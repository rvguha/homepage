      "reviewBody": "I have to admit that I was initially fearing that &quot;Jennifer&apos;s Body&quot; was going to be another generic teenage horror movie. But luckily it turned out to transcend mediocrity and be more than an average teenage horror.\n\nIt was because of the cast that I had feared as much. I mean, Megan Fox, come on. But she actually stepped up to the plate and delivered where it counted, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.\n\nThe story is about a girl who catch a ride with some questionable Guys. And fearing her gone, her friend is relieved to find her coming back home. But Jennifer is not the same person anymore; she is so much more.\n\nAs for the story, well, it wasn&apos;t revolutionary to the horror genre by any means, but it was entertaining. And it delivered where it had to.\n\nThe practical effects were quite good, as were the special effects. The slow breakdown of Jennifer&apos;s body throughout the movie was particularly impressive.\n\nI have seen this movie twice now, granted with years in between, but the movie does have enough contents to sustain more than just a single viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; tells the story of the Dutch resistance fighter Hannie Schaft (1920 - 1945). Together with &quot;Sophie Scholl, the final days&quot; (2005, Marc Rothemund) &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; forms an interesting combination. In both films a young girl goes into resistance against the Nazi regime and in both films she pays with her life.\n\nThere are however also differences between the two films. Sophie Scholl remained nonviolent while Hannie Schaft hardened during her career in the resistance movement and ultimately performed liquidations. &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; is mainly about the character development of Hannie in the resistance movement.\n\nIn the beginning of the film Hannie gives up her law school in order to serve justice in a more practical (and violent) way. This reminded me of &quot;A short film about killing&quot; (1988, Krzysztof Kieslowski). In this film from the Dekalog series a law student is portrayed both during his final exam and his first case.\n\nIn practical life al sorts of ethical issues arise. Focused on working in a resistance movement during the Second World War one can think of the following.\n\nHow to take into account possible reprisals the German occupier would undertake? This issue is at the heart of &quot;The assault&quot; (1986, Fons Rademakers). This film centers around a liquidation not performed by Hannie Schaft, but it is presented in a way very much like a liquidation Hannie Schaft did perform.\n\nHow to eliminate personal motives in selecting actions and targets? This issue appears in &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; after the death of the fiance of Hannie.\n\nIt is also interesting to compare &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; with &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977, Paul Verhoeven). In this comparison the ethical issues are not so much ones that the resistance fighter has to take into accoount regarding the society but much more the other way round. &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; is the story of Erik Hazelhof Roelfzema, also a resistance fighter, but one of a more glamerous kind than Hannie Schaft. Roelfzema had also connections with the royal family. Right after the war Roelfzema was very popular, but his popularity diminished when it was revealed in 2015 that he was involved in planning a coup in 1947 to prevent the independence of Indonesia.\n\nHannie Schaft on the other hand was not very popular after the war because of her Communist background. After the end of the Cold War her popularity is once again on the rise.\n\nHannie Schaft is played by Renée Soutendijk, an actress that was at the top of her game in those years. She played both in arthouse movies such as &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; as in more commercial films such as for example &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980, Paul Verhoeven). She could also play very different characters. In &quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; she plays an idealistic girl from the higher classes, in &quot;Spetters&quot; on the other hand she plays a very opportunistic girl from lower descent.\n\n&quot;The girl with the red hair&quot; is a rather slow movie, and so is the music. I imagined hearing music similar to that from films of the brothers Taviani. I was right. Nicola Piovani wrote the music, as he did for &quot;Fiorile&quot; (1993, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani).\n\nThe cinematography is very beautiful, somewhere in between color and black and white. A bid like the cinematography in &quot;Sleepy hollow&quot; (1999, Tim Burton). Of course the red hair is in color and really sets the images on fire.",

An ex-con-desperate Santa and an extremely pregnant girl. Perhaps Adam Sandler&apos;s silliest performance ever. What a cast! Steve Martin. Madeline Kahn. Rob Reiner. Gary Shandling. A temperamental elevator and a dangerously stale fruitcake. A vet who also has a people-practice. 3 cute dogs. A most unusual Christmas tree! Murder and mayhem! Alas, it&apos;s Christmas eve and there are not enough suicidal people to go around to justify the existence of a crisis hotline that has just been evicted! I find it enjoyable in a very zany and offbeat sort of way. Rita Wilson is adorable as the love-starved female who has a serious &quot;crush&quot; on Steve Martin. Disliked by most critics, and you will either love or hate this movie!",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the world premiere of &quot;Bernie&quot; last night at the Los Angeles Film Festival. I must confess, after Jack Black&apos;s run of &quot;Year One&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&apos;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, I was starting to lose hope of ever seeing the &quot;School of Rock&quot; guy I fell in love with. When I heard Richard Linklater (School of Rock) and Jack Black were teaming up again, I felt a glimmer of hope. I am happy to report, I was not disappointed last night! Jack Black gives one of the best performances of his career in &quot;Bernie.&quot; Shirley MacLaine was the icing on the cake and Matthew McConaughey was the cherry on top. I loved this movie! &quot;Bernie&quot; is based on the true story of Bernie Tiede, an assistant funeral director and general do-gooder, who confessed to killing Marjorie Nugent, a very rich and mean old lady. Bernie was a bit eccentric but beloved by his entire community of Carthage, Texas. Jack Black nails this performance. He really shows us what he is capable of as an actor. It was such a pleasure to watch him transform into Bernie Tiede. Great moments of physical comedy and also some twisted, dark moments of catching a glimpse into Bernie&apos;s spiraling psyche. Shirley MacLaine was Marjorie Nugent who was known as a mean, bitter lady with no friends and a family who tried to sue her for her money. You can&apos;t go wrong with Shirley MacLaine – she&apos;s just brilliant. The chemistry between MacLaine and Black was fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching them on the screen together. Even at the world premiere last night they had great chemistry in person. It seems like they truly loved working together on this film. Matthew McConaughey was great as the D.A. Danny Buck Davidson, the character didn&apos;t seem to be a huge stretch for him, but who cares – he was great! I&apos;m not sure when it is due to be released, but I will be recommending it to my friends when it hits theatres.",

That sounds like a formulaic movie that has been made a thousand times, but Martinez really brings home the film in a way that will keep you watching.\n\nI don&apos;t know much about Columbia, but i was really fascinated with the celebration of death before the funeral of Jonhefe. They borough him to the bar and sat him in a chair and had a party, including a lap dance for the dead man. Makes it kind of a grind house film, but it was a film about love and loss.\n\nIt&apos;s worth a look just to see Martinez.",

When Dae-jin regains consciousness he begins to exhibit mannerisms that suggest that he is possessed by his brother&apos;s spirit, which leaves Ho-jin&apos;s wife Eun-su (Mi-yeon Lee) uncertain how to react.\n\nI watched the dreadfully dull Sarah Michelle Gellar movie Possession not so long ago, unaware that it was a remake of Korean drama Addicted, a film that has sat gathering dust in my box of unseen DVDs for quite some time now. On seeing that the original had a pretty decent rating here on IMDb, I decided to dig it out and thankfully found it to be the superior film, a classy affair that, unlike the remake, deals with its subject matter in a subtle and intelligent manner.\n\nLike Possession, Addicted is a real slow-burn of a film, the narrative unfolding in a considered manner that I suspect will be way too leisurely for many viewers, but with the Korean film successfully avoiding the dumb plot holes and ridiculous characterisations that made its US counterpart difficult to endure, it proves to be a thoroughly engaging bittersweet romance, twisted and yet touching at the same time.",

      "reviewBody": "Who knows what&apos;s the trademark of almost all of the Asian horror movies? Yes, you&apos;re right: a ghost or a spirit shaped as a girl(or a woman) with her long, dark hair over the face. In small doses, at the right moment, usually associated with creepy sounds or eerie score, moving suddenly or with broken movements, those out-of-this-world presences have the power to scare to death the poor characters unfortunate enough to be in their path. Now, ladies and gentlemen, in &quot;Bunshinsaba&quot; you have the longest presence on-screen of the aforementioned long-haired female ghosts in the entire Asian horror history. If you have a better example, please let me know.\n\nNow you think that will make this movie the scariest of them all? Errr...no. &quot;Bunshinsaba&quot; is a horror movie, no doubt about it. But, it&apos;s scare factor is average or even low. Despite some (very short) disturbing images, it&apos;s hard to be really terrified. No unsupportable tension from &quot;Shutter&quot;, no gruesome-deformed faces from &quot;The Ring&quot;. The last three-quarters of the film we&apos;re dealing with the ghost, who-as usually-seek revenge. The main problem is that we have real difficulties to know who&apos;s the real person, who&apos;s the real person possessed by the vengeful spirit, who&apos;s the real spirit, what&apos;s real and what&apos;s imagination and who&apos;s the reincarnation of the spirit. It&apos;s not easy to follow. Once invoked(at the beginning) the spirit move from person to person, determining the subsequent behavior. Some commit suicide by putting a plastic bag over the head, spilling flammable liquid over and set it on fire. Other girl throw herself out of window.\n\nAbout the standard, mandatory, long-haired girl(notice that I didn&apos;t said &quot;ghost&quot;): As I said, you will see a LOT of standard stuff. A face looking down and then slightly starting to rise the sight. Don&apos;t expect demoniacal expressions, sudden scares in sync with loud sounds. Once is the real girl-school, next time the ghost, next another girl possessed by the ghost. Hmmm, pretty twisted, maybe a second viewing is necessary.\n\nOtherwise, even the plot is relatively clear, it is also pretty twisted. There&apos;s a lot of talk. All the girls are beautiful and in general the cast consist in pleasant-looking people. Unfortunately, if you want to be really scared, this is not the right movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Father Of My Children&apos; tells the story of the family of a film producer who comes under financial stress. Plot-wise, the film surprises when the expected ending occurs half-way through; we thus get to also see the aftermath. There&apos;s nothing wrong with this per se, although it means we really have two stories in one, and the overall narrative arc is thus slightly broken. But I don&apos;t think this is the only reason this film seems strangely devoid of dramatic tension. Even though there are some fairly notable developments, nothing really seems to upset the serenity of its affluent characters. At one point, there&apos;s a power cut and the lights go off; after a few minutes, they come back on again, and in some ways, that&apos;s how the whole film feels: stuff happens, but the consequences always seem not to actually matter that much. I normally like understated films; but this one, although nicely put together, feels underplayed, and therefore, just a little uninteresting.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s amusing to read some of the comments in this page of IMDb. Most postings place the blame for what they perceive as the failure of this picture on James Ivory, Ismael Merchant and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the successful creative team of some of the best movies of recent years. In fact, the sin they appear to have committed was to adapt the Diane Johnson&apos;s novel about the contrasts she has always written about between two cultures that should be more similar: the French and American, yet, as we read in the book, and now watched in the film, they are not as close as one would imagine.\n\nFirst, the French one sees portrayed in the film belong to the high classes that are imbued in their traditions, savoir faire, their sense of style and being B.C.B.G., something the Americans, being somehow a new society without those traditions cannot comprehend. Money is a taboo subject to be spoken at all by the wealthy French, whereas in America the flaunting of having made fortunes and having millions is an everyday subject for the higher ups.\n\nMs. Johnson, who has lived in France for quite some time, is an observant of that society. In her many books about life in that country, the study in the contrasts she sees, are at center stage and the mixing of Americans with the French bourgeoisie produces surprising results that make the reading of her novels more compelling for the joy they bring to her readers.\n\nIsabel, the young American, arriving to stay with her sister Roxanne, takes easily to the new surroundings. In doing so, she completely disregards the established rules when she enters in a liaison with Marc-Henri, who sees the occasion as one for amusing himself for a while. Roxanne, on the other hand, soon discovers what she is against when her French husband decides to ask her for a divorce. Little has prepared her for the consequences that go with it and the archaic laws about a couple&apos;s separation in that country, which benefits the husband while punishing the wife.\n\nThe other theme at the core of the story is a painting Roxanne has brought with her from San Diego. The possibility of it being a real Delacroix is now at the center of the divorce settlement. Where one can see it has nothing to do with the cheating husband, Suzanne, the mother-in-law deems otherwise because of the possible value the painting will fetch when it&apos;s sold.\n\nNaomi Watts makes another great contribution in her appearance as Roxanne. Kate Hudson is not in the same league, although her good looks and natural charm makes one care more for her Isabel. The delicious Leslie Caron plays Madame de Persand with great panache. Just watching her remarking about the granulated sugar Charlotte offers her to sweeten her tea is one of the delights of the film. Tierry Lhermitte is seen as the callous Edgar. Glenn Close plays Olivia Pace, a writer,who might be Diane Johnson&apos;s alter ego in the story. Stephen Fry, Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, and the rest of the French and American cast do a good job.\n\nThis film has a feeling of being more French than some French movies. The cinematography of Pierre Lhomme is wonderful as he takes his camera all over the city showing us what a treat it is to be in Paris, even for a visit. The other thing that comes across is the involvement of the late Ismail Marchant to the production. Mr. Merchant got great locales in where to film and had a great eye for the style of the pictures he was producing. His absence, alas, is sadly missed from the latest James Ivory project &quot;The White Countess&quot;.\n\nIn spite of not being up to some of his best movies, James Ivory still shows he has a keen eye for presenting the material on the screen.",

After seeing City on Fire, I have to say I have even more respect for Tarantino now than I did before.  City on Fire is a very good film with its own merits, which many people have already mentioned; however, to call Reservoir Dogs a rip-off of City on Fire insults both films.  They are two separate films, telling different stories in different ways.  Tarantino took the few most compelling elements of City on Fire, and then built an entirely different film around them.  This is certainly an inspiration that deserves credit, but it is Tarantino&apos;s skill as a writer and director, as well as the amazing actors, that made Reservoir Dogs as great as it is.  Even the most directly lifted scene, the Mexican stand-off, is an entirely different experience in each film.  The way it is framed, the dialogue, and the resolutions are unique to each.  Both films have their own strengths and weaknesses, and deserve to be judged independently.  Don&apos;t lump them together by criticizing one great film for being inspired by another."

      "reviewBody": "The sequel to the 2010 film Hot Tub Time Machine, &apos;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&apos; has a few laughs. Its definitely not a laugh-riot, but some genuine jokes/sequences leave an impression.\n\n&apos;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&apos; Synopsis: When Lou finds himself in trouble, Nick and Jacob fire up the hot tub time machine in an attempt to get back to the past. But they inadvertently land in the future with Adam Jr. Now they have to alter the future in order to save the past - which is really the present.\n\nLet me put it up bluntly: &apos;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&apos; is strictly an okay fare, that only works in limited doses. This isn&apos;t the funniest sequel you&apos;d watch, but, the few laughs here are fun. I didn&apos;t except anything else &amp; hence I wasn&apos;t disappointed.\n\nJosh Heald&apos;s Screenplay definitely needed more wit, but it has some humor, nonetheless. Steve Pink&apos;s Direction is alright. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design, are superb. Graphics lack finesse.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry &amp; Clark Duke reprise their parts with more madness, but one is certainly missing John Cusack. Seriously, why isn&apos;t he a part of the sequel? Adam Scott tries to fill in Cusack&apos;s shoes, but fails totally. Chevy Chase appears in a miss-a-blink appearance.\n\nOn the whole, &apos;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&apos; works in bits.",

      "reviewBody": "As a TV Producer of &quot;entertainment&quot; shows, I make a point of watching this film at least once a year and giving DVDs of it to all who may disparage what I do.\n\nPreston Sturges achieves the impossible in this movie: he has his cake and eats it too. He makes a perfect film - he manages to make a socially significant statement while wrapping it up in a comedy confection.\n\nHis hero, John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea - a very underestimated actor) is a\n\nsucccessful director of frivolous musicals and comedies who, one day, decides he needs to make a Capra-esque &quot;serious&quot;film. His studio chiefs and immediate staff are against it and point out that he is rich and privileged, what does he know about the less fortunate? Sullivan retorts with an ingenious plan:\n\nSullivan: &quot;You&apos;re perfectly right...but I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;m going to do first: I&apos;m going to get some old clothes and some old shoes from wardrobe and start out with ten cents in my pocket...and I&apos;m not coming back till I know what trouble it..I&apos;m going out on the road to find out what it&apos;s like to be poor and needy and then I&apos;m going to make a picture about it.&quot;\n\nBurrows(his butler): If you&apos;ll permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one. The poor know all about poverty and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous. \n\nNevertheless, Sullivan does it and unwittingly (and hilariously) discovers the true value comedy has in the lives of those with little else to laugh about...\n\nIt&apos;s genius. Exquisitely written, directed and acted (Sturges uses his usual ensemble plus the ever watchable Veronica Lake, even here in her most improbable disguises [I met her, professionally, in England in the 70s, she was still a class act and her &quot;rider&quot; demanded her drink of choice - vodka and cranberry juice).\n\nSullivan&apos;s Travels is a true gem of American Cinema. Ten out of ten."

What is essentially a one joke movie, comes across extremely well. Perfect casting, starting with Danny DeVito and a truly funny script. There is also a fine message that you should not be disappointed if people do not live up to your expectations. Kathy Bates and Danny DeVito as the &quot;trailer trash&quot; parents are so great, and Christine Baranski is the perfect foil for Beverly DeAngelo and her sequin dresses. Off the wall hilarious situations abound, and there are even some very sweet moments. Highly recommended. - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "The interesting thing about Swayze is that he &quot;did&quot; this movie... more or less after Dirty Dancing. After the success of Dirty Dancing Swayze could&apos;ve done anything - instead he decides to tell the simple and sad tale of one families personal tragic past.\n\nA big career mistake? I don&apos;t think so, this is a fine movie and a fine vehicle for Swayze to explore his talent. In all fields this film has strength... the acting and cast are rock solid... the location work is fabulous and the story, although tame compared to todays standards still hits the target solidly. The only thing that shows through in parts is the budget is lacking. Swayze does well as the out casted son weaving his sentimental spell as the movie unfolds its mystery. The simple sense of futility and overwhelming sadness in this film is all due to Swayze acting his part so well.\n\nSure this is not a blockbuster - and on it&apos;s budget it wasn&apos;t supposed to be, but as entertainment value (which is what movies are all about) this is a fine piece of work. Watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "Watching &quot;Once&quot; is like sitting in on a jam session. It&apos;s mellow and relaxed. It doesn&apos;t amount to much, but it&apos;s pleasant enough.\n\nThe director has said that he set out to make a movie so simple that the story could be summarized on the back of a postage stamp, and he&apos;s succeeded. An Irish busker meets a Czech émigré, and both flit around the edges of falling for each other while recording a demo album of the busker&apos;s music. Both are struggling with the loves in their lives, he with a girlfriend in London, she with her estranged husband and father to her little girl. The resolution of their stories, what resolution there is, felt right and realistic. This isn&apos;t a fairy tale, but neither is it Shakespearean tragedy. Life simply goes on.\n\nThe film&apos;s biggest asset is its music, and indeed most of the songs in the film we see performed in their entirety. The movie isn&apos;t exactly a musical in the strictest sense of the word, since characters don&apos;t spontaneously burst into choreographed musical numbers, but like the best musicals, the songs in &quot;Once&quot; illuminate the characters and play an integral role in the storytelling.\n\nA low-key little gem of a movie.\n\nGrade: A",

It&apos;s the 10th, or so, Krimi that I&apos;ve seen, and Eddi Arent stars as the excessively talking and irritating comic relief character... again. Klaus Kinski stars as the mysterious but relentless and silent killer ... again! Other than that, though, &quot;The Curse of the Hidden Vault&quot; is a very decent and enjoyable thriller with a compelling plot, far-fetched but imaginative twists and a number of ingenious gimmicks, booby-traps and killing methods. The story seems complex but is actually fairly straightforward. Now that he has reached his final years, a former gangster and dubious casino owner becomes remorseful and intends to donate his entire fortune to the daughter of a man he wronged many years ago. All his previous partners, enemies and competitors know the entire inheritance is stored in a secret, hi-tech and heavily booby-trapped vault that no one ever managed to even reach. Now the word is out that the vault will soon be opened, every gangster in London wants to use to girl to get to the fortune. Good pacing, regular action and solid performances from the ensemble cast (also including the great Werner Peters) ensure this is an above average and very entertaining Krimi.",

Ingrid was a big Hammer star about the time Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were, and she had no compunctions about taking off her clothes to sell the movie. In this movie, she&apos;s old, fat, clearly hasn&apos;t worked in a long time and the only nice thing I can say is she DIDN&apos;T remove her clothing. Because once you&apos;ve seen it, you can&apos;t unsee it.",

So I thought that I could never be screwed buying it. I was quite wrong, I must say.\n\nTo begin with something positive, the idea of the movie is quite good. A society of students uses their computer skills to kill off degenerates in the society. For me, that&apos;s an idea that have could been used to make an entertaining movie. But director Andy Anderson has chosen the very wrong way and tried to make a mixture between SF and some kind of buddy comedy. The 2 main characters (John Davies &amp; Lauren Lane) try to be funny, but they don&apos;t succeed, resulting in a irritated viewer. Also, a young Lou Diamond Phillips in the first 5 minutes of this film. The budget is also very low, but that didn&apos;t bother me.\n\nI will even say that many low budget movies are better then those big budget special effects movies Hollywood likes to churn out. But again, the idea of this movie was good enough to make a great movie, but no cigar. Anderson would later make the great Detention (if you believe the comments this movie gets on IMDB), but this sure isn&apos;t a great debut for him.\n\n Was this movie made by someone like Jim Wynorski (who made entertaining movies of The Lost Island and Chopping Mall), it would have be nice, easy entertainment. Had David Cronenberg been the director, he would have made a neat, little but intelligent SF/horror flick with some shocking effects. But Andy Anderson made it and this is the result. And you already know what I think about it."

Which reminds us of that age again by making the funny scenes very funny The love scene is cute too. Which this movie is different from general teen movies All the actors performed very well. And another interesting thing of this movie Is to insert various songs To match the storyline, thus making the audience feel very involved And finally, this movie is also very interesting, it is probably a love story in many aspects of the characters and friendships. That, despite the changing of time, cannot make their friendship fade away Which the movie is doing very well In giving an idea And it also inspires young people who are interested in playing music.",

This movie shows how deep attraction and passion can change people&apos;s lives (perhaps for the better) and overcome class/personality and age differences.\n\nThe first and perhaps most noticeable aspect is one of the hottest and more believable seduction scenes in a movie, where Nora shows a raw animal passion for Max rarely shown in movies (and when it is is shown in an unfavorable light, e.g. Single White Female).  Susan Sarandon pulls off this challenging scene with great passion AND dignity.\n\nThe May/December romance with the older lady is shown in a healthy light (not like say The Graduate).\n\nBut more important than the age dynamic, is the deep attraction between Nora and Max, which goes strongly across traditional cultural differences.  Max is a compulsively organized widower, neat and decidedly upper-middle/upper class.  Nora is more impulsive, living a less ordered existence and is lower/lower middle class.  Max has conditional love for Nora, trying to change her (unintentionally acting judgemental?) by trying to help her out (e.g. buying her cleaning supplies as a &quot;gift&quot;).  Nora teaches Max about life, and passion.  This movie has a much more interesting love story than say &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "I knew from previous reviews that &quot;Don&apos;t Open Till  Christmas&quot; would be bad, but I didn&apos;t realise just HOW bad!  But perhaps that&apos;s just as well.  The &apos;story&apos; is so sleazy and mean-spirited that the film would be deeply nasty if it were well-made.  As it is, it is just laughable.\n\nEven on the most basic levels, &quot;Don&apos;t Open Till  Christmas&quot; fails to work. The various murders, though gory, are suspenseless.  We know nothing of the victims, we know when the killer&apos;s about to strike (so there is no surprise) and the direction is hamfisted. The giallo elements fall flat because neither we nor the police are given any clues and indeed the police investigation never really comes to a conclusion.\n\nParts of the film simply don&apos;t make any sense.  The timeframe is all to hell, for one thing. Early on, a newspaper headline reads &quot;Only three killing days left to Christmas&quot;, but then four or five days pass and we&apos;re only at Christmas Eve!  Lines like &quot;Is there a pattern here?&quot;, after 3 Santas have been gorily dispatched, beggar belief.  It also seems unlikely that people would still be happily wandering around London in Santa costumes if a psychopathic Claus-slayer WERE on the loose!\n\nThe direction is inept, the dialogue ludicrous and the acting desperately flat.  And why does Mark Jones, as one of the police investigators, dress like a Twenties matinee idol?  Perhaps his flamboyant costumes are an effort by the makers to disguise attention from the threadbare sets!\n\nNevertheless, &quot;Don&apos;t Open Till  Christmas&quot; does have a certain historical interest as the very last gasp of the low-budget British horror film.  The involvement of Derek Ford gives it a tenuous link to the gory glory days of Compton and Tigon.  And it&apos;s amazing to think that it was made in 1984, the time when Goldcrest were at their height.  What a contrast between such genteel efforts as &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Dresser&quot; and this sadistic little affair!"

      "reviewBody": "Dois Perdidos Numa Noite Suja is one of the classic texts of national theater. Written in the late 1960s by the playwright Plínio Marcos (also author of works such as Abajur Lilás and Navalha na Carne), it had been adapted for the cinema once, in 1971, by Braz Chediak. In this first version, two men (Emiliano Queiroz and Nelson Xavier), Tonho and Paco, met on the outskirts of São Paulo to discuss their similarities and differences in relation to the society that excluded them. In this version signed by José Joffily, the differences in relation to the original work are immediately apparent: Paco, this time, became a girl (Débora Falabella, debuting in cinema), and she and Tonho (Roberto Bomtempo, the director&apos;s regular partner) they are illegal immigrants in the United States, the mecca where everyone goes after realizing the &quot;American dream&quot;. However, the theatrical setting is still present (the film takes place practically in a single scenario), strongly marking its origin.\n\nIn an abandoned warehouse in New York, Tonho (Roberto Bomtempo) and Paco (Débora Falabella) meet to reevaluate their conditions. In common, the fact that they are Brazilians, are abroad illegally and in pursuit of their ambitions. Tonho is silly, naive, small, and hides his condition from the family, which remains in Brazil, through illusory letters that report a utopian present, in which everything worked out. It&apos;s the way he found to deceive not only the only people who care about him, but also to deceive himself, since he&apos;s the first to consider himself, first and foremost, a failure, ready to give up everything to go back to House.\n\nPaco, in turn, is daring, marked by life and based on trickery. He disguises himself as a boy to pass himself off as a call boy at bus stations and subway stations, where he makes a living through the change he receives for performing oral sex on men in a hurry in public bathrooms. When the masks they hold so hard fall away, regret and frustration remain, feelings that will learn to work together.\n\nJoffily&apos;s filmic work departs from the original dramatic structure of the play by Plínio Marcos, but proposes a reinterpretation of it, modifying characters and setting, in a process of transcreation that allows the contemporary spectator a critical and social discussion, overcoming and deepening the mark of pure or mere entertainment. Seeking to address the world we live in and not an imaginary world. An influence of Bertolt Brecht&apos;s aesthetic propositions on the filmic work is pointed out, when discussing contemporary social themes that allow the spectator an important critical distance for a process of social reflection. Characteristic that overlaps the structure of the film with a discussion about fictional narrative and documentary narrative. Bill Nichols in his book entitled &quot;Introduction to documentary&quot; deeply discusses this theme, demonstrating that the differences between the two genres do not guarantee an absolute separation.\n\nBased on the filmic product and the analysis of the filming script in conflict with the original text, major changes that characterize the transcreation process are pointed out, with structural alterations that show that the film does not result in a simple adaptation of the original text. The setting of the text for the city of New York in the United States makes possible a contemporary discussion about the problems of Brazilian immigrants in search of the &quot;American dream&quot;, a condition that allows the viewer to critically reflect on our country. The recreation of the character Paco, now presented as a woman, Rita, opens the way for a discussion on gender and interpersonal relationships.\n\nThis is how the character of Plínio Marcos&apos; work is shown. With a great power to place its characters under an oppressive and exploitative environment, strong enough to make them reach the ultimate consequences in the results of their human relationships, managing to discuss social and political issues with psychological and subjective issues of a human relationship. . In this line, the cinematographic resources for presenting the filmic product are not only necessary, but also become an important tool that, when well used, will provide not only the identification of the public, but also the relationship that it makes of the artistic work with its daily life. . Producing a product that not only serves as an artistic object representing a thought in a given time and place, but also carries intrinsically the character of being able to be a transforming source of human beings and, through them, the transformation of society. Thus ensuring an enrichment in the production of the work, safeguarding characteristics that go beyond mere entertainment.\n\nPaulo Halm makes use of this resource and the script shows us different locations, which help to understand how this relationship between the concrete (social and historical) and the subjective (imaginary or symbolic field) of each character takes place. Thus, the new guise is established and promotes the public&apos;s critical reflection with the remodeled object and rises to transcreation. The film promotes a new discourse, arising from the unveiling of the initial dramatic situation, no longer hypothetical or lived only in the characters&apos; speeches, but interfering in their intentions that, a posteriori, will come to be part of the action in the audience&apos;s imagination, in a forceful way. This dramaturgical option of the screenwriter makes the nomenclature adaptation erroneous because the cinematographic work was not directly adapted from the theatrical play, but transcreated from narrative interfaces.\n\nThe screenwriter created his cinematographic version proposing a dialogue between the different languages and interfering in the structure of the theatrical dramaturgical work. Previously spent entirely in Brazil, in a fifth-rate stable in a big city, with a market with the potential to generate the dream of improving life for the less affluent layers of neighboring places, but which, in contrast, produces exploitation and discrimination between other elements, which generate social and human ills. Relating, thus, the fictional artistic object with the commitment that one must have with reality for the relationship of identification or critical reflection that the public will make during the presentation.\n\nThe point of convergence between the scenic, theatrical and cinematographic narratives analyzed here is directly related to Plínio Marcos&apos; aesthetic proposal of going deep with his characters. Present in the outcomes and in the elements that surround the narrative, which is the context in which it is expressed. Taken to the scene to deepen the intrinsic social discussion in the primary objective of the dramaturgy, in the style of the author and in the voice of the film. Thus, the filmic work shows itself as transcreation because it brings in the creative process characteristics that renew the existing object and prepare new images that are revealing of the concrete (the context in which they are realized) and the subjective (psychic). Following the line of realism, and this is taken to the extreme, in its events, proposals by Plínio Marcos. These possibilities and verisimilitudes generate the public&apos;s identification and the conflict leads to the psychological drama contained in existing human and social relations, that is, mutual knowledge and recognition is considerably subjectivist to the audience and contributes to walking along with the tension of the plot.\n\nFinished on digital equipment, this image clarity is easily perceived on stage. Filmed in São Paulo (internal) and in New York (external), it is an example of an international co-production that knew how to present a beautiful work even with few resources, an example to be followed in our cinematography. Despite this, it lacks energy, and what we see is actually a filmed play rather than a film in its own right. The transposition from one medium to the other did not take place completely, which ends up hampering its acceptance a little.\n\nWith regard to the aesthetic correspondences, a creative dialogue between the screenwriter/filmmaker and the playwright Plínio Marcos is perceived, in a lyrical rescue, where the love and hate relationships between the characters are discussed, in a contemporary reinterpretation where gender issues are inserted in questions relevant social. These experiences have been teaching us some possible paths between literature and cinema. And it is in this dialogue that paradoxical and complementary elements such as subjectivity and objectivity, pleasure and criticism, unveil social and psychological issues, expanding the discussion in the constitutive narrative interfaces of different languages, theater and cinema becoming an important tool in the commitment that must be had with the conscious management of the work of art and its aesthetic and ideological trends.\n\nWith cutting dialogues, typical of Plínio Marcos, Joffily sets up an intimate scenario of resounding disillusionment, centered on the abandoned apartment that the duo share. The 5th avenue and the Broadway region, without glamour, do not hide the failure of those who, targets of prejudice and lack of opportunities, head from one side to the other with still a shred of expectation.\n\nIf there is any slippage in Joffily&apos;s version - the second made to the cinema, after an attempt by Braz Chediak, in 1971 -, it is the predominance, at times, of a vestige of theatricality in the dialogues. Débora Falabella gives a performance worthy of the award she received at the Festival de Brasília, but ends up overloaded, since the text retains much of this prolixity. On screen, the situation calls for more atmosphere, less vehemence... By itself, without needing reinforcement, the situation experienced by the characters is already frighteningly tragic.",

Yet another one of those films where technically the acting stinks, the script is lame and the set is an amusement park but you just have to watch it once or twice or again and again. Choice is yours! (but I&apos;d check it out:) As a Kiss fan I have no choice but to stick it a 10."

      "reviewBody": "I read through the reviews here before I watched it and didn&apos;t know what to expect: a classic or a bummer? In my view, the truth is in the middle and the average vote of currently 5.8 seems justified. &quot;Natural City&quot; is by no means a movie on the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; level. Take away the futuristic eye-candy, and what is left? A man is in love with a cyborg lady without really telling us why, how or what for. Real character development is not happening! He gets in a conflict with his friend over the cyborgs which leads to gratuitous violence with faces covered in blood like in a million action flicks before. Meanwhile, a girl plants flowers in a roof garden to provide a contrast to the post-war destruction scenery around. &quot;Natural City&quot; doesn&apos;t really have any new ideas, it simply spices up the collection of familiar trade marks with &quot;Matrix/Equilibrium Next Generation&quot; visuals which is fine for web 2.0 designers but not for the art of film making. Everybody who truly believes this is going to be a classic should go watch &quot;Soylent Green&quot; where it was the actors and the story that mattered. \n\nStill, &quot;Natural City&quot; is a movie that has its touching or stunning moments. Actually, I liked that explanations were not provided in many cases. One might argue whether it is a deliberate attempt to open it for interpretation or simply plot holes. But I think, if we once really caught a glimpse of the year 2080, there would be much that we won&apos;t comprehend, either. You know how silly SF movies of the 1950s seem today because they applied manners, moral standards and ways of conversation that are outdated. In this respect, I&apos;m curious what people will think of &quot;Natural City&quot; in the future. Keep it in the archive.",

In the 1930s Janet Gaynor was a huge star, veteran of a number of silent features with Charles Farrell and others; while Will Rogers was one of the best-loved actors and personalities in the USA.\n\n&apos;State Fair&apos; teams Gaynor and Rogers as daughter and father, and adds Norman Foster as her brother, and Louise Dresser (another silent screen veteran) as mother. They&apos;re all off to the State Fair; Wayne and Margie to look for fun and frolics, Mother to try to win a prize for mincemeat, and Father to get a prize for his hog, Blueboy. Will they all find the things they wish for? Lew Ayres and Sally Eilers might just have the answers! I really liked this version; I&apos;m very familiar with both musical adaptations but this film is more folksy, more fireside, more farm ... and it works very well. It&apos;s a superior product which deserves a clean-up and a decent video release.\n\nThe print I have is not brilliant, but is watchable. From what I can see this looks like a film which had high production values and I&apos;m sure it would look great if it is was in pristine condition.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, a masterpiece.  The entire premise of the movie is wildly original, even coming from WOODY ALLEN who continually cranks out one interesting film after another to this day.  \n\nThe label of mock-umentary just doesn&apos;t do justice to the uniqueness of this film.  ALLEN and his amazingly talented staff created a movie that no other director could have made nor even thought of doing.  Some of the humor is rather modern like the forward references to self-gratification during the psychiatrist scenes with MIA FARROW.  But mostly, it&apos;s filled with humor from another time and place which we&apos;ll never return.\n\nTo me, one of the wonderful aspects of this is the period music dispersed throughout with joyful admiration.  We are lucky that ALLEN has continued to use music from the early part of the 20th century.  I think no other director has so consistently had such a reverence for this wonderful music. Perhaps no other director has such a strong knowledge of it either.\n\nThat WOODY ALLEN normally portrays himself as a nebbishy character in many of his own movies works so well in this movie.  A more aggressive person who becomes a chameleon would not have worked as well at all.  I am glad that MIA FARROW was still associated with him when he made this film, I think no other modern actress could have pulled this off as well as she did.  She has that timeless look that is appealing but has a far-off feeling.\n\nThe flavor of the period-looking cinematography and photography is part of the genius of the implementation here.  It is so right on the money.  The flickering of projectors, the out-of-focus look to so man scenes shot today meld amazingly well with the contrived shots.\n\nTHINK ABOUT THIS - this is years before CGI took over Hollywood...years before FORREST GUMP and countless of other knock-offs have proliferated in movies.  Gee whiz, there is CGI in so many movies these days.  I watched a DVD of a recent movie recently which used special effects in the most unexpected, unlikely and unnecessary parts you&apos;d be surprised.\n\nYes, ZELIG is a masterpiece and I only feel sorry for those who cannot see the astounding piece of cinema this is.",

He is first observed at a party by F. Scott Fitzgerald, who notes that Zelig related to the affluent guests in a refined Boston accent and shared their Republican sympathies, but while in the kitchen with the servants, he adopted a coarser tone and seemed to be more of a Democrat.

      "reviewBody": "First of all, lets get one thing straight: Christopher Lambert makes B-movies. I&apos;ve never seen him in anything that wasn&apos;t a B-movie, and as far as I know, he hasn&apos;t done one single non-B-movie for his entire career. This particular B-movie, however, is more interesting and entertaining than that of the typical B-movie; the story revolves around a few people in the not-too-distant future(the year 2017, if I remember correctly) who are in a futuristic gigantic prison, which is said to be impossible to break out of. So, naturally they try to break out. The plot is OK, it moves along at a pretty good pace, never really loses your interest or bores you. The acting is all bad, but what do you expect from a B-movie? It has plenty of action to keep you distracted from the horrid acting, so it probably won&apos;t bother that many people. The characters are all cliches, but, again, what do you expect? The action and sci-fi parts of the film are reasonably entertaining, and pretty good for a B-movie. The film depicts a gloomy futuristic fascist world, but that&apos;s nothing that hasn&apos;t been seen many times before. All in all, a pretty typical B-movie, just a notch higher in quality than most others. I recommend it to fans of action/sci-fi B-movies and/or Christopher Lambert. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "The classic Spanish picaro is lovingly transferred to the screen in this marvelous adaptation of one of its first prototypes preceding the immortal Don Quixote. In the opening frames the beautiful brooding quality of the Spanish landscape is established as a fitting background to the events which transpire after Lazarillo, a poor boy, is sold into bondage by his mother to the first of a succession of masters. Thus begin the travels of Lazarillo as he learns to live by his wits, first with a greedy blind beggar who beats and starves him. He soon learns to outwit his mean-spirited captor in some delightfully realized sequences and eventually becomes an accomplished street-wise thief who survives quite handily through petty crime. Only one of his succession of masters is kind to him, the impoverished threadbare nobleman (engagingly portrayed by Juan Jose Menendez) who desperately tries to appear eligible to make an advantageous marriage with one of the daughters of the local grandees, but whose pretensions are cruelly mocked as he and his new servant Lazarillo slowly starve together. Cruel necessity causes the canny Lazarillo to leave this most favorite master and move on to yet other unscrupulous patrons and more petty crime in the shadow of the always threatening Inquisition. His travails afford opportunities for much biting social and political satire sharply observed along the way. Lazarillo finally seems to find a good place among a roving roguish company of puppeteers, but just as their wagon merrily rolls away with him as their newly acquired apprentice we are informed that before reaching the age of fourteen, Lazarillo will undoubtedly be hanged for his life of crime.",

      "reviewBody": "While through the ages, many noteworthy motion pictures detailing the film industry itself have been made, the majority concentrated on a highly positive tone, portraying Hollywood as the organization which &quot;brought dreams to life&quot;, or similar self serving platitudes. However, in the early 90s, a new trend began to emerge - films which delved below the glossy exterior of Hollywood and began to expose more negative aspects of the industry. One would be hard pressed to find as fitting an example of this Hollywood introspective neo- realism as writer/director George Huang&apos;s semi-autobiographical (but hopefully only to an extent...) Swimming With Sharks - a biting, cynical look at the interior of the film industry which challenges the preconceptions of the industry and its bleak aims.\n\nLike Robert Altman&apos;s The Player, Swimming with Sharks offers a harshly critical commentary on the corporate moneymaking machine that is Hollywood, but from the opposite end: the perspective of a low level assistant striving to rise in the ranks. However, similar to Altman&apos;s work, Huang&apos;s film dabbles with the notion of being a black comedy or darkly satirical take on the business end of the film industry, but ultimately lacks the acerbic wit needed to succeed on such a front. As such, while the occasional moment of darkly gleeful comedic insight may derived, for the most part, the film falters on attempted darkly ironic comedic moments which come across as too heavy handed to be truly funny. The film&apos;s main strength is in its strictly dramatic climax; its harrowing and powerful turn of events toying with notions of all consuming ambition and free will in a truly gripping fashion. Combined with a numbingly unexpected and chilling ending scene, the film&apos;s finale is easily its strongest point - enough so to carry the occasional botched comic moment from earlier in the film. However, Tom Heil&apos;s understated and affecting single piano score and the occasional moment of intriguing cinematography also add to the overall quality of the work. \n\nKevin Spacey is the main pleasure to behold here as the film&apos;s main selling point, the &quot;boss from Hell&quot; figure Buddy Ackerman. Alternating between wryly funny, starkly powerful and disconcertingly human, Spacey, though disappointingly denied the ability to chew the scenery quite as much as one might hope for, easily walks away with the picture with his top notch work. Frank Whaley gives an adequate performance as the constantly put upon assistant who finally seeks revenge, though his character is given next to no development and Whaley lacks the engaging charisma needed to really sell the role. Michelle Forbes also comes across as disappointingly flat as an ambitious business woman caught between Spacey and Whaley, though she shines in certain scenes. Watch also for an early appearance by Benicio Del Toro in a tiny role as Whaley&apos;s predecessor. \n\nWhile it may falter as the black comedy it clearly wants to be throughout, the film excels as the harshly critical drama it becomes by the end. An undeniably maliciously enjoyable performance by Spacey keeps the film afloat, and while it may occasionally come across as lopsided or falling short of its potential, Swimming with Sharks keeps enough surprises up its proverbial sleeve to remain interesting throughout as a cynical treatise on ambition and the film industry which thrives upon it. \n\n-7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Though the careers of Robert Montgomery, Joan Crawford, and her husband at the time, Franchot Tone&apos;s respective careers were not hurt by films like No More Ladies, this was the kind of stuff all three of these players were looking to get out of.\n\nThere was a truism at MGM back in its heyday. For films where the men wear tuxedos you first get Robert Montgomery. If he turns it down get Franchot Tone. If it&apos;s bad enough for Tone to turn it down God help him, Robert Young is stuck with it. So knowing the pecking order and knowing the billing, you can guess who Crawford winds up with.\n\nRobert Montgomery plays another of those irrepressible womanizing playboys who&apos;s sowed enough wild oats to qualify for a farm subsidy. He&apos;s decided to settle down with society girl Joan Crawford who has certain ideas about infidelity and how wrong it is. Montgomery behaves at first, but when he uses their perpetually inebriated friend Charlie Ruggles as an alibi that doesn&apos;t hold up, Crawford decides on some revenge with Franchot Tone.\n\nNo More Ladies is harmless enough and when Edna May Oliver as Joan&apos;s grandmother is on the screen, always entertaining. But it was the stuff that MGM was grinding out in its dream factory. It was a case of Montgomery and Tone look great in tuxedos so cast them as urban playboys.\n\nWell, both of them did look great, Louis B. Mayer wasn&apos;t wrong about that.",

Hwangsanbul is a comic satire based on actual event that took place prior to the unification of three kingdoms in Korea (ie. Shilla, Bakche, and Koguryo).  Major part of the comic relief is built in around the regional dialogues between the three kingdoms (still prevalent in Korea today) -- and I can&apos;t imagine this humor being passed on by reading subtitles.  There are some seriously funny scenes prior to the big battle, unfortunately, nothing ever becomes of it and the plots sizzles down.\n\nI give first half of this movie an 8 out of 10, however, second half and the conclusion of the movie was disappointing with lack of closure and substance -- an overall 6/10",

It&apos;s a warm and charming comedy, a kind of fairy tale set in the early 1930&apos;s, with all the tips that made gangster movies of that time so precious. There are the nicknames (Happy McGuire, who don&apos;t smile), the words (a kisser is a woman&apos;s lips) and even the music (Hear Ned Sparks whistle The Prisonner&apos;s Song when there are cops around The Dude night club.) All the actors are great, but May Robson gives a great emotional performance. Even if this movie is very representative of the 1930&apos;s, it stills\n\nsounds very fresh today. Please, don&apos;t look at the version that Capra will made in the early 1960&apos;s, with Bette Davis. This is the real thing!",

As a foreigner who has lived in an Italian town for a year, I come to see that the colossal heart of every Italian man can only be captured with its gist by Cimino. And no other up till date. It comes from lighting, its shadow, its colours, its smell even on screen, its silhouettes, its accents, its breathing space, and his very own colossal heart that can contain it all. You do feel that he has achieved that sacred task in showing us THE SICILIAN. Nobody has that feeling ever been captured with rapture that its texture is almost noble, royal, yet sacred.  But in its careful craftsmanship of Cimino, you find it everywhere, and it is just everywhere that overflows: its costumes, its lighting, its camerawork, its juxtaposition, its projections, so on and so forth. Its tempo of the film makes you flow like a river that breeds lives and cultures at the very same time."

      "name": "Ordinary Spaghetti Western  with lots of shots , thrills , action , including a spectacular final attack on a train",
      "reviewBody": "This thrilling film packs noisy action , shoot&apos;em up , round-up , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving , being quite entertaining and made in American style as well as Spaghetti , approaching increasingly Leone Italian manners , but keeping some details that make it special in this particular genre . It deals with a solitary drifter called Jeff Benson (Carl Möhner) helps some unfortunate people who have been gunned down by El Diablo&apos;s murderous bandit band . Then Jeff saves Jerry and joins to him . Both of them arrive in Canyon City , a dangerous city run by Black (Ivano Staccioli) , the sheriff&apos;son and whose sister (gorgeous Alessandra Panaro) falls in love for Jeff . But Bandit leader El Diablo (Jose Torres) who controls the country with his gang plans to achieve gold destined for Mexico , though he is not the only one .\n\nThis obscure Spaghetti results to be an exciting Maccaroni western that contains a story full of violence , so-so dramatic pace and slick direction . It follows the Sergio Leone wake , including close-ups , shootouts , choreographic duels and that&apos;s why being proceeded in Italian style . It&apos;s a thrilling western with spectacular scenes and breathtaking confrontation among protagonist Carl Mohner and heartless enemies as Jack Taylor and Ivano Staccioli . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with usual actors , technicians, production values and pleasing results . Charismatic interpretation from Paella/Spaghetti&apos;s customary actors . The Austrian actor Carl Mohner is average in his usual tough role , here as Jeff Benson , an undercover federal agent posing as a drifter and desperately wanting justice , but a ruthless Mexican and a traitor are on his trail . Carl Mohner was as Austrian character actor who appeared in British and continental productions from 1949 . He was also a noted abstract painter, whose works have been exhibited internationally . Mohner starred films in all kinds of genres , especially thriller , action and wartime such as : ¨A woman at her window¨, ¨Wanted babysitter¨ , ¨Cave of the living dead¨ , ¨It takes a thief¨, ¨Sink the Bismark¨, and ¨The last bridge¨ . His greatest hit was ¨Rififi¨ . There are also some familiar faces in the support cast , most of them under-covered by American pseudonyms , such as Ivano Staccioli , Antonio Garisa , Mila Stanic and José Torres who steals the show as nasty Mexican bandit called El Diablo . This role as a cruel Mexican outlaw to be continued a few years later , in the classic Spaghetti ¨The specialist¨ by Sergio Corbucci with Mario Adorf as Diablo . \n\nColorful and evocative cinematography by Marcello Masciocchi , though being necessary a perfect remastering . And inappropriate and inadequate musical score . The motion picture was regularly directed by Gianfranco Baldanello . He was assistant director and subsequently directed some films . Gianfranco made several Spaghettis , such as ¨Uccidete Johnny Ringo¨ , ¨This man cant die¨ , ¨Son of Zorro¨ , ¨The Cry of the Wolf¨, ¨Black Jack¨ and ¨Blood River¨ . And ¨30 Winchesters for El Diablo&quot; - International title- or &quot;Gold Train&quot; rating : 4.30/10",

      "reviewBody": "well....what can i say....Argo is an interesting movie. I am Hungarian so i had a chance to watch it in its original format and i was pretty pleased. It took some getting used to and the &quot;action scenes&quot; were pretty cheesy, but i think some people who bash it kind of miss the point. this isn&apos;t trying to be a James bond action movie. it&apos;s a comedy. There are a good few things that you wont get or laugh at unless you are Hungarian, so that may take down the value of the movie for some, but than again, this movie wasn&apos;t really intended for the US audience. While a good number of jokes are verbal, the sheer stupidity of some of the characters is mind blowing. From some aspects this movie reminds me of some Jancso films...................I thought it was a good movie, the humor was great, action was bleh, while it may look like the producer is trying to copy his US colleagues, to me, these references came off more in the tone of satire than anything.",

But the air-soft element is completely forgotten as soon as the baddies show up - the characters who are supposed to be good at the game behave just as idiotically as the rest.\n\nIt&apos;s not even that they make the understandable mistakes panicking civilians might make in a deadly situation - they just do whatever random, stupid things they need to progress the &apos;story&apos; to the next plot point. One character is happy to kill an injured enemy in cold blood, but then hesitates when confronted by an armed enemy coming for her two minutes later. One character who&apos;s armed with a real gun nonsensically *puts it down and forgets about it* just to let a particularly nasty and sadistic scene happen without her preventing it.\n\nThe cinematographer&apos;s main trick is to have the focus wander between foreground and background - which looks classy the first time, but loses its appeal when it happens in every other shot.\n\nNot at all good.",

      "name": "My honest opinion of &quot;Murder-Set-Pieces&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "Let me set the record straight, first and foremostI am an enormous fan of the horror genre. I have never had more fun with any other type of film. There is nothing that I enjoy more than kicking back with a good scary movie.\n\nI&apos;ll be honest. When I first heard about &quot;M-S-P,&quot; I was a bit apprehensive about seeing it. Some of the reviews I&apos;d read on its graphic content made me wonder if this was a film I should sit through. After all, this *was* the film titled the most &quot;graphic and disturbing horror film ever made.&quot; I finally got my hands on an uncut copy a few months ago. I sat back with a good friend of mine and popped the disc in. As the film progressed, the two of us began to chuckle. Those small, child-like giggles soon turned into full on hysterical laughter. &quot;M-S-P&quot; is a film so laughably bad, the two of us couldn&apos;t believe our eyes.\n\nWhat is called the most graphic and disturbing horror film ever made is nothing more than gore for the sake of gore, violence for the sake of violence, and vicious bloodshed for the sake of vicious bloodshed. That&apos;s not what the two of us found so funny. What we found so incredibly hilarious was the fact that this film was ever made in the first place. Who could&apos;ve possibly been behind this pathetic drivel? Then, I stumbled upon the homepage and MySpace of writer/director Nick Palumbo. Oy vey. Where to begin? This is a man so positively hellbent on making a name for himself, it&apos;s actually downright sad and most of all, pathetic. Most of the hype around the film comes from him himself. *He* is the one calling this film shocking, disturbing, graphic, violent, terrifying. *He* is the one responsible for the public&apos;s knowledge about the film&apos;s content. *He* is the one claiming film labs refused to print it and the set was intruded upon by uniformed officers brandishing rifles and guns. He *wants* more than anything to go down in the books as the most controversial horror director in history.\n\nIf those are your aspirations, fine. If you have the talent to back it up, wonderful. Sadly, he does not. What he presents the audience with is a weak script that goes basically nowhere. There is no story arc, there is no character development, there is nothing but bloodshed. Most of the dialogue in the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is an incredibly poorly written script that must&apos;ve been only about twenty pages long upon its completion. Mr. Palumbo does not care about story. He does not care about dialogue. He does not care about creating characters an audience can identify or even sympathize with. When a new character is presented, he or she (mostly she) is simply killed off. That&apos;s it. Time to move on to the next scene of vicious bloodshed. I felt absolutely no remorse for any of the characters getting the axe because they simply were not believable. This film contains some of the stiffest, forced performances I&apos;ve ever seen, most of which came from Sven Garrett.\n\nI read an incredibly poignant, smart, and honest review by film critic John Fallon that perceived the film as a &quot;&apos;Look at me, look at me! 9-11 footage! Look at me!&apos; opus.&quot; Very true. Mr. Palumbo desperately wants you to look at him. He wants you to believe the film is all of the aforementioned adjectives. He wants you to believe he himself is sick and depraved. He is not. The film is not. It&apos;s just another pathetic film that tries way too hard and simply does not deliver.",

      "reviewBody": "In this character study of two hateful middle-aged women (not so middle-aged in the movie, however, as in the novel by Ruth Rendell) we are made to fathom the bad that may befall the good.\n\nClaude Chabrol&apos;s direction is clean, crisp and uncluttered--which isn&apos;t always the case, witness his Madame Bovary (1991), which is a bit too leisurely and L&apos;Enfer (1993) which muddles a whole lot. Maybe it&apos;s the editing. Anyway this is more like his quietly brilliant Une affaire de femmes (1988) with a fine script and striking performances by Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert, handsomely supported by Jacqueline Bisset, Jean Pierre Cassel and the very pretty Virginie Ledoyen.\n\nBonnaire plays Sophie, an intense taciturn woman harboring dark secrets, whom the Leliévres have hired to cook and keep house at their country home. Bisset is Catherine Leliévre and Cassel her husband. They exist in bourgeois heaven avec matrimonial bliss with two teenagers, a family so closely knit and so charmingly together that they watch a two-part production of Mozart&apos;s Don Giovanni on TV, just the four of them cosily on the couch.\n\nWell, this sort of unobtainable happiness doesn&apos;t sit well with Jeanne (Huppert) who is a lowly postal clerk living alone whose past includes the (accidental?) killing of her four-year-old daughter. Jeanne takes a fancy to the Leliévre&apos;s strange new maid with the idea of showing her something besides work. They strike up a fateful friendship that we know is leading to something horrible.\n\nHuppert is as good as I&apos;ve seen her, which is very good indeed. She is particularly striking here in an uncharacteristic role as a spiteful, working class woman with a heart of vengeance against anybody better off than she is. There is just a touch of sly irony in her performance suggesting that she is having a particularly good time playing the nasty. Bonnaire&apos;s stark performance as the unbalanced and humorless, reclusive Sophie will remain etched in your brain. Apart they are like inert, harmless chemicals. Together they catalyze one another and become brazen and explosive. \n\nThe story, filled with little foreshadowing of the tragedy to come, gilds the lily of our tristesse by making the Leliévres so very, very nice. We are reminded of the violent hatred by the proletariat toward the privileged classes, in this case acted out by two loonies against an innocent, but representative family, echoing not only the Russian Revolution but even more so the French Revolution, now two hundred years old.\n\nWhat I am trying to figure out why this is called La Cérémonie. Maybe it is a ceremony of execution.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

Interst will be limited to extreme cultists.\n\nFragmentary story unfolds at Abadon, a private school in Connecticut presided over by old-fashioned villainess Madeline (Jackie James). Using a machine (very cheap designwork) created by her late scientist husband, she has achieved immortality by stealing the energy of her students.\n\nDr. Harmon (Duane Jones, star of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;) is an occultist who fills us in on the pic&apos;s scientiic background with mumbo-jumbo dialog. Amidst several stalker-type murder scenes, pointless cutaway shots to closeups of tarot cards or gargoyles on the building&apos;s facade, filmmaker Len Anthony inserts numerous phoned-in scenes of voice-over during pointless filler footage. Key scenes, such asw the fate of the heroine coed Ione (playe by attractive Orly Benair) or a flashback concerning the surprise parentage of fellow student Deborah (Robin Michaels) are missing.\n\nAnthony has some occasionally striking shots by famous cameramen Ernest Dickerson (of Spike Lee&apos;s pics) and Larry Revene (Chuck Vincent&apos;s favorite), but the acting is awkward."

This film calls for meditation and careful consideration. It is not only a reflection on the teenage struggle for identity. It is also a serious declaration about the vacuity of contemporary society, and how urban culture is in many occasions the ultimate refuge to look for spiritual feed and support. It is not a pretentious film, rather it is a sincere one.\n\nGraffiti and hip-hop are not simple hobbies, the film tells us, but - as a cultural expression - they constitute an emanation of the human soul trying to make their way from the depths of this diminished world to the arena of the people&apos;s consciousness. This idea is used in the image system of the film when one sees graffiti extending on the city walls coming from the soil. \n\nThe use of animation with a Japanese look in some sequences of the film is really beautiful and coherent with the overall work. \n\nThe acting of the lead actress Alba Garcia is well done and fits in the structure of the film.\n\nThe directing is both creative and effective. I hope this filmmaker can make his way to get his second feature done in a near future. More films like this are needed.",

Lethal Weapon 4 for example had more humor in it than Death Machine. This is a great movie with a strong resemblance to Aliens, not Alien despite public opinion. The costume design on the Hardman suit was very good for a low budget film. The camera work was really good especially in certain scenes where several emotions are caught in them. The movie features a good plot and believable tech for the year it takes place in. It does feature some cheesy lines in a couple of parts but other than that its dialogue is strong. Our tree hugging heros are very likable too. In my own humble opinion which of course is the only one that matters, if this were re-released as a theatrical motion picture, it&apos;d be the action flick of the summer next year! This one gets a 9!"

It is a careful and sympathetic character study/biography of an actual young woman named Aloise, who was born about 1900. \n\nIt starts off in the dark, at night, with voices of young girls talking, sisters. Aloise says she would like the name Lulu for all the U&apos;s. \n\nI didn&apos;t know what it meant at the time, but now I can see it meant she wished she were someone else. She was a gentle, artistic woman with a mind divided over many things. \n\nThere are various stresses in her life as she grows up; she is happiest when she is singing and when she is taking care of children, as a nanny. There is a beautiful scene in the park with the children, the last scene before the war breaks out. It starts to rain at the end of the scene, and, since I was in college, I recognized this as an allegory of the coming storm of the war.\n\nWhen the war breaks out, it puts tremendous stresses on her psychologically.\n\nShe is a very gentle and empathetic person. None of us enjoy war, I&apos;d guess, at least not most of us when we stop to think about what goes on. But it was just awfully hard on her. In a similar vein, the American poet Denise Levertov told me in the 1980&apos;s she was unable to write for a period because of the horrors America was supporting in El Salvador. War affects Aloise the same way.\n\nI found it engrossing. It was stylish and beautiful. It was the first foreign film I saw over and over; the pacing and perspective were Western, but definitely not American. It was much slower and more delicate than an American film.\n\nI was hooked. \n\nI would very much like to see it again, and highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie pops up on ebay once in a while and for fans of mystery or horror films, particularly those of Universal, this is a must.\n\n The plot is unimportant - it is about a haunted old theater where an old Broadway play is being brought back despite threats from the ghost of a dead actor.\n\nThis film was the last directed by the great Paul Leni. It is really the work of a virtuoso working at his peak. It has everything The Cat and the Canary had and more. The version that seems to be relatively available on video has a good music track too, but unfortunately it seems that the experimental sound sequences the film originally contained have not survived.\n\nNevertheless, we are lucky that this film has survived as it is such a joyous romp of horror cliches with inventive, wild camera moves and stunning lighting and spooky set design. It foreshadows the great horror classics that were less than two years away for Universal. It is just wonderful filmmaking from a forgotten great director who was at his peak, so if you are into old dark house mysteries or Universal horror movies - FIND IT! - It is one of the best!\n\n8/10 - even better than The Cat and the Canary.",

      "reviewBody": "Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s satirical novel of 1973 resonates as deeply now as it did way back then. The themes of suburban paranoia and soulless consumerism have motivated some of the best films of the last twelve months, so an inspired interpretation of Breakfast of Champions would have been warmly endorsed.\n\nIt&apos;s clearly been a labour of love for director Alan Rudolph, who has tried for twenty years to make this film. Sadly, twenty years of work appears to have produced one bad draft copy. And Rudolph does not have the slightest grasp on what is funny.\n\nNick Nolte wanders aimlessly around in a dress but it isn&apos;t funny. Albert Finney searches out his chaotic literary masterpieces in pornographic magazines but it isn&apos;t funny. Barbara Hershey&apos;s character is a product of the chaos, but her appearances lack a motive. She isn&apos;t required until the film bursts into chaotic life in its last ten minutes.\n\nThis means three great actors are left stranded. It results in the unlikely event of Bruce Willis stealing the acting honours. He is good, but one feels it would have been no great stretch to act insane.\n\nAmong the problems here is that the film keeps its feet on the ground. While we&apos;re expected to believe the world has gone mad, the actual events are as uninspired as they are unfunny. This doesn&apos;t mean it is any easier to understand. In fact, without having read the novel, you&apos;d most likely be lost from the beginning.\n\nThe chaos of Vonnegut&apos;s vision was its real joy. The way characters conspired to come together was inventive. The film though plays like a cliche. The ending is anarchic, but you get the impression it only serves one purpose: to stop you making rational sense of the rest of the film. And as much as you want to like it, or applaud Rudolph&apos;s commitment, the truth is that BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is a sad, poor film."

      "reviewBody": "Films about the film industry tend to be self-mocking at the best of times. Singin&apos; in the Rain poked fun at the coming of sound and outlined the difficulties it brought to the industry amongst a love story and a few other things. Additionaly,the more contemporary The Player brought to our attention the trials and tribulations of a Hollywood film producer as he struggles to balance everything at once, complete with disgruntled rejected writers. So it&apos;s sort of a shame as well as a surprise that The Last Tycoon does not hit as many spots as I thought it might with it ending up as a slow burning but ultimately unrewarding experience.\n\nThe film adopts an approach that makes it come across as more of a love story than anything else, but there is a sub-narrative involved that revolves around De Niro&apos;s character of Monroe Stahr gradually getting more and more confused with his life and things around him. The primary problem here is the film is not involving enough to warrant it an interesting or touching love story and the dedication to the focus of a man slowly getting more and more overwhelmed is undercooked  both are there and done reasonably well but both feel anti-climatic. Along with this and like I said in the opening paragraph, the film does not poke fun at and nor does it reference enough the industry in which it&apos;s set so it doesn&apos;t feel particularly clever, something Singin&apos; in the Rain and The Player were because they did it very well and to good comic effect.\n\nThere is a definite study going on here with some substance in the sense it is about Stahr and his struggles with his current life and his love for newly acquired girlfriend Kathleen Moore (Boulting) but nothing much else. Is it a romance? Probably, but is it a good romance? Not really. Ingrid Boulting is shot in an extremely objective manner with lots of brightly lit shots and compositions that reveal enough of her body at particularly nicely timed incidences in the film. This is twinned with several close ups of De Niro&apos;s facial expressions in which the lust and desire is very much apparent. It would be easy to argue that these objective and obvious set ups revolving around a gaze of some sort are deliberate given the film is about film-making and that very early on there is a scene involving a man and woman shooting a romantic scene of some sort. But the concentration on a genuine romance between two characters in the story we&apos;re watching is clearly trying to come across as serious and thus; being self-aware of its own compositions is an idea the film fails to get across.\n\nBut before this romantic distraction gets involved, the film begins in a light-hearted but intriguing style. An individual answers a question on how difficult it must be to shoot an earthquake scene and they laugh, replying that shaking the camera usually works and insulting the idea as a cheap effect. Sure enough about ten minutes later, there is an earthquake within the universe of The Last Tycoon and we realise the film is poking fun at itself. Then there is the other concentrated dig early on that, unfortunately, isn&apos;t played on an awful lot and that involves Tony Curtis&apos; character Rodriguez and Tony Curtis as a whole. The character name of Rodriguez is short and sharp  it is exotic in the sense it sounds &apos;Latino&apos; and we all know that &apos;Latinos&apos; in Hollywood cinema are usually scorching hot in their appearance (at least the women are). Rodriguez is an actor who appears in lots of films about love and making love; he appears topless in the scenes within the scenes that Tony Curtis is filming. The point here being that Curtis himself is (or was) a bit of a pin-up and his public figure is being spoofed through him playing the part of a romantic lead in a film within a film.\n\nWhen all is said and done, The Last Tycoon is a study of one man and his issues. It is not as engrossing as De Niro&apos;s own Taxi Driver from the same year and nor is it as interesting or disturbing as more contemporary examples like American Psycho and One Hour Photo. The film substitutes daily rigmarole and movie set interaction for the introduction of Boulting as the dull love interest and shoots her body accordingly. Twinned with this is a visit from Brimmer, played by Jack Nicholson, which is ill timed and feels out of place given the route the film had gone down at that point. While the film isn&apos;t particularly bad, it feels underdone and somewhat one dimensional. Its study of love and stress is alright but it does not demonise the film industry in ways it could&apos;ve and nor does it feel particularly urgent. This could revolve around anyone, in any industry, at any time and that said, The Last Tycoon is pretty ordinary.",

We have the same two main actors but here, Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi play different characters who come together after a big gangland hit to, basically, reminisce about their childhood together. There is fierce violence but this has gentle and reflective periods, that reminds one more of Takeshi Kitano&apos;s Sonatine than the more usual Miike product. Indeed, whilst this is not easy to follow, with its flashbacks and incomplete tales, it is further made mysterious with magic acts and surreal moments. Nevertheless a likeable film with amazing visuals, just not all of exploding body parts.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a Peacock Original movie, the Executive Producer is Melissa McCarthy. Fittingly she also is the star of the movie, playing the Genie named Flora. With that as background we should all be surprised if it turned out to be an excellent movie. It is also a remake of &quot;Bernard and the Genie&quot; from 1992, which has Alan Cumming as the Genie. He is in this movie as the uncaring boss.\n\nHaving just watched it I can say authoritatively &quot;Genie is a very ordinary movie.&quot; But the real question, &quot;Is it entertaining&quot;, and my wife and I were mostly entertained. It is the kind of movie that, if you never see it, you are fine.\n\nIt starts with Paapa Essiedu as Bernard, a family man with the inability to properly balance work life and family life. Like missing his young daughter&apos;s birthday party because his boss asks him to stay late. At home alone, after mom and daughter go visit grandma, he picks up an old, bejeweled box and rubs it. That is how he meets Flora.\n\nMost of the movie covers somewhat unimaginative instances where Bernard uses Flora&apos;s magic to grant wishes. But in the end he decides that wealth and fancy wishes were less important than mending relationships. Many won&apos;t like the end when he fails to wish for riches untold but that is in essence the message of the movie. Who you are and how you treat others is more important than wealth."

However I wouldn&apos;t recommend it as a &quot;let&apos;s rush to see it at the movies&quot; movie, it&apos;s more a video movie. Susan Sarandon is brilliant as Adele August as she adds all the characteristics of a mother who wants to pursue her dreams and protect her daughter at the same time. Natalie Portman does a great job as Ann August showing the maturity her character possess, however I think there were too many tears on her part as in practically every scene that was shown she&apos;s be crying !! But I thought it was a fine movie"

      "reviewBody": "We&apos;re all stuck with narrow selves through the day, doing our best to mind our part in the noisy, incoherent narrative of life, organizing a myriad worries with one eye at the clock. At nights however, some nights, we dream, have passionate sex or watch truly mind-bending movies, drawing fresh water from the well of deep, mysterious non-self which is the great dancefloor where lovers meet their dragon.\n\nSo here&apos;s a film about a man haunted by a half-remembered night from his past, who wakes up inside a dream to find himself. The film begins and ends with shots of the protagonist in his own primordial sea, the sea of clarity and dissolved self. He is a famous actor, to stress the roles and guises of that weekday showbiz self we carry with us everywhere. A lot of time is spent around film sets and cameras.\n\nThe film is split in two very clear halves, a usual trope of films about memory since Vertigo; the long, blurry Miami night of sexual obsession and going back 18 months later. Overt drugging and boozing insert the dazedness of mind. The meta-aspects of the work involving a sex video being made and &apos;looking back&apos; through cameras are thin and obvious. And Ferrara&apos;s attempt at a script-less improvised feel among the actors does not pan out in the least, not solely Modine&apos;s fault this.\n\nMy guess is that it does not pan out because Ferrara is not a genuinely curious, patient person like Altman who takes pleasure in the tentative brushing of characters, Ferrara is eager to get to the bleeding soul. I don&apos;t have to reach out to his other films to confirm this, here&apos;s a film about yearnings but only as acknowledged through an overbearing sense of misery and self-pity. \n\nThe obvious self-reference. The emotional bluntness. The shouting and partying as some acidic edge. These are all the same, short narrative distance away from the viewer. The film can be described as David Lynch films Le Mepris but all that French, Godardian baggage are as cumbersome now as thirty years prior. So in narrative terms, it is a modest failure.\n\nAnd yet I recommend this to you on its power to enchant with its visual fabrics. There are all sorts of those:\n\n1) the sex video as in-sight of our guy&apos;s hallucinative desires, and grainy handcamera footage as memory, fixing the mind. Dennis Hopper anchors this part as director, channeling both his Blue Velvet and Last Movie chaotic selves. 2) raw, cutting intimacy around the lovely Dalle. 3) warm coziness in New York, with smart usage of Claudia Schiffer as token of bloodless normalcy. 4) the b/w, Nouvelle Vague- inspired interlude at the beach.\n\nYou may settle in one or more of those. I settle in the Miami reverie, not the pleasure-seeking itself but those fleeting drive-by shots of nightlife and cloudy views from balconies, the gauzy loss of self and story. Marvelous, marvelous mood. If you mute the drama, it can sink into you."

Nowadays we&apos;re hardened to gore and violence, and horror in general, I can imagine when this went out, many people felt uneasy when home alone.\n\nI think there is some real menace in this film, the scares are real, it&apos;s just a shame that we only really get them at the beginning, and the end of the film. The middle segment of the film doesn&apos;t quite have the same bite as the start and finish, but overall, it is still a cracking horror, 7/10.",

When an evil group of villains robs and kills grandpa in their absence , they further on are determined to hunt them down . Shortly after t, hey arrive the last minute to save Corinne (Jennifer Youngs , John Savage&apos;s daughter) from the very same band of cutthroats . However her daddy dies due to the injures , so they ask the young woman to live with them . Later on , the family head off to the local village where the bad guys are spending time at the saloon . The family and the faithful mate , the wolf-dog , attempt to stop the ambitious, snarling evildoer (Rik Battaglia) and his hoodlums until a thrilling final confrontation .\n\nThis is a tepid and light-hearted adventure about known and very freely classic novel by Jack London . Lumpy blend of adventure , action , villainy , though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . Exception for some shootouts , it almost entirely lacking in moving incidents or interest enough . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London , though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version , however remains the essential elements as the young-dog friendship , the gold rush , spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . Made in similar budget and parallel style to ¨Tonino Ricci &apos;s White Fang to the Rescue¨1975 with Maurizio Merli , Henry Silva. The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian and Italian landscapes . It&apos;s a below average that that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for a so-so juvenile amusement , being partially redeemed for its gorgeous outdoors nicely photographed by cameraman Giovanni Bergamini . Weak screenplay from Tito Carpi who wrote in similar similar style a lots of films in the sixties and seventies . The main entertainment of the film is to find several Italian secondaries who apperead in all kinds of genres , Spaghetti Western , Giallo, Peplum , Euro-spy , in the golden age of the Eurotrash such as Rik Battaglia , Ottaviano Dell&apos;Acqua , Franco Fantasia , Alberto Dell&apos;Acqua , Bobby Rhodes and William Berger , while the American John Savage has a very secondary intervention.\n\nThis one belongs to subgenre about Jack London renditions, dealing with Call of the Wild and White Fang , such as : ¨Call of the wild ¨ by Ken Annakin with Charlton Heston , White Fang(1991)by Randal Kleiser with Ethan Kawke as young prospector and Klaus Maria Brandauer, and The return of White Fang(1994) by Ken Olin with Scott Bairstow and once again Ethan Hawke.\n\nIt displays an anticlimatic and unappropriate musical score by actor David Hess himself , composed by mean of synthesyzer , including a lousy song .The motion picture titled ¨Buck ai confini del cielo(1991)¨ was badly directed by Tonino Ricci . He was a below average director who in the 90s also realized other dog-films as this ¨Buck and Tim¨ and sequel ¨Buck and the magic bracelet ¨ with Matt McCoy , The recently deceased Tonino was an uneven filmmaker who began his career as an Second Unit Director or Assistant Director and writer, being his first film this &quot;The Liberators&quot; , or ¨Dedo En La Llaga¨, or original title &quot;Il Dito Nella Piaga&quot; . Ricci was a craftsman who directed all kinds genres , as Terror : ¨Panic¨ ; Giallo : &quot;Cross Current&quot; ; Western : &quot;The Great Treasure Hunt&quot; ,&quot;Robin Hood , Arrows , Beans and Karate&quot; , &quot;Bad Kids of the West&quot; ; Adventures : ¨Buck¨,¨Buck and the magic bracelet¨ , &quot;White Fang to the Rescue&quot; , ¨Robin Hood¨ , ¨Thor Il Conquistatore¨, &quot;Raiders of the Magic Ivory&quot; , ¨Bermudas : The cave of sharks¨ ; Action : ¨Rage¨, ¨Rush¨ , ¨Day of the sharks¨ , &quot;Days of Hell&quot; ; Sci-Fi : &quot;Encounters in the Deep&quot; and Mafia film : &quot;The Big Family&quot;. Rating . 3.5/10 . Inferior adventure movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve not watched as many shorts as normal of late, but even with a few months off, I probably still saw more &apos;proof of concept&apos; films than I would have liked. Rise is one of the bigger ones of late, and the hundreds of thousands of views shows that an impressive visual showcase delivered in a tight package will grab those online eyes. Of course proof of concept is not the same as proving you can make a good short film – but then, this is not really the goal here. There is a certain amount of universe creation, and a scenario is played out, however it never doesn&apos;t feel like a trailer which runs long.\n\nVisually there is a lot of very impressive work here. The tight editing makes the most of the dramatic scenes and footage, while the effects are very well done. The merging of humans and robots is particularly convincing in how it looks and moves. The money spent on this is certainly right there to be seen. As a story though, it all feels so very familiar that it didn&apos;t really excite me to get into it more. The familiar faces (Sewell, Yelchin, Kang) add to this feeling of it having quality, but like the effects, it only works on the level as a trailer.\n\nHard to complain, because it delivers what it set out to do, and it certainly got the views it wanted, however if you are looking for anything more than a professionally produced trailer then Rise will not do much for you."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s easy to fall in love with this tale of the ingeniously, slightly magical story of The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet. The story is touching, and quite charismatic, and the little boy is presented as quite a believable genius. Without being presenting as being too intelligent or arrogant and thus putting the audience off. He&apos;s both intelligent and likable, and modest too. Whilst charming and witty it&apos;s not exactly funny. Then again it&apos;s not a comedy. Now this is not a bad thing, as the film works really well for it. \n\nThe film comes across as this little humble tale of something possibly real, and emotionally touching, whilst being both enlightening and saddening at times. Nothing like &apos;Home Alone&apos; or any of those sorts of movies. It&apos;s just that I can see how to some, the film may be perceived as being somewhat bland, and in some ways yes, but for the most part no. You really will become greatly involved all the way throughout the movie. The cinematography is brilliant, as you would expect from Jean Pierre Jeunet, director of Amelie and Micmacs etc. It accompanies the magical style and point of view that T.S. Spivet holds, without overpowering the film as a whole. The screenplay is brilliant, really working off of the original books. In addition, every character feels essential. It doesn&apos;t waste time with characters unneeded, and feels much more compact for it. The story has many a twist and turn in store for you and will make you well up inside. The reason mainly being in the ending, where there is a major plot point, and we can feel every emotion possible from every single character, because by the end, you really have grown to love them. You&apos;ve connected with them, and you feel for them. Slightly strange at times and brilliantly acted, to which, I see great things in-store for Kyle Catlett (T.S. Spivet). T.S. Spivet is definitely one to watch with the entire family. Prepare yourselves, hearts will be uplifted. There&apos;s only two flaws with this movie... some people may feel like it&apos;s not &quot;entertaining&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; enough, to which it&apos;s not supposed to be... It&apos;s touching, brilliant and a really adventure, (And do you know what, it&apos;s a little bit funny too). The second flaw, is that some of the characters are a little bit of a caricature, especially with the stereotypical police officer and Two Clouds just being thrown in for good measure, where they just act as fillers, however, as fillers go, they&apos;re still really good.\n\nFinal Grade: A-\n\nNot quite Jeunet&apos;s best work, but it does the trick. Original and clever, and connects emotionally... and a little bit surreal. The Jean Pierre hat-trick has been successfully pulled off. A worthwhile watch.\n\nFor more please visit... http://wp.me/4w7bk",

The story is very silly, and the film seems even for the year 1950 very antiquated and stuffy. Marika Roekk acts stiff in this film and the rest of the cast is even more hopeless. Especially the leading man is very annoying. Only Josef Egger acts natural. Watch out for a very young Nadja Tiller, who makes her film debut in this one. - My advice is &apos;Don&apos;t watch this film&apos;! It&apos;s only worth mentioning for being the first Austrian colour movie.",

I have asked other people if they have ever read or watched the film. None of who I had asked ever even heard of the title. I felt disappointed in that because I think the story had a great connecting bond between the two characters and the kingdom they had was similar what I had as a kid growing up in the mid-west. We (as a child in grade school) had to read and watch the film. At the time the film wasn&apos;t all that &quot;bad&quot; in acting from what I remember. Twenty years later I was looking up the film to see if I could find it. To my surprise I see that Hollywood is in development for a remake in 2006 which I feel is a very good thing. Kids of today don&apos;t really know good story anymore and I hope that some kids that view the remake will help them appreciate the story in todays time.\n\nI would just like to tell the kids out there that this story impacted me when I was in grade school and hope that it touches them in the same way.",

      "reviewBody": "Close second to &quot;Dead Alive&quot; as goriest film ever made. Rivers of ridiculously over-exaggerated red will fill your screen and turn your stomach.\n\nRiki was just an innocent (though super-powered, think Mr. Incredible) youth until the day his girlfriend was killed in a botched rape attempt by gangsters. After dealing out his bloody revenge he is carted off to prison where he wishes to serve his sentence as peacefully and undisturbed as he can. However, this pseudo sci-fi Asian prison is any thing but peaceful. Prison film clichés ensue (ie. corrupt guards, an evil warden, an escape attempt).\n\nTechnically speaking, the movie isn&apos;t very good. The sets lack believability, the dialogue is pretty horrible, and the acting is way over board. The bad guys seem to be bad because they can be...either that or they are just bored, one or the other. Outside of Riki, there is no background attached to any of the characters and none of them are ever developed properly. Additionally, the plentiful fight scenes aren&apos;t choreographed very well. Top it all off with some of the cheesiest kung-fu dubs ever recorded and you have a film suffering from lack of talent.\n\nSo why the positive score? This is a damn fun movie, that&apos;s why. Each and every fight scene ends with a gory display of gruesome blood letting. Heads crushed, stomachs torn open, eyes popped out, faces cut off, one villain even tries to strangle Riki with his own intestines. Amidst the crimson flow, the dumb-as-a-brick story is awash in unintentional humor; the more serious it takes itself the funnier it is. Even the gore itself makes for a joke, it&apos;s so over the top it ceases to offend and becomes a sight gag.\n\nMain stream viewers will not get this movie and will simply not like it. Genre fans, however, will find the holy grail of gore flicks.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Mariel Hemingway stars in what is perhaps the most defining film of her career, a vehicle that displays her acting talents at what is probably her own &apos;personal best&apos;.\n\nIn &quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot;, Mariel is Chris Cahill, a young and attractive bi-sexual athlete competing at the Olympic Team Trials for the 1980 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles. Her character is defined as somewhat naive, but she is guided through her sexuality phase with the help of Tory Skinner (wonderfully played by Patrice Donnelly). Whether the two characters are lesbian or not is beside the point, what &quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot; tries to deal with is the hardship of having a relationship at a trying time in your life. In this case, both Chris and Tory are competing for a place in the Olympic Team and they both help each other emotionally and physically to achieve their goals.\n\nThe two girls both deal with sexual confusion which distracts them on and off the field. Their coach is played by Scott Glenn who plays a hard and despicable character who &apos;pushes&apos; them too hard to achieve their personal best.\n\n&quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot; is filled with unnecessary nudity including countless scenes inside a sauna where you get to see young female athletes baring all. There are also several explicit sex scenes involving Chris and Tory which would probably not be suitable for younger children. One questionable scene involves Chris and a male athlete/temporary love interest in a bizarre toilet scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - but other than that, the rest of the film is quite inspirational.\n\nWhen the movie isn&apos;t trying to be serious, there are some comedic moments including a scene where Chris asks Tory to &apos;pull her finger&apos;. Another thing &quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot; successfully achieves is building a story around a &apos;lesbian relationship&apos; without delving into silly stereo-types and cliché&apos;s that spoiled other films of the same time (ie. &quot;WINDOWS&quot; and &quot;THE LONELY LADY&quot;).\n\nWhen it all boils down to it, what drove Chris and Tory to achieve their personal best was not endless training and their physical attributes, but their love and friendship for each other which was something that would probably last forever. &quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot; is a film about athletics and it is also a love story.\n\nYes, Mariel Hemingway has starred in a lot of trash (ie. &quot;LIPSTICK&quot;, &quot;SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE&quot;, &quot;BAD MOON&quot;) - but it is &quot;PERSONAL BEST&quot; which I remember her the most for. Patrice Connelly was also a very good actress, but she has since retired from acting after appearing in only two films. This movie brought back a lot of memories about the 70&apos;s and the 80&apos;s and how innocent love could be in times that weren&apos;t so troubled.\n\nI highly recommend this film, not just for sports enthusiasts, but for also those who are seeking a romantic love story.\n\nMy rating - 8 out of 10",

I didn&apos;t consider to pay for this movie when it first came out, but when I caught a free screening in a plane this afternoon I decided to give it a shot. Well, it was a mistake. There were almost 100 movies in the list and this was one of the worst among them. This movie tries to be so many things but succeeds in none of them. It tries to be an action movie and it fails, it tries to be a thriller with a historical mystery side and it fails, it tries to be a spy movie and it fails in this, too. Characters make so many irrelevant moves, some of the decisions make you wander what the heck they were thinking. And the ending... I don&apos;t want to spoil anything, but it is a mess, you can just hate this movie for its end. I would want to say good things about the acting, but I cannot so I will leave this topic like this. I gave 3 stars just to appreciate the effort to make this film. I hope they make more movies like this but only good ones. Unfortunately, this isn&apos;t a good movie. I strongly recommend to avoid from it.",

      "name": "Burt Lancaster&apos;s Eastern Frontier flick",
      "reviewBody": "Released in 1955, &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; is one of only a couple films directed by Burt Lancaster.\n\nTHE STORY takes place during the presidency of James Monroe circa 1820. Lancaster plays Eli Wakefield, a Kentuckian who desires more room to breath in Texas. Still in Kentucky, they blow their &quot;Texas money&quot; on freeing a beautiful indentured servant, Hannah (Dianne Foster). They don&apos;t get past the next frontier town where Eli takes up with his brother in the tobacco business and Hannah gets a job as a bar matron. Eli&apos;s dreams of Texas are sidetracked when he meets up with a schoolmarm (Diana Lynn) who encourages him to settle down and make a family with her. The problem is that Eli&apos;s son prefers Hannah and doesn&apos;t want to give up their Texas dream. Meanwhile feuders are hot on Eli&apos;s trail, not to mention malevolent local businessman with a whip (Walter Matthau).\n\nSome highlights include: \n\n\n* Lush Eastern locations. The film was shot in Levi Jackson State Park, Kentucky (near London), as well as Owensboro, Kentucky, which is on the Ohio River, and Rockport, which is just across the river in Indiana. The river depicted in the film is supposed to be the Tennessee River (I think), but it was shot on the Ohio. In any event, although &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; is classified as a Western, it&apos;s actually an Eastern.\n\n\n\n* The film offers a good glimpse of what the Eastern USA was like back when it was still a frontier -- the cabin-styled houses, sleeping in the woods, etc. No internet, cable, video games, DVDs or microwaves. People actually sat down with other people and communed.\n\n\n\n* The story is realistic, albeit with some lame dialogue. Regardless,you don&apos;t have to worry about any goofiness or unbelievable bits that plague some 50&apos;s Westerns, except for the too-wooden-they&apos;re-funny feudalists.\n\n\n\n* Back then a huge riverboat coming to town was an exciting attraction. Americans today, by contrast, get all excited over the shenanigans of some celebrity.\n\n\n\n* Dianne Foster (Hannah) is a beautiful redhead. One wonders how a woman like this would stay single very long on the frontier.\n\n\n\n* The whip fight with Matthau is great. Lancaster is almost whipped to shreds (!).\n\n\n\n* Loyalty is a sub-theme here. Eli&apos;s son is loyal to Hannah and never warms up to the schoolmarm, although there&apos;s it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s nothing wrong with the latter. And Hannah is loyal to the man who delivered her from bondage (Eli), despite his infatuation with the marm.\n\n\n\n* I liked the bit on Eli being a laughing stock because of a worthless freshwater pearl, but he gets the last laugh with a letter from the President (or is it?) and additional help.\n\n\n\n* Lastly, Lancaster is a likable protagonist with his charismatic joy-of-living persona; he&apos;s humble and respectful, the antithesis of Eastwood&apos;s amoral and lifeless &apos;man with no name&apos; a decade later.\n\n\nThe film runs an hour and 44 minutes.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; is breath of fresh air and I enjoyed it from beginning to end for all the above reasons; it&apos;s sort of like &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992) of its era, albeit no where as good. It&apos;s innocuous and easy-going, but sometimes surprisingly brutal (the dog fight and whip fight). If you can acclimate to the style of filmmaking of the mid-50s it&apos;s worth checking out.\n\nGRADE: B",

This film takes the basic plot line of two sister&apos;s and their journey with love. There is an older sister who longs for love, yet puts family above her own needs, and the younger one, who nearly misses true love because of her inability to see past her romanticized ideas. The opening battle scenes are definitely not Austen, and neither are all the MTVized song and dance numbers. BUT, that&apos;s what makes this movie a unique screen experience. It&apos;s the blending of Western and Eastern ideas of a universal plot: love lost and love regained. There is comedy, romance, even action in this one. We are becoming definite fans of Bollywood films. They bring a new twist to the old Hollywood musicals of yesteryear, and subtitles don&apos;t get in the way of the entertainment. Very colorful, fun, and even enchanting.",

      "reviewBody": "The original F/X was a moderately successful movie. It certainly wasn&apos;t anything great but it did have unmistakable quirkiness in regards to how it approached the action genre. This sequel took five years to follow it, which does seem quite slow by the standards of the day. It teamed up the duo of Bryan Brown and Brian Dennehy again, the former playing the lead character, special effects artist Rollie Tyler.\n\nThe film opens once again with another amusing opening that turns out to be a film-within-a-film, featuring a transvestite alien lunatic. The story kicks into gear when Rollie&apos;s police detective friend is killed on a sting he was roped into. He has evidence of foul play though, so he joins forces with his private investigator buddy to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Truthfully, the story is not very good and ultimately is only there to serve as a means to connect various action and jovial banter scenes together. In fairness, like the first movie, there are some entertainingly different action scenes to enjoy. Especially good was the robot clown fight, which was a refreshingly different way to approach an action movie punch up; also amusing was the shop sequence where the bad guy is finally dispatched when he has his head mechanically cellophaned like a supermarket chicken! But all-in-all, irrespective of these occasional original moments, F/X 2: The Deadly Art of Illusion is nothing to get too excited about. It&apos;s a passably entertaining action flick and no more really.",

      "reviewBody": "I think it&apos;s time for Tim Burton to stop. This remake has none of the charm of the original film. The first half hour maybe has occasional moments that appear as an homage to the original. There&apos;s a few scene&apos;s just remade in live action form and even a couple of what I guess could be considered very brief cameos by Mr. Stork and Timothy Q. Mouse, but those characters really play zero part in the film.\n\nBeyond that first half hour it goes off the rails quickly and continues a downward spiral that has almost no relation to the original story, including caricatured antagonists and chase scenes. A cast that includes Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, and Danny Devito, turn in some of the worst performances of their careers. At least Johnny Depp doesn&apos;t make an appearance.\n\nLike his remake of the Chocolate Factory, and just about every other Burton film it has to get creepy at some point. Unfortunately, it does so in what seems such a forced way and what&apos;s become such a cliche way in Burton films; and it doesn&apos;t even really fit the story line. Danny Elfman&apos;s over dramatic score, another predictable staple of Burton&apos;s films, doesn&apos;t help.\n\nSome of Burton&apos;s early films, like &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; were brilliant and groundbreaking. Unfortunately, like many of his characters, he&apos;s become a caricature of himself with no new ideas, just remaking old ideas in his own style which has become a caricature of itself.\n\nI actually found myself yawning and drifting off during what should&apos;ve been the climax of the film. But there was little there but a cliched story with a bit of Burton&apos;s weirdness thrown in.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of the original, skip this mess of a film and watch the original again. Or maybe watch the first half hour, but skip the rest. There&apos;s little you&apos;ll recognize from the classic Disney tale."

Sounds promising, and so are the first scenes.\n\nThings quickly go downhill though as the two sidekicks are introduced, who might manage to provide some low brow comic relief for ages 5 and below, but are guaranteed to annoy anyone else, and who are given way too much screen time. The other prominent character, Mr. Vampires niece, must be around 18 years old, yet acts like she is a whiny cognitively challenged toddler which obviously gets irritating very quickly as well.\n\nOn the up side: Michiko Nishiwaki is convincing as a wicked sorceress, and Ching-Ying Lam doesn&apos;t disappoint.\n\nTo sum it up, there sure are some entertaining scenes and fights, but you will probably find yourself fastforwarding a lot as well. Might be worth it for Mr. Vampire fans, but certainly not required viewing.",

And Robert Downey, Jr. just does a tremendous job - he is so talented. When the four spirits enter his body (at different times), it&apos;s amazing how well he portrays each one with such accuracy (especially as Penny), like he&apos;s really that person. The humor never misses a beat.  This movie will probably always be in my top 5!!"

      "reviewBody": "In the mid-70s when this film was made there was - in the real world - a &apos;battle of the sexes&apos; with militant feminism in full swing (if not an actual &apos;war&apos;, there was a lot of bruised feelings and anger in the air - witness works of fiction like &apos;Who needs men?&apos; and &apos;The Woman&apos;s Room&apos;); the student riots of the late 1960s were a fresh memory, as were images of Vietnam (and for British viewers, the latest IRA atrocities). Black Moon may not &apos;make sense&apos;, but it&apos;s more understandable as a dream, from beginning to end (forget the idea that any of it is meant to be set &apos;in the near future&apos;), by a pubescent girl, subconsciously worried by the apparent war between the sexes and disturbed by her budding sexuality (note the juxtaposition of the idealised vision of heterosexual love, presented by music from Wagner&apos;s Tristan und Isolde first heard on the car radio, quickly followed by the shocking images of war).\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, this is beautifully filmed, and IMHO captures beautifully the quality of dreams where one event follows another in a &apos;stream of consciousness&apos; manner (yet with certain obsessive themes), and the dreamer does everything as if it were the most rational thing to do (as one does in a dream). On first viewing I suspected this film to be a rather self-indulgent exercise, but there&apos;s a strangely compelling quality about both the narrative and the beauty of the actual cinematography. Highly recommended.",

She is the person who lost the garter to begin with and has only come to get it back having borrowed it from her employer--the empress of France. The marquis mistakenly thinks he was nursed by the empress, herself, and decides to woo her.\n\nThis was Lilian Harvey&apos;s last UFA film before she left for the Hollywood. It has a weird charm, opulent sets and a great cast, but somehow never quite comes together. There isn&apos;t much chemistry between Harvey and Conrad Veidt or her second lead Heinz Ruehmann. This may have something to do with the melancholy of it&apos;s being pretty near the end of the Weimar film era and the heydey of Harvey&apos;s career. Many of the most key people at UFA had already begun to emigrate and be forced out of the business.\n\nThe tunes are good and the little subplot with Offenbach gives the film a chance to use some bits of operetta to comic advantage. Somehow, however, the film probably wasn&apos;t the best send-off for UFA&apos;s biggest star."

I saw the movie despite my modern distaste for that ahem sport: and was at least semi-converted. In ancient northern religions, with their male animal gods, the animal god presents himself to the people to be ritually slaughtered. The ritual must be beautiful. The ritual must be risky: potentially fatal for the killing-man-priest as well as for the animal-god. Migueline shows how it&apos;s done when it&apos;s done right.",

      "reviewBody": "Here is a very brief review of the first movie (or at least what i thought of it) - Brilliant. Plenty of action, developed characters, good story line, nicely paced and well directed and acted.\n\nHere is a very brief review of this movie - terrible.\n\nWhy you ask? Mainly because it has nothing that the original movie had. Admittedly this film doesn&apos;t have the budget that the original had, but the way that it falls down could have been solved without further expense. The characters aren&apos;t developed in any way. I can&apos;t really explain this without adding spoilers, so i won&apos;t, but believe me, there is no recognition of ANY of the &quot;new&quot; assassins background or any story behind their assassination &quot;style&quot;. Lazlo Soot (a returning character) isn&apos;t in any way as likable as in the original. His whole &quot;human face mask&quot; approach was very refreshing in the first film, but tired and used in this attempt. He adds very little in all. As for the Tremors? They just aren&apos;t the Tremors. Simple.\n\nThe action is average at best. Nothing special to report unfortunately. A lot of it just feels very rushed- cops get killed, one or two assassins get killed, more cops get killed. Unfortunately it all happens within 5 minutes, so there isn&apos;t even a chance for some of the assassins to even attempt getting to their target.\n\nHowever, the story line does end out with a fairly OK twist, even if it is slightly far fetched. It gives reasoning behind the actions of the assassins and their &quot;contracts&quot;. Not anything special though. So it&apos;s not all too bad i guess.\n\nIn a nutshell, I would recommend that you just go watch the first one again. There&apos;s a reason as to why this release is straight-to-video. This is only my opinion though, so by all means, give it a try. You might end up liking it more than i did :)",

      "reviewBody": "This is a tense thriller that shows, in no uncertain terms how real and deadly the Killer Bee threat really is. This film shows, with scientific plausibility, the City of New Orleans coming under the increasing threat of a large killer swarm approaching town on the eve of Mardi Gras. Unlike Irwin Allen&apos;s The Swarm, whose main objective was to show one celebrity guest star after another being stung to death, this film is more like a cross between a tense sci fi thriller and a Hitchcock film. Obviously a TV film cannot posses the cinematic genius of a Hitchcock film, yet this little gem comes close. The team of scientists, (aided by the local sherriff) that are trying to thwart the disaster deal with a slow subtle(at first), steadily climbing stream of attacks. The threat grows as the attacks continue, and for awhile it looks like the bees will win out. The death scenes are the most realistic ever shown in a killer bee film, one senses what it might actually be like to meet this horrible fate. Also a first, this film gives the actual history of how the bees came to invade South &amp; Central America, and deals with the scientific realities of how to stop this menace. Now that there have  been killer bee deaths in the United States, this film rings even more true than when it first was telecast in 1976.",

During Hyaku-Me&apos;s monologue about her dream and flags, the boom mic bobs in and out of the scene multiple scenes. Barring this error, the movie has a 2 thumbs up soundtrack, rather good acting, and great scenery."

      "reviewBody": "Devil and the Deep contains a fascinating performance from Charles Laughton as a submarine commander going nuts with the conviction that his sultry wife (Tallulah Bankhead) is cheating on him first with Cary Grant and then Gary Cooper.\n\nThe physical production features a claustrophobic studio recreation of a North African town (reminiscent of Von Sternberg&apos;s &quot;Morocco&quot; but without the dazzling shadow play), a romantic scene in a starlit desert oasis (said to have been filmed in an actual desert but looking exactly like a painted backdrop) and finally the laughable spectacle of toy boats bobbing around in a tank of water that we&apos;re supposed to believe is the Mediterranean. \n\nBankhead, like other female stars of that historical moment, is made up and coiffed to look like a Garbo clone. The style suits her without overwhelming her innate, distinctive qualities of voice and manner. Laughton&apos;s performance prefigures his later Captain Bligh in Mutiny on the Bounty and Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I prefer his work here to his Bligh, which was sometimes too messily overwrought. This is also the second 1932 film (the other being &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;) in which he plays dementia with mad laughter. Cooper is wooden and awkward (and handsome) as usual and Grant does well in a smallish supporting role."

But, because of my liking for Sophie Marceau and my love of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I rented it...and I loved it.\n\nThis film takes a unique perspective, concentrating more upon the relationship between mother and daughter, rather than the romance between mother and father.  Though the story is an oft-told one, this is a film whose magic will grasp you, just as the mentioned firelight within.\n\nSophie Marceau gives a wonderful performance as Elisabeth, combining her lovely face with the warmth of any mother towards her child.  Stephen Dillane is also very good, but I was entirely *riveted* by Dominique Belcourt as little Louisa.  Her performance had no artifice---she had no problem acting like the little brat, then slowly beginning to soften as she discovered what a life could be without hating everyone other than her father.\n\nThe costumes were as good as any other recent period film and the sets were *gorgeous*, especially the famous &quot;lake house&quot;.\n\nTherefore, despite a plot everyone knows, &quot;Firelight&quot; utterly charmed me and held me spellbound even after its conclusion."

The subject itself is fascinating, but what&apos;s even cooler is the access the filmmakers had to Chong himself. The film reveals the personality behind the persona--all while giving an in-depth look into the life of a comic legend. In addition,the film gives an extremely eye-opening look at drug policy in this country. I don&apos;t think that most people realize the roots of the most of the drug laws in the U.S. are based in racism, and this film does a great job of exposing that in a non-preachy (even hilarious!) manner. Anyone who has the chance should absolutely catch &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Larry Ward is toplined in this low budget Italian/Spanish oater for some reason; he has less screen time than the other male leads, except for Robert Mark, who disappears early on only to reappear toward the end. Ward was an American actor who had quite a few TV appearances, mostly in westerns, and appears suited to play the town storekeeper, or priest, or councilman, hardly a wandering adventurer. Mark has plenty of charisma as Randall, one of a quartet of killers who hole up in a wonderfully dilapidated ghost town, hiding out until they can escape over the border. Ben (Ward) and Judy, recently widowed, ride into town and are taken prisoner by the gang, who enjoy toying with them. Meanwhile the money has disappeared, Braddock (the fine Furio Meniconi), the leader, is growing agitated, and his lover Shelley is looking around for a better deal. This script was the blueprint for the later MATALO! which is virtually identical, with the addition of boomerangs. The remake is a little crazier, with the women dressing like hippies and wild camera-work, psychedelic music, and a Gothic atmosphere, but KILL THE WICKEDS is a good time for western buffs, available on a nice double feature from Wild East, teamed with KILL OR BE KILLED, also starring Robert Mark.",

      "name": "Below average Chorizo Western dealing with Canadian Mounted Police , being lousily directed by Ramón Torrado",
      "reviewBody": "In a fort located in the remote lands of Canada, a regiment of North West Mounted Police with plenty of soldiers dressed in deep red , being commanded by a tough commandant , there two men (Frank Latimore, Alan Scott) face each other over a woman (Maria Silva) . But a young Indian girl (Diana Lorys) is in love with one of them. Along the way, our protagonist John Bedford (Alan Scott) is assigned to find some outlaws who have killed some fur sellers and Indians, in order to prevent an Indian war led by Chief Brown Bear (José Truchado) . However, he is taken prisoner by the Indians along with the two bandits (Barta Barri, Tito Garcia) and tied to a central post in the camp of the Indian tribe to be sacrificed, eventually they are saved by the young India and manage to reach the fort . But there things go wrong.\n\nThis is effortless and inferior story in Paella Western sub-genre style , thus the picture mingles the Canadian theme similarly to ¨Unconquered¨ by Cecil B De Mille along with Indian attacks and traitor bandits . As the movie follows more the American models than Spaghetti wake . As it results to be a familiar film , with no much violence and action enough . A very mediocre Western quite poorly shot with poorly staged action scenes. Although there are plenty of extras and impressive Indian attacks alongside a spectacular attack on a fort with a number of horsemen falling from their horses , the film turned out to be very disappointing. The picture contains a breathtaking and overwhelming final battle with hundred extras , when the regiment is really besieged by Indians . Regularly played by two B-American actors Alan Scott as the hero who sets out in a manhunt and Frank Latimore who plays middlingly an upright and stiff commandant . And many other familiar faces from Chorizo/Spaghetti Western , there appears ordinary secondaries as Alfonso Rojas , Bernabe Barta Barri , Rufino Inglés , Fernando Bilbao , Rafael Hernández , Tito García , Xan das Bolas , Alfonso de la Vega, Guillermo Méndez , Luis Barboo , and several others. Mediocre photography by Francisco Sempere , being necessary a right remastering because of the film copy is washed out , filmed on location in Las Rozas , Manzanares , Navacerrada , Colmenar Viejo , Madrid . The movie was produced in budget enough by Atlantida Films/Jose Frade productions that financed several Western during the 60s and early 70s such as ¨Cuatreros¨ , ¨Mestizo¨ , ¨Challenge of McKenna¨ , ¨The mercenary¨ , ¨Los Compañeros¨, ¨twenty dollars for seven¨ and ¨Saddle tramps¨ , among others.\n\nThis so-so Western was middlingly photographed , -though being marred by a worn-out cinematography- by Ricardo Torres , a prestigious cameraman who made ¨Fray Escoba¨, ¨La Mies Es Mucha¨, ¨Vida Por Delante¨, ¨Comicos¨ , and westerns as ¨Sheriff Terrible¨, ¨Vengador California¨ , ¨Bienvenido Padre Murray¨ . Evocative and atmospheric musical score by Daniel White . The motion picture was badly directed by Ramon Torrado . Ramon was born in 1905 , Galicia, Spain . He was a director and writer , known for directing some vehicles of known Folkloric stars such as Peret in Amor a Todo gas (1969) , Manolo Escobar in Un Beso en Puerto (1966) and Paquita Rico in Malvaloca (1954). The nice craftsman Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1964 La Carga De la Policía Montada , 1964 Relevo a Pistolero and 1963 Bienvenido, Padre Murray and 1965 Los Cuatreros .

      "reviewBody": "Gilbert Roland was perfectly suited to the spaghetti western; he seemed to GET it, the rituals, pauses, steely glances, the ambiguity of his characters. You&apos;re never quite sure of his motives; is he the hero or the villain, on the hero&apos;s side or against him? Already elderly when the Italian western made its debut, he was in remarkably good shape and looked a good decade younger than his actual age. He made several Italo-oaters including BETWEEN GOD, THE DEVIL, AND A WINCHESTER, GO KILL AND COME BACK, THE RUTHLESS FOUR, JOHNNY HAMLET,and this one, SARTANA DOES NOT FORGIVE, my favorite of these. He plays Kirchner, a veteran gunfighter who may or may not be an adversary of Uriah Sartana, (George Martin), who is searching for a man, Slim (Jack Elam) who raped and killed his fiancé. Standing between Uriah and his vengeance are the Mexican bandidos led by Reyes who are allies of Slim, and a Mexican rancher, Jose (Alfio Caltabiano) who wants vengeance against Slim for his own reasons. There is the usual maneuvering of gunfighters, a fun Laurel and Hardy-type routine between Kirchner and Uriah with cigarillos being put out in drinks, drinks poured into dishes of food, dishes of food spilt onto boots...they don&apos;t mix up their hats, thank goodness. Martin is good as the steely-eyed avenger who typically gets the snot beaten out of him without losing his good looks. Elam is slimier than ever as Slim, who doesn&apos;t regret the rape/murder of Uriah&apos;s fiancé and even taunts him about her. The lovely Rosalba Neri makes an appearance to get some of her clothes ripped off and instigate a gunfight, and a nicely set up duello at the end will keep you in suspense (even though you KNOW how it&apos;s going to come out) and this turns out to be an entirely satisfying entry in our favorite genre. And of course the music by de Masi is outstanding, as well. This cries out for some attention from Wild East or Franco Cleef. The version I saw was from SBS in Australia, nicely letterboxed (if not the O.A.R.) but dialog was in Spanish with English subtitles. Does an English track of this one exist? If not, too bad, because Elam&apos;s voice is definitely missed!",

During the Middle Ages , in 1472 Great Britain kingdom is ruled by a sicked Edward IV who violently deposed the previous fleeble King Henry IV . A web of intrigue veils the lives of all who know only too well that today&apos;s friends might be tomorrow&apos;s enemies .

Subsequently , Richard eliminates those ahead of him in succession to throne then occupied by his ill brother Edward IV . Richard , Duke of Gloucester , is a dominant , unstoppable , nasty lord , gross black spider of a figure that devours or possesses everyrhing on its path . Do you have the courage to spend 83 minutes in the Tower of London ? Mother England meets Father Terror ? You will need someone to hand onto when you come face to face with the blood-chilling terror in the tower !\n\nEnjoyable and hypnotic amusement for Vincent Price enthusiasts , resulting to be a sophisticated remake from classy version 1939 by Rowland V Lee with Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff . The film results to be as a Shakespearean theatrical drama, as a terror film in the wake of Allan Poe/Roger Corman adaptations and adding some historical elements . As this awesome movie being partially based on historic events , during Two Roses War, Red Rose (York House) ruled by Edward IV and Richard III followers and White Rose (Lancaster House) Henry VII followers who defeat to them . Finally , there takes place the Battle of Bosworth , in which Richard III is vanquished and a new ruler called Henry VII takes over the kingdom . The picture profits from a nice cast who gives over-the-top interpretations . Vincent Price provides an incisive role featuring an acclaimed acting . Being well accompanied by a good secondary cast, such as : Michael Pate , Joan Freeman, Richard Hale , Robert Brown and Sandra Knight .\n\nOther movies regarding this historical character are as follows : &quot;Tower of London 1939&quot; by Rowland V Lee with Basil Rathbone , Boris Karloff and Vincent Price who coincidentally appeared here as the doomed Duke of Clarence . &quot;Richard III 1955&quot; starred and directed by Laurence Olivier with Jean Simmons , Ralph Richardson , John Gielgud , Sir Cedric Hardwicke , Peter Cushing , this is the landmark version of the Shakespearean play . And modern take on &quot;Richard III 1955&quot; by Richard Loncraine with Ian McKellen, Jim Broadbent , Robert Downey Jr , Nigel Hawthorne , being set in an imagined 1930s London if swanky Art Deco .",

Vizontele is one of them in my opinion, as a great harmony of these two genres. It is the beginning of a new era in Turkish cinema which is dominated by the actors and actresses of this movie in the following decade. The cast of the movie is so to say an &apos;All-Star&apos; squad of acting containing plenty of master degree acting artists, which is very hard to be encounter again in the future. There are lots of notable performances without a distinction of lead role or back role, some of which are performed by Erkan Can, Köksal Engür, Cem Yılmaz, Cezmi Baskın, Şafak Sezer, Zerrin Sümer, Tolga Çevik, Salih Kalyon, Selahattin Taşdöğen, Sinan Bengier, Erdal Tosun, İclal Aydın, Tuncer Salman, Bican Günalan, Şebnem Sönmez, Serhat Özcan and of course the lead artists Demet Akbağ, Altan Erkekli and Yılmaz Erdoğan. This movie has gifted so many quotes that are used even today in Turkish people&apos;s daily conversations. In this manner, it is possible to claim that Vizontele has already became a cult Turkish movie.",

      "description": "The story takes place in a small town (called Hakkari) in Turkey at the beginning of the 70&apos;s. The time has come to bring technology into that small town. The first Television (or called Visiontele by the citizens) arrives and the chaos begins. Some people are excited and some are afraid of this new device which can show us live pictures from different places. Is it devils easy prey to catch us or is it just a feature of the modern time? Without losing time, the mayor (Altan Erkekli) of the town Hakkari tries to find some people who can help him to set up the signal receiver on the highest position of the mountain. His Team consists of one crazy electrician called Emin (Yilmaz Erdogan) and some mayor office staff members and none of them has any knowledge of TVs. These predecessors of time tried their luck :) . The Story of Viziontele consists of many Jokes which are mixed up with some traditional superstitions to show how funny the conflict between these two points can be. But also with a dramatical point of view. The storyline of Viziontele is based on the memories of the Dircetor Yilmaz Erdogan, where he grew up in Hakkari while he was a little child. ",

I can only imagine the smirk that must have been on Fosse&apos;s face throughout this production.  He doesn&apos;t ask for forgiveness, he doesn&apos;t try to justify Gideon&apos;s behavior, and he certainly didn&apos;t encourage Scheider to be sympathetic.  &quot;You&apos;re right, I&apos;m a bastard,&quot; he seems to be saying.\n\nWhile catchy and professional, the musical numbers (particularly the art direction and costumes) range from tasteless to bombastic- as they were intended, I think.  The choreography is precise, the editing masterful, and the performances in sharp focus.  These elements, plus the acerbically mournful script, make for a fascinating deconstruction of self to an extent rarely, if ever, seen in the movies.\n\nNot every artist should think himself so interesting, but thankfully, both Fosse&apos;s professional and personal life merited such honest examination.  I can&apos;t think of any of our more iconic filmmakers today who have been turned the camera back on themselves in such unflinching fashion.\n\nNote:  Among the direct parallels to Fosse&apos;s actual career are &quot;The Stand-Up&quot; to &quot;Lenny&quot;, and Lithgow&apos;s snooty Lucas Sergeant to theatre&apos;s estimable Harold Prince.",

Sadly, hasn&apos;t aired in years and not available on DVD or streaming, but if you get a chance to ever see it&apos;s worth the watch. Loretta Swit is beautiful and very thorough in bringing us on a beautiful tour of Germany where many of the traditions everyone holds dear about Christmas started.",

This film, however, is the worst piece of garbage that I have ever seen. I know that phrases like this are used too liberally on IMDb, so believe me that I am using the phrase as appropriately as possible.\n\nThe sound engineer must be deaf. The director (if there was truly a director) should permanently resign himself from film-making. The actors although terrible should probably not be blamed because the sense is that the script and directing sealed their fate before the first line of dialogue was spoken.\n\nThe editing is horrendous. It&apos;s so bad that in many parts of the movie, you can&apos;t really tell what&apos;s going on because of the atrocious scattering of clips.\n\nThere really is no excuse for this piece of rotting manure. Budget is not the issue. I could make a better movie than this for the price of a used lawnmower.\n\nSkill and talent are the ingredients that are missing from the start. Money can&apos;t buy those and unfortunately for those involved in this film, they will never possess either.",

Trancers 5 is really, really pushing it in terms of nostalgia and fandom from the earlier movies. The film is aimless and has no real zip to make the story move forward. Action is mediocre per the budget and the only thing this tired sequel has going for it is Tim Thomerson. It&apos;s hard to believe that the director of this is currently one of the best directors on TV. I guess that&apos;s one good thing to come out of this misbegotten mediocrity. Also the same problem as 4 is that the sword and sorcery era is not nearly as interesting as the Blade Runner inspired first couple and the movie develops no real momentum. This is the type of movie that is best described as &quot;For die hard fans only&quot; which is something part 6 doesn&apos;t even get right. \n\n* * out of 4(-Mediocre)",

      "reviewBody": "and I absolutely loved every minute. There&apos;s nothing better than when you see actors commit fully to absurdity, and there wasn&apos;t a misstep in the entire film, stellar cast and a great movie watching experience. My favorite, of Wes Anderson&apos;s films, and what a move picking the two lead child actors - their performances were brave and spot-on. I want to find this island, I want to liquidate everything I own and move there, I just wonder if a place like this still exists in the World? I bet it does. Quirky and humorous, this film doesn&apos;t disappoint (or at least I&apos;ve only heard of 1 person so far not giving it a thumbs up), anyone who doesn&apos;t get this film I suspect had a very regimented childhood and didn&apos;t take any risks. Great soundtrack, two people near me in the theatre jumped up into the aisle to start dancing (I suspect they may have been there for a second viewing!), the entire audience enjoyed it. Really, Anderson&apos;s best film yet in my book, highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "From 1985: &quot;Target,&quot; directed by Arthur Penn, stars Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon as father and son.\n\n&quot;Target&quot; concerns the abduction of Walter Lloyd&apos;s (Hackman) wife while she is in France with a tour group. Lloyd understands the implications immediately, but his son Chris (Matt Dillon) doesn&apos;t: Someone is after Lloyd, or information in his possession. Father and son leave immediately for Europe to find her. There, Chris learns information about his father that he never knew. And that&apos;s all I can say without giving the game away - which, if you&apos;ve seen a lot of these films, is pretty apparent.\n\nThe problem with &quot;Target&quot; is in the beginning of the film, which has a TV-movie feel to it. Plus, despite locations in Paris and Germany later on, the beginning has a cheap feel to it due to the music and credits, not to mention some trite dialogue and the usual &quot;try to get to know your son while I&apos;m away&quot; speech. It&apos;s a bad set-up.\n\nGene Hackman is terrific as Walter, and Matt Dillon is fine as his son. The standout performance, in my opinion, is by the great acting guru and Broadway star Herbert Berghof in a rare film appearance toward the end of the movie. There are some excellent European actors as well, including the Russian actress Viktoriya Fyodorova.\n\nIf not for the beginning, which threw me off, this would have been a better film.",

Going in, a had seen a few snippets of their act at Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was amusing but I wasn&apos;t expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Watch out for cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this does well in the theaters. &quot;Follow me, we are the shadows&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in August 1985 after watching the movie on Prism video cassette.\n\nMade in 1982, &quot;Ironmaster&quot; is an Italian adventure fantasy right off the assembly line that has copied recent trends in Yank and Aussie action pics. In this case, it&apos;s mainly &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; time, though the primitive men here are far more advanced.\n\nGeorge Eastman is in the tile role, portraying a power-hungry Iron Age man who discovers the art of iron smelting and uses it to make swords. He has been passed over by his tribe elders who want a woman to succeed them, but Eastman as Vude plans to conquer his and other neighboring tribes.\n\nIn opposition is young muscleman Aela (Sam Pasco), who not only steals Vude&apos;s swords but invents a bow &amp; arrow to easily subdue the baddies. Corny finish has him destroying all these weapons of war after they&apos;ve done the job.\n\nPicture is strictly routine, with no nudity, discreet (mainly) violence and little period atmosphere. Lensing is competent, including unusual (for this genre) locations, shot in South Dakota, with a small buffalo herd grazing nearby."

We took the movie home and watched it, but did not happen to find &apos;a great little funny movie.&apos;  In fact, if the video hadn&apos;t been property of the video store, my friend and I would have taken the tape out back and burned it in effigy right at the credits started to roll.

I don&apos;t understand why the original Hong Kong flick is mentioned nowhere in the credits but nearly every single scene and plot element and much of the dialog comes directly from the Hong Kong film. Until Death wasn&apos;t bad, but the problem is that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn&apos;t half the actor that Lau Ching Wan, the star of the original is and director Stephen Fellows is no Johnny To. The love story between the recuperating police officer and his pregnant wife is handled much more effectively in the original. I highly recommend that anyone who enjoyed Until Death (and can tolerate watching movies with English subtitles) seek out the original version, which was released last year on DVD in Hong Kong and can purchased from places like Ebay. It&apos;s a much better movie.",

James Braddock (Chuck Norris) and his men thrown into a POW camp where they are constantly abused and tortured. Soon Braddock finally realizes that their only chance for survival is by escaping. I&apos;ve read at a couple sites that the first two films in the series were shot at the same time and that originally this prequel was meant to be the first in the series but the producer&apos;s film that the other film, the eventually part one, was better so this one here was released second and as a prequel. The first film was a laughably bad action film but this one here tries to play itself more straight and it works in some ways. I&apos;m really not sure if the series would have been better had this one been released first but it does contain more human drama than the first film. This film has &quot;B&quot; movie written all over it due to the poor performances and lackluster direction but it still manages to be entertaining due to some nice action and a fun ending. Soon-Tek Oh plays the bad guy in the film and actually steals the movie. This isn&apos;t an all out action film like the first movie but I enjoyed it just the same."

Before watching A City of Sadness, I subconsciously had this notion that somehow there were certain ways (or methods) feature narrative films should be made. Ohhow wrong I was. Experiencing this movie was like the first time I saw Asian art, no more like the first time I tasted Chinese food as a kid. It was more than different. It was delightful! This film totally enlightened me! This poetic masterpiece changed the way I view cinema. This film which deals with modernity of Taiwan, feels more like a Confucian ritual, an ancestral rite of some sort. And at the same time like many of Hou Hsiao-hsien&apos;s other films, this movie deals with the theme of &apos;growth&apos;. Hou seems to tell us over and over again that growth is learning to say goodbye to the things we love. One beautiful movie. I strongly recommend it to the cinephiles who haven&apos;t yet tasted this great cinematic treat.",

      "reviewBody": "THE CONMAN (Du Xia 1999)\n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound format: Mono\n\nFollowing their collaboration on the eminently watchable A TRUE MOB STORY (1998), director Wong Jing and star Andy Lau re-teamed almost immediately for THE CONMAN, a variation on the hugely successful &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; series. Here, Lau plays a ruthless card-sharp who&apos;s jailed for killing a mobster after being caught cheating during a routine card game. Upon his release five years later, a repentant Lau is targeted by the dead man&apos;s equally vicious brother (Waise Lee) and forced to play for big money against a notoriously successful gambler during a contest which revolves around the outcome of the 1998 World Cup (!). In the meantime, while searching for the wife and child he abandoned after landing in jail, Lau is given refuge by a loyal - though somewhat dim-witted - admirer (Nick Cheung) who is determined to learn the tricks of the gambling trade. And just to complicate matters, Lau finds himself unable to resist his feelings for Cheung&apos;s protective older sister (Athena Chu)...\n\nNot an action film per se, THE CONMAN proceeds at a rapid clip whilst never really moving into first gear, perhaps because it foregoes elaborate set-pieces in favor of character-driven tableaux. Lau coasts through the film largely on autopilot (hardly surprising, given the material) and allows himself to be upstaged throughout by Cheung, who parlays the role of lovable buffoon into something quite distinctive through sheer force of personality. But the climactic card game - during which Lau and his cohorts attempt to deceive their opponents by rigging the satellite transmission of an alternative World Cup Final - lurches wildly from drama to comedy and back again, and hinges around such a ridiculous sequence of events that the entire film is completely derailed. Perversely, this ludicrous episode is also side-splittingly funny, with Cheung playing multiple roles (including the women!) during a series of fake commercial breaks which are designed to make it look as though Brazil won the Cup (don&apos;t ask me to explain why - you wouldn&apos;t believe me if I tried!). Having thus abandoned all credibility, the film has nowhere else to go. Ben Ng (RED TO KILL) and Karel Wong (THE JAIL OF NO RETURN) are featured in the supporting cast as a couple of vicious thugs, though neither of these fine actors is billed in the English-language credits.\n\n(Cantonese dialogue)",

Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That&apos;s just Alt-Right spamming.

It is a sensational little tragedy about a prostitute who returns from the city to her home town where she is variously loved, spurned, and lusted over. The grim, fatalistic atmosphere bears a good deal of resemblance to the much better known contemporary masterpiece OSSESSIONE, by Luchino Visconti.  In fact Massimo Girotti appears in both films. Elli Parvo is quite riveting in the main role."

Freezing and unable to survive the elements for much longer, they&apos;re forced to seek shelter in an abandoned sanatorium, of all places, to wait out the blizzard. Oddly, no one seems to be all that creeped out about their surroundings; they&apos;re too busy boozing, smoking pot, and fondling each other. Their bliss doesn&apos;t last long though and, come morning, the group of pretties are stalked, tortured, and in the worst case scenario, eaten alive.\n\nDid we really need a prequel for this franchise? Was it not plainly obvious about the origins of Saw Tooth, Three Finger, and One Eye? They&apos;re seriously deformed, inbred hillbillies who delight in maiming, murdering, and munching on people. What difference does it make that they were locked up in an institution except to play on an overused horror flick location?\n\nSadly, the ONE guy who could act was unceremoniously fed to the wolves. (The cannibal fondue was a bit much.) I&apos;ve heard more voice inflection and genuine emotion from someone reading the ingredients off a cereal box. When you&apos;re getting paid to see just how many buckets of fake blood a person can handle getting dumped on him/her, I guess nothing else matters. Everything in Wrong Turn 4 went overboard and not in the exploitation-done-right way. Hopefully, this misrepresented prequel is the final insult in a series of increasingly hacked-up sequels.",

In the Novel Villie Abeynaike ( Gamini Fonseka) meets the girl ( Malani Fonseka ) at a Railway Station. Whereas , in the film he meets the girl at the river&apos;s edge.

      "reviewBody": "Set in the 21st century, criminals are forced to fight each other like gladiators on motorcycles for the enjoyment of TV audiences. Sound familiar? Arnold Schwarzenegger &quot;The Running Man&quot; wouldn&apos;t come out for three years later, but Stephen King&apos;s novella came out two years earlier, so don&apos;t give director Lucio Fulci too much credit. Part of a cycle of cheap Italian ripoff films capitalizing on the popularity of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; and &quot;Escape from New York,&quot; this one is better than most of it&apos;s contemporaries, although that&apos;s an admittedly a low bar. In the film&apos;s favor is the cast includes Fred Williamson, which is always a treat, a charmingly 80s synthesizer heavy score by Riz Ortolani, and solid direction for Fulci. As far as director Fulci goes, I&apos;ve never quite decided if he&apos;s an artist along the lines of Dario Argento or Mario Bava or is merely a talented gorehound like Joe D&apos;Amato or Bruno Mattei. I think I lean towards the latter, though Fulci&apos;s &quot;The Beyond&quot; is pretty great, but it&apos;s still no &quot;Deep Red&quot; or &quot;Suspiria.&quot; Back to &quot;The New Gladiators,&quot; the story is corny, most of the performance are goofy, the action is ham-fisted, but the film has an undeniable 80s grindhouse charm that I found irresistible. From Ortolani&apos;s rockin synthesizer score, to Fred Williamson kicking ass, to strobe light fight sequences, to some terrifically gory practical special effects, to awful laser special effects, to some wonderfully corny miniature future cityscape sets, there was a definite so-bad-it&apos;s good quality to this film that I loved, but Fulci&apos;s direction of the motorcycle sidecar action sequences are pretty lacking in comparison to George Miller or even a hacky Italian contemporary like Enzo G. Castellari. Overall, this is not a good film in the traditional sense, but if you&apos;re a fan of cheesy 80s low budget post-apocalyptic Mad Max knock-off films, it&apos;s essential viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "When I finished this film, I was sure that it ran over two and a half hours. In reality, it was only 125 minutes.  That reveals something about the pace.  If you can imagine a worm burrowing through granite, you have the idea.\n\nActually, the story was a good one.  The problem was the screenplay and the direction.  This is a story of Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver) a city girl who has moved to the country so her husband could try his hand at farming. However, this is no Green Acres.  Alice is having difficulty coping with country life and her relationship with her two children.  One day she is minding a friend&apos;s children and leaves them playing with her own children momentarily to put on her bathing suit.  Upon returning, she discovers one of her friend&apos;s little girls missing and after a desperate search finds her face down in the pond.  Subsequent to this tragic accident, Alice is accused of child abuse by another child who claims she molested him in her duties as school nurse.  The two incidents together turn the whole town ugly as they assume she must be guilty.  The story is an in-depth character study of Alice and her struggle to cope with both her guilt and innocence.  The guilt is her feeling of responsibility for the little girl&apos;s drowning and the innocence is the knowledge that she is not a child abuser.\n\nUsually I enjoy complex character studies with deep conflicting emotions, but this one left me exhausted.  This is not because of the story, but because of the script and the presentation by Director Scott Elliot.  Far too much time was spent on scenes that weren&apos;t really interesting or relevant.  The dialogue often seemed inconsistent with the characters, especially in Howard&apos;s (David Straithairn) case.  The lawyer was made to look like a buffoon.  Having seen Arliss Howard in a number of other films, I know he is a capable dramatic actor so I have to assume this was the director&apos;s interpretation of the character.  \n\nSigourney Weaver has received much critical acclaim for this performance, but I found it to be somewhat uneven.  She was superb in parts, especially the parts where she was playing the strong woman trying to hold it all together.  However, she seemed to struggle with the vulnerable parts, as if she wasn&apos;t comfortable with the character.  I realize that part of the point was that Alice wasn&apos;t comfortable in her own skin and used a lot of defense mechanisms to cope, but Weaver seemed unnatural and forced in these scenes. She seems to have a lot tougher time playing weakness than strength.  In that regard, Julianne Moore&apos;s performance was much better.  Her breakdown scene in the woods was compelling and heartrending.\n\nDavid Straithairn was well cast as the self-sacrificing and supportive husband, a role with which he is well familiar.  However, he too seemed uncharacteristically tentative.  When veteran actors have so much trouble giving confident performances, one has to wonder if there was a disconnect between the actors and the first time director.\n\nOverall, despite some good performances and a solid story, the whole project just didn&apos;t come together and dragged ponderously from scene to scene.  I rated it a 6/10.  For patient viewers only.",

To say The Legacy is uneven is putting it mildly, no two characters appear to realise they&apos;re in the same film. Shove them all in a grand old mansion in the English countryside, add a touch of supernatural hokum, some surprisingly inventive death scenes, a whole lot of messing around doing nothing, the most pointless random car drive scene in movie history, a cat which has more screen time than half the cast yet has no reason to be involved in the film, and enjoy - but not that much because it drags after an hour or so.",

From Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates in Psycho to Colin Firth as Adrian Leduc in Apartment Zero, darkness and a fragility that is part of the unbearable suspense. Maybe I&apos;m in need of professional attention but I don&apos;t think so. What attracts me is by the undeniable innocence behind the horror and that has a lot, if not everything, to do with the actors playing them. Look at Anthony Perkins in Psycho! 57 years ago and it still looks and feels kind of revolutionary or Colin Firth in Apartment Zero, the character is so unique and real that you can see it a thousand times and always find some new extra something, then Dean Stockwell in Compulsion. He plays a monster, a sick, pathetic prince of a man. Yes all of that. The humanity of the actor makes the monster human and we can&apos;t dismiss him, he doesn&apos;t allow us. Orson Welles has a great entrance into the film and E.G Marshall is superb as per usual, it is the rest of the cast who seem a bit dated, specially when sharing the frame with the extraordinary Dean Stockwell",

The first part goes into broad comedy, with the parents scheming to find ways to get their son to leave the nest. This film is just as much about the parents--even more--than the son.\n\ni noticed that someone else commented about the Asian aspects of the film. At first, it really doesn&apos;t make sense, except to show Tanguy&apos;s fascination with the country, and almost as a goal (for the parents)--have him go to Peking as soon as possible. By the end, it&apos;s wonderful because there is a subtle comparison (that the audience must make) about the family situation. That is--the Chinese filial responsibility, love, and respect--and yes, there were three generations living under one roof. And in the Guetz household--all three generations have, at one point or another, lived under the same roof. That&apos;s just one way of looking at it. If you see it and go in with that idea of comparing cultural aspects of families, then maybe that would make better sense."

I can understand why some may not, since it has a sort of anti-ending and very little actual &apos;plot.&apos;  The film is simply the portrayal of daily life for a London family--a collection of character subplots, basically.  \n\nIt doesn&apos;t sound like much, but the film&apos;s strength is its characters. Besides the main little boy, there&apos;s the overzealous father, the sexually-liberated teenage sister, a hilarious grandpa, a gang of far-from-innocent little boys, and others.\n\nOverall, watching this movie is like stepping back in time and sneaking a peek into everyday life.",

It&apos;s fun to watch even though it&apos;s more ripoff than creative and not as good as his classic spoof &quot;A Clockwork Orgy&quot;.\n\nMelissa Hill won an award in her well-performed lead role, with Kaitlyn Ashley quite sexy as her daughter (not the son role of the original). Terminators Alberto Rey (the good one) and Jonathan Morgan (the bad one) are fine in wooden Schwarzegger fashion, while Lovette is a very sexy MILF of a guard at the insane asylum where Hill is incarcerated. SPFX for Morgan transforming into Lovette&apos;s form for an exotic 3-way with 2 studs makes the usual sex-with-a-robot action kinkier than expected.\n\nNic tips the balance to sex over action scenes and the final reel is nearly all-sex, but there&apos;s enough patina of sci-fi to save this from degenerating into mere gonzo content. His illusion of production value is convincing, without the subsequent actual big budgets of such projects by his genre successor Brad Armstrong."

      "reviewBody": "MORD39 RATING:  *** out of ****\n\nI have always loved this strange little film, even as a kid. Bela Lugosi has one of his greatest roles as the insane Dr. Vollin, a part which ranks right up there with Dracula and Ygor. It&apos;s also one of those rare times where he actually upstages Boris Karloff.\n\nAt only 60 or so minutes, the 1935 version of THE RAVEN is brisk entertainment with all the golden elements of a fine horror movie: a crazed doctor, his misshapen assistant (Karloff), secret rooms and lots of thunder and lightning. There are trap doors, a creepy dungeon, and a torture chamber. This film doesn&apos;t pretend to be profound or a literary rendition of Poe&apos;s works... it&apos;s just Bela and Boris - the two greatest horror stars of all time - doing what they do best. \n\nThe comedy in the film is rare, and doesn&apos;t detract from it. The main issue at hand is Dr. Vollin&apos;s jealous need for revenge to satisfy his own tortured soul...by inflicting horror on those he feels have caused his misery. The moment where Bela blackmails Karloff and cackles maniacally has no equal.\n\nA perfect companion to THE BLACK CAT, it&apos;s not cinematically as good, but I have always had much more fun with it. Highly recommended for fans of &quot;classic&quot; horror!"

When I saw it at an Italian film class in the late 90&apos;s not even the professor had actually seen it - ( though I had).\n\nRescreening this 1976 film in today&apos;s political/terror climate gives this film even more resonance. \n\nLino Ventura is the moral center of this unblinking look at Italian politics. He has the kind of &quot;gravitas&quot; of Bogart at his best. If you have any way of seeing this film, you won&apos;t be sorry.\n\nIf you enjoy it, check out Rosi&apos;s &quot;Tre Fratelli&quot; and Ricky Tognazzi&apos;s &quot;L&apos;Escorta&quot; with similar subject matter.\n\nFYI, Rosi (Dir) was an assistant to Visconti.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember seeing this cartoon when it was syndicated on Disney Channel (back when that channel showed only old stuff instead of the overload of pre-teen comedies and the usual DCOMs they are known for today). But seeing this as an adult, this has to be the worst My Little Pony incarnation ever. One of the reasons is that some of the episodes are really mean-spirited and sometimes teach the target audience horrible morals (one episode, Shop Talk, is about Teddy getting bullied because Patch spreads a rumor he sleeps with a teddy bear. leading to a scene where Ace and Lancer are forced to stop when an embarrassing picture is taken of them dressed as babies, which constitutes blackmail). Also, the ponies are basically stereotypes, and while other MLP cartoons can have those, this show seems to have the worst of the lot. The main ponies are basically young teenage girls, while three males are there to sometimes serve as bullies. This series is not recommended for young children.",

Unlike the first movie, Jason stars in this movie while his &quot;mother&quot; has the cameo. The gore and the kill scenes surpass the original. The characters are true teenage stereotypes. Much like the ending in the original, the ending here is great. A jump out of your seat moment that lives up to the original. This is way before Jason wears his hockey mask. Here we are witnessed to a masked killer that uses a pillow case to hide his scary identity. From here on, the fame of PART 2 made it possible for the next bunch of films to happen. It is pretty much all down hill from here. While some of those films lived up to being great horror movies, most fell short and could not recycle the same effect that PART 2 had on its audience.",

Or was it a detective story, a thriller, or something altogether different? The answer, I think, is that it is all of those things.\n\nThe film begins with a series of mysterious and shocking events in a cabin in the forest, and much like a spider&apos;s web, returns to this place quite often in an attempt to unravel its secrets.\n\nSpider Forest manages to avoid most of the modern horror/suspense/thriller conventions, including scary pale children and does not rely on special effects to set the mood. Instead, the psychological predicament of the main character creates an atmosphere of blurred confusion and distrust of one&apos;s own memory.\n\nThe story is entirely unique and never quite goes in the direction the audience is expecting.\n\nI give a confident recommendation to see this film.",

      "reviewBody": "A &apos;Lifer&apos; Helen Slater fan, I recently took in a viewing of this for the first time in about 15 years. It&apos;s nowhere near as dreadfully bad as I remembered, but it&apos;s still not that great either. Of course none of this is in any way directed, I feel, at the Super star in question. It&apos;s all on account of the technicalities. For a &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; style thriller in the 1990s, it&apos;s a good, intriguing script. Young mother, with a child in tow, is at the center of a dangerously deceptive plot. Who and why are to be discovered as the story unfolds.\n\nJust goes to show that pulling off Hitchcock in style, prose, writing, narrative, et al, isn&apos;t an easy task, and certainly one most directors, producers, and studios might figure to steer clear of permanently. That means from HERE ON IN. What may have looked terrific on paper hardly translated properly to the camera and screen. The editing is choppy, sloppy, clunky, and slow. Many tense moments were NOT had because of this. It&apos;s one thing to draw a good moment tense or otherwise, out with bypassing the option to implement punch ins, hand held camera takes, and other stylistic tropes with which this industry has become accustomed. Director Strathford Hamilton delivers confident shot compositions and an eerie delusional breakdown moment from the fabulous star, but fails to capture any tension with the story or any of the other cast members, save for Harvey Korman.\n\nAs another review mentioned, this is a laughably miscast roster. Slater and Korman are the only properly cast players, whilst Alan Thicke, Kelly LeBrock, and Billy Zane have the look and the potential, it&apos;s never reached. It&apos;s grinding teeth watching them, despite some moments with stamina and nuance. Still, even those moments are where we see this needed improvement, and could have been better with different casting and directing.\n\nAnother fail is the done-to-death suspense &quot;bomb-under-the-table&quot; approach. Another trope made most famously by that &apos;ol maestro, Hitchcock. Perhaps former actor-turned writer Robby Benson and his wife would have fared better with script doctors. Maybe the budget wouldn&apos;t cover it. In any case, the lack of tension and suspense ultimate tank what could have been a motion picture experience. The end titles read &quot;Dolby Stereo in Selected Theaters&quot;. Really? Because I don&apos;t remember this being released theatrically. Wish it was, if only because Helen Slater (Toldja I was a long time fan) gets to have some fun with this role. Sadly, she and Harvey, who have great chemistry together, haven&apos;t anything to react off of, making this absolutely bland.\n\nThe film makes excellent use of betrayal, sure, but what of the viewers and the professionals who put much time into this project? It&apos;s sloppiness surely must have cost it a prime theatrical run. Lots of potential there and it&apos;s just a product, slid onto the Movie Time video shelves. That&apos;s the ultimate betrayal right there. We are the ultimate victim when we invest our own time and money into these films, with which we get nothing. Okay, that&apos;s not true. As I said, Helen Slater delivers a bright, focused, fully developed character and performance. BUT...in all consideration, &apos;Betrayal of the Dove&apos; might just work better as an industrial reference to bad films. Maybe...",

The VHS version is 62 minutes long, transferred from a French print; the original 1927 version was 85 minutes.  John Gilbert plays a bootlegger who kidnaps Joan Crawford and her fiance on his boat and eventually the two fall in love with each other, but things happen that cause a rift in their relationship. It is interesting to see a very young Crawford in a small role and her presence is what makes the film interesting, but in general it is a strange and muddled story, likely due to the fact that important pieces are missing. Again, only valuable for film history reasons, due to the fact that the original film no longer exists.  2 1/2 out of 4 for this one."

Although there are details regarding the various stages of such a tedious process, I found the little interactions between them to be most interesting. It was beautifully filmed and gave insight to some subtle nuances of Japanese culture, family, and the struggles that some of them experience outside of the tough working conditions. The unique personalities of each individual that became apparent through watching them interact was so fascinating and was my favorite part of this film!",

It raises a number of very interesting questions...\n\nPlenty of eye candy in every form, the two leads, the scenery, explosions, action sequences, the cinematography, everything you would expect from Michael Bay and Co. \n\nThe pacing to begin with is somewhat slow as the premise is set up (though disappointingly the trailers give it all away), but once it launches into the first action sequence it doesn&apos;t let up for some time. Yes the story has a number of plot holes but you can easily overlook them and get swept away in the fun. I&apos;ve never seen Johansson on film until now and WOW, now I know what all the fuss is about. Her and McGregor display enough chemistry to make their relationship believable but only just. I&apos;m sure this will only propel them onto bigger and better things.\n\nMy one and only gripe was with the ending scene complete with cheesy choral accompaniment - blech! Maybe Bay just couldn&apos;t help himself. I suppose no film is perfect..\n\n7 out of 10, solid, fun entertainment, what more can you ask for?",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this under the title Dating Santa. Between the title and the actors and settings, it appears to be a foreign (to USA) film. I even wondered if the actors filmed the movie in Spanish and then used English voice overs, but the lips appear to be in sync with the words mostly in English. The closed caption, however, had a lot of discrepancies.\n\nIn the beginning of this movie, I thought it was going to be great. The lead, Lucia, is very appealing, at least at first. The two lead actors have great chemistry and the dialog is lively. At first, the daughter, Leo, looks like she is going to be a cutie. Mom is able to stay out all night on a date and greats her daughter amicably upon waking. Clearly the plot is going to be more than so many other Christmas movies.\n\nThen it crashes and burns, all because of that little cutie. It is not unusual for a single mom to be especially doting with her little girl. It is not surprising if she is a little spoiled and tyrannical. But when Leo meets the boyfriend, she throws an absolute tantrum and Lucia caves completely, willing to give the child anything she wants. This, of course, is how the movie sets up the need for Sergio to impersonate Santa. I just wish it had been done without making Leo such a spoiled brat. Also, it almost seems that the mom and child are more in sync than the romantic leads.\n\nThese things smooth out as the movie goes on and it becomes a comedy about the ruse to make Sergio into Santa and the place they are visiting into the North Pole. Leo remains a bit manipulative but not as tyrannical as she was.\n\nIf Leo doesn&apos;t turn you off, this could be a fun movie. If she does turn you off, it does get better, but leaving a little sour taste behind.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Saam gaang yi&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;3 Extremes&quot;, is composed of three segments\n\n(1) &quot;Dumplings&quot;, by Fruit Chan, is the best segment. I saw the complete film (&quot;Jiao Zi&quot;) on 25 August 2007 on DVD released in Brazil with the title &quot;Escravas da Vaidade&quot; (&quot;Slaves of the Vanity&quot;). The gruesome tale tells the story of an aging actress that seeks out a mysterious woman that cooks dumplings with a special ingredient that rejuvenates those who eat them. My review is available in http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472458/reviews-21\n\n(2) &quot;Cut&quot;, by Chan-wook Park, is a tale of cruelty and insanity. An insane stranger breaks in the house of a film director and ties him up with his wife and a boy in the room. The strange tries to force the director to kill the boy, otherwise he will cut the fingers of his wife that is a pianist.\n\nThis segment is very cruel and insane, and has a surprising conclusion.\n\n(3) &quot;Box&quot;, by Takashi Miike, is a confused tale. The twenty-five-year- old writer Kyoko has nightmares with a box and also with her sister Shoko. One day, she receives an invitation to visit the place where she saw her sister for the last time.\n\nThis segment is messy and predictable, with a disappointing conclusion. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock did one hell of a job!  I was planning on watching this movie just for about 30 minutes before going to sleep and was gonna finish watching it the next day, but instead I was so engaged that I couldn&apos;t stop watching and stayed awake the whole 2 hours.  I loved the irony of the actual rapist having no clues pointing to him and the innocent man having all clues pointing to him.  The scene involving the rapist in the back of the truck, rummaging through a sack of potatoes (and that&apos;s all I&apos;ll reveal) is classic suspense.  I also loved how Hitchcock left the rape scenes (excluding the first one) up to the imagination.  There is a great shot where one of the victims is being raped and we don&apos;t even hear any off-screen yells or screams.  The camera simply tracks backwards down a staircase and out the front door, where people walk by minding their own business, ignorant to the evil that&apos;s being committed a floor above.  Any amateurish director would&apos;ve went for true shock value and showed all the rape scenes in explicit detail. We don&apos;t call Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.  The scene is still quite haunting.  In horror and suspense, what you don&apos;t see can be a lot more frightening than what you do see, since the imagination is a powerful thing.  The last line of the movie should go down in history.  It had me bawling with laughter!  Just that one line gave perfect closure to this wonderful film.    \n\nMy score:  8 (out of 10)",

And, this universality of the story make this an exceptional war film.\n\nWhen the story begins, some American soldiers are loading trucks with airplane fuel which will soon be transported to the front. However, during this process, a North Korean plane attacks...killing one of the men. The plane soon crashes and a lone man bails out of the craft. Now when the surviving three American soldiers enter the ship, they have a prisoner.\n\nOnce aboard the ship, the men contact headquarters and are told that they were NOT to bring the prisoner in with them. In other words, they were to kill him! This is clearly a war crime...and is against the articles of war. The sergeant (Kirk Douglas) clearly seems to LIKE this order...one of the men, one of the privates (Robert Walker Jr.) thinks the order is monstrous and refuses to do it. The sergeant takes delight in goading this private but despite this, he will NOT kill the man. So, the sadistic sergeant then tries to get the other private to do it...\n\nThe story is a great look at human nature...the good as well as the bad. And, it reminds us that the German soldiers of WWII were not the only ones who murdered and chalked it all up to &apos;just following orders&apos;. A very strong film whose only shortcoming is its pacing (it could have been shortened a bit and that would have made a stronger picture).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Our Little Sister&quot; is a simple, beautiful little film. It focuses on a small scale - a bunch of sisters who decide to start caring for their little half-sister after meeting her at their father&apos;s funeral - but the characters are universally relatable. It deals with themes of family, love, childhood, dealing with change, and human connection. If anything, this is a very human film.\n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous, but subtle and subdued. The film goes along with a slow pace, but this helps it focus on the great beauty of the small moments in everyday life. Although the slow pace of the film make take some time to get into, all the characters feel lovable but flawed by the end. All of the performances, including child actors, are spot on. The slow build up has major payoff because the sentimentality of the film doesn&apos;t feel forced or exaggerated. These emotional moments are played pretty straight, and they all work immensely well.\n\nThe film is simultaneously a coming of age story for the youngest sister, Suzu, and the oldest, Sachi, although it focuses on each character enough to feel emotionally attached to each one. Even most side characters are given a good degree of depth.\n\nThis is a beautiful family film that doesn&apos;t just focus on the effect of family, but finding your own family. It&apos;s about solidarity with the people one loves despite everything that each person has gone through (or is going through).",

      "reviewBody": "The real star of this drama is the story, and the script. Costner&apos;s portrayal of a highly complex, sometimes tortured, character is superb in that he is seemingly always in control, always one step ahead of the challenges. One of the best stories in some time, this one covers all of the bases in a satisfying way, keeping the viewer completely involved from start to finish. There are just enough plot twists, blended seamlessly with just the right amount of predictability, to make this story completely believable, and totally satisfying.\n\nMr. Brooks, Mr. Citizen, is a soft spoken, highly intelligent man of the community, always in control of his job and family, despite the adversities he faces throughout the movie. Very enjoyable is the intricacy, detail, and discipline he is able to maintain throughout the chaos that befalls him throughout the entire plot. His total control of all of the challenges almost makes him a super hero in terms of skill and control in the performance of his self assigned, gruesome tasks at hand. The blending of his alter-ego, bad conscience side, Marshall, is seamlessly accomplished in this psychological escapade, to the point that one almost has to root for &quot;them&quot;. Marshall, although the psychopathic side of Brooks, is almost likable, in a twisted sort of way. The ongoing dialog between the two is perfect, in that almost everyone can relate to conscience issues at some point in their lives.\n\nThe added sub-plots concerning detective Demi Moore, the would be wanna be killer Mr. Smith, and the ex-gold digging husband and his attorney, are extra, intriguing elements that are very well done. Though told with a considerable dark tonality because of the theme, one finds himself cheering for Mr. Brooks and his incredible ability as a master craftsman. Ironically, one can also cheer for the detective that is out to capture him.\n\nIf you are ready for a story that is intriguing, suspenseful, gripping, and present day, then this movie is a good place to start. Costner, Moore, Cook, and Hurt are all splendid. Each one is intense, tormented, fun, and believable in his respective role. Another positive feature about the storyline, and it&apos;s conclusion, is that it lends itself to, perhaps, a very interesting sequel potential. Kudos to the directors, producers, and entire cast.",

      "reviewBody": "The dream imagery and music, as well the development of Sailormoon&apos;s character and her relationship with Chibimoon, are the strong points of this film.\n\nThe final theatrical Sailor Moon film based off the original anime, the movie was produced during the run of Sailor Moon SuperS which adapted the Dream arc of the manga. The movie with its emphasis on dreams and Pied Piper of Hamlin by way of Hansel and Gretel narrative falls well in line with the established tone and aesthetic that characterized the arc run at the time. Fan reaction is pretty divided on SuperS because of its focus on the equally divisive Chibi-Usa, but I personally don&apos;t mind the arc. Admittedly the biggest drag on SuperS is the fact it&apos;s burdened with following in the steps of S that adapted arguably the strongest most &quot;stakey&quot; arc with the Death Busters, and following that very strong and often dark arc with an arc based around circus iconography and dreams was always going to pale in comparison. While Chibi-Usa was very grating in Sailor Moon R and her inclusion as Sailor Chibi-Moon in Sailor Moon S was often used as a running gag in how &quot;stupid&quot; the show seemed to think Sailor Chibi-Moon was as a concept. Sailor Moon SuperS for all you can criticize about it at least tried to build Chibi-Usa as a character which I personally felt was more successful than not (though your mileage may vary). Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie on the other hand not only feels like an abridged version of many of the elements seen in the SuperS arc of the anime, but it&apos;s also lacking in an emotional core like Sailor Moon S: The Movie managed to establish, and feels like there&apos;s too much in too little time.\n\n💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯",

      "reviewBody": "These German Krimi movies, based on the stories of Edgar Wallace, are by definition infamous for their convoluted and hectic screenplays, but with its numerous twists and turns &quot;The Devil&apos;s Daffodil&quot; truly is the cinematic equivalent of a pretzel! You won&apos;t hear me say this is the greatest movie ever made, but there is plenty of exiting stuff going on and you won&apos;t get bored for a second. The film literally opens with a double bang, namely the vicious murder of an exotic dancer in her dressing room and the explosion of a discovered drug cargo in the customs&apos; office. The two events are undoubtedly related, since the drugs were hidden in the stems of daffodils and the killer threw a handful of flowers on victim&apos;s body; - also daffodils. The murder streak continues, with daffodil-covered corpses popping up all over London, and Scotland Yard teams up with an odd Chinese super-detective. Excellent cast, with Krimi-regulars Joachim Fuchsberger and Klaus Kinski, and the unsurpassable Christopher Lee depicting yet another Oriental character (what he also did in &quot;Terror of the Tongs&quot; and a handful of &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; movies). There&apos;s much less sinister atmosphere than in other Krimi movies I recently watched, but the pacing is good and there are gruesome &amp; inventive death sequences. The mandatory comic relief is also missing here, unless you consider Lee&apos;s recurring line &quot;There&apos;s an old Chinese saying...&quot; as comical.",

      "reviewBody": "In London, sexy blonde American chorus girl Jean Harlow (as Suzy Trent) has trouble finding work and paying the rent. Producers balk when Ms. Harlow refuses to trade sexual favors. Hoping to change her fortunes, Harlow resolves to marry a wealthy Count and walks into a moving Rolls Royce. Charming Irish inhabitant Franchot Tone (as Terry Moore) turns out not to be the vehicle&apos;s owner, but offers Harlow a place to live, with no strings attached. He&apos;s a promising inventor and seems devoted, so they tie the knot. Neither know it, but Mr. Tone&apos;s workplace (&quot;Schmidt &amp; Co&quot;) is, apparently, a front for German spies. After a frightening incident, Harlow relocates to Paris. The Great War (WW I) breaks out and French playboy pilot Cary Grant (as Andre Charville) joins the cast...\n\nThere is more care in having Harlow look attractive than authentically from the year 1914, and the automobile she walks into looks like a 1930s model. You&apos;ll also have to check your brain at the door a couple of times during the plot. Harlow gets two A-list leading men, as well as good support from stalwart Lewis Stone and duplicitous Benita Hume. The dubbed song &quot;Did I Remember?&quot; became a contemporary hit. Recalling her memorable &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933) exchange with Marie Dressler, Harlow is given the comic line, &quot;Been reading a book,&quot; and disrobes early in the running time. Reportedly, the popular box office star wanted to move away from the sexpot roles and &quot;Suzy&quot; appears to be a compromise. Harlow is so vivacious and appealing in this neatly-produced melodrama; it&apos;s difficult to believe she would soon pass away, from kidney disease. MGM and director George Fitzmaurice showcase their star well.\n\n****** Suzy (6/26/36) George Fitzmaurice ~ Jean Harlow, Franchot Tone, Cary Grant, Lewis Stone",

      "reviewBody": "After the huge success of the first Faces of Death film in 1978, John Alan Schwartz wasn&apos;t going to turn down the opportunity to capitalise on audience&apos;s unquenchable thirst for death and returned to the &apos;director&apos;s&apos; chair in 1981 to make another collection of grisly events. Michael Carr returns once again as our host Dr. Francis B. Gross, this time sporting a shirt and jeans combination, rather than his doctor&apos;s jacket (he was fooling nobody). We have more animal slaughter, decomposing bodies, shoot-outs and executions, as well as a large focus on stunt accidents, a fatal boxing match, animal experimentation, and the aftermath of an avalanche.\n\nWhile the first entry was mainly a collection of badly-filmed and thoroughly unconvincing staged scenes, the sequel has much more real footage, and only the police shoot-out scene, where director Schwartz plays one of the criminals and proves himself to be as useless at acting as he is at directing, is seemingly faked. While the staged scenes was the main factor I criticised from the first film, the distinct lack of them takes the (should I say it?) charm out of the film. The clips are simply thrown in together, lacking the first&apos;s narrative structure, taking whatever &apos;meaning&apos; the FOD series tries to convince us it has and coming across as simply low-rent exploitation.\n\nOne of the longest scenes focuses on the boxing match between Welsh Bantamweight boxer Johnny Owen being knocked into a coma by Mexican champion Lupe Pintor. Gross&apos; narration fails to really acknowledge Owen as anything other than a face of death, but knowing that Owen&apos;s statue stands in Merthyr Tydfil not far from where I live where he is fondly remembered (the statue was unveiled by Pintor), it hammers home how bad taste this film really is. So, certainly not as &apos;good&apos; (I&apos;ve never used so many inverted commas) as the first, which at least provided some unintentional laughs, but this series will still remain a curiosity to me, and will no doubt reluctantly seek out the rest of the series in time.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

The range of characters run from flashy queens all the way to uptight New Englanders who don&apos;t do anything about their sexuality but talk about it. The bar is owned by a woman who presides like a mother at a party; her staff is mostly middle-aged men who go home to their wives. There&apos;s an undercurrent of sadness under the almost hysterical holiday partying. Like many of the cheap movies of the era -- of any era, really -- the cast includes actors years after their cinematic prime, like Carleton Carpenter, the current stars of queer cinema, like Candy Darling, and performers before they became well known, like Fannie Flagg, Gil Gerard, and Rue McClanahan.\n\nIn the end, Christmas Eve is no time to be alone, and these people are more alone than most.",

      "reviewBody": "The subject of this U.S. documentary is Vito Russo, a gay activist in the early days of gay liberation and an AIDS activist in the 1980s shortly before his death in 1990. He was also a film lover and had written &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; which exposed how early film-makers in Hollywood were restricted from being direct about gay characters in their films.\n\nThis film is superb in many ways - not only for the fascinating subject but mostly for the amazing film footage and photos used throughout. Interviews with those who knew him were also very moving. Some of the best excerpts included those of my favourite performer Lily Tomlin. They included her comedy sketches and interviews with her as she was a great friend and collaborator of Russo.\n\nAlthough the 60s, 70s, and 80s were a very volatile and difficult period in different ways, this era is also one of the most fascinating times in recent history. The film &quot;Vito&quot; does this era justice by not just exposing it but evoking the feisty spirit as well.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nNotable Achievement: Film Footage Collection",

Every night for months after seeing the film, I made certain my bedroom curtains were securely drawn. I just knew that the alien was out there looking into my window at me.\n\nBy todays standards, the special effects were really Mickey Mouse. Perhaps a remake of this film will happen some day. If so, I will be first in line to see it. This time I will not worry about my bedroom curtains."

It&apos;s much slower in pace, has less action, and has far more talking. Also, the way it&apos;s directed lacks any flashy style, though it picks some atypical locations in the Spanish desert to shoot on. But for the most part, the movie just plods along slowly with not very many surprises. I think that&apos;s because there was more of a Spanish influence on the movie than Italian; the Italians were much better at making lively Euro westerns. Anyway, there&apos;s not much to recommend in this movie unless you have great interest in seeing a Euro western that was made in a more conventional style before Leone came along and really shook the genre up.",

Guess if he&apos;ll drop right before her feet and she&apos;ll think it&apos;s so cute.\n\nThe problem is, Christian is a kind of dreamer, dealing with antiques and old documents, while his wife inherits her fathers software company on their wedding day and has to do all the things a 16-hour-work-day-power-woman is supposed to do: answering the phone in every imaginable situation, cancelling dates because of business appointments, and fiddling with her computer while he tries to talk to her seriously.\n\nYou know the scene in some movies where people are watching something lame on TV and predict the lines the characters will say, and the characters on screen actually say it? That&apos;s what I did. Please, dear screenwriter, don&apos;t let them say this ridiculous phrase now, and bang!, it happens.

This is a great piece of visualization of the culture of 18th-century Enlightenment (did you notice that the bad guys all wore uniforms from the Napoleonic age - as a sign of when this great period of human cultural achievement finished?). It is a movie in which the sets and costumes are THE ESSENCE - the mechanical giant fish, Venus getting out of the pearl, the small amours with the pink garlands, the pinkish clouds, the two-dimensional buildings on the Moon, the separation of the head from the body, the exoticising of the &quot;Grand Turk&quot; - these are all correct reproductions of both the imagery from, and the topics relevant for, the Baroque period.

      "reviewBody": "South Korea&apos;s answer to TOP GUN (1986) -- SOAR INTO THE SUN (a.k.a. R2B: RETURN TO BASE) is a big-budget blockbuster tries to replicate the Hollywood-style of filmmaking mostly found in any summer movie tentpole. It certainly has that showy and expensive look, particularly for its many impressive aerial stunts (more on that later). But writer-director Kim Dong-Won botches everything up with too many cheesy melodrama and mawkish sentimentality borderlined into self-parody. No wonder the movie ends up underperformed at the domestic box-office.\n\nIn this embarrassingly lackluster movie, the story centers on Jang Tae-Hun (Rain), a cocky young pilot of the South Korean Air Force&apos;s elite Black Eagles squad who gets expelled of the team, following from his dangerous daredevil stunt at an air show. As a punishment, he is immediately transferred to the 21 Combat Unit, which is led by Park Dae-Seo (Kim Sung-Su). Meanwhile, it doesn&apos;t take long before he makes enemy with an ace pilot Lee Cheol-Hee (Yu Jun-Sang), who particularly hate each other. Naturally, they prepare to engage in a flight contest to see which among of them emerge as the best pilot in the 21 Combat Unit. Of course, such genre movie like that wouldn&apos;t be complete without an obligatory love interest. Enter Sgt. Yoo Se-Young (Shin Se-Kyung), a failed pilot-turned-head of maintenance who loves to act cool and doesn&apos;t particularly talks much, even though Tae-Hun likes her very much.\n\nClocking at 113 minutes, I must admit that watching SOAR INTO THE SUN is seriously a test of patience. The first half is especially a huge letdown, in which the story drags too much that goes into nowhere. Most of the time we are forced to sit through a long-winded stretch of some lame romantic comedy (particularly the one involving Tae-Hun and Se-Young) found in Korean TV drama, and not to mention, many other annoying subplots. If Kim Dong-Won is trying hard to be funny, then he fails miserably. Even by the time the movie reaches the second half with a sudden change of dramatic tone, it&apos;s already too late and too little to redeem everything.\n\nStill, those are looking forward for some sensory thrills will be excited by the aforementioned aerial stunts. The two climactic highlights -- the aerial battle within the city of Seoul and the explosive finale -- are undeniably breathtaking with swooping cameraworks and magnificent sound effects that they are best seen in a big screen theaters.\n\nToo bad that&apos;s the only good thing about this movie. The rest is simply a monumental waste of time. If that&apos;s not insulting enough, the cast is a total disappointment who are all nothing more than one-note stereotypical characters. Rain, who completed this movie before heading off for his obligatory national service, gives an unremarkable performance who spends most of the time looking too cheesy or (ahem) cutesy. Sure, he does show some &quot;seriousness&quot; towards the second half, but by then, it&apos;s really hard to take him seriously. As for the rest of the supporting actors, the less said the better.\n\nSo much for a so-called movie specially released in remembrance of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.",

Neill would go on to be one of those few actors with such a range that he can convincingly play the hero to literally the devil incarnate.\n\nNeill has some ear popping monologues with a statue of Jesus. It&apos;s so obnoxious that I&apos;m half amazed it wasn&apos;t cut. It all strikes me as rather career threatening for an actor and I wonder if any American actor would have done it.\n\nBut those scenes do help give this movie a bit of depth.\n\nThe first Omen was great because the Thorns weren&apos;t sure if crazy supernatural things were occurring, or if they were just crazy. Unfortunately, this one, like Omen II mostly boil down to crazy death scenes.\n\nThere&apos;s one major annoyance here... why does Damien believe the second coming will be a child*? He literally reads from the Bible. And the producers were well aware that was wrong, considering the display the relevant passages of the Bible.\n\nIt&apos;s certainly not terrible, and has some effective horror scenes. Looked at simply as a horror movie, it&apos;s kind of an oddball, but it works. But considering the seemingly end of time apocalyptic stakes, not to mention closure of the three movie arc, it&apos;s lacking, and the world surrounding Damien seems surprisingly small.\n\n* I think the reason Damien decides to kill babies is obvious: the production wanted to do the baby killing thing.",

      "reviewBody": "Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman&apos;s Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein&apos;s daughter carrying on her father&apos;s work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story is tissue-thin here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of leering and suggestive comments(surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not really much action or suspense. And while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay/Bey plays the Baron&apos;s daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. She oozes desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is pretty one-dimensional, but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated to European horror films for money, plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. He is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron&apos;s assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. As crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, policeman(I wasn&apos;t buying this)Mickey Hargitay starts to pump Tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances, and lackluster direction all head further South. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.",

Nevertheless, I watched it to the end. Main actor did rather solid job, despite some criticism here. It looks refreshingly underplayed as opposed to regular overplay standard for this type and level of movies. Some of effects are decent (???), and story itself is not that horrible. All in all, not the worst movie(just in last few weeks I saw at least two much worse, one of them being Living hell), but not too far either.",

I would give it a 7.5. I think that the reviewers should award efforts like that, for encouraging producers/directors/writers who don&apos;t have large budget in their movies, to keep their vision up. Finally, i must confess that i wouldn&apos;t have understood the meaning of the end if i had not read the interpretation here, in movie&apos;s page in IMDb.

      "name": "Terrance Malick + Beat Takeshi",
      "reviewBody": "If The Red Spectacles was a David Lynch film meets a George Orwell flick, then Stray Dog: Kerberos Panzer Cop is a Terrance Malick meets Beat Takeshi film.\n\nWhile this might sound like some kind of glowing praise for both films, I have to say that the description and cover art for both films are terribly misleading. The &quot;sci-fi&quot; tag is more of a fleeting descriptor than anything, as there is little to no science fiction elements involved, save for the over-arching theme involving the Kerberos squad, whom only have the briefest of appearances at the very beginning of the film.\n\nSomeone compared this to Takeshi&apos;s Sonatine, and I think that&apos;s a very fair comparison. Only, it&apos;s far less somber, a lot more goofy in parts, and -- perhaps, to an extent -- less thoughtful.\n\nUltimately, the first half is like a road trip, and majority of the second half is a slice of life vacation film. There are some great shots, and excellent use of guerrilla filmmaking as much of the scenarios throughout the film are the complete opposite of the claustrophobic and highly contained surrealist set pieces used in The Red Spectacles.\n\nHere, we get lots of wide open shots of the city, and fantastic, bustling moments throughout dense urban environments.\n\nIn many ways, Stray Dog is more of a film about a dedicated segment in the portrait of a life, rather than anything grand.\n\nAnd again, this may sound really existential and artfully encompassing, but the problem is that despite this having a much shorter runtime than The Red Spectacles, it feels so much longer, mostly because at least The Red Spectacles attempts to keep moving, even while the main character keeps getting waylaid. His setbacks and frustrations are just part of his motivation to reach some kind of resolution.\n\nHere, once the road trip aspects of the film conclude the film completely meanders, and not just meanders, but it becomes quite pointless. We have five minute segments of the characters just eating -- nothing significant really happens during this time. And there are a ton of aimless scenes that -- had they been cut -- would not have changed the overall plot of the film at all.\n\nThis is one of the biggest problems with the film. It meanders way too much. However, if you like Terrance Malick films for that exact reason, then I can easily see you taking a liking to this film.\n\nThe only reason I gave this a 5 out of 10, however, is because the ending sequence is absolutely awesome. It&apos;s one of the best filmed action scenes put to celluloid. I just wish we had a proper movie themed around that concept but in the way that Oshii envisioned it here in Stray Dog.\n\nYes, we get more of the action-oriented elements in Jin-Roh and the South Korean remake; and yes, Jin-Roh definitely captures more of the horror-elements that were briefly on display during Stray Dog&apos;s big third-act finale, but even Jin-Roh found itself being more akin to Ghost in the Shell with its existential framing rather than really indulging in the horror concepts that this property constantly puts forward through its imagery and themes.\n\nIt&apos;s a real shame, because even the masters of horror couldn&apos;t seem to really dig into the trenches of this franchise and bring out the scary prospect of an authoritarian, nearly indestructible police force used to suppress and squash. We only always get hints and glimpses of the dystopian horror that the Kerberos represent, but never the full-on thing. It&apos;s always undermined in some way.\n\nIn this case, we have a movie that spends its entire time setting up a plot point to coincide with its prequel-sequel (The Red Spectacles), while the rest of the film lingers along aimlessly for the most part. Very little dialogue is present, and what dialogue is present is mostly either difficult to parse for context unless you&apos;ve already seen The Red Spectacles, or it leaves a bit confused about the character motivations until the next act.\n\nThat&apos;s probably the biggest difference between Oshii&apos;s films and Malick and Takeshi&apos;s films; the latter two at least know how to maintain consistency and interest, even while Malick is the master of meandering. Though his films can be boring, at least there is conviction in the performances he captures, and a sense of seriousness in how he approaches the subject matter.\n\nTakeshi is one of my favorites because even in the somber and slow moments, his films are still highly thought provoking, well acted, and expertly paced. He manages to capture stillness without making it boring, and that&apos;s a real feat of an excellent auteur; something Oshii aimed for but didn&apos;t quite hit with The Red Spectacles nor Kerberos.\n\nUnless you&apos;re just absolutely fascinated with the expanded lore of the Kerberos saga, the only two films really worth watching are the original Jin-Roh from 1999 and the live-action South Korean remake. I think Jin-Roh will stick with you more because it&apos;s a lot more brutal and unwavering, but the South Korean remake has its own stylistic charms.\n\nAs for Kerberos? I really wish it was a more focused film, and that the tone and depiction of the &quot;Stray Dog&quot; at the end was made more apparent and focused throughout the rest of the film. Some day hopefully there is a proper political-thriller framed within the lens of a horror film based on the Jin-Roh concept, because I still think it could work really well that way. But until then, we&apos;ll still have these films that give us some hope for a more expanded cinematic universe based on the property.",

The start of the movie is gripping showing one of the nth attempts made to escape and the will to survive persecution.\n\nOne attempts by a their mate is partly successful and in conveying the message to Indians. But it is in vain as the Government &amp; Army cannot do anything. The son of Kaul, Akshaye Khanna, takes it upon himself to go to Pakistan and get his father back. Here&apos;s the silly part of the ease in how he enters Pakistan and goes about doing the necessary.\n\nAs a reprimand for the escape attempt the prisoners are moved to a &apos;high security&apos; prison where they mingle with other similar captives, led by Raj Zutshi. Also there is Sunjay Dutt a goon caught on the border. He somehow manages to escape and in short teams up with Khanna for the escape where he lands up back in the jail (!!).\n\nThe title &apos;Let&apos;s bring our hero&apos;s home&apos; is kind of misnomer as this is no rescue attempt (like Behind Enemy Lines, Saving Private Ryan, etc.). Couple of scenes by Kay Kay (a good playback singer  playing a Pakistani jail officer) and Akhilendra Mishra are impressive. The heroine is a waste. A couple of songs here and there. Though the escape planning, akshaye in Pakistan, and some of them are lame (compared to good Hollywood thrillers) it is a good entertainment package.",

      "reviewBody": "1968&apos;s &quot;Las Noches del Hombre Lobo&quot; (The Nights of the Werewolf) remained a frustratingly elusive title during Paul Naschy&apos;s illustrious lifetime, uncompleted, unreleased, or (most likely) never made, supposedly shot on location in Paris by director Rene Govar (his only credit), who apparently died after completion. Only the second outing for hirsute Waldemar Daninsky, who catapulted Naschy to stardom with &quot;La Marca del Hombre Lobo,&quot; and scripted by Naschy under his real name Jacinto Molina, in collaboration with director Govar and C. Bellard (like Govar, no other credits). Of the four actors listed on IMDb (Peter Beaumont, Monique Brainville, Helene Vatelle), only Beba Novak had any other credits, Naschy&apos;s own &quot;El Vertigo del Crimen,&quot; and Freddie Francis&apos; German comedy &quot;Gebissen Wird nur Nachts&quot; aka &quot;The Vampire Happening.&quot; Storywise it&apos;s a plot that Naschy would return to quite often, a mad scientist exploiting Wolf Man Waldemar for his own nefarious reasons, popping up in the next several Daninsky titles: &quot;Assignment Terror,&quot; in which Michael Rennie&apos;s Dr. Odo Warnoff is revealed to be from another planet, &quot;The Fury of the Wolf Man,&quot; making the mad scientist a beautiful woman (Perla Cristal), and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and the Werewolf,&quot; with Jack Taylor&apos;s Jekyll using his Hyde formula on the already cursed Waldemar. Considering that he repeated the same role in a dozen features, &quot;Las Noches del Hombre Lobo&quot; could very well be no great loss but coming so soon in his starring career, we can only speculate at such a late date. The third Daninsky title, &quot;Assignment Terror,&quot; threw in every conceivable monster in existence, solidifying Naschy&apos;s hold on the crown for King of Spanish horror, but it was the 4th entry, &quot;La Noche de Walpurgis&quot; aka &quot;The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman,&quot; that became an undisputed international sensation. Today it appears that the final verdict on whether this title was ever made comes up as negative, an urban myth that grew during Naschy&apos;s lifetime but proved a falsehood upon further examination."

      "reviewBody": "The movie definitely could be better, however, it could be worse as well. It seems to me that the main nuance of the picture, constraining it in a lot of aspects is it&apos;s rating, and that looks like creators were trying their best to make something good for the given auditory. So, they achived some goals - though all plots are enough predictable and silly, there are some good ideas in them which could be useful for the youngest generations as well as for the more mature ones who could once more think about such things. However, I wouldn&apos;t watch this movie again because it does not present a unique shape of visual expression and as a result doesn&apos;t differ from a large set of Russian movies I&apos;ve seen previously. Despite said upper, there were some moments which were somewhat hard to predict and match with previous experiences so it shouldn&apos;t be forgot to point that out. In conclusion, I&apos;d like to say that you should watch this movie just if you&apos;ve got a desire and possibility to watch something with your family, but not more than that - this is not intended for other purposes, which with higher quality have been served by another examples.",

Clydie (Rosanna Arquette) resists and her deputy dawg boyfriend (Edward Blatchford) is playing both sides. In comes the hard-ass to get things finished (a very young Ted Levine) and, at the same time our hero breaks out of prison and camps on her doorstep. It seems Van Damme is always either breaking out of prison or going AWOL. Relationships with her two cute kids begin and then things really heat up with mom. Boyfriend is jealous and it all comes to a head, as expected, between Van EDamme and Levine. Smaltzy ending, but great chases. fights, and lots of passion.",

      "reviewBody": "Noche de Walpurgis, Nacht der Vampire, Blood Moon, Werewolf Shadow ... the amount of alternative titles that this movie has, annoying as it may be, is a testament to it&apos;s international success.\n\nSo why is it that the world cared so much about some Spanish horror movie? Well, the fact is, it was simply better than most of what everyone else was doing at the time. But like &quot;I Was A Teenage Werewolf&quot; did in the late fifties, this movie sparked off a whole new generation of similar werewolf movies such as &quot;The Beast Must Die&quot;, which attempted to emulate it&apos;s atmosphere precisely.\n\nBut has it stood the test of time? Lead actor and writer Jacinto Molina certainly thinks so. Others are less certain. For instance, it&apos;s easy to put off by the cheesy soundtrack, complete unsuited to what the mood of the movie should be, and the script definitely has it&apos;s dull moments. There&apos;s a whole sequence towards the end of the movie, when a policeman comes to investigate the murders and seems to spend half an hour in pointless conversation with the villagers. Oh, and the &apos;romance&apos; aspect of the film feels both rushed and forced. The blood often looks fake, and the clearer the picture is, the less convinced you are by the makeup. It&apos;s one of the few movies that fails to benefit from a restored DVD version.\n\nHowever, there&apos;s still plenty of good stuff here that help it to rise above the &apos;trashy horror&apos; category for some parts at least. There&apos;s only a small amount of nudity in the film, gratuitous though it may be, and the dialogue isn&apos;t half as bad as most horror movies of this period. The historical sequences are surprisingly good, and the vampires are particularly creepy -- thanks to Molina&apos;s insistence that they should be filmed in slow motion. His performance is easily the most notable, and it&apos;s likely that if he&apos;d been given more creative control over the production of these movies, they would have been much better.\n\nAll in all, this movie may well be for genre fans only. Most will probably find it dull and dated, but at the time it was definitely something pretty special.",

      "name": "Yet another weak Stephen King film!!",
      "reviewBody": "This film reminds me of the situation surrounding the making of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The film was turned down by one studio after another as none of the studios wanted to commit to making 3 films. One of the studios actually agreed to make it, but only if the script was condensed into a single film. Thankfully the people that had the rights and were pitching the films understood that the idea of translating the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in a single film was a laughable proposition and the end result would have been a terrible film that would ultimately do no justice to the source material. They were willing to bring it down to 2 films instead of 3, but the studio wound up turning them down. \n\nThe final studio they approached was New Line and because all of the other studios had turned them down, they pitched it to New Line as a 2 film series as opposed to a trilogy. Amazingly, New Line agreed to take on the project but only if it was made as a trilogy. Clearly someone at New Line smartly recognized that Lord of the Rings was an amazing project and the only way to do it right was to make it a trilogy. And anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings trilogy understands first hand that there is just way too much material to be condensed into a single film or even 2 films. And as we all know, the films wound up being a HUGE success and made New Line billions. At last look the Trilogy had made more than 6 billion world wide. \n\nLike Lord of the Rings, The Dark Tower series is just way too big to be condensed into a single film. Any film studio that was legitimately serious about doing the Dark Tower series justice would understand that right out of the gate. The Lord of the Rings was 3 books and the running time for the extended versions of the films was 682 minutes or just over 11 hours long. .The Dark Tower series is 8 books and many of them are BIG books. Anyone who thinks that amount of material can be condensed into a single film is living in la la land. I knew going in that this was going to be a cheap attempt at making money off of Stephen Kings name and the popularity of The Dark Tower series and that&apos;s exactly what it was. The Dark Tower series is one of my all time favorite book series, as is Lord of the Rings, and this film is literally a bad joke compared to the source material. How they got Matthew McConaughey to sign on to this film when he has had such an amazing run the last 4-5 years is simply beyond my understanding. I will never understand how such an amazing writer has had so many terrible films made from his books. \n\nBottom line - this was a terrible film, one that does no justice to the source material at all. If your a fan of the Dark Tower books, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this film. Its like a bad joke of the Dark Tower universe. Everyone involved with this film should be ashamed of being a part of it. The only reason I saw it is because I have a nephew than basically begged me to take him to see it and I have to admit, part of me was curious to see just how bad it really was and in that regard it didn&apos;t disappoint. It was just as bad as I expected it to be. This is Hollywood garbage, nothing more and nothing less. Do yourself a favor and put your money elsewhere.",

It was a minimalist movie for the genre but did so much with what they had it seemed like a big budget film. The story is compelling and you actually come to feel emotions for the characters. The direction was outstanding with shots that brought you into the action while at the same time made you feel alone in the desert. Lastly the actors how this movie escaped the Academy is beyond me. Each one brought an element unique to their part of the story from Michael Shannon who was outstanding as the farmer who struggled to keep thing as sane as possible for his children and who hoped for better days with such devotion as to be palpable. To Nicholas Hoult who showed more range than any young actor has a right to. But the rest of the cast each added an element that together make this film amazing."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Cheap Detective,&quot; as others have observed, is a sendup of two of Bogart&apos;s most famous films.  The film&apos;s opening sequence sets the stage of the humor styleings which acts as both a setup and warning for the casual viewer.\n\nThe humor is smart, but almost too clever for its own good.  It&apos;s funny, but you almost have to be a Neil Simon fan (or at least in tune with his writing style) to really get the gags.  Not entirely true, because if you keep an open mind, and understand all or most of the references, you should have a good time :-)\n\nOtherwise the film might go over your head, or rather you&apos;ll understand that there&apos;s supposed to be a joke at a certain moment, but won&apos;t get the entire gist because you might be unfamiliar with the material being referenced. Hence the reason why I called the film almost too clever for its own good.\n\nIt helps to be familiar with both &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; to really get all of the &quot;in-stuff&quot; within Simon&apos;s film.  Even so there&apos;s a good amount of regular humor that should help boost the appeal to those already in the know, and at the same time salvage a film for those not.\n\nAnd yeah, Anne Margaret never looked better :-)\n\nA fairly good watch, but not for everyone."

He also goes back to unrequited love but eventually finds a love he did not know existed. The film is beautifully shot making the most of the rural surroundings and the characters are all fully rounded, so much so, that by the end of the movie you will know and care for them all. It also contains much humour and a perfectly integrated musical score. Of course it is a fantasy world where everybody cares for and accepts other people for what they are, but it is a world we should all be striving to make real.",

Her acting(Christine Taylor&apos;s) is so bad that I kept having the feeling to fast-forward the film just to see how it ended. Also the running scenes with Amy were more like a silly kind of dance. Her running scenes, along with the father-daughter&apos;s scene were the worst scenes i have ever seen on a movie(I&apos;m not kidding). Well, I guess the monster make-up wasn&apos;t so bad although it looked like they stole them from other movies(That were obviously better than this one). The best scene so far was the one where the nurses make-out(REALLY HOT), but it still doesn&apos;t make-up for watching 90 minutes more of the film. Overall, i suggest you save your time and watch any other movie."

Also fans of Lundgren who wanted a sequel to Red Scorpion, here you go.\n\nMatt Bronson 2.5/5",

She doesn&apos;t even make it off the bus before being harassed by some sleaze-ball and finds that the townsfolk don&apos;t even bother lifting a finger when the man continues to harass her in town.\n\nHer landlord seems like a sweet, if gossipy, old man. James Mason claims that his family used to be powerful in the region, but now he&apos;s reduced to just watching the world go by, even though he seems to know an awful lot about what&apos;s going on in town. It also helps that one of her fellow teachers is hunky Franco Nero, with his moustache and staring. \n\nHowever, that creep keeps annoying her and one day his corpse is found sitting on a chair in the middle of piazza with a flower in his mouth. The police of course suspect Jennifer, who is enraged by such accusations. Then again, the townsfolk have totally changed their attitude towards her, now bowing and doffing hats to her in the street. She also somehow becomes a champion of the poor folk of the town, and their political voice. What&apos;s going on? And who&apos;s killing the people who go up against her? And why the flower?\n\nNot quite a murder mystery, not quite a Eurocrime film, this is more of a strange puzzle that Jennifer O&apos;Neil has to solve as the audience watches on. It&apos;s not terribly action packed but Jennifer O&apos;Neil is pretty good as a strong woman who won&apos;t put up with anyone&apos;s crap, including Franco Nero. She switches from confused woman to a ball of female rage (and back again!) at the drop of a hat. Nero on the other hand is rather subdued, but I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s down to the character he&apos;s playing. Mason of course is great as James Mason, all hissing English charm.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed it, I&apos;m not sure others will. It&apos;s kind of lacking in action and gore, and isn&apos;t quite arty enough to be off the wall. Fans of Franco Nero&apos;s arse will be pleased to note that his arse turns up in this one. So stop asking about his arse!",

If you want to see him at his peak, this is it!! There is dancing, singing and music, music, music. The band includes some members of the Revolution and some future NPG members, but the real stand-outs are Cat, Sheila E. and Bonnie Boyer.

I watched it with no expectations and I&apos;m glad there were no reviews that could potentially put me off watching this before giving it a chance.\n\nThey matched the new family to the area, perfectly. Part of the film incorporates father and daughter bonding. There are a few chuckles along the way. It&apos;s entertaining, but stupid. Hardly anything is realistic, the graphics aren&apos;t great, but the actors played their parts, brilliantly. On a number of occasions throughout the film, the colour of the skin was mentioned and also white privilege. There was no need for it and it has no place in a film that is meant to be fun.",

What movie doesn&apos;t do that? Princess Caraboo is not a sugar-sweet and syrupy G-rated story, and those looking for fairytale family fare may be taken aback at times. \n\nI am watching the movie for the second time (had to stop part way through last night) and it seems much different this time, as I know what&apos;s going to happen. The mystery may be gone, but there&apos;s some good laughs and of course, foxiness abounds. I started the reading the book on which this is based, but didn&apos;t finish it, at least not yet. Maybe I&apos;ll pick it up again, gotta have it around here somewhere.\n\nKevin Kline does well as a butler, as does Stephen Rea as a journalist. Worth checking out, and if you like early 19th century British period pieces - well, this one is less puffy and ponderous than some.",

      "reviewBody": "WHITE FANG is an exciting adventure set in Alaska during Gold Rush . This adventure movie is set at the end 19th Century , in the Klondike region of Yukon, Canada . It has as starring the wolf-dog named White Fang , as when his master is killed by two nasties (Donald O&apos;Brien ,Luciano Rossi), then warns another prospector named Burt Halloway . After that , the dog teams up the avenger prospector (Maurizio Merli) who changes his identity with the deceased and as he seeks revenge the killer his previous partner . Meanwhile , the murdered prospector&apos;s son arrives to the small gold town named Dawson City and befriends the wolf-dog . There the little boy meets a gorgeous girl , the saloon owner( Gisela Hahan who acted in ¨They call me Trinity¨) and Burt falls in love with her . The prospector and his faithful mate , the wolf-dog, attempt to stop the evildoer, an ambitious, snarling businessman (Henry Silva replacing to John Steiner from original film ) and hoodlum( Benito Stefanelli , also master of arms and stuntman ). They&apos;re deceiving of faking manner to the prospector by means of stealing the map of the Alaskan gold mine and to profit from him .\n\nThis following to ¨Lucio Fulci&apos;s White Fang ¨(with Franco Nero , Virna Lisi and Fernando Rey ) is a tepid and light-hearted adventure about known and classic novel by Jack London. Lumpy blend of adventures, action , villainy, though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London , though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version , however remains the essential elements as the young-dog friendship , the gold rush , spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian landscapes . It&apos;s a passable sequel that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Weak screenplay from Giovanni Simonelli and Sandro Continenza who wrote in similar similar style to former movie . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Rustichelli who also composed ¨White Fang¨ . The film is rated PG-13 (Parents guide), because contains some violent scenes about killing, a cruel fighting between bear and dog and brutal biting . The motion picture is regularly directed by Tonino Ricci, a below average director who in the 90s also realized other dog-films as ¨Buck¨ with John Savage and ¨Buck and the magic bracelet ¨ with Matt McCoy . Other adaptations about Jack London classic are : ¨Call of the wild ¨ by Ken Annakin with Charlton Heston , White Fang(1991)by Randal Kleiser with Ethan Kawke as young prospector and Klaus Maria Brandauer, and The return of White Fang(1994) by Ken Olin with Scott Bairstow and once again Ethan Hawke. Rating : acceptable and passable.",

The girl gets pregnant, resulting in their early marriage.\n\nThereafter, the permanent shortage of money makes itself felt. With all pressures, complications &amp; worries that comes to it.\n\nThis film&apos;s plot was set in 1988, in the last full year of Communist East Germany -- the former DDR. Built up with good German craftmanschip, and developping in a not-too-fast, convincing way.\n\nA remarkable feature: &apos;Grüner Hochzeit&apos; opens with a scene of &apos;Sieben Sommersprossen&apos; -- director Herrmann Zschoche&apos;s most famous film from ten years earlier.\n\nZschoche characterizes GH as &apos;Sieben Sommersprossen&apos; a few years later&apos;.",

The dialogues are weak and the cliched introductory song of the hero gives you a glimpse that you are going to witness other bone crackling, goons flying in the air with just a punch and shaking the earth with their feet of the hero kind of a flick.\n\nAs far as acting is concerned Nagarjuna is a seasoned actor and he knows how to play his character and he had did pure justice with it, Anushka and Priyamani although had a strong role in the script but they did what is required from them by adding the glamour quotient, Brahmanandam is a superb talent and he will either make you smile or laugh whenever he in on screen, Pradeep Rawat had been playing such characters for long now and he has nothing new to do.\n\nThis movie is surely for the die-hard fans of Nagarjuna and if you are one of them then this is a must watch for you and if you are not then you might have seen such movies lots of time but still you might get some entertainment, can be watched once.",

While there are so many references to Scorsese that you could almost call it an homage, this French milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of Paris in such an elegant - and honest - way, that I would go so far as to call it the most relevant French film of the last 20 years. But it&apos;s also a cinematic masterpiece and great, often hilarious entertainment. Everything fits: the musical choices, the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters, the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. And, perhaps most of all, THE perfect script. \n\nAs much a realistic portrayal of a torn society as it is an artistic achievement, &apos;La Haine&apos; is essential viewing.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone familiar with the 90s output of HK based Seasonal Films (Gary Daniels&apos; BLOODMOON, American SHAOLIN, KING OF THE KICKBOXERS II) will most likely know what to expect here: excellent fights and plenty of laughs. To paraphrase a friend who also took this film in, &quot;How this 80s movie got made in the 90s is beyond me!&quot; Honestly, I have not laughed this hard while watching a film in a long time. The first 15 minutes had me going scene after scene. Nearly everything thing about SUPERFIGHTS is funny. From the male lead &quot;training&quot; while working his day job as a box boy to the hilarious stereotypes regard wrestling to the amazing theme song (&quot;Superfighter! Kick his ass!&quot;), the film is completely wrongheaded in every aspect. Well, except for one. Like every Seasonal film, the fight choreography is exceptional. Director/fight choreographer Tony Leung Siu Hung captures some great moves from martial arts veterans such as Keith Vitali, Cliff Lenderman &amp; Chuck Jeffreys along with newcomer Brandon Gaines. Gaines is extraordinarily agile, but can&apos;t act to save his life. One truly hasn&apos;t lived until you have seen Gaines run up the steps of a courthouse a la ROCKY while screaming &quot;Woo hoo!&quot; at the top of his lungs. Writer Keith W. Strandberg is also responsible for the equally hilarious NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER series, so that explains a lot. If you are a fan of high quality fights, then this is definitely recommended. However, if you are a fan of movies so funny that they will make you cry, then SUPERFIGHTS is highly recommended.",

It still contains lots of silly jokes. In my opinion, it&apos;s not as good as the first, but considering how low my hopes were for this film since the actors are older, also using a different director, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nLots of surprise collaborations such as Yung Gravy, Kai Cenat, Mark Cuban, Pete Davidson etc which made the film feel like a fever dream at some points.\n\nThe film does seem to follow a similar plot to the last one, but still retains that &quot;stupid&quot; humor while managing to be somewhat new.\n\nIf you&apos;re thinking of watching this film without watching the other, don&apos;t bother. Watch the first film, then this or you probably won&apos;t get it. This film is not to stand out or make any marks, it&apos;s simply for the fans.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a high school history teacher, and I use this film to give students insight to the way Medieval kings, queens, and princes plotted and schemed with and against one another, how marriages were arranged with political motives, and how the relationships between these self-important royals shaped the history of the time. When I first introduced the films plot to my student, I was met with apathy and predisposed boredom, but they quickly were caught up in the intrigue and plot twists. At each major turn (an impromptu wedding, a surprise revelation about one of the character&apos;s sexuality, etc.), the students were often literally gasping.\n\nAs for the film itself, I can not think of a movie with more solid acting from the headliners (O&apos;Toole and Hepburn) to the other principal players (Hopkins, Dalton, Terry, and especially Castle), and even the other characters are well cast (Merrow as Alais is not especially solid, but she is at least adequate in her portrayal as &quot;the only pawn&quot; in this game of kings, queens, and knights). \n\nIt is, of course, not to be seen as wholly accurate historically, as it would be near impossible to achieve such for events that took place 800 years ago, but the major themes are true to form, and the film is wonderfully engrossing. Highly recommended!",

I recall hearing about her death on the t.v. news and how I cried a few tears; even though I was a young child of 9.\n\nThe movie is fast-paced, exciting, well-acted, and the Paris of the 1960s is in all it&apos;s glory.\n\nUnless this movie comes out on DVD, it will be lost to the ages. Most likely it&apos;s about forgotten, except for those lucky enough to have seen it. I even have the original movie poster of this film hanging on the wall of my apartment.",

How hard to think this film has been overlooked for so long. Definitely a must for any fan of musical movies and it warrants repeated viewing on a regular basis.\n\nA gem just waiting to be rediscovered.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Der Frosch mit der Maske&quot; aka. &quot;Fellowship Of The Frog&quot; of 1959 is the first of the popular German Edgar Wallace movies, but it certainly isn&apos;t one of the best. It has to be respected for inciting the wave of these Wallace-based German crime flicks that became extremely popular in the early 60s. Generally speaking, I am a fan of the German Edgar Wallace flicks, but I personally always preferred those dealing with a murder series to those dealing with super-criminals like this one. Also, &quot;Fellowship of The Frog&quot; is a bit too naive for my tastes. Sure, the German Edgar Wallce films never were nasty, brutal or cynical like the Italian genre-cinema in the 60s, for example. Still, the naiveté is quite extreme here. This makes the film a pleasure to watch for its sentimental value, but, for me personally, it doesn&apos;t go beyond that.\n\nScotland Yard are in desperate search for a ruthless super-criminal wearing a frog mask, whose henchmen can be identified by a frog tattoo on their forearms. The police have hardly any success in the search for the mysterious arch-criminal, even though the investigating chief inspector (Siegfried Lovitz) is a clever man. Richard Gordon (Joachim Fuchsberger), a rich man and hobby detective decides to investigate in the case himself, with the help of his loyal butler (Eddi Aren&apos;t)...\n\nIt is Aren&apos;t, one of the absolute cult-actors of the German Edgar Wallace &apos;krimis&apos;, who is responsible for many of the (half-dumb, but often very amusing) gags in the film. Aren&apos;t, an Edgar Wallace flick regular, often played the more comical parts in these films (often that of the butler), and this is his first role to do so. Siegfried Lovitz is very good in the role of the chief inspector, and the Eva Pflug fits in well as the seductive femme fatale. The rest of the performances are not necessarily breathtaking (the greatest performances in Edgar Wallace flicks always came from the great Klaus Kinski), but they&apos;re not bad either. The only awful performance comes from Walter Wilz, who is quite terrible as a naive young guy. All things considered, &quot;Fellowship of the Frog&quot; is an important film for its value as the first of the German Edgar Wallace films. Nevertheless, I recommend other Edgar Wallace flicks, such as &quot;Das Indische Tuch&quot; (aka. &quot;The Indian Scarf&quot;) way over this. &quot;Fellowship Of The Frog&quot; is a fun film to watch, but only for sentimental values. Recommended to fans of the German Edgar Wallace films.",

It&apos;s definitely not one of the better-known Karloff films, which is a bit of a shame, because it&apos;s at least as good as anything he did for AIP. Maybe horror fans need to pay more attention to Criterion.\n\nThe simplicity of the transformation is great. Apparently the originally script called for more of a &quot;possession&quot; angle, and then it developed into more of a physical thing -- sort of Jack the Ripper meets Jekyll and Hyde. And Karloff nails it. By simply taking out his dentures, he successfully plays two very different people.",

      "reviewBody": "Much like the recent &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, &quot;Bomb the System&quot; is a film spotlighting a semi- underground subculture, in this case graffiti writers, wrapped around a narrative plot. Somewhat similar to &quot;Kids&quot;, the story follows a young writer, &quot;BLEST&quot; as he tags, hangs out with friends, smokes pot, parties and tags again. This would all work fine as a minimalist, loosely structured, spectator piece, but instead, the filmmakers throw the dramatic storyline arc into the mix about a crooked cop and his ex-writer partner, which makes the whole thing seem artificial. Besides this major flaw, the film also suffers from over-acting, un-motivated hyper editing techniques and un-authentic slang dialouge. As an artist myself, I would suggest to neophytes looking to learn more about the culture to explore documentaries and check out websites. It&apos;s too bad that this film doesn&apos;t work, because the characters, like the filmmakers, seem to have a spiritual passion for the art of graffiti. The character Alex says in one scene something along the lines of while graffiti is aesthetically pleasing and stylistic, it the end, it stands for nothing. This particular line echos my thoughts and feelings about the film itself.",

I&apos;ve never liked cowboy or Indian pictures, but this movie  realisticly sets up a fantastic but simple premise that there are Indians still living in the wilderness. Tom Berringer discovers them with the help of Barbera Hershey while the sheriff played by Kurtwood Smith is looking for him. Smith, by the way, is now probably best known as the no-nonsense father on &quot;That 70s Show.&quot; I also have to mention the dog who seems to get a lot of his own scenes. The Indians superficially look authentic and believable as does their history which is so grounded and set up before hand that they could almost be real. The scenery is probably the biggest star as much of the locales and views are too breath-taking to be real. This movie would have had Academy Award written all over it had it been released theatrically. This movie just goes to prove that Hollywood big shots really don&apos;t know what they are doing.",

      "reviewBody": "In Emanuele Crialese&apos;s lyrical drama Respiro, the sky is gorgeous. The sea is gorgeous. The harsh landscape is gorgeous. The children, even when they are behaving like little monsters, are gorgeous. The lead actress is gorgeous. There is so much obvious and intentional gorgeousness about this picture that we have to dig far down, past the scene painting, to find the story.\n\nAlthough subtitled Grazia&apos;s island (Grazia is the lead role, magnificently realised by Valeria Golino), Respiro could have well been called &quot;Scenes from rural Sicilian life&quot;, as the scenography, cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro&apos;s locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunis is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky.\n\nThe story is fairly typical, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since Cinema Paradiso?\n\nGrazia (incidentally, the name means &quot;grace&quot; - get it?) is a loving, rebellious humanist - she loves her children, she loves music, she loves swimming in her panties, she loves the Vespa-propelled wind in her hair and loathes the suffering of any living creature. She does not love to cook, or put on rubber wellies and plastic smock to pack sardines. This high-spirited recklessness is just a bit too much for this dusty place and she is duly deemed mad. Golino, who acts in four languages and has had decent parts in Leaving Las Vegas, Immortal Beloved and Frida, is a joy to watch. There is not a moment forced or unnatural about her performance and this is saying a fair bit, considering her several mad scenes. She conveys brilliantly the purgatory of a loving woman who wants more, but knows neither what it is nor how to get it.\n\nAfter two incidents (one just a bit lusty, the other bordering on a bit off) it is decided by the meddling crones and village busybodies to send Grazia off to a sanatorium in Milan, which might as well be Mars. She will have no part of this and her 13-year-old son hides her in a secluded cave. Her ensuing escape, seclusion and discovery offer us some more gorgeous imagery and displays the motherly bonding quite well. Yes, the imagery does go a bit down the obvious, biblical, redemptive female roads, but it well handled. Water, which has played quite a large role in the director&apos;s concept, stars in a few more scenes. It also features in the film&apos;s ending, which is spiritual, gorgeous and inconclusive in the same breadth. Love and human devotion may win, but this gal is not going to be packing sardines for much longer!\n\nThe movie, considering the almost rudimentary story line, is incredibly rich. The smallest characters are well defined and there is wonderful juxtaposition between formal Italian and the coarse regional dialect. Much of the cast is so natural you could believe them to be locals.  The essence of life in such a village is well captured and the relationships within a family are well explored as well. And there is enough of the magical landscape of the place to make you want to board the next Alitalia jet. For a visit, that is."

In fact I was hoping for the &quot;twist&quot; to be something more surreal or supernatural (like a portal to hell or something), but unfortunately that was not the case.\n\nFor one thing, the trope of Serbia being this dark and horrible place (and Eastern countries in general) is tired, shallow and inaccurate. There&apos;s some inconsistencies another user pointed out, one big obvious being the &quot;bad guy&quot; with a Serbian tattoo.\n\nActing is decent, filmwork itself is quite good as well, but the whole thing comes across as rushed, half-assed and predictable. While I wouldn&apos;t call this &quot;French Hostel&quot;, it&apos;s on the same level as far as quality goes. Stereotypical characters, obvious &quot;twists and turns&quot;, nothing terribly memorable.\n\nIn my opinion, it&apos;s particularly disrespectful to base a film on horrible real events and just sort-of switch the characters&apos; ethnicities around. The main premise could still be based on real events but would&apos;ve worked better had they maybe picked a completely different location or with less focus on the characters&apos; nationalities.\n\nNothing special here, might as well watch an M Night Shalalalam if you&apos;re in the mood for something tepid and mediocre.",

It would seem it fully deserved its Oscar nomination for Best Sound.\n\nPerformance-wise Alexander Gray comes off as charming as usual- he made a handful of early talkies and proved himself a charming and handsome man, very much at ease.  Sadly both his work in NO NO NANETTE and the pictorial portion of SONG OF THE FLAME is lost.\n\nBernice Claire in the lead has a babyish voice and poor dramatic ability -she sings well, but does not seem at home in talkies.  Noah Beery as the villain is word perfect and pronounces so carefully that he lacks any dramatic vocal flair - an unnatural speaking voice with over careful diction.\n\nThe score is a marvelously operatic one.  All nine songs are preserved in the sound disc performances.  There were four choruses as well, three of traditional Russian folk tunes and one drawn from Tchaikovsky&apos;s Nutcracker.\n\nA delight to the ear - this &quot;lost&quot; operetta of the early days of talkies and film musicals."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Christmas crime story&apos; tries to be that type of film that tells a story, by way of a fractured timeline mostly in reverse, of several individuals and the unexpected ways their jumbled lives intersect. In that intent it does succeed, and each story as it unfolds is sufficiently intriguing to grab our attention to one extent or another. There are degrees of success, though, and try as it may, I think this effort is perhaps best described as &quot;adequate.&quot;\n\nSordid though they generally are, some of the characters are very sympathetic, especially as themes present in their story threads. On the other hand, there&apos;s so much drama herein that it feels maudlin at points, to say nothing of specific scenes or lines of dialogue that are overdone as they present. While each scene is executed fairly well as it presents, it&apos;s hard not to feel like the end result is a little overbearing: an overabundance of tragedy and sorrow, with almost no counterbalance. And that above all may be the greatest downfall here. I&apos;ve seen no few movies that were terribly depressing, but in at least one if not many other ways they were very well made, and very worthwhile. Here, however, the performances are of varying quality, story beats get our attention but hold it to varying fruition, and each &quot;segment&quot; is so straightforward in its presentation that there&apos;s not much to &quot;write home about&quot; in terms of technical craft.\n\nIt&apos;s not outright bad. I want to like it more than I do - and also wonder if I&apos;m being too generous. The picture that we get isn&apos;t engrossing so much as it is bleak, and nihilistic, without any meaningful thrills, heart, or emotional payoff to offset the preponderance of cruelty and degradation. It&apos;s like an extra down-beat Christmas variant of the &quot;tragic horror&quot; RPG Ten Candles, built on an despair and definite bad endings at every turn, yet with no effective hooks to keep us engaged. The end sequence tries to offer recompense, but it feels like a non sequitur, and too little too late. Unable to achieve any equalization as it is, &apos;Christmas crime story&apos; is relegated to at best a very average quality - not terrible, but not necessary, either. There are some good ideas, but a rough, barbarous, indelicate hand rends them atwain. There are worse ways to spend 96 minutes, true, but there are also many far better cinematic experiences deserving of your time.\n\nOh well.",

      "reviewBody": "Kidnapping movies were really big in the 1970&apos;s, especially after several high-profile cases like Patty Hearst. The Italian exploitation industry is notorious for taking its cues from the US movies, but that may not have been the case here since there was even a bigger kidnapping problem in Italy (eventually leading to the kidnap and murder of a former prime minister by the notorious Red Brigades). The kidnappers in this movie though are pretty low-rent types, barely connected to the Mafia. Their victim is a very spoiled, but perhaps not especially rich, teenage girl (Rena Neihaus) whose parents seem unable--or perhaps unwilling--to get her back (she hints at an incestuous relationship with her stepfather which might have been explored in the sequel to this &quot;Oedipus Orca&quot;). In this movie the youngest, most handsome kidnapper (Michele Placido) falls for the girl in kind of a reverse Stockholm syndrome, with tragic results for at least one of them. The end of movie, strangely enough, is kind of reminiscent of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; but with nowhere near the dramatic gravitas\n\nThe movie is generally lacking in character development. The film at one point follows the creepiest-looking gangster (Flavio Bucci from the &quot;The Night Train Murders&quot;) to his home where he is shacking up with another gangster&apos;s wife and her kid, but more than character development this seems to be more an excuse for another sex scene. The Placido character has an interesting flashback of him working on a filthy fishing barge, which is contrasted with a fantasy where he is piloting a yacht. This movie is very class-conscious in the way it has this poor Sicilian boy falling for a rich, northern girl (the Italian title &quot;La Orca&quot; comes from the designer outfit she&apos;s wearing). Placido is pretty good here, but this handsome, light-complexioned hunk is not too convincing as a lower-class Sicilian ruffian. As for Neihaus, I can&apos;t decide if she is a bad actress, or is just playing a really obnoxious character (she&apos;s more Paris Hilton than Patty Hearst). She does get naked several times which, judging from the English, title was the primary consideration.\n\nThis movie has a bit of a bad reputation, but I don&apos;t know why. It&apos;s not nearly as brutal as similarly-themed American films like &quot;Date with a Kidnapper&quot; or &quot;The Candy Snatchers&quot;. I believe Niehaus&apos; character is underage, but the actress obviously wasn&apos;t (she&apos;d been in &quot;Playboy&quot; two years earlier). Maybe it offended people that the victim is made so unsympathetic, but that doesn&apos;t explain why she returns in a sequel. . . I dunno. Check it out for yourself and see what you think."

Shot on a micro-budget, the film literally soars with an extraordinary screenplay rich in wit and irony, spiced with a remarkable music score that flavors the visual and intellectual genius depicted on-screen.  Clearly one of the best underground films of the 1990s.",

      "reviewBody": "I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It&apos;s one of the best &quot;teenager&quot; horror films I&apos;ve ever seen; and that&apos;s saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we&apos;ve been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless &quot;Saint Ange&quot;.) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.\n\nWith the plot and the details, goofs are minor; the characters are this movie&apos;s strongest point, given that so many clichés are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are not by any means the idiotic types we&apos;re used to; although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype, not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. And, in the end, and although everything is decorously explained, it&apos;s easy to see that things won&apos;t go so easy to the surviving characters.\n\nThe only errors I can see, and which do not imply continuity (IE, Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo&apos;s pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. Although, plot and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia, that little village in the midst of nothing, so I&apos;ll give it that. It&apos;s been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; &quot;How can two people build an entire house of wax?&quot;, &quot;Where do they get all the wax from?&quot;. These wouldn&apos;t be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton&apos;s unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior, it&apos;s pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax, in a WWII-type fashion.\n\nSo, that aside, I think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.",

The acting performances were great and the script was equally great.\n\nHelen Hunt was magnificent as the Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie cop with the Riverside Police Dept. She ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids, all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer.\n\nJeff Fahey (the Ray Liotta look alike) did a bang up job as the confused, often stammering, police officer that had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra-marital affair.\n\nSteven Weber, most notably from the sitcom &quot;Wings&quot;, did a nice job as the quiet, meek, underachieving sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lied a cold-hearted killer. Weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.\n\nThe entire movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days, if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie. This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.",

Something about drinking...&quot; And just wait for the scene were Joan destroys a room with a riding crop. Not to mention where she smears her vanity mirror with cold cream in order to cover her over emoting reflection.

The acting and the scenery in this film are amazing, i can still remember sitting in my bedroom watching Ethan Hawke&apos;s character walking up that huge slope to get to the top and meet with the people he is going to mine gold with. Along the way White Fang comes along and helps him and protects him. It is one of the greatest movies having to do with the gold mining and wildlife. White fang was my hero as an animal as i was growing up, and i had always wished that i could find a wolf, and live in alaksa with it by my side.",

We also have the late Cassandra Harris as a Bond girl who at the time was married to future Bond Pierce Brosnan.\n\nEven for everyone who didn&apos;t like Moore&apos;s portrayal of Bond, you still gotta claim this one as his best even though he was in his mid 50&apos;s. Sheena Easton sang probably the best theme song of all the Bond films."

      "reviewBody": "A Werewolf in the Amazon (2005) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nBrazilian horror/comedy has Dr. Moreau (Paul Naschy) doing various experiments in the Amazon. At the same time six people show up to party on some &quot;tea&quot; and soon they begin getting killed by a werewolf. I will admit that A WEREWOLF IN THE AMAZON has quite a bit packed into its short 77-minute running time. I will also admit that I had to watch the film in Portuguese without any subtitles so I couldn&apos;t follow everything going on but the visuals pretty much told you everything you&apos;d need to know. Within the first five-minutes of the picture you&apos;re going to see a werewolf attack, a big-breasted woman taking a shower and then a lesbian scene in that shower. Throughout the film there&apos;s just all sorts of weirdness going on including a couple idiots doing comic relief, a bizarre musical number and there&apos;s even a cult of females attached to everything. Oh yeah, there&apos;s also the werewolf going around killing everyone. There&apos;s no question that director Ivan Cardoso wanted to pay homage to star Naschy and for the most part I think he did just fine. I think most people are going to object to the humor because it&apos;s simply not funny and it takes away from the horror elements but outside of this I think the film offers some cheap thrills. Naschy turns in a good performance in the role of Moreau and the director even allows him a few sex scenes. The supporting actors are actually better than you&apos;d expect in a film like this. All of the actresses have very large breasts and often take their clothes off, which adds to the exploitation nature. The attack scenes aren&apos;t overly graphic or bloody but they&apos;re good enough. To my shock, the werewolf make-up is actually extremely good, which is a major plus. The bizarre nature of the film certainly helps it stand apart from various other low-budget movies out there. Add in the great Naschy and the film is worth viewing, although this certainly doesn&apos;t rank among the actor&apos;s best work."

Goebbels had some very dark secrets as a young man growing up who carried out all his sick mental problems on other people. Joseph Goebbels is played by Wolfgang Zilzer who did a great job of acting and also looked very much like the real person. Goebbels in real life loved all kinds of women and he really loved Maria Brandt, (Claudia Drake) who was a very pretty German actress who gave Joseph a hard time. However, Hollywood twisted the story which made Goebbels into a person who was not as evil as he really was. In real life, Goebbels really went to bed with this famous German actress and was really married to a very beautiful woman who had to turn her back on all his affairs. Nice 1944 film.",

      "reviewBody": "I put this movie on on a whim, primarily on the basis that there have been some halfway decent movies available of late from lesser known studios in the vein of CG animation with a distinct appeal to varied age bands with their primary focus being children. However at this point I distinctly regret this choice. \n\nThis movie was an utter abomination, mass produced soulless CGI trash with little respect for children as viewers. It smacks of boardroom meetings, of what would be cheap and easy to churn out and of perceived ideas of what the core essence of children&apos;s animating should be. The characters range from the cardboard in the dolphin protagonist, to the extremely annoying in the form of the &quot;comedy relief&quot;, and I use that term loosely, the jokes were flat, often crass (of course children like more &quot;rude&quot; humour but even a child can be disgusted with a lack of tact ) The character designs left an immeasurable amount to be desired, often lapsing into utter nightmare fuel in the case of the sunfish character, a design not even intended to be intimidating to children. The plot was limp and directionless and there were several points where the film seemed to be winding down to a natural end only to prolong its death throes by zooming off on another lifeless plot tangent.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that&apos;s left to be said about this movie is that in a domain like children&apos;s movies, this sort of film is a distinct step backwards from the current trend of catering richly to children and adults and going a little further with what they are capable of handling in their viewing, harking back to the older Disney where children were not quite reduced to fart jokes and cheap effortless animation. There is so much more out there to watch, don&apos;t waste you or your children&apos;s time with this money spinner.",

The Texas Promise witnesses the consequences of those cuts by going inside the 2013 Texas legislative session, the historic trial that questions the adequacy and equity in education funding, and delves into the lives and voices of the communities, districts, schools, teachers and families that are affected by these policy decisions. Through this collage of voices and experiences, The Texas Promise reaches into the core of the historic education decisions being made about opportunity, the economy, and our democracy.",

Although it does venture into Japanese horror territory -vengeful, long, black-haired specter- there&apos;s enough originality and good storytelling to outweigh any overly familiar images. The final revelation is definitely satisfying..."

Taking a device straight out of Aeschylus&apos; masterpiece &quot;The Persians&quot;, the war itself is almost entirely an off-screen presence (except for a few atmospheric news-reel clips, which serve to separate acts, as it were). Instead, like &quot;The Persians&quot;, it considers the war through its effects on those at home, and does a generally excellent job.\n\nIt is particularly good at showing the view from inside the military &quot;family&quot;, both of that life in general, and the effects of Viet Nam in particular. James Caan and James Earl Jones (the latter especially) turn in fine performances as veteran non-coms (the backbone of any army). One reviewer condemned D.B. Sweeney&apos;s portrayal of the young gung-ho recruit Willow because he sounded as if he were reading his line from cue cards - which rather misses the point, which is that because the green Willow doesn&apos;t know what it&apos;s really like, the slogans he repeats inevitably sound tinny and false.\n\nDespite a few flaws (e.g. Mary Stuart Masterton&apos;s character is rather under-developed, and a few scenes are clangers), overall this is one of the greatest of all Viet Nam movies.",

His personal journey speaks eloquently to the national trauma, and he&apos;s just the most prominent in a complex collection of transition figures, caught on the official last night of the war, now looking forward but not yet able to escape the ravages of war and the attendant moral and psychological confusion, not yet free of potential victimhood (like the mayor&apos;s assistant who on learning of his boss&apos; promotion drinks excessively in celebration of his own presumed advancement, but in his disruptive drunkenness kills off what future he had). The ending, intercutting a personal tragedy with the dancers doing the elegant polannaise in the streaming light of dawn, like disembodied Felliniesque figures, perfectly encapsulates the film&apos;s mix of toughness and allusiveness.",

The characters are appealing and, though they do very wicked things, one can not be really mad at the witch (the actress has great fun in portraying her) and her spoiled daughter who - what a fine idea - has only one eye! The film feels like someone is telling the story with moving pictures at the side as there is a very good story teller (as voice-over) who has the right tone and never tells too much. Another winner in the genre of producer Hubert Schonger.",

The parts where Hell or whatever that ridiculous place is supposed to be are done so poorly I won&apos;t even bother loosing words about it. The acting isn&apos;t as bad as some claim (well, what exactly can you expect from Martin Sheen anyway)and Theresa Randle is gorgeous as ever. The atmosphere of the movie is very, very dark and morbid, so I would recommend this movie to comic-hero fans ONLY!",

      "reviewBody": "Great film from the time after the Second World War, when there was still no wall in Berlin. The Soviet engineer Mischa (Ivan DESNY) is looking for his childhood sweetheart Anna (Ruth NIEHAUS) in Berlin, which is already divided into East and West. She now works for the Soviet Major Kazanov (FILM BAND in GOLD for Rene DELTGEN). The two lovers meet again, but suffer more and more from the repression of the communists. There are also problems with a bitter man (Karl JOHN) who is stalking Mischa. As things get worse, Mischa makes a momentous decision...\n\nFinally a West German film that deals with the bitter realities of division and political confrontation. And there was already a GOLDEN GLOBE in Hollywood for the Moscow-born director Victor VICAS. Alf MARHOLM and Wolfgang NEUSS also appear in other roles. A special masterpiece is delivered by the future ACADEMY AWARD winner Lila KEDROVA (she received the award for ALEXIS SORBAS / ZORBAS THE GREEK), who plays an unintentionally funny Soviet commissioner in the best Ninotschka style. Splendid!\n\nGreat Berlin film! Great love drama! Great contemporary document from the first half of the 1950s! Ruth NIEHAUS and Ivan DESNY are particularly great in the main roles. After her appearance in ROSEN BLÜHEN ON THE HEIDEGRAB, NIEHAUS became one of the great film stars of the West German film industry. DESNY received the GERMAN FILM PRIZE (h.c.) in 1980 for his decades of achievements for German-language cinema.\n\nHighly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s undeniable that The Phantom Carriage&apos;s influence precedes itself. From its iconography of the grim reaper, it&apos;s Christmas Carol-esque tale of repentance, to echoes of Jack Nicholson chopping down the door in The Shining. If The Phantom Carriage is known for anything, it&apos;s for being Ingmar Bergman&apos;s source of inspiration for what his films would later muse upon. He would later recruit director and star Victor Sjostrom to lead on of his most acclaimed films Wild Strawberries. Of course, we already know how profound these concepts are nearly 100 years later and their importance is still imbedded in the film. It&apos;s fascinating to watch inventive techniques of translucence portrayed on screen too, though admittedly the prior year&apos;s Caligari is more impressive. Its real problem is undisciplined structure and its resulting poor pacing, but these are archaic issues of silent cinema that required a few years of trial and error. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is palpable, the ideas are timeless and it oozes with passion from Sjostrom, if not as nightmare worthy as the next year&apos;s Nosferatu.\n\n8/10",

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump&apos;s travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",

But in all fairness, Gene Hackman blazed that trail for Norris and Stallone. &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; is as manly as they come, wielding a righteous cause and a well of brute testosterone. And for a great deal of the running time, it&apos;s a by-the-numbers war movie. I have to admit, that&apos;s not really my thing, so I started drifting after awhile.\n\nIt&apos;s a good cast, but Hackman deserves high praise for his sympathetic performance. The damn thing opens with him stalking the streets of Bangkok in hopeless search of his POW son. Washington&apos;s no help and his desperation is palpable. The stake are a lot more real when he&apos;s around.\n\n6/10 Stray thought: what is with the milquetoast pop songs that end these &apos;80s &apos;Nam movies?",

In fact, it could be construed as an attack on the hardhearted peasants who don&apos;t understand the loving principles of socialism, allied with the dull, workaday lack of understanding that socialism proceeds from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs. I don&apos;t read its subtext that way. The effects of socialism were made for the Czechs&apos; tendency for satire, and there are few pleasures like telling a joke that flies over the head of the censors. the people in charge of the community don&apos;t understand what Miss Kotrbová is going through. It&apos;s irrelevant to them.\n\nStill, the thing about good art is that it is open to many interpretations. I like mine.",

      "reviewBody": "The 1981 splatter film NIGHTMARE hearkens back to a long-passed time in American horror cinema when &quot;slasher&quot; flicks were not only excessively gory, but also deeply disturbing in their underlying themes. These films not only outraged elitist film critics and general audiences, but also worried many horror film enthusiasts who felt that such films had &quot;gone too far&quot; in their uncompromising brutality. While a few of these films, most notably William Lustig&apos;s masterful MANIAC (1980), have attained cult status and been rereleased to DVD and VHS, most of these films have fallen out of print and into obscurity. Unfortunately, this is the case with NIGHTMARE, one of the better examples of the visceral, uncompromising horror films of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nAdmittedly, this film does not start off very well. The first 30 minutes or so are pretty sloppy and hard to follow, largely because of choppy editing. However, once the film&apos;s story gets on track, what follows is a truly disturbing and horrific splatter film. Director Romano Scavolini, obviously working with a very low budget, nevertheless delivers some genuine suspense and adds touches of style (though he can&apos;t touch Dario Argento). The acting by the cast of unknowns is also surprisingly good. While the music during the opening and closing credits is pretty lousy, the score during the rest of the film is terrific, effectively creating an atmosphere of dread and fear. Of course, there&apos;s also the unforgettable gore effects by Tom Savini, displayed most spectacularly at the film&apos;s finale.\n\nIt goes without question that NIGHTMARE is definitely not for all tastes. Non-horror fans should stay far, far away. Additionally, I must note that more than any film I have ever seen, this film should not be viewed by children or impressionable young adults. However, hardcore fans of horror should definitely give this example of a bygone era a look. Watch this with some teeny-bopper flick like I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and see which film leaves a longer lasting impression.\n\n**1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "With an involved, detailed mystery and an elegant adversary played by Gale Sondergaard, this is one of the most entertaining features in the Sherlock Holmes series of movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The story gets a little far-fetched, but it is quite interesting. It is loaded with plot devices pulled from several different Arthur Conan Doyle stories, and it&apos;s interesting to see how many you can catch. It also features the usual pleasant camaraderie between Rathbone and Bruce, plus Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade.\n\nAs &quot;The Spider Woman&quot;, Sondergaard creates a memorable opponent for Holmes. The slightly exaggerated role cannot have been much of a challenge for such a fine actress, but she puts her heart into it, and looks as if she is enjoying herself - as her character certainly is. By creating such a dynamic character, she also helps make the complicated story seem more plausible, and it creates a worthy challenge for Holmes.\n\nThe movie also contains the amusing bits of dialogue and detail that characterized so many of the movies in the series. The climactic sequence, in particular, is a very good combination of suspense and wit. It is a fitting way to cap off an enjoyable entry in the popular series."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the earliest versions depicting the life of Christ. And what a film it is! It&apos;s partly colourised (but only parts of most frames). So you get a movie made over a hundred years ago hand coloured and 44 minutes long which is much longer than the average films of the time (1-5 minutes). This was made to last, you can tell - the effort it took to hand- colour hundreds of feet of film and shoot that length with so many decorations.\n\nThe opening scene - The Annunciation is clearly made in a setting inspired by the Italian Renaissance art, just like the Last Supper scene later in the film. And if you put yourself back in those days where film was just coming out of its embryonic state, as it were, people were used to seeing paintings, pictures and frescoes, and of course, those films were made to look like those paintings only moving, which was in a way a miracle of a painting coming alive. Static camera shots (there was no zooming or panning of camera at the time) only add to that effect. In this film, however, they used camera panning in two of the scenes.\n\nAs I mentioned, it&apos;s whopping 44 minutes long and the director managed to fit the events of entire life of Christ into it - from Annunciation to Ascension (Mel Gibson had 2 hours of running time and managed to fit only a quarter of the events - just teasing). So it is like a visual Bible reminiscent of those stained glass windows in cathedrals called the Poor Man&apos;s Bible made not only for beauty and inspiration but also for those who couldn&apos;t read (which was the vast majority of the population as books were rare and very expensive). So the film is also made of stand-alone parts or scenes, just like those windows. The other thing to mention is that it is made in a fashion of passion plays (hence the English name of the film). In good old days those were very common throughout Europe for many centuries wherein actors performed scenes from the life of Christ and saints in towns around the holy days. So, clearly the settings in this film look very much like open theatre stage decorations. However, the progress, it seems was made in shooting some open air scenes as well. They also used special effects - combined shots. Some are really incredible for the time, like the walking on water in the catching of fish scene or transfiguration scene or or the scene with lightning on Calvary. And so... the development in film-making continues...\n\nThe film runs at normal speed so there&apos;s no fast moving comic effect everyone is used to. And the actors face quite a difficult task: there was no speech possible as they were used to in theatre and had very limited use of facial expressions (there were no close-up camera shots at the time, although they made two here), so they only had to make use of their body language and arms, which looks a bit over the top at times. There are no title cards in the film apart from the scene titles, so the viewer is meant to know at least the basics of the four Gospels, which was, I&apos;m sure, a lot more common back then than today. Enjoy, highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was first a television play performed live and then went on to Hollywood for a slightly glossier production. This is NOT a bad pedigree, as shortly before this the TV movie &quot;Marty&quot; was also brought to Hollywood and became one of the best movies of the 1950s. Both the TV and Hollywood versions are excellent--see either or both if you get the chance.\n\nTo me this movie is the antithesis of &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; was not a very realistic portrayal of alcoholism in many ways--particularly the ending where the lead suddenly just kicks his addiction and everything is hunky-dory. Get real! &quot;&quot;Days of Wine and Roses instead does not pull punches. It refuses to give in to sentimentality and take the typical Hollywood approach to films. There is no happy ending, there were surprises and heartbreak--much like dealing with alcoholism in real life.\n\nBecause it would spoil it to give too much information, I will only briefly discuss the plot. Jack Lemmon is a business man who slowly goes from the &quot;two martini lunch&quot; to alcoholism. His acting was very convincing and gut-wrenching. Equally compelling is his wife, Lee Remick, who puts on the performance of her life as the long-suffering wife who slowly goes from co-dependent to alcoholism herself. I&apos;ve worked in a chemical dependency program and I&apos;ve got to tell you, all the excuses and bargains and excesses in the movie were exactly what my clients had said and done as well. It is obvious the writers were doing their homework, as the movie delivers on every level.\n\nUPDATE: Since this review, I was able to see the original teleplay--which, along with a few other teleplays of the era, are available through the Criterion Collection. See this in its original form. While not nearly as glossy, it still packs a huge dramatic punch!",

The best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch.\n\nThe movie plays like the Naked Gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clichés and bad acting. Unfortunately, i don&apos;t think they meant to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialog really does suck, so well just have to laugh at them, and not with them.\n\nOn a side note, it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space, half on earth, and doesn&apos;t mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. I really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors.",

      "name": "The definitive Great Depression film",
      "reviewBody": "Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake &quot;Hollywood&quot; dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichés. And the ones that don&apos;t are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford&apos;s Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.\n\nAs I&apos;m sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family&apos;s home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. \n\nIf I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won&apos;t spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck&apos;s masterful writing and the actors&apos;s somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. \n\nEvery single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don&apos;t even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.\n\nJohn Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.\n\n9.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins in Utah with a funeral procession making its way to a cemetery on the outskirts of a small town when suddenly several cowboys appear on a ridge nearby and begin shooting at the coffin. Naturally, all of those in the funeral procession immediately take cover, with one exception-an attractive woman named &quot;Lisa Drummond&quot; (Elina De Witt) who defiantly stands there alone while bullets rip the ground all around her. It is then revealed that she is one of the last survivors of a family which has been decimated by a rival clan headed by Jonathan Griffith (Furio Meniconi) who hates the Drummonds with every fiber in his being. That being said, after shooting up the coffin of Lisa&apos;s father, the Griffiths then noisily ride off. The scene then shifts to a stranger by the name of &quot;Jerry&quot; (Rodd Dana) riding into town and, upon going inside the local saloon, produces a fiddle and begins to play. Angry that he doesn&apos;t continue playing after a couple of tunes, a drunken young man named &quot;Spot Griffith&quot; (Fabrizio Moroni) becomes violent and begins an altercation which leaves one man dead and the young man and several of his companions lying unconscious on the floor while the fiddle player calmly collects his violin and walks out. Not long afterward, he rides his horse to a nearby ranch and its there that he sees Lisa and her younger cousin &quot;Steve Drummond&quot; (Tony Rogers) working hard on their small ranch. Needing a place to stay for a while, he then offers to help out and she gladly accepts. Meanwhile, having been humiliated in the brawl at the saloon, the Griffiths have begun to scour the area in search of him. But, in spite of their viciousness, Jerry is not who he seems and is much more deadly than any of them could ever imagine. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an okay Spaghetti Western which bore a certain resemblance to the Clint Eastwood picture &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; released a couple of years earlier. It is not, however, nearly as dark and doesn&apos;t quite capture the same level of intensity as the 1964 classic. Be that as it may, while it may not be on the same level, I still found it to be worth the time spent to watch it and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",

That makes me wonder how times I would watch this, since I already own a lot of great visual movies. Cinematography-wise, this film reminded me a bit of Sleepy Hollow, but not quite as dramatically filmed as that. There also is excellent 5.1surround sound in here. Being a ghost story, and one that is trying to scare the viewer here and there, sudden jolts of sound is important and utilized well here.\n\nI also appreciated this was done without almost any profanity and with famous actors like Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. I expected some Bible-bashing since that&apos;s normally the case in these ghost or witch stories, but it wasn&apos;t bad here. However, the &quot;surprise&quot; almost political-correctness ending didn&apos;t really surprise me, considering how films are these days.\n\nA decent movie but 50-50 whether I would watch it again.",

While I have certainly never heard it spoken about when talk of Vietnam films crops up. The film is in essence a who done it police drama, two cops on the streets of Saigon during the war are searching for a high ranking officer who is, erm, offing prostitutes.\n\nIt is the backdrop of the war that gives the film added substance and lifts it way above average, because we see not only the problems a murder investigation brings, but also the horror of war getting in the way as well. Some damn fine and tidy performances flesh out the characters, with both Gregory Hines &amp; Willem Dafoe as our two stoic and battle weary coppers engaging us from the off, whilst the supporting cast of Fred Ward, Keith David (look out for his dance man!) &amp; Scott Glenn are interestingly watchable; the latter of which who leaves the lasting impression with what has to be the best 5 minutes work he ever did during a brilliant interrogation sequence during a mid-air flight.\n\nIt&apos;s gritty and interesting and deserves to be better known and sought out. It doesn&apos;t pull up any trees as regards formula, and it certainly isn&apos;t one you will want to go back to time and time again for thrills and spills, but it hits the spot and as the mystery and stifling heat of Vietnam pervades the mood, you will remember watching it long after the credits have rolled. 7/10",

I like the song &quot;manam ennum medai mele&quot; for its melodious tune and beautiful lyrics by poet Kannadasan.\n\nYou can still go for it today if you like old B/W thriller...."

      "reviewBody": "Making a film about the &apos;chemical generation&apos;, those who live for the weekend, must have been a very hard enterprise. It would have to accurately reflect the lives and experiences of &apos;clubbers&apos; and also appeal to a wider audience. Human Traffic just about achieves that.\n\nIt is certainly spot on in with it&apos;s observations and in it&apos;s accuracy. It&apos;s obvious the filmmakers have &apos;been there and done it&apos;. If you are or were once like the people in this film, than there is so much to relate it. It&apos;s all there, often depicted humorously but not condescendingly. The fake euphoria of being on &apos;E&apos;[&quot;in the end ,I just want to be happy, yeah ,that&apos;s it.....hang on, what the **** was I talking about?&quot;]. The monged conversation at 4 am which seems deep and meaningful but is basically rubbish [ Star Wars being about drugs!]and gets more and more incoherent. Exchanging pleasantries with someone you only see in pubs and clubs and really can&apos;t stand. &apos;Coming up&apos; suddenly at the same time as someone else and mumbling to each other what you&apos;re &apos;on&apos; at the speed of light. Reminiscing how it was better in the &apos;old days&apos; and is now too commercial and widespread. Doing it all for the first time and going off with a bunch of dodgy geezers who are suddenly your best mates. The thrill of finding the after party. The depressing, inexorable sense of returning to the reality.\n\nThe film&apos;s attitude to drugs is commendable, drug taking is simply something the characters do, and that&apos;s all. Nobody dies or is seriously ill ,and yet there is a sense that it doesn&apos;t really lead anywhere. &quot;After all ,we&apos;ll not going to be doing this for ever, are we&quot; says one character at the end.\n\nThe film falters a little when depicting the lives of it&apos;s protagonists. For many scenes, director Justin Kerrigan uses a kind of &apos;heightened reality&apos;, for instance in a scene when a character comments on how the workers in a fast food place are like robots and for a moment they &apos;become&apos; actual robots. This approach does not always work, and it&apos;s a shame since the characters are all the sort you could expect to run into on a Friday night. We do care a bit about their respective lives and problems, but we don&apos;t really get to know the female characters properly, and what is really the main thrust of the plot, the blossoming romance between two of the main protagonists, is dwelled on too much and is somehow unconvincing,if sometimes quite sweet. The acting is generally OK if not great.\n\nHuman Traffic is not as important a film as, say, Trainspotting, which despite being about heroin addicts seemed to speak to a generation. Nonetheless, it&apos;s a truthful depiction of an element of society which films and TV either ignore or condescend to. Incidentally ,there are two versions, the director&apos;s edit and the later producer&apos;s edit. The latter, which cuts some footage, changes some music and adds some silly CGI, is inferior to the former."

The young man who made his breakthrough performance as a pot-head who hung out with Craig Jones (Ice Cube) on a memorable day (and film) between Thursday and Saturday.  Now though, the sequel revolves around Craig&apos;s family instead of his neighborhood as the first Friday did.  I think wrier/producer/star Cube decided to do that to add a little kick to the Friday saga, and it does. But without Tucker it&apos;s a kick from a baby.  Still, the movie isn&apos;t the worst ever, it has many laughs from it&apos;s supporting characters (John Witherspoon, Mike Epps, Don Curry) who play Craig&apos;s odd family.  Cool, hip, and not quite fine.  A-",

      "reviewBody": "John Waters&apos; satirical 2004 release &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; was the controversial film that attained an NC-17, and basically was unable to be edited for an R-rating. Waters&apos; film is very disgusting at times, sometimes even vile in its matter-of-fact portrayal of various sexual fetishes (some of which are admittedly fun-looking, while others are just plain foul and hilarious), which to be honest is expected of his films. And oddly, the characters are all well-played and likable. This is a film I have trouble rating. It isn&apos;t his best film, but it is ultimately enjoyable, despite some serious flaws.\n\nTracy Ullman stars as Sylvia, a &quot;neuter&quot; (someone who is repressed sexually) in a small town that is obvious very repressed and uptight. However, within the community exists a growing group of people who have experienced a sexual awakening (mainly due to head injuries), and are very open with their fantasies. When Sylvia experiences a head injury and is awakened, she meets with &quot;sex saint&quot; Ray-Ray (Johnny Knoxville) who introduces her to the world of open sexual fetishes, as he and his followers search for the ultimate fetish. \n\nThe film is very much a sexual cartoon, and often is full of exaggerated ideas, dialog and imagery. Waters employs all sorts of tactics (everything from gags, on-screen subtitles, suggestive set dressing, etc.) to illustrate a town that is repressed while still being exposed to sexuality, and the characters are all very interesting. I didn&apos;t even mention Selma Blair as Ullman&apos;s daughter- a woman who has enormous implants that are practically bigger than the rest of her body.\n\nThe film is also quite funny (particularly a scene that will make you look at the &quot;Hokey-Pokey&quot; in a whole new way), with some great gags and hilarious dialog, as well as trademark over-the-top jokes. A lot of &quot;queasy&quot; laughs are also brought in by the descriptions of various fetishes (many of which are real) and occasionally by seeing them played out by our &quot;awakened&quot; characters. Although this is one of the problems- the film does go overboard at times, and a lot of the gags don&apos;t quite fit in, and interrupt the flow.\n\nIn addition, it isn&apos;t made particularly well- certain effects give themselves away, the plot does get sloppy, and after a while, the content will weigh on your patience. You will wish that more &quot;plot&quot; would happen.\n\nThat being said, there is still a lot of fun to be had, just don&apos;t expect this to be Waters&apos; masterpiece. I give it a slightly above average 6 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The new film by Andrew Wood (&quot;Stories of football,&quot; Machuca &quot;) came several weeks ago the national billboard, much discussed by critics and expected by the general public. And someone who does not know who Violeta Parra, regardless you like it or not, it is increasingly difficult to find in our country.\n\nStill, knowing who you are or have heard it is not enough at all to say that we know the inside and out. And this is what &quot;Violet went to heaven&quot; proposes. Based on the book written by his son Angel Parra shows us a close look, and many times deep metaphorical Chilean folklorist.\n\nWith silent flashbacks, a journey between the real and the dreamer, an idiosyncrasy so characteristic of a person raised in the countryside and a life forged and hardened with hardship and suffering, &quot;Violet went to heaven&quot; is a complete x-ray naked the artist who provides us with the greatest simplicity himself, and incidentally, of his work.\n\nThe filmmaker manages to mix with a very positive linear history with the desires and obsessions of the protagonist, armed with a smart script from the memory and the present development of the film.\n\nFrancisca Gavilan, who stars in the film is delivered to the paper, with a sublime embodiment, and a perfect vocal and instrumental performance when required, something unfortunately scarce among Chilean companies. It shows the work required and the technical goal more than achieved.\n\nThe rest of the cast of &quot;Violet went to heaven&quot; offers good performances, but because of the limited role they have, fail to shine as a Hawk.\n\nThere is a game camera in the foreground, with the simple and detailed human face, and so the image goes beyond the feeling that emerges in each scene with an ease that is appreciated.\n\nIn short, &quot;Violet went to heaven&quot; allows the viewer a simple exercise: to see a common history, stress, ups and downs of passion and destruction, and a remarkable inspiration of an artist. How it travels between the cliff and the idealization sometimes at the same time. And all with a visual poetry that accompanies the beat of the compositions of Parra we hear throughout the film.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie at the theater when it was released. I liked it all the way, but I can imagine some might not have liked it at all.\n\nFirst of all, if you&apos;ve never read a S&amp;W-comic you may have a hard time getting into the characters. They all have their own little singularities which have grown during the years (remeber this is a comic that has been published for over 60 years now) and may seem a bit awkward to some.\n\nSecondly, the dialogues and especially the humor is typically Flemish, which might be even harder to get into by foreigners.\n\nThirdly, the costumes are exact copies of the costumes used in the comic. Even though most of the story is set in the middle-ages, a lot of costumes may seem outdated because of the fact that this movie is based on an episode that was released in 1958.\n\nAnd lastly, this is a kids-movie. If you rent/buy and expect a cool transformation of the story into an epic movie... too bad. This was meant for kids, so you should watch it as a kids-movie.\n\nSo, as a fan of the S&amp;W comics I am very pleased with this movie (which is why I gave it a 9). This is exactly how a fan wants the story to be retold as a movie. If you&apos;re not a fan, try it. Maybe you&apos;ll be bitten by the virus too.",

Jean-Paul Rouve also does a fabulous job of acting, making you hate him just for playing his character.\n\nWell seasoned with humor, recognition and turning points, this is definitely a good film to see and perhaps even learn a lesson from."

This time, though, it&apos;s a different, not so long ago by-gone era&apos;s air infiltrating back to surround you from the depth of the alleys. With the marshal&apos;s resurgence it&apos;s not only the loudly anti-communist mayor who will reconsider what the end of communism means to him. The ex-partisans might have their say, too. Who&apos;s going to marshal this then? See for yourself.\n\nVery good satire with exactly the right mixture of plausibility and improbability in the story. In dealing with the post-socialist social and political transformation by deploying satirical means, it fits into the long series of films from &apos;former Eastern bloc&apos; or &apos;Soviet satellite&apos; states doing the same, along with &apos;Pogoda na jutro&apos; from Poland or &apos;Good Bye Lenin&apos; from the cultural space, so to say, of former East Germany, to name just a few of many. Watching one is no substitute for the others, of course. As anyone barely acquainted with the subject might know, &apos;communism&apos; was no cheeseburger for the Eastern so-called &apos;bloc&apos;, to which the former Yugoslavia did not belong. The experiences with socialism were similar, but differences were abound as well. And besides, the films I mentioned are all very good anyway.",

This time round he finally debuts on the big screen in Serbian adaptation of Hitchcock`s TROBLE WITH HARRY and the WEEKEND AT BERNIE`S franchise. Debeli is talented and old enough to keep overwhelming actors at bay even though most of the laughs are sniffed out of curses. And foul mouth isn`t a reliable source of humor. Plotting is also a wee bit convulted since there are too many obstacles for main characters and not too many ways to solve these situations. This is why audience is forced to wait for the miscellaneous hijinks for the plot to move forward. Relying on luck makes characters look passive. Some situations are poorly staged but who are we to whine when MRTAV `LADAN is one of the rare Serbian movies shot on film stock, even though it`s 16mm. As it is, it is mildly enjoyable. One of the finest films in the season when we had only 3 barely watchable Serbian films. Yeah, right.",

It is similar in plot structure to Joseph Heller&apos;s Catch 22. \n\nBoth start out with an odd but &quot;realistic&quot; beginning. Each progresses in small steps to more and more outlandish and unbelievable situations with a blurred line between possible and &quot;this can&apos;t really be happening.&quot;\n\nIn Catch 22, the story begins with an odd but possible situation in the European theater in World War II. At the end of the story Milo Minderbinder, an American officer, is contracting with both the Germany and the Allies to bomb the other&apos;s military installations. \n\nIn the Last Shot, the story begins Baldwin, an FBI agent trying to make a name for himself, voluntarily allowing the bad guys to cut of one of his fingers so that he can charge the bad guys with more serious crimes.\n\nThe plot progresses with Baldwin setting up a façade of making a movie to trap other Mafia types. Obviously, no one expects that the movie will ever be made. It then progresses to a point where Baldwin and his superiors at the FBI are making what appears to be a real deal for a &quot;three picture deal&quot; and negotiating over marketing rights.\n\nThat progression, together with some wonderful side trips,cameos by Joan Cusack and Buck Henry, caused something that is rarely heard in multiplex theaters with relatively small audiences-outright loud laughter and even a bit of applause as the movie ended.\n\nThis movie is not Gone with the Wind or Citizen Kane. It is just good fun with laughs enhanced by the progression of not likely but possible to outright absurdity. The kicker is that the movie, according to the producers was based on a true story. If so truth may really be stranger than fiction."

Alain Corneau takes you very close to the characters and their feelings. And the acting is so perfectly nuanced, so delicate, and therefore closer to the truth. This is one quality that is extremely important in psychological movies such as this one. Sylvie Testud reminded me of Isabelle Huppert in La Dentellière. Same very sensitive acting. And it&apos;s interesting that I recently saw Stupeur et Tremblement, by the same director, and they are very different movies, something I really appreciate in a director, this ability to explore totally different type of story and in very different ways. Sergi López is also a great actor. He is so convincing, the way he delivers his father&apos;s story at the restaurant... it gave me goosebumps. And of course, let&apos;s not forget Anna, the center piece of the whole movie, beautifully interpreted by beautiful Camille Gauthier with this fascinating stare of hers... ouafff! Great acting, great movie making, go ahead, see it, it&apos;s definitely worth your time.",

It&apos;s got drama, plot, action, emotions, and nice acting all rolled into one, on the background of a fantastical assumption on a twist of real history.\n\n Note on the title.  The setting is the year 2009, and the film is based on the assumption that Korea is still a colony of Japan, as it had been for the past 100 years, because a single assassination attempt back in 1909, which succeeded in real life, failed and changed the whole course of history for the past 100 years in this alternative story.  A Korean-born special agent tries to set the history right, and his colleague, a Japanese-born and a friend of his, tries to stop him.\n\nAlthough made in Korea, dialogues are about 70% Japanese, and you have to have some knowledge in the history of the two countries to fully understand this movie, but the setting and basis is very imaginative and fascinating, that anybody can appreciate it.  The two stars of the movie, Dong-Kun Jang and Toru Nakamura, who are Korean and Japanese in real life, are very fine, and make up a nice team.  The action scenes, which are plenty in this movie, are nicely choreographed and serve to contribute to the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The Korean film industry is growing, so the next time you catch a Korean movie, it could be this one!",

      "reviewBody": "Vidhaata is a very enjoyable Hindi movie of its time. Subhash Ghai gathers some of the greatest talents of those times, including Dilip Kumar, Shammi Kapoor, Sanjeev Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, and Amrish Puri. The story is quite an interesting one, and the development is very well brought out. The film does veer into formulaic caricature from time to time. Much of the action borders on the fantasy, but then it is well made up for by some intriguing twists. One scene between Amrish Puri and Dilip Kumar, which involves the explosion of a car, is greatly entertaining. Unfortunately the second half is marred by proceedings which are uncalled for. Similarly, the love story involved is not very convincing and contributed little to the story.\n\nThe main high-point of this picture is unquestionably the acting. No one can ever doubt Dilip Kumar&apos;s extraordinary acting prowess, and in this film he turns in what I consider his best work of the decade (along with Shakti). He is tremendous as Shamsher, a simple working man who turns into a mafia don. This is one of the few Hindi movies where such a transformation is credible and, without question, due credit for this should go to the actor himself for his renowned ability to portray complex characters with rare, natural ease and realism. As his character adopts a new name and identity, he appears greatly stylish and sophisticated, but his immense love for his grandson and the pain over the loss of his son are utterly convincing. This is just another understated performance, which never fails to leave a lasting impact on the audience.\n\nThe rest of the cast are there to support the screen legend in his author-backed role, and all do well. Sanjeev Kumar is unsurprisingly dependable in a small supporting role, and Amrish Puri is excellent in a villainous part which is slightly better than his usual parts of this sort. Sanjay Dutt makes a confident debut, and he is well paired with the beautiful Padmini Kolhapure, even if the two are the least impressive here. The one who almost, if not totally, manages to steal the show, however, is the wonderful Shammi Kapoor, whose well-etched comic part provides the main glimmer of relief in an otherwise heavy story. He is simply brilliant as Shamsher&apos;s age-long and loyal friend, soulfully portraying the wholesome, admirable kindness of the character and exuding warmth at all levels.\n\nVidhaata is like many films of its kind but at the same time it is a cut above the usual fare presented at the time. In this sense, it is a very good film well worth seeing. Ultimately it is the acting, particularly by Dilip Kumar and Shammi Kapoor, which elevates it to an altogether different level and more than makes up for its flaws.",

      "reviewBody": "Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans (1993) is a French film shown in the U.S. with the title The Young Girls 25 Years Later. The movie was written and directed by Agnès Varda.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort, directed by Jacques Demy, became an iconic movie after it was released in 1968. Twenty-five years later, the people of Rochefort held an extravagant event to celebrate the film and its positive effect of bringing Rochefort out of its &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; slumber.\n\nDirector Agnès Varda is Jacques Demy&apos;s widow. Although she didn&apos;t participate in the movie directly, she was there taking photos and videos.\n\nMany of the film&apos;s stars returned to Rochefort, including Catherine Deneuve, and Jacques Perrin. Composer Michel Legrand was there as well.\n\nVarda is too good a director to only focus on stars. (The camera just wants to follow Deneuve, but Varda won&apos;t let that happen.) Varda presents interviews with bit players and extras. In the film, Deneuve and her sister Francois Dorleac were supposed to be twins. (They were sisters, but not twins.) Some twins were used in the films, and they are interviewed. Two of the school children, who were both extras, met again years later, and eventually married.\n\nIn 1993, tourists still came to Rochefort to see the places where the filming took place. (By coincidence, 2018 was the 50th anniversary of Young Girls. I wonder how many people still remember it.)\n\nDemy was a brilliant director who made films that were different from those made by other French directors of the time. He often said he was trying to imitate the Hollywood musicals of the era. However, how many Hollywood directors would transform the appearance of a city by painting more than one thousand shutters to match the color scheme of a movie?\n\nThis is a movie worth seeing, although it would work better in a theater. You&apos;ll enjoy it more if you can see The Young Girls of Rochefort before you see the documentary.\n\nThis film apparently can&apos;t be purchased separately. However, it&apos;s easy to find a Young Girls Criterion Collection DVD, which contains this movie as a supplement. That way you&apos;ll be able to see the Young Girls first, and then follow with Agnès Varda&apos;s documentary. It&apos;s definitely worth making the effort!",

      "reviewBody": "In 1912, the Texas-Mexico border was ablaze with raids by hordes of Mexican bandits calling themselves revolutionaries. To combat them, the U. S. government sent General John (Blackjack) Pershing to deal with the bandit raiders, one of the most dangerous of which was General Hector Cordoba. Some cannons have been stolen by a Mexican gang led by Cordoba. So Captain Douglas (George Peppard) is assigned by General Pershing (John Russell) a dangerous mission, he along with a group of misfits (Don Gordon) set out in pursuit of outlaw gunslingers on the Texas border, circa 1912. Meanwhile, Douglas attempts to liberate a Mexican village besieged by a nasty gang that is ravaging the small town. Douglas is determined to take a group of prisoners (Nico Minardos and Pete Duel, who committed suicide the following year) and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits. He goes to the territorial prison, where a group of renegades and other prisoners are given a chance to redeem themselves. Later, the captain tries to take the stolen cannons and catch the bandit Córdoba (Raf Vallone), with the help of a Mexican officer named Antonio (Gabriele Tinti) and the beautiful Leonora (Giovanna Ralli). They aimed it at the fortress of Córdoba and pulled the trigger! The army followed to pick up the pieces!\n\nThe story is partially similar to Richard Brooks&apos; &quot;The Professionals&quot;, adding Robert Aldrich&apos;s &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; with the usual gang of outlaws made up of an eclectic team with diverse specialties, such as dynamite or guns. Implausible story but real action, tense emotion and fun at all times. The film has Western action, exciting driving, explosions, shootouts, it is fun and entertaining, although nothing new, but it shows a TV style at times. The film contains some moments of grisly violence and even touches on the relationships between George Peppard and Giovanna Ralli. This is a so-so and inferior imitation of the original and enduringly popular &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; by John Sturges (in fact, it&apos;s the same producer Walter Mirish), and turns out to be standard action fare. George Peppard as a two-fisted officer who employs soldiers of fortune is quite good and Don Gordon is likable as his stubborn assistant. Great supporting cast consisting mainly of American actors like John Larch, John Rusell, Greek Nico Minardos, imposing Frenchman Hans Meyer and Italians like the beautiful Giovanna Ralli, Raf Vallone and Gabriele Tinti. And being Pete Duel&apos;s last film; in fact, shortly after his character was released from prison, he puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger. A year after the release of this film, while shooting the second season of the series The Two Musketeers (1971), Duel would commit suicide in this way. For the more experienced, and film buffs who like actors, they can take a look and catch the brief appearances of ordinary Spanish secondary characters from Spaghetti, such as Luis Barboo, Barta Barri, Cris Huerta or Aldo Sambrell.\n\nFilmed in Spain in locations in Hoyo Manzanares, La Pedriza (Madrid) and Andalusia, Almería, where hundreds of Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in the 60s and 70s. In fact, although the production is North American, there is a lot of Spanish technical support, such as the cameramen Antonio Macasoli and Ricardo Navarrete; the first assistant director José María Ochoa; the prestigious expert in &apos;matte painting&apos; Emilio Ruiz del Río; the special effects and miniatures of Francisco Prósper; the artistic and set designers José María Tapiador, Rafael Salazar, Emilio Ardura, among others.\n\nIt has a bright and colorful photography by cameraman Antonio Macasoli . As always, an impressive and memorable soundtrack by maestro Elmer Bernstein in a style similar to his classic &apos;The Magnificent Seven&apos;. The movie was professionally directed by Paul Wendkos, a regular TV movie director although he also made some westerns for cinema such as &apos;The Face of a Fugitive&apos; and &apos;The Magnificent Seven Ride&apos;. Rating: 6/10, acceptable and passable.",

      "reviewBody": "Strangely enough, that&apos;s one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn&apos;t use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman &amp; Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?\n\nYes, there&apos;s something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn&apos;t always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.\n\nThe lesson wasn&apos;t learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher&apos;s garish direction and Chris O&apos;Donnell&apos;s irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.\n\nAnd so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he&apos;s clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn&apos;t give a bad performance per se. Rather, it&apos;s his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn&apos;t think she&apos;s that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she&apos;s joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what&apos;s the point? He gets to call Batman &quot;Batunbuuurg&quot;, refers to Robin as &quot;Buuurd Bouy&quot; and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word &quot;ice&quot; that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman &quot;Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola&quot; the urge to use the video&apos;s &quot;stop&quot; button is almost insurmountable.\n\nBane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn&apos;t her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?\n\nTiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy&apos;s dialogue, with her urges that her &quot;garden needs tending&quot; adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it&apos;s unrelenting innuendo - &quot;I&apos;ll help you grab your rocks&quot; - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman&apos;s cashcard: &quot;I never leave the cave without it&quot;; and it&apos;s also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler&apos;s costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. &quot;It&apos;s the hockey team from Hell&quot;; &quot;So this is where you hang out&quot;; &quot;I&apos;ll cancel the pizza&quot;; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!\n\nThe film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. &quot;Not all heroes wear masks&quot;; &quot;to give life... that&apos;s true power&quot;. Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman &amp; Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with &quot;failures&quot; like that?",

      "reviewBody": "The visual appeal of the film is exceptionally strong, from costuming to the sparse Jarmanesque sets, to the period settings.  The part of Goya is superbly played.  Yet too often the character&apos;s, mostly that of Goya himself, stoop to uttering banal platitudes about art, about freedom, about life.\n\nThere is also a bit too much docu-nonsense in the film.  Surely with the advent of the Biography channel one need not waste precious feature film time rehearsing an Art-101 bio of the man.  One can find that elsewhere. What a waste.\n\nStill for the look and mood of the film and the quality of acting, I&apos;d recommend it pretty strongly.\n\nI also recommend watching this film close on the heels of Jarman&apos;s Carravagio in order to understand why films about art really must avoid talking too much.  Jarman&apos;s film is difficult, but it doesn&apos;t annoy one with the hubris of always trying to explain genius the way Saura&apos;s film does.",

Fine acting,particularly by Joan Benett and Milton Berle.Preminger&apos;s character is a bit caricatured."

It makes out the point that there is no way to escape these wars. It&apos;s a circle killing everybody at the end. It goes on for centuries. The way war is depicted is so realistic, the director, Milic, has been himself in the war. There is no single woman in the screen, because it is a war movie, and no romance can fit in. All the craziness of the war is there, driving those soldiers mad. The craft of doing that movie is amazing. No wonder why Croatian school of film is probably the best in the Balkans. If you can, go see that movie. And you wan&apos;t need to see any other war movie in your life.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, the first eight minutes are spent on a long, slow comedy bit between Seth (Phillips Lord) and the tax man, in an Abbott &amp; Costello-type who&apos;s-on-first routine. That just goes on way too long. Audiences of the day would have been familiar with radio personality Seth Parker, kind of a Pa Kettle kind of guy. Bette Davis is &quot;Mary&quot;, his daughter, who is trying to figure a way to get to the barn dance. This was only Davis&apos; fourth role, and she plays it very straight forward... at twenty-three, she hadn&apos;t yet developed her sophisticated, scheming style. Effie Palmer is Ma Parker - in one of the two films she made, and both in 1931. One of the characters talks about going to Bangor (&quot;Bangah&quot;), presumably Maine, but the only new england accent we hear is one very badly-done one. The actress playing Lizzie (Sophia Lord... Phillips&apos; actual wife) was actually BORN in Connecticut, so you&apos;d think she would be more familiar with a new england accent! I guess that explains why she only (over)acted in this one film. Oscar Apfel (from Shop around the Corner, and SO many others) is a minor character here, but he doesn&apos;t have his usual giant, twitchy, mustache, so you almost don&apos;t recognize him. Not at all coherent; the main story seems to be Mary and David sneaking around to try to spend time together alone, but Mary&apos;s father is determined to keep them apart. There&apos;s also the side story of Rufe Turner (Stanley Fields) trying to take his son back from the man who raised him. Again, Fields&apos; own story is quite interesting; Fields had been a boxer, moved into vaudeville, then into films. Everyone&apos;s real life story is much more interesting than the story we are watching here. Seth and his cronies sit around and sing a beautiful version of Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song at one point, but other than that there isn&apos;t much going on here. Some of the other songs used are more from the south - several Stephen Foster songs, Turkey in the Straw, which isn&apos;t really appropriate for a film taking place in Maine. Directed by William Seiter, who worked with the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy later in his career. This wasn&apos;t one of his better films.",

I also thought a lot of the &quot;military jargon&quot; was a bit over the top, especially from the older Marine guys. And there was some definite over-acting at times from some of the kids. But I suppose they&apos;ll improve with experience.\n\nOtherwise though, it was a decent movie and I certainly didn&apos;t feel like I wasted my $5 by renting it. I have to laugh at the people saying they didn&apos;t like it because &quot;it could never happen&quot;. You&apos;d have to be pretty naive to believe that something like that could never happen. It happens all the time in other countries and we certainly aren&apos;t immune.",

I had to watch this film (DVD) twice to get some of the dialogue, and I wish I spoke Japanese, but it was worth it. (Viggo, with his laconic accent needs to be miked better.) The plot is complicated and there seems to be a plethora of doublecrossing, double dealing bad guys - even the so-called good guys.... but then you should watch this flick. There is some terrific acting all around. And plenty of action.",

      "reviewBody": "Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love films about ET&apos;s taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (&quot;The Escapist&quot;) and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (&quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;) for special effects. &quot;Apes&quot; is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn&apos;t about the humans, it&apos;s all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer&apos;s. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee&apos;s to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new &quot;altered&quot; gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it&apos;s age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It&apos;s only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an &quot;Ape Sanctuary&quot; and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nTechnically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in &quot;Avatar&quot; to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and Kong from &quot;King Kong&quot;) plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis&apos; work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.\n\nNot only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.\n\nMy only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to &quot;phone it in&quot; as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn&apos;t about the humans. It&apos;s about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.",

      "reviewBody": "The problem with a film like &quot;A Soldier&apos;s Story&quot; is that too many will skip it because it is one of those black social films. They expect a boring bitchy sermon. That&apos;s too bad, because they miss out on one of the best ensemble films of the 1980s, not to mention a tough mystery story that navigates deep psychological waters in delivering a message far less rosy and doctrinaire than you might expect.\n\nIt is World War II, and just outside a Louisiana army base for &quot;colored&quot; troops, a black master sergeant is shot to death on a deserted road. Whites from the nearby town are suspected. Howard Rollins Jr. plays Capt. Davenport, a black lawyer sent by Washington to investigate. The expectation is he will ruffle no feathers and work instead at being what the base commander calls &quot;a credit to your race.&quot; But Davenport quickly makes clear he isn&apos;t anyone&apos;s token, even if it means pressing white suspects or investigating the possibility that whites didn&apos;t kill Sgt. Waters at all.\n\nToday, you see the film and notice Denzel Washington has a major role as one of Sgt. Waters&apos; men. But the star of the film is neither him nor Rollins, but Adolph Caesar as the doomed Sgt. Waters. &quot;They still hate you!&quot; he almost laughs as he is being murdered, and one of the many mysteries sorted out in the film is that Waters wasn&apos;t talking to the killer but himself.\n\nWaters is bent out of shape not only over white American attitudes towards blacks, but his own attitude about how a black person can be more acceptable in white society. He expresses admiration for Nazi Germany, noting that they have a commendably direct way at getting at the problem of racial purity. For him, the black race is held down by a certain type of southern black, &quot;geechies&quot; he calls them, who play to white stereotyping by not speaking correct English and so on.\n\nCaesar tackles Sgt. Waters as if his were a Shakespearean role, and in a way it is, Shylock crossed with Richard III, filtered through a multitude of American racial prisms, white on black, black on white, black on black. His every twitch and body shudder come over perfectly, especially when you watch a second time. Even in smaller moments, like when he&apos;s getting ready to beat the tar out of Denzel, and is joshing with the other non-coms, he never lets go of that glint in his eye or his hold on the viewer&apos;s jugular.\n\nThough Rollins and Washington are both very good in support, even better is Art Evans as Waters&apos; sad flunky, Wilkie, who gives two contradictory depositions to Davenport and the deepest insight as to what made Waters tick. Dennis Lipscomb as Capt. Taylor is also fantastic, a white officer who tells Davenport frankly he doesn&apos;t want him investigating the murder because of the color of his skin. Taylor&apos;s not a bigot, mind, he just wants justice and fears a black officer won&apos;t be able to make an arrest in Louisiana. Taylor&apos;s more socially awkward than anything else, and scripter Charles Fuller, working from his great &quot;A Soldier&apos;s Play,&quot; has a lot of fun with him and his exchanges with Davenport.\n\nWhen Davenport tells him of an especially cruel trick Waters played, Taylor refuses to believe it. &quot;Colored people aren&apos;t that devious,&quot; he says, a nice line in that you discover Taylor&apos;s racism and his naive decency simultaneously.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, director Norman Jewison doesn&apos;t mention his earlier &quot;In The Still Of The Night,&quot; which is odd given the many parallels between the two films. Both are murder mysteries set in the American South with blacks and whites butting heads. Rollins even went on to appear in &quot;Still Of The Night&quot; the TV series. I don&apos;t see this film as a copy of that earlier one, but a variation on the same theme, and in many ways an improvement.\n\nInstead of noble Sidney Poitier, you have a deep raft of black acting talent representing a variety of different attitudes and moral shadings. Real stock is taken, too, of America&apos;s racial divide, how people can still feel American enough to want to die for their country even if it won&apos;t let them drink from the same water fountain. There&apos;s something heartbreaking about the scene where we see the black soldiers celebrating being sent off to combat, in the wake of what happened to WWI hero Sgt. Waters. Will they come back with memories of their own Cafe Napoleon?",

A beer in a hand, a cigarette in the other one, I didn&apos;t expect to watch something that fun!\n\nThe opening scene itself is a tribute to absurd funny gore. I don&apos;t want to tell more, but it is one of the most hilarious intro I&apos;ve ever seen. Since this moment, I didn&apos;t stop laughing until the end.\n\nIf, like me, you appreciate pictures with over played acting, absurd dialogs, many topless scenes, stupid humor and... some blood too, you will love this one. Of course, we can say that about a lot of films (troma, Fulci...) but this one is just a little bit better in everything. I found it almost as fun as P.Jackson&apos;s &quot;Braindead&quot;. HG Lewis comes back with his famous humor noir, and is at his best!\n\nI would give a special appreciation for the music: A few good old school psychedelic rock n&apos;roll songs doesn&apos;t kill, after all.. does it? And of course, the acting is (intentionally) as bad as you could expect. At the opposite, the special effects are impressive. In fact, it is the perfect mix between a stupid teen movie plot and some old styled gore scenes!\n\nThe perfect film to watch with a few buddies and some beer! Don&apos;t miss it!",

      "reviewBody": "The premise made this look like a distant cousin of movies like Groundhog Day, only that it&apos;s more bizarre, and containing an element of gore. Imagine if you wake up but find yourself living a different life from before you slept, not just repeating the last 24 hours. And each iteration actually ends in death, where you feel pain, and knowingly being hunted down. Then you rinse and repeat, with little recollection and little opportunity to figure things out before you get hit again.\n\nSounds interesting, right? But The Deaths of Ian Stone wasted the premise, and became a very boring movie despite the tense build up. It kept you guessing, until slowly you realize a whole host of clichés start to creep in, especially those pertaining to speeding up the narrative and to provide wholesale, verbatim explanation on things to come. Showing you is not enough, the characters have to blabber repeatedly, and you start to roll your eyes when they beat around the bush for no good reason.\n\nIan Stone, the titular character, is played by Mike Vogel. A teenage ice hockey jock, things start to go bump for him when he realizes that time will start to freeze, and he finds himself getting thrust forward in time, but not before suffering immense pain from creative death. The only constant that keeps him sane, is the presence of girlfriend Jenny (Christina Cole), who seem to not recognize him in his moment of awareness, as he tries hard to figure out the whos and the whys.\n\nThe posters plastered suggest creatures spawned from the imagination of Stan Winston Studio, but to give credit to the plot, it contains something a little more. While you can find little fault with the special effects and Harvester creature design, you will probably laugh at the laziness in costuming, where total rip offs from the Matrix Trilogy were adapted from, with the tight Trinity styled Lycra spandex coming on screen, with the characters&apos; hair slicked back and shades to boot as well. \n\nOf course the theme of love is central to the story (i.e. if you have no theme, you can always fall back on love), as an emotion so powerful it can move mountains and oceans, and with new love come jealousy and envy from those around you, especially from the ones who hold the candle. As mentioned, the movie had promise and an explanation for the strange, but the delivery is suspect, and unfortunately, quite boring. After the first few iterations, you know the idea well has run dry with generic killings, and a whole amalgamation of tools being used concurrently just to inflict pain, but done off-screen. The fight sequences too are terribly bad, with lacklustre punches being thrown around, while brandishing those nicely shaped bladed hands.\n\nThe Deaths of Ian Stone is nice to look at at first, but slowly the flaws start to surface, and soon enough you&apos;ll realize just how flimsy everything had been put together. Should Harvesters be real, they could feed on the audience&apos;s collective fear of the dreadfulness the movie is heading towards. And they will be well fed.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Der Architekt&quot; tells an interesting variation of the old story of a family confronted with serious trouble caused by underlying interpersonal problems and a &quot;dark&quot; secret from the past. This is always a good basis for a psychological drama.\n\nHowever, pretty much of it is exaggerated and overacted (which is, by the way and IMHO, still typical of German cinema: &quot;Real&quot; people simply don&apos;t behave the same way as most of the on-screen characters). And many metaphors/symbols are simply carried too far (e.g., the name &quot;Winter&quot; for the troubled lead character stumping through the all-present discomforting winter landscape).\n\nJosef Bierbichler is really great, but the rest of the cast can&apos;t keep up with him. This is especially true of the currently way overrated Matthias Schweighöfer. He should really take some acting classes in order to get rid of his mannerisms (e.g., constant grimacing); his performance is plain awful."

In the 2 hours or so the film ran it was not possible to tell the whole story. So they use shortcuts and invention - so what. I bet more than one person started to research Chaney and other stories from the silent era. Interest stimulated...... job done. \n\nRather like the Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman stories, same applies. How many started to appreciate the music, they knew nothing of the inaccuracies. They saw a good story and heard some interesting music, helped me to start listening to jazz and I am grateful.\n\nYou will never satisfy the &apos;expert&apos;."

      "reviewBody": "In the tradition of &quot;No Exit&quot; and &quot;Twelve Angry Men,&quot; &quot;The Method&quot; gathers a small group of people into a single room to observe what happens when they are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time together, essentially cut off from the outside world. (The movie throws in elements from such wide-ranging and eclectic sources as &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; as well).\n\nSeven high-powered job applicants, all vying for a single position in a prestigious company, arrive at a high rise office building in downtown Madrid. As a part of the selection process, the seven are immediately put into a room and subjected to a battery of bizarre psychological tests designed to pit the applicants against one another until only one of them - the default &quot;winner&quot; and future employee - is left.\n\nPredictably, the stress of the ordeal brings out the worst in the applicants, leading to personal betrayals, the exposing of secrets, and a cutthroat jockeying for power. Part of the fun of the movie is in seeing just how long it takes for the veneer of civilized behavior to be stripped away, exposing the ruthless animalistic nature within. For this is how the natural law of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is played out in the modern world - no longer with clubs, bows and arrows, but with duplicity, deviousness and carefully chosen words.\n\nHowever, the individuals are not the only ones to come under the scathing censure of the filmmakers. The movie also attacks the Big Brother aspects of corporations in their insistence on total allegiance to the company in exchange for &quot;job security&quot; and their willingness to drain their employees of their humanity to secure that allegiance. Yet just outside this bleak, stark and sterile office building, where &quot;civilized&quot; people are subtlety tearing each other apart for corporate advancement, masses of people are marching in protest against the World Bank and the IMF who are holding a conference in the city.\n\nMateo Gil and Marcelo Pineyro have written a sharp, thoughtful screenplay that gets to the heart of the human condition, while, as a director, Pineyro manages to keep the action fluid despite the single-set restriction of the conceit (the film has been derived from the play by Jordi Calceran). The acting is uniformly excellent with each performer given his or her moment to shine as well as the chance to be an indispensable part of an extraordinary acting ensemble.\n\n&quot;The Method&quot; may be derivative of other works at times, but the view of human nature it reveals to us is often unnerving and chilling in its honesty and precision.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Mariti in affitto&apos; (&apos;Our Italian Husband&apos;) is sort of a mess of a movie. Ilaria Borrelli wrote and directed this bilingual film and apparently lost track of her story during the making of it. The Italian language portions are supplemented by English subtitles, but the English, when spoken, is so distorted by the actors and by the musical sound track that the words are nearly incomprehensible. What results is a slapstick comedy acted way over the top to the point of frustration on the part of the audience.\n\nThe action opens somewhere in Italy where Maria Scocozza (Maria Grazia Cucinotta) is eking out a living making sandals to support her two children from her marriage to artist Vincenzo Scocozza (Pierfrancesco Favino) who left for America some years ago to make it big in New York. Maria is courted by older gentlemen who threaten her to the point that she leaves with her two children to fly to New York to re-join her husband. Upon arrival she finds an unfriendly country but no husband and is befriended by Raul (Diego Serrano) who eventually finds her work passing out fliers for an agency called &apos;Rent a Husband&apos;. She eventually discovers her husband has remarried to TV model Charlene (Brooke Shields) who is extremely pregnant. Outraged but with no place to go, Maria and her two children move in with Charlene and Vincenzo, and as predicted the two women eventually join to plot against the two-timing Vincenzo...etc etc etc.\n\nThe acting is raw - Chevy Chase even has a role as a TV writer - and the performances all border on overacting. There is a hint that somewhere in this mélange of ideas there are some solid humanistic points to be made, but everything gets lost in the mess of a production. Not a very good way to spend an evening.",

The trouble is, old-fashioned husband Tracy is already penciled in as the prosecuting attorney. Let the Battle of the Sexes begin!\n\nThe script sets up a great opportunity to have Tracy and Hepburn sparring with one another during every phase of the trial, as well as at home every night after they&apos;ve spent each day trying to outwit each other. As a comedy, there aren&apos;t any huge belly-laughs, but it&apos;s a charming enough little take on the differences between men and women which also manages to make the point that, in many ways, the sexes aren&apos;t really all that different when all is said and done.\n\n**** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Paddy Considine&apos;s directorial debut has been a widely anticipated event. With his excellent performances throughout his British cinematic career, most notably his work with Shane Meadows, a dark, churning piece of cinema was what we have been expecting. \n\nWe have not been let down. Tyrannosaur is as gritty as it is gripping. The setting in a Northern industrial, working class community – the estates of Leeds, creates the imprisoned physical environment for Joseph (Peter Mullen) an alcoholic, self-loathing widower who meets a Christian charity worker (Olivia Coleman) and we are drawn into their troublesome worlds. \n\nThe films workings of violence and desperation draws another influence to my mind, which is Gary Oldman&apos;s directorial debut &apos;Nil by Mouth&apos;. Both are lavished in gritty, deglamorised violence. Both have a tendency to stare the darkness in the eye, unlike some audience members (including myself) that will have an undeniable urge to look away. It&apos;s a representation of life on the underside, where it often is difficult, dark, testing and sometimes evil in its twists of fate.\n\nThe film has a strong link to animalistic representations, an element to which instantly brought Andrea Arnolds award winning short film &apos;Dog&apos; to mind. The idea of trapped animals and the capabilities of those pushed too far is a powerful and dominating theme.\n\nNeedless to say the challenging viewing nature of this film forms the base of its appeal. Its unflinching and unapologetic brutality could be deemed too prosaic for the majority of mainstream cinema goers. You will need to be ready for the challenge to fully take in and be moved by the film, it&apos;s not one to watch on a Sunday morning, put it that way.\n\nThe direction and acting are the notables in this production. Most notably Olivia Coleman, whose supporting role threatens to overshadow that of Mullen&apos;s, if it wasn&apos;t for his own exceptional performance. Mullen portrays Joseph in such a way that despite his loathsome qualities he remains human and even relatable, at times when other characters don&apos;t.\n\nBut it is Coleman&apos;s character and performance that really underpins and illuminates the rest of the feature. Her character is an almost polarised opposite in comparison with Joseph however as the plot turns we are exposed to an array of character transformations. It is these that actually help support the minimalistic plot which allows us to focus and be consumed by these iridescent performances.\n\nConsidine has excelled himself in his writing and direction, with very few criticisms that could be levelled at each, other than those looking to nit-pick. Whilst somewhat preoccupied with the grim and depressive side of the characters, the film triumphs as it chase&apos;s the ray of light at the end of the tunnel. For all its depressing and challenging nature it mirrors the lives it portrays and the personal struggles of the characters, as they keep pushing and fighting. An excellent first feature from Considine and I personally cannot wait for his next offering.",

But it did.\n\nI miss George and John. It was a fantastic movie."

Tooth Fairy stars ex WWE man The Rock (aka Dwanye Johnson)who plays Derek Thompson a ice hockey player who goes as &quot;The Tooth Fairy&quot;. That night he tells his girlfriend&apos;s(Ashley Judd)daughter that tooth fairies don&apos;t exist but when he gets a cheque saying that he is in bail for 2 weeks he turns into a tooth fairy complete with a tutu(yeah a dude in tutu how hysterical can it get keep reading on). The head of the fairies world is of course played by Julie Andrews who looks fabulous here tells Derek that if he keeps telling kids that tooth fairies don&apos;t exist their world will be gone forever.\n\nThe problem I had with this movie was that there wasn&apos;t enough of gags and I felt like watching The Mighty Ducks meets Toothless(you know the one with Kirstie Alley)over and over again. I was disappointed that there wasn&apos;t enough of screen time with Billy Crystal(from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY)as he was only in it for like 5 minutes and then its all about Dwanye Johnson shining his gnashers for most of the film. Another was that it was kinda dull in some places.I suggest the movies that I mentioned below are a lot better. But still Tooth Fairy wasn&apos;t a bad flick but it wouldn&apos;t be my all time favorite as it was kinda lame. This film is definitely suitable for 4 year olds not for a 19 year old girl like me.\n\n5/10",

Let&apos;s face the facts of life...poverty can ruin one&apos;s plan for the future, and this was evident in the film. You&apos;ll really see how hard life in mainland China is, even though this is a movie. The story is gripping and very realistic. You&apos;ll really feel the hardness of being in poverty and having to quit what you&apos;re doing. For the characters, Wei is a substitute school teacher who would go to extremes (high determination) from handling a class to walking around the city looking for a missing person.\n\nI highly recommend watching this Chinese movie to any movie lover out there. This film is NOT a waste of time, it is simply VERY GOOD.",

The kidnappers give a ransom of 2 million dollars.  Rene Russo (Outbreak, Major League) plays his wife.  Delroy Lindo (Clockers, Get Shorty) plays the head FBI agent on the case.  Gary Sinise plays a New York cop.  Gibson soon starts to doubt the chances of the ransom working, so he changes the ransom to a bounty on the kidnapper&apos;s head.  The film is well-directed by Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Cocoon).  The story line is gripping and well-written.  Mel Gibson is excellent as the father.  Rene Russo and Gary Sinise are good in their roles.  Delroy Lindo delivers the best supporting performance, he plays the agent very convincingly.  A suspenseful, entertaining, and overall great film.

      "reviewBody": "This 1999 film features an appointed Vice President who assumes Presidential power upon the death of the President -- ergo, a completely unelected President.  Interesting concept but more importantly, the basic plot has this President forced to face a major crisis in Iraq when all of his diplomatic and military power is concentrated on a crisis in Korea. Somebody must be reading this script in Washington right now -- but they switched the locations.\n\nAt any rate, all of the ranting negative reviews and the flowery positive reviews I have seen here on IMDB about this film seem to me to miss the point.   What happens in the film is of limited note compared to very strange feeling of &quot;deja now&quot; watching this film in February, 2003 while watching its big brother on CNN live.   See this film!   It&apos;s interesting, a bit disturbing, and sightly prescient (only partially I hope).",

      "reviewBody": "I have to admit, I enjoyed this film, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. This is only the second Roger Corman film I&apos;ve seen so far, and therefore I can only really compare it to the other film I saw by him, The Terror. I can clearly recognize the directing style, and basic film-making style, but I must say that this is better than The Terror. The plot is pretty good, and fairly interesting, and more original than most other films dealing with Frankenstein. It has a decent enough pace; I wasn&apos;t bored for the 90 minutes it lasted. The script is fairly good too, a good twist on the original Frankenstein story, though I guess some fans of the original story wouldn&apos;t like the various changes. The acting is good enough, both John Hurt and Raul Julia gives pretty good performances, and the rest of the cast is decent. The characters are fairly well-written and credible. The film has a fairly bad name, it seems; yes, the monster does look more like the result of genetic mutation or something similar, rather than a creature built together by human bodies, and, arguably, the film has several violent scenes that seem to be there mainly to add violence rather than substance to the film, but apart from that, the film is pretty good, at least worth a watch, if only one watch. The effects are decent enough, at least for a film from 1990. The makeup effects and such were also pretty good, I must say that the monster&apos;s face, especially the eyes, did send a chill through my spine, the first time he was shown. I liked the various science fiction aspects of the film, and the social commentary was very good, too. The ending was a little weird, but it was a fairly good climax. All in all, a decent enough science fiction/horror drama, and worth one watch, if you can catch it for free. I recommend it to fans of Roger Corman and open-minded fans of Frankenstein and/or horror films in general; just be prepared that it won&apos;t be an incredible or very memorable film, just an entertaining 90 minutes, if you&apos;re into violent movies without any real purpose. 6/10",

When it turns out that the young man Bronek who accepted the task has a criminal record, things look bleak and anything but comical. The first signal that this impression is not the whole story comes from a short conversation between Wladek and Bronek. Wladek says &quot;We are not going to pay you for repairing the TV antenna on the roof, we did not ask you to do this work, you will not get one cent more&quot;. Bronek&apos;s reply is astonishing: &quot;No problem. I never had a home&quot;. In addition to the main story interesting events unfold in the background. The local priest practices medicine, there is often a line of patients in front of his home - seen from the street. Jadwiga as the mayor considers this view a disgrace to her small town. She is powerless, however; the priest takes no money from his patients. The local police chief has amorous designs on Jadwiga. By an accident the criminal past of Bronek is revealed to a third party and blackmail begins. There is also a real criminal lurking in the dark - and a visit of an important dignitary from Wroclaw is a threat to the locals also. As befitting a comedy, various problems get solved eventually - but after delightful twists and turns.",

The Actors are obviously laymen, and do not know a single thing about acting. The camera-work is equally horrible, sometimes the camera is totally out of focus, at other times the camera just lingers for (seemingly) hours on the same scene without any cuts. Its like a glorified home movie really. The dialog is mostly mundane and nonsensical, the actors just seem to improvise their lines on the spot. But its really hilarious, the crazy 70s fashion, the wigs and the disgusting interior set decoration (Luzi Kryn&apos;s apartment) really sell the movie. But please be advised: This is definitely not your usual movie entertainment. Its crazy,amateurish and tasteless. A real treat for trash fans, but sometimes it&apos;s so incoherent, that it becomes extremely boring after a while. I can&apos;t really recommend this, but if you are interested in truly bizarre film-making, then this is a film for you.",

I strongly suggest to all young people, unfamiliar with the lead years period of Italy, to study the matter. The lessons from that era are extremely valuable. Because they clearly show that no matter what one believes regarding politics and ideology, at the end only two truths remain. A-everyone outside the state, is a puppet of the state. B-the state always wins. The lead years was a chaotic period with countless victims. Most of them, innocent. In the surface, many people think that Lead years means neo fascists and far leftist terrorists, causing havoc. But the truth is that the main actor, was the Italian state.\n\nItalian state and deep state, Italian secret services, Carabinieri, Army officials, NATO, CIA, politicians, are all guilty, or to be more fair, they all have among them guilty people, who should be accused long before any low level neo fascist or any anarchist. This is known to almost everyone living in the Mediterranean European countries. We know our history and we will not forget the innocent who were butchered.\n\nThe movie is centered around the Piazza Fontana bombing and as political thriller, it achieves both purposes. It informs and it is entertaining as well.\n\nThe director did only what he had to do and he did it good, and the actors are all excellent in their performances. The recreation of that era is perfect.\n\nWatch it and then do some research about the Lead years.\n\nHistory repeats itself.",

      "reviewBody": "Seeing &quot;Exodus&quot; early in the 21st century, one is robbed of the experience that moviegoers of the early 1960s would have had; it&apos;s impossible to see a movie about the birth of Israel now without the perspective of the Six-Day War of 1967, which changed the perception many non-Jews had of Israel. That, and the events that the Six-Day War led to, have eroded the moral assurance that many of the main characters of &quot;Exodus&quot; espouse about Israel and its founding, and would eventually lead to the moral quagmire found 45 years later in Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Munich.&quot; Today, &quot;Munich&quot; is much closer to the grayness of who is right or wrong in the modern-day Middle East than the black-and-white assumptions that drive the characters of &quot;Exodus&quot; in 1947 -- or its creators in 1960.\n\nAnd it&apos;s likewise much harder to accept Paul Newman in the role of a Jewish freedom fighter; though he was already a big star in 1960 (which was no doubt the reason that he was chosen for the part), one cannot evaluate his performance here without recalling all the other high points of his career that were still ahead of him -- &quot;The Hustler,&quot; &quot;Cool Hand Luke,&quot; &quot;Hombre,&quot; and of course his two big triumphs with Robert Redford, as Butch and Sundance and in &quot;The Sting&quot; -- not to mention a career that kept humming even into the 1990s. He&apos;s hardly remembered for this role at all today, and though even he isn&apos;t in every scene in a sweeping epic like this, it&apos;s hard to look at the movie without remembering all that would come later.\n\nWhat stands out today more than Newman&apos;s performance, therefore, are the many secondary characters -- Sal Mineo as the tortured survivor of Auschwitz with secrets that lead him to the Irgun (and a performance that would earn him his second and last Oscar nomination); David Opatoshu as a Menachem Begin-like figure who believes violence is better than negotiation; and Jill Haworth, all of 15 at the time, and who would have a bevy of ingénue roles into the 1960s, but whose career would dribble out by the end of the next decade.\n\nIn particular, this was a great role for Opatoshu, who is probably best remembered today for his many guest shots on television (like Newman, most that came after this, in everything from &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Mission:Impossible&quot; to &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;). Though he is recognizable for those roles, it&apos;s worth remembering that he came out of Yiddish Theater and was a controlled, subtle performer who rarely got the kind of meaty role that he had here -- and one that no doubt was important to him.\n\nSo, while it&apos;s mainly remembered today for Ernest Gold&apos;s stirring theme music, &quot;Exodus&quot; is interesting as a window into a different time and a different way of thinking -- both about its subject matter and its main character . . . and the once and future star who played him.",

      "reviewBody": "Two World War was just ending , a German submarine , U-Boat , commanded by a captain called Lauchs (Horst Janson) sinks an English ship and gun down most of its crew . Then , a sole survivor of the ship , the revenge-minded Murphy (Peter O&apos;Toole) carries on his own war , no matter what the cost to himself . The Irishman survives and returns to health thanks to a nurse named Hayden (Sian Phillips , real-life O&apos;Toole&apos;s wife) . Murphy&apos;s war is about to begin from a settlement on the banks of the Orinoco River .\n\nThrilling and exciting screenplay concerning about an obsessive seaman with an eagerly determination to seek vendetta on the Germans , even after he learns the war has ended . Interesting and moving script by prestigious Sterling Silliphant , saddling some nice action scenes at the ending , when it takes place a relentless pursuit between a boat and the sub , specially in the last reel . Sensational acting by Peter O&apos;Toole as the lone survivor from a British naval ship who seeks revenge when his ship is sunk by the Germans and gunned down most of its crew . However , his extreme obsession with desire for vengeance upon the Germans isn&apos;t believable , but the moments that click make the movie more than worthwhile . This character about an avenger who seeks revenge on those who killed his crewmates bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Moby Dick&apos;s Captain Ahab¨ by Herman Melville . Other important players are : Philippe Noiret as his supporter and sympathetic helper gives a mesmerizing acting , Siân Phillips as a good-tempered nurse and Horst Janson as a captain who massacred the Allied shipmates in the water .\n\nMagnificent color cinematography on tropical places by Douglas Slocombe . Adequate as well as stirring musical score by John Barry . The motion picture was compellingly made by Peter Yates and splendidly edited by film editor John Glen , subsequently director of James Bond movies . Never a prolific director, Peter Yates subsequently made only a few more films . His best films include the stylish and ingenious caper comedy Hot Rock (1972); the underwater adventure Deep (1977), based on the novel and screenplay by Peter Benchley ; and the quirky coming-of-age comedy Breaking away (1979). For the latter, Yates received simultaneous Oscar nominations as Best Director and Best Producer and the enjoyably old-fashioned comedy Curtain call (1998), starring Michael Caine and Maggie Smith as a couple of theatrical ghosts . He was nominated again for a more cerebral &apos;actor&apos;s piece&apos;, The dresser (1983), starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay , based on a play about an ageing stage actor and his long-standing assistant. It was followed by a flop titled Eleni (1985) with John Malkovich . Most memorable, perhaps, were the courtroom thriller Suspect (1987), and the political drama House de Carroll Street (1988) 2011 , following directing a few films until death in 2011 (age 81).",

      "reviewBody": "Funny and amusing film , though middlingly directed by José Maria Elorrieta . A witch (gorgeous Maria Perschy) from the 16th century falls for a modern-day professor (Jeffrey Hunter) and by means of a magic amulet she sends him on an adventure in time in which he becomes involved into abundant problems , first to the Stone Age , after the Nero emperor time and eventually a far future where there aren&apos;t men ,but with plenty of women (Paloma Cela and several others) .\n\nThis likable movie relies heavily in confusion , mayhem when a professor meets a fantastic witch appearing here and there , and even troubles arise when he is wonderfully transported to Stone Age and Roman time .This flick features beautiful girls , inadequate costumes , dated atrezzo and stodgy action sequences , feeling too cheap and though actually convince us at times , it results to be an average flick . It&apos;s the sort of story that surprises us due to the ridiculous , absurd happenings and with non-sense set pieces . Here stands out the enjoyable performances from the American Jeffrey Hunter and Austrian Maria Perschy as the bombshell who seduces him . They&apos;re well accompanied by an all-support-Spanish-cast , such as : Perla Cristal , Gustavo Rojo, Félix Dafauce , Marisol Ayuso, Julio Pérez Tabernero , Antonio Pica ,Alfonso de la Vega , Esperanza Roy ,Frank Braña and Al Mulock -playing Wurlitz the Wizard- who a bit later on , he committed suicide on the set of his last movie The Good , The Bad and the Ugly (1968) by jumping from a hotel, on location in Guadix, Andalucia.\n\nAtmospheric cinematography by cameraman Alfonso Nieva showing Madrid outdoors , being shot on various location in Colmenar Viejo , Manzanares del Real , La Pedriza, Madrid and Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain .

Pink, a North American producer who financed several co-productions in Spain, such as : Fuego, El valle de las Espadas, Tabu, La llamada, Un sudario a su medida , Joe Navidad, Finger on the trigger, Una bruja sin escoba, among others.

      "reviewBody": "Errol Morris&apos;s &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; manages to be, in its succinct 80 minutes, a moving biopic and a thought-provoking documentary. Based on the best-selling book of the same name by British cosmologist Stephen Hawking (1942- ), it is accessible for those who are not science experts (without being condescending), yet still have an interest in questions about the origins of the universe and, therefore, ourselves (will time ever come to an end? which came first, the chicken or the egg?; and so on).\n\nFeaturing interviews with the Hawkings (Isobel and Mary Hawkings, Stephen&apos;s mom and sister, respectively), Janet Humphrey (Stephen&apos;s aunt), several people related to the world of science (astrophysicists, professors, researchers, etc.), plus interviews and clips from lectures with Mr. Hawkings himself, we reflect on some of the most fundamental questions about our creation. The beyond reasonable, sensible and bright conclusions presented by this man whose body might be paralyzed, but whose mind is one of the greatest of all time (few would argue against this statement) make this film both a fascinating lecture (or, even better, meditation) and an inspirational life story. And with his fantastic reasoning and suavity, Hawkings ends up proving (as far as reasoning can prove, or define, the power of faith), the very existence of God. A great achievement of filmmaking, perception, philosophy, science, and perseverance. Bravo, Mr. Hawkings. Bravo, Mr. Errol Morris."

This Aida was interesting in a sense for historical value, but it didn&apos;t work for me.\n\nGranted, despite the score being cut/shortened, the music is brilliant. Renata Tebaldi sings Aida absolutely wonderfully, Ebe Stignani is a compelling Amneris and Gino Becchi a powerful Amonasro. Rhadames is sung very nicely too, Guilio Neri is one of the better Ramfis&apos;s I&apos;ve heard and Sophia Loren looks beautiful and gives her all to what she&apos;s got.\n\nHowever, the film does look dated. The costumes are alright, but the sets in alternative to grand are rather cheesy and the editing and picture quality look tacky. Despite such amazing music and singing, the film feels rather dull, some of the best dramatic elements are either cut or badly underplayed especially the Bass-Tenor chorus ensemble, the choreography looks unimaginative, the lip-synching is pretty much a disaster with the lip movements rarely being in sync to the singing, and there are some unnecessary added scenes too which add nothing to the story. The on-screen acting apart from Loren and perhaps Afro Poli is lacking too, Rhadames is bland and seemingly unheroic, but Lois Maxwell fares worse, her acting throughout is very awkward.\n\nAll in all, rather disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m just going to get this out of the way first. Yes, the main hero in this movie&apos;s name is Kirk, and he&apos;s a captain in the army. So yes. they refer to him throughout the picture as &quot;Captain Kirk&quot;. Now, to me, that&apos;s HILARIOUS. i had to rewind the movie just to make sure i wasn&apos;t hearing things. And there was even an officer named &quot;O&apos;Brien&quot; later on in the movie. I&apos;m shocked that the monster&apos;s name wasn&apos;t &quot;Riker&quot;. But enough of the good stuff, let&apos;s dive into &quot;Panic&quot;.\n\nThis movie is another on our awesome 50 chilling classics collection at number 26. Now i took a two week break at the halfway mark, and coming back, i&apos;m not so sure WHY i came back. OK, if you looked at the top, i gave this movie a 2. So what&apos;s the big problem with this movie you may ask? One word. PACING. This movie&apos;s pacing is TERRIBLE. this 90 minute movie has a plot that could either have been resolved in 15 minutes but it also had the plot to stage an entire 90 minute movie if they did it correctly. Sadly, here, they did not. It&apos;s really sad when i understand more of the movie from reading the one paragraph DVD sleeve in my Box set, but that seems to be happening more and more with these movies. And this movie is no exception. on the DVD sleeve it says &quot;A British research scientist is working with various forms of bacteria when he is accidentally exposed to a deadly variety due to a lab accident.&quot; OK. there are 3 problems with that sentence. 1. This movie is Italian, not British. But all the actors are dubbed British so they put in stock pictures of England. Why? I&apos;m not sure. 2. No, i did not accidentally type &quot;Variety&quot; instead of &quot;Virus&quot; That is what actually was printed on my DVD sleeve. and 3. IT NEVER SHOWS YOU THAT IN THE MOVIE. in the film it starts out with some rats fighting in a lab, a guy grabs his face and that&apos;s it. i had NO idea what happened. and honestly, i STILL have no idea what happened.\n\nLike i said though. This movie is S-L-O-W. it takes forever to make any point and while the movie has a relatively high body count, all kills are offscreen and in the dark. and they quickly cut away from any sort of interesting nudity. pff. this considers itself a monster mash film? There&apos;s at least 3 times in the movie where they could have stopped this monster dude but then...they didn&apos;t for some reason? and that just gives them an excuse to have lengthy scenes of them talking. um. yay? I really had to pull out the DS during this movie. it was more than i could do to pay HALF attention to it let alone ALL my attention. But i gave it a good go. i gave it 45 minutes of my undivided attention and there was so little going on i realized that i could do at least 2 more things at once and still know exactly what was going on. and you know what? i was right.\n\nThe ending is extremely abrupt with no time for an epilogue and the final scene just makes NO sense. i&apos;m not going to give the ending away but i will say 5 words. &quot;Fire extinguisher? What the crap?&quot; With pacing that could bore Ben Stein, characters that are less enjoyable then a Disney channel sitcom line-up, and an ending more predictable than the ending to &quot;The Village&quot;, Panic gets 2 melty faces, out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "The basic premise of this ultra-low budgeted slasher is completely unoriginal, the gore-effects are cheesier than you can even imagine, the dialogs are laughably inept, the acting performances are pathetic, the script is hopelessly incoherent and yet .... this is a horror effort from The Netherlands, so please forgive me in case I can&apos;t possibly bring myself to speak overly negative about it! During the past few years, this country (which happens to be my neighbor to the North) is really trying hard to build up a halfway decent horror reputation, and &quot;Woensdag&quot; certainly deserves to be mentioned as one of the films that played a role in this process. More recently, other Dutch filmmakers had a little more commercial success with the surprisingly entertaining &quot;Sl8N8&quot; and the sadly disappointing &quot;Dood Eind&quot;, both of which benefited from a much larger budget. The title simply means &quot;Wednesday&quot;, which is fairly insignificant because the events of the film may as well take place at any given day of the week. Like so many recent horror/teen-slashers lately (&quot;My Little Eye&quot;, &quot;Halloween: Resurrection&quot;, ...), the plot of &quot;Woensdag&quot; revolves on an interactive reality-TV show where the participants  surprise, surprise  quickly get killed off by an unwelcome visitor. Admittedly, however, the setting and concept of this reality-TV show is still somewhat cool and refreshing. Eight young people are challenged to survive a night in the dark woods where, according to a local legend, a sadistic killer wanders around. The live TV-show is well-prepared, with actors imposing as killers and fake ambushes all over the forest, but the silly game becomes deadly serious when the first contestant dies for real. The creators of this little flick clearly did their homework and studied a whole lot of typically American 80&apos;s slashers. The legendary &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; in particular, as the killer is almost an exact clone of the notoriously immortal machete-wielding killer of Camp Crystal Lake. Either with or without the mask covering his face, the killer could by Jason Voorhees&apos; overseas twin-brother! The gore is a bit difficult to judge, actually. There&apos;s plenty of grossness going on, including implements, slit throats, decapitations and dismemberment, but the effects aren&apos;t very professional and couldn&apos;t even disturb a small child. The lighting, editing and camera-work are terribly poor, and I guess this movie holds very little value in case you&apos;re not a horror fan living in The Netherlands or Belgium. But, if you do live here, it&apos;s an encouraging and worthwhile time-waster.",

Several scenes are just laugh-out-loud funny. The female interest, Arija Bareikis, is not someone I was familiar with but I liked her wholesome looks. William Forsythe plays the villain and, of course, he&apos;s over-the-top. The film had a nice soundtrack, a lot of familiar rock tunes.\n\nAs with most modern comedies, this gets carried and a little stupid at the end but, overall the film is good low-grade fun (and I mean &quot;low grade!&quot;)"

However, there is more than one version of the incident which resulted in her death.\n\nI love several things about this movie. Denzel is perfect as always. He needs to hold the center while having a compelling emotional story. Meg Ryan does the hardest acting of her career by bringing different versions of her character to life. Lou Diamond Phillips is great. Matt Damon is unrecognizable. It also has the Rashômon style of storytelling. I love that method. It feels more compelling than the straight forward way. It also feels more real with differing point of views.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.\n\nThe film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn&apos;t seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.\n\nOn this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn&apos;t care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.\n\nUnfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value."

The treatment is sardonic and distant; we rarely see anyone in a closeup, and the point of view is as critical of liberalization (embodied in bad rock and go-go dancing) as it is of the cult of Mao (performed in the hilarious socialist-patriotic opera at the beginning of the movie). As Fassbinder said of the movies of Douglas Sirk, material objects--a brick wall, a pile of boards, a marketful of cheap clothing, bowls of noodles, embroidered slipcovers, copies of bellbottom pants, a truck, etc.--are at the center of the mise en scene, appropriately so, since the story is indeed about material changes. In fact the movie bears a lot of resemblance to Fassbinder&apos;s Marriage of Maria Braun, as both trace growing prosperity, consumerism, and personal alienation through a sequence of rooms, houses, relationships, and home furnishings. Provincial China moves from dirt, scarcity, and collectivism to a modest supply of consumer goods and more individual freedom/insecurity. This historical movement is intertwined with the characters&apos; aging from their teens to middle age. There is no appreciable increase in human joy and happiness, nor a marked decrease either. This cold, distant treatment will not please some viewers.",

No. This film is so outrageously bad, even by bad movie standards. But it doesn&apos;t fall into the gray zone of boring bad. It&apos;s not bad like other bad films. A million typing monkeys couldn&apos;t have come up with a more disjointed script. After reading other reviews, positive and negative, I suspect that a lot of the people who watched it were too stunned to even remember how messed up the continuity was. This is like three bad films in one (at least parts of three bad films, randomly cut together) As far as I remember, it starts off with the story of the friends roll-playing, then they start to die, before anyone figures out what is happening- Adam starts killing some other people, for no apparent reason, then he goes to a party. I won&apos;t give away the ending, which comes rather out of left field. In the end I was confused. \n\nYes, put it out on DVD, it&apos;s been too long since I saw it. (I too used to inflict this film on others, watching it is like picking at a scab.) I can&apos;t cast a vote, it&apos;s awful and great. Please, recommended for weirdo&apos;s only."

It is Fords great humanity and sense of justice which makes this film so appealing.\n\nSome of the narrative is forced and the resolution is pat. What we do have is Fords beautiful colour camera in Monument Valley, ala &quot;The Searchers ( 1956 )&quot;, broad humour, defined characterizations and attention to detail both individual and historical.\n\nJeffrey Hunter, always an underrated actor, is fine as the lead, but it is Woody Strode as the title character that is a stand out. His courtroom scene defending his beliefs and humanity is truly moving as is his scene as he rides back to save his troop. A &quot; man mountain&quot; he is ! Through his physical presence Ford coaxes out subtle nuances of character which give the role a ring of truth. Supporting him we have Fords usual wonderful stock players. Although not as poetic or thought out as some of Fords other films this is still miles ahead of other peoples efforts."

(Although I will argue this film is a good case that the, &apos;female gaze&apos;, and objectification of men was indeed around in decades gone).\n\nEverything about this film had me engrossed because it just would not be made today and it&apos;s so lame 80&apos;s it&apos;s hilarious throughout but also fascinatingly cool in a retro way.\n\nI didn&apos;t really pay much attention to the story as I was to engrossed in the camp and comedic to care, but the plots is so basic you&apos;ll know how the entire movie will roll, at about the four minute mark.\n\nThe whole thing is a slice of nostalgia, even for those who weren&apos;t around in the 80&apos;s.\n\nWant to step into the head of what a late 1980&apos;s 13 year old girl dreams being 16 is like, then watch this. Fan of camp, cult or pop culture, watch this. Want to see the guys actual tongue slide in out of the girls mouth in the kiss scene, errrr you can watch this as well.

      "reviewBody": "Barbara Stanwyck is very good in this melodrama, but I believe little praise has been given to King Vidor, whom I have grown to appreciate in recent years as one of the best classic American filmmakers of all times. Precisely for this reason I finally acquired this film and enjoyed it very much, especially as he shows great perception to depict the cruel and too frequent irreconcilable differences that end relationships. In movies like «The Crowd», «Our Daily Bread», «Street Scene», «Hallelujah!» and even «Bird of Paradise» or &quot;Solomon and Sheba» Vidor intelligently dealt with social, cultural, ethnic, economic or ideological differences, that still affect people and quite often impede any one of us to find happiness. Perhaps the ornamented Stella is a bit overdone, especially in the hotel sequence after she has previously demonstrated how to control her tendency to be excessive and vulgar in dress, make-up, hair style or social manners, when Mr. Dallas picks up their daughter to spend Christmas with him. But most of the time Vidor keeps everything tight, including Sherman Todd&apos;s film editing, and even Alfred Newman&apos;s melodramatic string overflows are well measured. I must add that the rest of the cast is all good, making «Stella Dallas» a rewarding film experience.",

The plot not so much. The macho theme throughout and the sexism or rather not pc friendly portrayal of women (mostly), may also get this into trouble with some. I always have to remind myself when I watch older movies that they had different ... let&apos;s call them priorities. That doesn&apos;t mean that the women in this are just here to look good (although some may not even feel that, considering the age of the movie, the clothes and hairdos and all that)! No they also have something to say and be mad about ... the last thing again not always pc friendly ... try to remember that and maybe give this some slack ... otherwise you probably should just avoid this",

OWW conveyed real heart felt emotion with many excellent scenes, this broken hearted sequel on the other hand went in a completely different direction - more to the style of a typical mediocer action flick. No where near as good as the first but not a bad movie on its own.\n\nPLOT IRREGULARITIES: Others have commented on this and its true - Sonny is no where in OWW, which on its own can be over looked. BUT in OWW there&apos;s a scene where Beth is talking about how Jake was &quot;bosting about his baby boy&quot; (refering to Nig) as if Nig was there first born child - but then all of a sudden Sonny appears on the scene. Sounds very much like a case of inventing characters just to make the sequel a bit interesting. Whether they achieved that or not is debatable."

I feel the writer&apos;s human approach to expressing the conflict between the white and the black man shows for all to see that we are, all, in the human race and need to learn to overcome our superior selfishness whether white or black. These 2 men become friends even to learning from each other and they both show they are indeed able to share there lives with respect for each other. They learn to trust each other and to protect each other. The haunting theme music so sets off this story. It sets the stage with the emotion, giving the viewer a real feel for the truths in this wonderful story.",

Vasilienko eventually escapes and plots revenge, creating a virus called The Rage, which turns victims into uncontrollable bloodthirsty maniacs; only when his cancer cure is publicly acknowledged will he release the antidote.\n\nThings go awry, however, when one of the mad scientist&apos;s test subjects escapes into the woods, dies and become vulture fodder: the birds also contract The Rage, and become airborne killers, which is not good news for a bunch of &apos;twenty-somethings&apos; (including Erin Brown AKA Misty Mundae, star of many a soft-core sex flick) who are travelling through the area in their RV.\n\nWith shonky vomiting mad-vulture puppets, a death-during-sex scene (always a winner), a killer hunchback dwarf wearing the face and hair of a little girl (and grunting silly phrases such as &apos;kiss the monkey&apos;!), giant leech attacks, and CGI feces (seen as a pole is rammed into the ass of a bald, blind &apos;zombie&apos; called Gor!), The Rage is sheer low-budget lunacy from a film-maker who is obviously having loads of fun entertaining us.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; is a &quot;splatter Western,&quot; directed by horror vet Sam Raimi (whose latest, as of this writing, is &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; but who cut his teeth on the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy).  It&apos;s set in the oh-so-ironically named lawless town of Redemption, a haven of grotesques that gives us an idea what the wild West would&apos;ve looked like if had been painted, not by Frederic Remington, but by Heironymus Bosch.  \n\nIn a surfeit of Biblical nomenclature, the town&apos;s mayor/owner/capo is named Herod (Gene Hackman at his oiliest, complete with bad hair).  Into town there rides a mysterious stranger, not Clint Eastwood this time but Sharon Stone.  I&apos;m not the world&apos;s biggest Stone fan, but this movie and &quot;Total Recall&quot; indicate that she has her uses in kick-butt action roles that make no demands on her limited thespianic skills.  As gunslinger Ellen, she&apos;s doubly armed--with a six-shooter, and with an axe to grind; even her &quot;inner child&quot; packs a gun.  She enters Herod&apos;s to-the-death fast-draw tournament, a no-win, no-exit, potentially no-survivors affair, with an agenda on her mind other than just winning the prize money.  \n\nThis is an overripe, over-wrought movie, but it mostly works.  Raimi all but erases the slim wall between the horror and Western genres:  Redemption is another Transylvanian village of simple peasants lorded over by by an evil baron, and the atmosphere--palpably oppressive and claustrophobic--could be cut with a knife.  Leonardo di Caprio and veteran character actors Lance Henriksen and Roberts Blossom effectively round out the cast, and the action scenes--exaggerated, mythic, often darkly humorous--deliver.  If you&apos;re more of a horror fan than a Western fan, this may be the Western for you."

The two women, each at a watershed in their lives, draw something from each other without being able to relate to each other properly.\n\nIt has an ungainly, unstructured feel to it  more sentiment than substance - like a day imperfectly remembered, which amounts to a startling, artless realism. The smudgy black and white Hungarian landscape and sparse dialogue are forefunners of Tarr&apos;s, and there are some nicely observed characters. Women will connect with Meszaros&apos; worldview: life as a forlorn struggle to be as benign as one might want to be, but inevitably held back by the sheer dourness of the world. So we make do with what we have and hope that things occasionally work out, as they do here. Winner of the Golden Bear."

      "reviewBody": "Ah, the joys of watching Walken -I could  watch him read the phonebook and be captivated (hey he should do that sometime) This film is an excellent one. It has a very nice low-key mood. It takes place in Queens (where I live and breathe) It has a great safe-cracking heist plot as well as enjoyable  scenes of Walken practicing his craft. see this movie when you are feeling well i don&apos;t know if i should say down but when you feel that you&apos;re miserable i guess this is a fine film to watch--not that its depressing but I mean thelow-key approach works perfectly and  the score fits in perfectly with the movie. which i for one enjoyed here more and really only noticed during the end-credits    and it has actuall characters as opposed to cardboard cutouts that the actors take and make nbeautiful music with.  . The real joy in watching this movie is in the performances and in them the way the story unfolds. It is so great to see walken acting   in a calm  role that is much more of a person then the usuall role he takes the scene-stealing villian (which I must admit I am a huge fan of) but walken is so much more than that as witnessed in great films like this, and(I&apos;m not comparing films here) natrually his oscar wining role in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;  I&quot;ve seen him on stage in Joyce&apos;s &quot;The Dead&quot; and a play which he wrote himself some years ago called &quot;Him&quot; Ah that was a great play seriously best damn play! Ok, so you know I think the world of Walken and that any and every movie could benefit form giving him a bit part in it but I don&apos;t mean to take away from the rest of the cast here  and this film is excellently acted all around I mean this is truly a character film and this movie simply could not work if they didn&apos;t have a good cast First of all- Who knew Cyndi Lauper could act?? I mean I liked the three or four epiosdes she did on &quot;Mad about You&quot; but she wasn&apos;t holding her own with walken there. While she&apos;s not in that many scenes she&apos;s surprisingly good  and therefore hope to see her in something else that&apos;s good  Donal Louge who&apos;s everywhere now (thoughts I once had about Walken)  continues to build up his resume quite impressively\n\nand of course Peter McDonald as the instigator of the whole film He has a reletively thick irish accent but if you listen carefully its not hard at all to get what he&apos;s saying  and Jose Zuniga and Vera Farmiga and oh hey Tom Noonan who makes a brief return from career obscurity (or is it oblivion at this stage) to play that wacky supplier of safe-bustin materials His career should be resurrected if only briefly Ok well the characters are great and its the actors who bring the characters to life so they deserved acolades for that but the biggest accolade has to be for writer director O&apos;Connell who made a heist film that&apos;s really a character film and how many films can we say that about.I honestly will keep an eyeout for his next film. (I hope that Abel Ferrar is taking notes after The New Rose Hotel although The king of NY is awesome and The Funeral is terrific too but still I&apos;m digressing again) Its low key charm was nothing short of brillant and its running time well who needs running time was without a doubt just right. While not like a fast movie the movie moves pretty swiftly as it reaches its ending without any real lull in the procedings  Ok while the movie isnt perfect (i did  find myself wishing that walken would just get to deliver a line in signature style which he does very quickly (you know the whole theatric gestural thing that i love)and he does have some good lines that he gets to deliver deadpan while remainning perfectly in character. (&quot;i&apos;m beginning to think there&apos;s something wrong with you.&quot; is just such an example) )\n\nSo in Summary as you can tell I am a huge Christopher Walken fan and even with some of the dreck he&apos;s  been in--he&apos;s always entertaining and this film I can say with the utmost confidence is not dreck and if you&apos;re in the right mood-- really enjoyable. So Thank You Mr. O&apos; Connell for writing a good script for the greatest actor in the universe!!!!"

Just a couple of weeks ago I was watching &apos;Kohinoor&apos;, another film of the 50s that falls in the same genre, where the heroine had a very clichéd damsel in distress. In &apos;Baaz&apos; (falcon) where the heroine plays the title role, she is brave, strong, sensual, a skilled fighter and a good leader throughout the whole film. Even after she falls in love with the prince, she isn&apos;t &apos;tamed&apos;. Then again, I shouldn&apos;t be so surprised as the female lead has always been a strong component of the one and only Guru Dutt&apos;s films.\n\nSpeaking of the film, &apos;Baaz&apos; is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However, some may feel that it&apos;s a little too anti-Portuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace, it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint, especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant (but it&apos;s funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies) and the choreography is mostly dazzling (for the fight scenes and the dances).\n\nGeeta Bali effortlessly pulls off Baaz/Nisha. Next to her firm screen presence, she fights, dances and of course acts very well. The charismatic Guru Dutt looks and acts like a prince and has the right chemistry with his heroine. Kuldip Kaur is over the top but funny at times. K.N. Singh is the evil general. Ruby Mayer is good too.\n\n&apos;Baaz&apos; is a great classic adventure film that can easily be enjoyed with the family around. This genre seems to be lost in the recent trend of Indian cinema. But hey, the classics are always there for us to revisit."

      "reviewBody": "In the series of Warner Bros/Busby Berkeley musicals stretching from 42ND Street to Varsity Show, Wonder Bar remains the least appreciated (and perhaps the least seen).  It&apos;s quite remarkable in that the plot, aside from a few opening scenes, keeps &quot;real time&quot; and relationships begin/end, lives are lost, and and all sorts of minor dramas are tied up neatly in one evening at a nightclub.\n\nAl Jolson, as the club owner, takes some getting used to, but he&apos;s actually more low-key than usual here--and even a bit touching in scenes.  And how fabulous do Kay Francis and Delores Del Rio look in this film?  Who cares if they can&apos;t act--they do lots of radiant posing and wear gorgeous outfits. There are some bits with Louise Fazenda and a much younger man that left me gasping.  The brief (and very funny) &quot;gay scene&quot; and hunky Ricardo Cortez whipping Del Rio also had me shaking my head in disbelief.  Anyone care to count how many censorship Code infractions are contained in this film? It raised a stir with the Catholic church and Legion of Decency, and I&apos;ve read a memo somewhere that some audiences reportedly were appalled by the goings-on in this movie (it was a hit though--grossing nearly a million dollars for the studio).\n\nIf you&apos;re reading about this movie you already know about the musical numbers--&quot;Don&apos;t Say Goodnight&quot;, with its octagon of mirrors and chorus stretching into infinity, and &quot;Goin to Heaven on a Mule&quot;, with the blackface angels and dancing watermelon.  &quot;Mule&quot; is beyond belief--it must&apos;ve been a killer on the big screen.  Viewers are still offended by it, and certainly should be--all it is missing is a Grand Dragon.\n\nA witty, fascinating, naughty, beautifully photographed film.  If 42ND Street is the king of the WB/Busby Berkeley crown, Wonder Bar is the banished, scandalous cousin that is inevitably more fun.",

Behind plastic tarps with swastikas spray painted on them are portals to 1958 where Nazi fugitive Max Shreck is torturing and burning small town locals. The interior shots in this movie are in a house decorated with pin-ups from Fangoria magazine. The ghosts who serve Shreck are simply men under white sheets. I must say, the torture devices dreamed up by the writers were quite elaborate. Without giving too much away I&apos;ll mention a swastika necklace used as a ninja star and a swastika ceiling fan/lawnmower blade. A lot funnier than a pixilated ogre.\n\nMove over &quot;Splatter Farm&quot;, the is the most offensive shot-on-vhs film from the American underground that I&apos;ve discovered."

      "reviewBody": "This film is sometimes described as a comedy, and while it has humorous bits (a more sardonic and biting form of humour most of the time), it has never really felt at home being classified as a comedy, in my estimation. I do like the rapid-fire wit that Holmes seems to have here (a bit more in abundance than in the canonical Conan Doyle stories), but the Holmes presented here is a bit more dark and brooding, more akin to the extra-canonical &apos;Seven Percent Solution&apos; Holmes in many ways.\n\nWilder was an extraordinary director and genius who sometimes gets carried away with his subject (in this regard, he is sometimes compared with Stanley Kubrick). His films are often of epic-proportions, even though they are not essentially &apos;epic&apos; subjects. This film is reputed to have been nearly twice as long as the final cut version, but this may be apocryphal in that much of the raw footage never made it to final print and production. The restoration available on the disc currently available is, in fact, rather minimal - a few scenes and a few extras, but not much more than the original release of the film. This is disappointing to many fans, but in fact is more than most of us have had for a long time, as the somewhat choppy film was often mercilessly cut for television broadcast.\n\nHolmes in this case is played by Robert Stephens, an unlikely Holmes in comparison to standards such as Rathbone, Brett, or Gillette, but still an interesting choice - quintessentially British, reserved but daring, brilliant yet flawed and faltering. Colin Blakely presents a stronger Watson than often portrayed before (this film, being made in 1970, presented this as a newer idea for Watson, one that has been picked up by many subsequent productions). Wilder has the actors play at various issues of Victorian sensibility and morality, including the implication (dismissed in the end) that Holmes might have a sexual identity issue. Christopher Lee, who himself plays Holmes in other productions, plays Holmes&apos; smarter brother Mycroft here, to good effect.\n\nThe story line does have some inspiration from the canonical stories (the Bruce-Partington Plans, for one), and from Gillette&apos;s play (the strange case of Miss Faulkner, introducing an ending that allowed for a love interest for Holmes in the end), but for the most part takes the characters from Conan Doyle and runs far afield. Still, this is must-see film for any fan of Holmes, and any fan of Wilder, who saw this as one of his last great productions.",

      "description": "Considered by many Holmesians to be the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made, Billy Wilder&apos;s THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is both an affectionate parody, and a brilliant, melancholy celebration of Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s famous detective.\n\nSherlock Holmes (Robert Stephens) and Dr. Watson (Colin Blakely), are tasked with locating the missing husband of a mysterious woman fished out of the River Thames. The course of their investigation leads them to Scotland and encounters with a group of monks, some dwarfs and even the Loch Ness Monster. Can Holmes and Watson crack the case?\n\nCo-written by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond (one of eleven screenplays they wrote together) and starring the late great Christopher Lee as Sherlock&apos;s brother Mycroft, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is one of the most underrated films in Billy Wilder&apos;s filmography, and The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film for Blu-ray for the first time in the UK.",

The unpleasant story, where the political and economical situation of this future and the characters are awfully developed, has many situations not explained. We just see the lead character running most of the time tracked by a stupid dog that kills everybody. Better off sleep, since watching this movie is a pure waste of time. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Rottweiler&quot;",

It&apos;s not about the Dora, but, as the title states, her crew, all good-looking young men. It starts out with Josef Dahmen about to be married to Charlott Daudert, but she changes her mind at the last minute. This means that his mates try to deal with his depression by hooking him up with another girl.\n\nThis and other plots about the love life of German Luftwaffe crew makes up about half the movie. The other half consists of most of the crew in the African campaign, stranded in the desert and waiting for rescue that seems will never come.\n\nIn other words, it&apos;s an ordinary war movie, competently made by Karl Ritter. He has a reputation of being a bad film maker, a reputation I feel that is based on the large amounts of propaganda in his movies from the middle of the 1930s; yes, it&apos;s there, and it&apos;s annoying, but somehow no one ever complains about the propaganda content of Soviet films from the 1920s and 1930s. Looking at Ritter, I will freely admit that as a writer-director-producer, he was not a great writer, but here, with a standard sort of adventure movie, with the propaganda not noticeable, it&apos;s a nice flick.",

      "reviewBody": "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969, films that did well at the box-office but mostly panned critically (especially his later films) and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.\n\nFor a mid-60s onwards Elvis film, &apos;Girl Happy&apos; is pretty good and while not one of his best films, like &apos;King Creole&apos;, &apos;Flaming Star&apos;, &apos;Jailhouse Rock&apos;, &apos;Viva Las Vegas&apos; and &apos;Loving You&apos;, it is a long way from one of his worst (much worse followed).\n\nThe story is thin and formulaic, with parts not always making sense, and the dialogue is corn and silliness-heavy and enough to make one cringe. The extras&apos; acting is indeed awfully wooden and just looks amateurish.\n\nHowever, the settings are suitably exotic and the film is beautifully photographed. On the most part, the songs are good. Could have done without &quot;Wolf Call&quot; and &quot;Do the Clam&quot;, the latter of which also being pretty embarrassingly choreographed, but the title song, &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; and &quot;The Meanest Girl in Town&quot;.\n\n&apos;Girl Happy&apos; is fun and good-natured, knowing exactly what it wanted to be, who to aim it at and never tries to do anything more. It&apos;s all competently directed and breezily paced, while Elvis is clearly enjoying himself and is well supported by charming and fiery Shelley Fabarres, menacing Harold J. Stone and perky Mary Ann Morbley. The chemistry between Elvis and Fabarres is great.\n\nAll in all, good bouncy fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. This 2000 version, directed by Harold Ramis is not so much a remake as a latter-day re-imagining of the story.  Aside from the basic premise, the two films share little else in common.  This new version is a wacky, fast-paced farce that makes up in some giddily amusing moments what it lacks in true wickedness.\n\nBrendan Fraser is perfectly cast as the hapless computer tech who makes a deal with Satan; granted seven wishes in exchange for eventual possession of his soul, we witness each wish he makes as his life becomes a series of colorful and very funny misadventures.  Some first-rate make-up and special effects transform Fraser and his world every time he changes wishes. Elizabeth Hurley is extremely fetching and quite likable as the embodiment of Satan, although I wish she&apos;d showed a bit more evilness than glee in her characterization.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining movie that, of course, leaves the door open for a sequel.  Bring it on!"

I hadn&apos;t thought of that scene in decades, had no idea of the name of the film, and must have caught it on television. How I can remember this but can&apos;t remember to take a towel to a swimming pool is beyond me.\n\nA rather middle-aged line up of stars in this one too, I notice. David Janssen is an ex-CIA agent looking for a man called John Benson, who has recorded a cassette that could bring down the whole organisation. Only we the audience know that Benson has had his throat slit shortly after the film begins (well, I guess the killer knows it too). Janssen is drawing a lot of attention and is being followed around by stony-faced agent Ivan Rassimov, who brings him before the pure malice of Arthur Kennedy. Arthur doesn&apos;t like that Janssen now makes a living publishing novels about CIA operations and wants to know what he&apos;s up to, and he&apos;s not above getting Janssen the odd kicking to put his point across.\n\nJanssen also hooks up with his buddy Maurizio Merli, another agent operating in Athens with a secret to hide and Janssen&apos;s lovely ex Corrine Clery as a girlfriend. Merli has his own problems - he knows where Benson&apos;s cassette is and he may also know who paid for the drug dealer to be shot at the start of the film. Kennedy also wants rid of Merli and has arranged for Merli to be &apos;taken care of&apos; by his successor Giacomo Rossi-Stuart (who doesn&apos;t do or say anything in this film). Philipe Leroy also drops in as a friendly Greek policeman and things start getting violent once everyone tries to track down the cassette.\n\nI was quite taken with this one as I guess it is a throwback to the old Euro-spy films. It has quite a few twists in it and for a change Maurizio Merli has a bit more to his character than just being a punching and killing machine, although he gets to do that too. Clery nearly makes it to the end without getting naked (she doesn&apos;t make it though) and Arthur Kennedy plays the most gleefully evil villain I&apos;ve seen in a long time. There&apos;s some truly cruel happens to Janssen in the film and Kennedy takes great delight in prolonging the agony. It&apos;s Kennedy and Merli that make the film, no doubt.\n\nIn summation:95% of Greece is made up of CIA agents.",

      "reviewBody": "LIGHT AND THE SUFFERER is a peculiar little exercise in dreamy cross-genre abstraction which centers on two young native-Manhattan brothers, one a hopeless addict, the other a more grounded, though susceptive college dropout. They mutually agree that starting a new life in California would benefit them both, but lacking the necessary funds for this move, they devise a scheme to rob a smalltime dope-pusher. The plan goes awry, however, and the brothers must lay low to avoid the dope pusher&apos;s lackeys. To complicate matters even more, they find themselves being incessantly tracked by a &quot;sufferer&quot;...a quadrupedal, silent creature with a humanlike head. Though these beings are confirmed to be extraterrestrial, no further exposition of their origins is given...their existence in the world seems understood, and is moreless acknowledged with offhand indifference. They are, however, regarded with some degree of disesteem, in that they habitually, albeit nonthreateningly, stalk individuals in the midst of a personal quandary or other such impasse in their lives. The motives for this behavior are argued but never fully clarified, though being &quot;followed&quot; is seen as a frustrating and potentially distressing ordeal which carries a rather touchy social stigma.\n\nAn earnest microbudget endeavor sourced from a story by cult writer Jonathan Lethem, it&apos;s surprisingly well appointed, and alluringly shot with an artful eye. A methodically slow-burning picture, its primary focus is more on the dilemma faced by the key characters than on the fantastical materiality of tailgating alien man-dogs. It could possibly be argued that the creatures have a figurative placement in the story, though what, exactly, they might represent is anybody&apos;s guess. I personally don&apos;t have a problem with vague narratives, but it might put-off some viewers, as will the primitive but sparingly used CGI effects.\n\nIn a nutshell, a flawed but mindfully prepared ambrosia with a pinch of hard-boiled neo-noir, a dash of sci-fi, and a sprinkling of plaintive sentiment...an oddly flavorful dish unlikely to appease all appetites.\n\n5.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "Originally from Cleveland, William Blake gets a job as an accountant in a place called &quot;Machine Town&quot;. Already in the train that takes him to the Dickinson wood factory an &quot;unknown guy&quot; warn him against the place he is going to. It is not fortune that awaits him but Death. Indeed the first night in &quot;Machine Town&quot;, Blake is shot at and wounded. From this point on start a long journey of wandering in company of Nobody, an Indian and a philosopher. \n\nThis black and white film is mesmerizing. Obviously the black and white marks a rupture between what you are used toSo in essence this rupture is between let say classic Western and Jim Jarmush western as he re-visit the genre. It is also a way to keep the audience to what is essentialColor is a filter that can distract you, the sobriety of black and white will not. \n\nBut what exactly is essential in that movie? Beside the fact that Mr. Jarmush depict a brutal and impulsive America, the movie opposes a new born civilization that is already collapsing and a dying one that is still shiningBut more than that the journey of William Blake is a metaphoric and circular voyage from misunderstanding to certitude. The guide Nobody, himself trapped between the two civilizations can not provide a cure to the passing man but may very well provide a path to a curing one. This journey from Machine Town, the &quot;anti chamber&quot; of hell to the sea, first step to Heaven is tremendously poetic and emotional. Also emotional is the evolution from misunderstanding to comprehension between Nobody and William Blake who eventually settles on what is essential reaching a common ground, clarity \n\nHelp by a haunting and beautiful score from Neil Young and an extraordinary cast the film succeed in transforming the wood wagon of hell in which William Blake embarks to the wooden vessel to heaven in which he will lie. \n\nOne of the best films from Mr. Jarmush, Dead Man manages to take the audience in one of cinema most poetic journey",

      "reviewBody": "I was stuck in an Austrian bed and breakfast on Pentecost (Pfingsten)Weekend and caught this one. It&apos;s about an elderly couple in a nursing home, who believe they have been invited to Sunday dinner by their relatives. They have to navigate all sorts of new-fangled inventions (like the subway system) to get to their destination, and there are lots of humorous moments. When they arrive, the relatives aren&apos;t at home. Presumably they had told the old folks &quot;we&apos;ll have you over for dinner on Pentecost&quot; and never expected them to remember the invitation. The ending takes place in a church and has mystical overtones.\n\nI got the impression that this film is shown every year at Pentecost for the kiddies (like we show Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer at Christmas). Although this movie is pretty saccharine, it was a good insight into German culture, and was easy to follow for a young American practicing German!",

However the film itself proves unfortunately melodramatic (too many long scenes of Jekyll having outbursts of guilty emotions over the actions of Hyde is the biggest shortcoming). The changes to the story were novel but at the same time managed to turn Jekyll into a simpering wimp compared to a much stronger Hyde. I also fails to make us feel sympathy for any of Hyde&apos;s victims..still for some reason I find myself sometimes going back to this one.",
