This is one of my daughter&apos;s favorite movies. \n\nIt&apos;s a movie that entertains your little one&apos;s and yet keeps the interest of adults, so you can all enjoy a movie together. \n\nI appreciated that it was a clean, cute, movie with lots of fun-filled action. It&apos;s sad but there aren&apos;t very many movies that the whole family can enjoy together without having violence and bad language, so this is a great Family Movie. \n\nGypsy is the cutest little thing, we all fell in love with him... and Daniel.\n\nGive it a try, We watch it all the time!",

This is really a very interesting story which I don&apos;t know if it is inspired by actual events or not. Why not? Gerard Blain gives in this film an awesome performance. the plot has already been given above, so it&apos;s useless I repeat it. But the main character is nearly unbelievable, as a sort of Robin Hood put in Italy during and just after WW2. Good action scenes and moving sequences too. This film should deserve to be more known and released. There are so many more hidden gems every where. Shame on the distributors."

I couldn&apos;t stand the way the film makers portrayed modern punk and its evolution, or rather DEevolution of the punk scene and music with bands like OBGYN (poppy punk at its worse) and the Boston punk scene, which consisted of following around a typical show promoter and the mundane responsibilities of booking a show, like collecting money at the door of an afternoon punk gig. It was irrelevant and annoying. They should have stuck to the interviews with the old school punk dudes who have served their time playing gigs, touring, recording, and living the lifestyle of a &quot;punk&quot;. Maybe the film makers didn&apos;t have enough footage therefore they had to fill it in with crap punk bands and skin head shows.....and OBGYN was probably one of the worst bands ever. thumbs down to a documentary that had so much potential but failed in the end.",

The only bone of contention is that there&apos;s a dog who is a family pet that they both love. They go to court and Dunne with a bit of trickery wins the custody battle.\n\nThis is one of those comedies where the people can&apos;t live with each other or without each other and both are too stubborn to admit it. Cary gets himself involved with society debutante Marguerite Churchill and Irene takes up with mother fixated oil millionaire Ralph Bellamy.\n\nAny fan of old Hollywood films can tell you how this one will end. My favorite bit is when Irene crashes the Churchill household with Cary there and pretends to be his drunken floozy of a sister.\n\nLeo McCarey won an Oscar for Best Director and Irene and Bellamy were nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor. McCarey keeps the laughs coming and takes advantage of the talents of all his players, Irene&apos;s voice and Cary&apos;s gift for physical comedy.\n\nAnd as for Mr. Smith the little terrier who finds out he&apos;s not all that Cary and Irene have in common. Well he&apos;s one lucky little fellow to be in a classic comedy like this.",

I absolutely recommend, it&apos;s not intended to be taken seriously, just enjoyed. Fun songs, cute dances. Wow, I liked it! Am I biased because I&apos;m a Shah Rukhaholic? You bet!

      "reviewBody": "Set in a luxurious mountaintop ski resort, Sierra Belmont (Lindsay Lohan) is the pampered heir to the prestigious Belmont Hotels and is currently dating influencer Tad Fairchild (George Young) while also being pressured by her father Beauregard (Jack Wagner) to take the position of VP of Atmosphere for Belmont hotels, a position that carries no real responsibility. Meanwhile at the neighboring North Star Lodge, Jake Russell (Chord Overstreet) the widowed owner of the lodge is struggling to keep the resort alive in the face of competition from larger resorts and Airbnbs. When Jake&apos;s daughter, Avy (Olivia Perez) makes a Christmas wish, Sierra finds herself knocked unconscious during Ted&apos;s proposal with the two of them separated after fall down the cliff. Jake finds the unconscious Sierra during a sleighride and takes her to town for medical assistance, but Sierra has suffered memory loss and has no identification. Jake offers Sierra a room at the lodge until someone finds her or her memory returns and finds difficulty adjusting to the simpler ways of doing things.\n\nFalling for Christmas is the latest Christmas rom-com from Netflix which like many streamers and cable channels routinely churns out these well trodden formula films with great regularity with the template popularized by Hallmark&apos;s TV movies to the point &quot;Hallmark&quot; has become synonymous with these kinds of films even if the film itself has nothing to do with Hallmark. Falling for Christmas was announced in May 2021 as part of a two picture deal between Netflix and Lindsay Lohan who will next year release Irish Wish for the streamer. The movie&apos;s positioned as something of a &quot;comeback&quot; for Lohan, and while I don&apos;t know what, if any, long term effect this film will have, it pretty much delivers on what you expect from this kind of movie.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty pointless critiquing the plot of not just one of these films, but pretty much any romantic comedy as the genre is heavily based on formula and gimmick so the elevating factor will always be whether the writing is strong and the chemistry between the leads is good. The writing in Falling for Christmas pretty much knows what kind of movie this is down to the opening phone call between Sierra and Tad so thick with fast delivered exposition you could cut it with a knife. You can recognized all the tropes you know such as spoiled socialite who gets taken back &quot;down to earth&quot;, precocious child character, widowed good hearted single father male lead, and quirky small town residents. The movie is more or less a redress of the 1987 rom-com Overboard only minus the revenge/servitude angle that&apos;s made that film have something of a hindsight re-evaluation. For what the cast are called to do, they do it well and the cast do seem to have genuine chemistry with each other as you can see in the outtakes (which I recommend you stick through). Lohan and Overstreet are appealing leads and they do seem fun together, but I think the funniest part was the B-plot where Sierra&apos;s finance Tad treks through the woods with a hermit played by Sean J. Dillingham which has some standard &quot;fish out of water&quot; gags but there&apos;s something about the way these two work off each other that makes the scenes work.\n\nWhat more can I even say here? You know exactly what kind of movie this is and whether or not you&apos;re going to watch it. I guess all I can say is I did laugh and enjoy myself and I liked the cast."

      "reviewBody": "A couple of things at the start. The rating of five is purely because I can&apos;t accurately rate this movie. Enjoyment is based upon your love of the Stones. My feelings for the Stones is one of like not love. I do enjoy their music but I think that they are little more a money machine now with their interesting music coming out of the various side projects.\n\nThis is the story of the Stones 1972 tour (sort of, director Robert Frank is interested in doing more than a straight documentary). Mostly its following the Stones from Hotel room to hotel room and performance to performance. Its the rich and famous interacting with the not so rich and far from famous, with everyone behaving badly. In its way its a sad story as Mick and the boys seem to drift aimlessly with in the confines of their cages. How they manged to survive it and, not go mad and continue on the road is probably a story that needs to be told. This story on the other hand is a bit dull and long at 90 minutes. It comes alive in fits and starts, mostly when we get to see one of the too few musical numbers (the Stevie Wonder/ Stones piece is amazing).\n\nThis film is rarely screened since due to a lawsuit it can only be run once a year and only when the director is present. Its rather dumb if you ask me, but the Stones were unhappy with the result and how they are seen to be. Why this film is still restricted considering all thats passed in the 30 plus years since its filming is beyond me. At this point it couldn&apos;t hurt the boys at all, since all it does is give visualization to what we knew already.\n\nIf you can manage to see this and you&apos;re a Stones fan do so. If you&apos;re not a fan you may want to give it a try, if for no other reason than its a unique and rare experience (due to the law suit that restricts its viewing).",

Both weren&apos;t the fan raves they&apos;ve been in the Fifties, but &apos;Das Haus in Montevideo&apos; turned a nice profit and pleased all but the most critics. They savaged the movie for its tediousness, banality and overall humdrum. \n\nIn all fairness, the picture did have its antic moments and ingratiating characters. Miss Leuwerik took her required pratfalls with the grace and spirits of a seasoned pro, but Mister Rühmann played her comic foil in a smug, balmy fashion that robbed numerous scenes of their laughs. Likewise, director Helmut Käutner was not in top form; his over-emphatic handling soured several potentially charming situations."

      "reviewBody": "This third installment to the &quot;From Dusk to Dawn&quot; movies is a prequel, as it takes place in the old West in American history. Initially one might think vampires and the wild West doesn&apos;t make for a good combination, but the movie was actually enjoyable. While better than part two, this movie still fell short of part one.\n\nThe story in &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman&apos;s Daughter&quot; is essentially exactly the same as in the first two movies. A band of outlaws and holy men and up at a seemingly deserted tavern in a secluded location. As night falls, the patrons turn into blood-thirsty vampires.\n\nThe characters in the third movie were more detailed than those in part two, and as such you get more into the movie and a greater wholeness permeates the overall storyline.\n\nAs for the acting talents in the movie, then people were doing fair jobs with their given roles and characters. It is, as always, a treat to have Danny Trejo in a movie, alongside the other familiar faces in the movie.\n\nWhile better than part two, this is not a movie that will make a lasting impression, nor is it a bright shiny moment in cinema history. &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman&apos;s Daughter&quot; is exactly what you would expect from a movie of this type. It is enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be.\n\nThe first movie stands well on its own. The second movie is just a filler. And the third movie is essentially also just a filler, although it does show the origin of the seductive Santanico Pandemonium character from the first movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw an early screening. I never saw the first one, but within the context of it being a kids&apos; movie, it was actually quite well made. I actually laughed at the jokes, and I&apos;m 33 and educated. If I were a young kid, I&apos;d love this movie a lot, but I&apos;m way past that and am often quite critical of children&apos;s genre films these days. The plot was coherent and the moral issues were clear. The characters stay true to themselves, much to anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon characters, and the dynamic of character triads works well for moral storytelling.\n\nThe moral lesson to be taught is about learning to be selfless and considerate of others. This is explored through Alvin and his ego problem, and the consequences it has on his friends and family. Other characters have their own arcs as well, and they read clear and convincingly.\n\nOn the downside, I think there are some choices that hurt the quality. Dave, the most famous human character in the franchise is probably in the film for about 5 minutes total, however the human characters we&apos;re left with are good performers with decent subplots. I did not care for the cliché use of a fart joke, but I forgive it because there was only one, and it was used in a way that&apos;s actually still funny to adults.\n\nSure, it&apos;s not the most intellectual film for an adult audience, but it serves its purpose and achieves its goals, despite being the result of commercialism. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their small kids out to a movie.",

The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.\n\nWar Games: The Dead Code isn&apos;t that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes I was a fan of the original, but no I wasn&apos;t expecting miracles from this one. Let&apos;s face it the original wasn&apos;t really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.\n\nThat&apos;s all I was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings. Was that too much to ask for? Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straight to video release? Well apparently that was too much to ask for. Stay away from this movie. At first it&apos;s just bad, like &quot;Oh yeah, this is bad, but I&apos;m kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original.&quot; And then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie.",

Then again, many of my favorite films deal with the loneliness of not quite fitting in to society&apos;s big picture.\n\nThis is a lovely story of two lonely people who find each other at just the right time, and the growing closeness between the two forces them to look at their lives more clearly and see what they really want out of life. The title song by Mancini is rather cloying and irritating, but I can overlook that for the wonderful performances by Ford and Page. Lansbury is also quite good as the supposed shrew and &quot;tomato&quot;, but even she is not entirely unsympathetic in the end. She is also lonely, you see.\n\nAnyone who has been truly lonely or is sympathetic to that position will react emotionally to this film. True, it is a little dated, but that is a large part of its charm for the innocence and hope that fills it. Definitely worth a look, and hopefully it will appear on DVD soon enough!",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t know a lot about The Dark Crystal before going in, other than it being created completely with puppetry, involving a giant crystal of some kind, and being reasonably dark for something aimed at kids. The story is pretty basic, especially considering how much thought and care went into everything else about this movie. Jen, the last of his kind, must find a shard of the crystal, and slot it back into place. Why? He doesn&apos;t know, but he embarks on the journey nonetheless, a journey that has him meet a variety of characters and creatures along the way. That&apos;s literally it; the entire story.\n\nThankfully there&apos;s heaps more to this movie than just its superficial story. For starters, the world created for the movie is quite unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s a wholly original affair from the ground up. We&apos;re told through an opening narration that we are on a different planet, in a different time, and that it used to be peaceful and beautiful, but something happened when the crystal fractured and two brand new species emerged. The Skeksis are dark and greedy, vain and selfish. They hoard all they can and constantly fight amongst themselves, but they&apos;re a dying race, quite literally decaying as time goes on. Now there&apos;s only ten of them, who spend their time holed up in a macabre castle in a wasteland. On the flipside are the urRu, a group of placid, lumbering, four-armed creatures who live amongst the life magic around them. Jen is a Gelfling, the last of his kind after the Skeksis wiped the rest of them from the face of the planet. There&apos;s also the Podlings which are a small and timid people hunted by the Skeksis and exploited as slaves, the Garthim, a race of giant arachnid beetles who the Skeksis use as their muscle, and lastly Aughra, an ogre-like oracle who studies the planets and brews potions for trade.\n\nImmediately I was struck by how dark this movie really is. Of course I&apos;ve always found 80s fantasy movies to be of a darker calibre than any other period, but The Dark Crystal is darker than most. The Skeksis are a truly villainous race, with a frightening appearance, and a disturbing penchant for sucking the life out of their victims before using the zombified husks as slaves, not to mention the off-screen genocide they committed against the Gelflings. And this is a movie for kids! Of course, being aimed at a younger audience means it&apos;s not as horrific as it could be for adult eyes, but it still manages to skirt the line just enough.\n\nBut of course the single biggest lure for The Dark Crystal are the technical aspects. This was the first live-action movie not to feature humans at all. The closest it gets is with people dressed up as Jen and Kira in longshots to make running and climbing more feasible. To make up for the distinct lack of people, the puppetry department goes all out. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen puppetry this amazing, not even in other Jim Henson productions. There&apos;s so much detail put into every aspect of this movie. Each of the ten Skeksis are resplendently designed in such a way to be distinctly different to one another. They have different facial features, wear different clothes, and even act differently (as portrayed in a fantastic dinner scene displaying how varied their eating habits are). The urRu also have an incredible amount of detail just on their faces alone, but also the way they slowly lumber about and their four arms interact with one another. The sheer amount of practice this must have taken from their dual performers is impressive alone. The settings and world around the characters are also brimming with life. There&apos;s a staggering amount of creatures and animals here, each with their own role in the local ecosystems. You may only see one briefly in the background, but even they enjoy the same attention to detail. There&apos;s just so much here. It&apos;s a full and brimming world that&apos;s so easy to be immersed into. They even wrote fictional languages for each of the main races! I would love to have seen a version with this, but even I can admit that maybe would have been too much for a movie with already risky prospects at the time.\n\nI&apos;m hard-pushed to called The Dark Crystal a masterpiece, because there are some deep flaws here. The story is incredibly simplistic and is far from original, the Gelflings for some reason don&apos;t seem to enjoy the same attention to detail as everyone else, despite being the heroes of the whole story, and the dialogue and narration is a little lacking in places. Beyond that, this movie was still amazing to watch today and it&apos;s technical achievements still hold up. I&apos;m looking forward to delving into Age of Resistance later. I give Dark Crystal a really, really good 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "The first time i heard of Steve Odekerk was when I first saw the movie &quot;Thumb Wars&quot; on UPN, I found it to be so stupid that it was hilarious. After I saw the movie I quickly went out and bought all six in the series and loved everyone, now the humor in these movies is the stupid off the wall type that I love. Now Kung Pow is the same way and has the most random unexplainable humor that I have seen in a movie. Now I personally love this kind of humor but not everyone does, so I would say if you saw any of his other movies like Ace or Juwanna man these are more &quot;normal&quot; movies and aren&apos;t good to go by. But if you have seen the thumb movies or just love weird humor you will love this movie, I loved but that doesn&apos;t mean you will, so my advice is if you don&apos;t like stupid comedy don&apos;t watch this but if you like that kind of stuff you should check it out.",

Volontè is simply amazing: the character is explained even with a close-up, expressing what not only a judge but every man should think about so-called undisputed truths... Trying to be anything but superficial trough doubt and curiosity. Maybe &quot;ccthemovieman&quot; were too left-wing or better were too convinced of his opinions once and unfortunately nowadays. He&apos;s partially understandable because this movie is deep-seated in Italian culture so is pretty difficult to a foreigner get some light nuances, amplified by the Sicilian environment of the script based on novel of the great Leonardo Sciascia. In my opinion this movie deserves 9 out of 10 stars for the psychological deepening of the characters.\n\ncheers",

      "reviewBody": "One of the typical ploys of modernist artists has been to take a known work, and to use that as a basis for experimentation. In this case, Bernardo Bertolucci (at the age of 22!) took Stendhal&apos;s novel THE CHARTERHOUSE OF PARMA and used the basic plot and characters, only Bertolucci abstracted these elements, taking them for granted and simply creating a wide-ranging collage of impressions and emotions. But the central love affair between Fabrizio and his aunt, Gina (the names of the characters in the Stendhal), is the motivating heart of the film; the suggestions of incest, the need for secrecy, the impacted emotion because of the covertness: these provide PRIMA DELLA RIVOLUZIONE with a core of great integrity, so that the more &quot;random&quot; elements (the scene with the lament on the lake, the scene at the opera, the scene where the friend rides the bicycle in circles, etc.) are able to reflect on Bertolucci&apos;s feelings regarding politics, class, revolution, art, the search for belief.\n\nPRIMA DELLA RIVOLUZIONE is one of the most youthful films ever made, as well it should be, since it was made by someone who was impossibly young at the time. I hate to say this, but it&apos;s the work of a prodigy, a gifted post-adolescent who is trying to find a form to contain his sometimes overwrought feelings about life, love, and politics. There had been many works catering to the teen crowd, movies like WHERE THE BOYS ARE or BEACH PARTY, but, aside from some of the works of Nicholas Ray (THEY LIVE BY NIGHT and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE), no film artist had yet tried to use the medium as a vehicle for a vision of youthful passions from the inside: Godard would follow with MASCULINE FEMININE and LA CHINOISE, Bellocchio with FISTS IN THE POCKET, Skolimowski with LE DEPART and DEEP END, but Bertolucci was pioneering when he made this movie, and the fact that it&apos;s &quot;flawed&quot; should not be held against it, as it represents the expression of a very young artist, trying to express his emotions as directly as possible.",

It doesn&apos;t seem to follow the rules of contemporary film-making--in other words, women aren&apos;t shown as fully equal to men (although they can be very resourceful in dealing with petty tyranny) and the hero shows no sign of resentment for the way he is treated. I felt a lot closer to the great works of the heyday of classic film by Cukor, Ophuls and Lubitsch. The story unfolds calmly and logically, whether the events take place in the 30&apos;s, 40&apos;s or 50&apos;s of the last century. Ivan Barnev as the young Jan is superb: funny, roguish and balletic (just watch how gracefully he swoops around the restaurant with that heavy tray; wonder how much rehearsal time that needed.) Jiri Menzel made Closely Watched Trains, then saw his career go into eclipse after the Soviet invasion in 1968. The work he has done since hasn&apos;t come to my attention until now. This may be his swan-song, since he is 70 now, but I hope not.",

Julie Christie&apos;s performance is the insurance &quot;Darling&quot; has to ensure its powerful sailing through the years into the forever ever. She is extraordinary! Schlesinger lets himself be guided by something other than his British restrain and fear of sentimentality here. He is tough and poetic telling us the story of Diana Scott (could had been Lady Diana Spencer to a T) with understanding and compassion but without trying to make her a sympathetic character. Julie Christie takes care of that in what, time will tell, in fact is already telling us, one of the best performances on film, ever.",

You will notice a lot of scenes are spoofed from classics. The cast definitely had a lot of fun making the movie. The shots are great.\n\nSo to sum up the story: Abahachi borrows money from the apache. Unfortunately the son of the apache chief gets killed by Santa Maria (the villain), who also steels the money. So Ranger and Abahachi go look for a treasure map, to find a diamond, Abahachi once hid a long time ago.\n\nThe story is secondary, the emphasis on this movie is on FUN. I gave it a 9. Go see it, and wait till the end. After the credits Winnetouch has a little scene.",

      "reviewBody": "In 2001, the FBI clerk Eric O&apos;Neill (Ryan Phillippe), who is a specialist in computer but wants to be an agent, is invited by agent Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney) to work with the senior agent Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper) that had worked for many years in Soviet Union and now is assigned to protect the agency against electronic infiltration. Kate tells to Eric to write down the behavior of Hanssen in notes and send them to her since Hanssen would be a pervert under investigation of his sexual behavior.\n\nEric works with the bitter and rough Hanssen and he finds a family man and devout Catholic who earns his respect instead of a deviant. Further, his investigation and his relationship with Hanssen and his wife Bonnie (Kathleen Quinlan) affects Eric&apos;s wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas). Eric tells his opinion to Kate and she decides to tell the truth about Hanssen to him: he is a mole that sold many secrets to the Soviet Union and has compromised the identity of dozens of agents. Eric decides to go on in his assignment despite his friendship with Hanssen and the problems in his marriage.\n\n&quot;Breach&quot; is an engaging and dramatic spy movie based on the true story of an FBI agent that was arrested for spying on 20 February 2001. I bought this DVD many years ago and only yesterday I decided to watch it and I found a great film.\n\nThe plot is developed in adequate pace and supported by magnificent performances of Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillippe and Laura Linney. The duel between Eric O&apos;Neill and Robert Hanssen is fantastic. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Quebra de Confiança&quot; (&quot;Fail in Confidence&quot;)",

Firs, one has to admire the audacious, lurching combination of genres and plot lines, hallucinatory in their variations. Secondly, the final two shots of this movie are stunning. I won&apos;t give them away, although I wish I could because they are just some of the coolest final images of any science fiction movie of that era, and make the entire movie worthwhile.\n\nAll of these impressions reflects some advice I would give if you choose to watch this movie. I don&apos;t think one ought to watch it literally, as a plot-driven film, because doing so could be frustrating given some of the illogic and seeming randomness of the events. Instead, I ultimately watched it for the imagery, the drunken, staggering wackiness of it all, and the utterly fascinating cultural aspects of the movie (for example, wow, do Americans not come off particularly well in this flick!).\n\nI would also recommend Genocide for those who enjoy eco-horror or eco-scifi, such as Frogs, Phase IV, Bug (the Bradford Dillman flick), Food of the Gods, and even classic giant irradiated &quot;bug&quot; movies such as Them and Tarantula, which were among the first eco-scifi movies.",

      "reviewBody": "It helps if you&apos;re able to live in Kierkegaard&apos;s unfolding moment if you want to enjoy this movie. Or in Fritz Perl&apos;s &quot;here and now&quot;, to switch hoaxes in midstream. \n\nIt&apos;s pointless to compare &quot;Casino Royale&quot; to any of the other &quot;straight&quot; Bond films. There is no &quot;plot&quot; worthy of the name. The five disparate directors saw to that, to the extent that the writers didn&apos;t. It&apos;s a succession of gags, puns, and visual effects taking place in spectacularly designed settings, spoofs of German expressionism, psychedelic imagery, and all that. Some of the gags miss the mark. A British soldier who has been practicing karate chops on wooden boards comes to a stiff attention when his superior approaches and snaps a quivering Brit-style salute, knocking himself out with his own hand. Ha ha. \n\nSuch silliness abounds and at times the movie drags a bit, but there is always another joke around the corner. Orson Welles, with his fat cigar at the card table, performing magic tricks with flags and scarves amid flashing lights while everyone whistles and applauds. Peter Sellers trying on different costumes for Ursula Andress, including one of a gruff old general, &quot;There&apos;s nothing wrong with the British Ahmy -- that a damned good swim won&apos;t cure.&quot; \n\nYou really can&apos;t look for logic in all of this. Listen to the score and watch the performers squeeze the most possible laughs out of their situations. Too bad the movie loses steam at the end so that what should be a climactic pulling together of all the accumulated lines of narrative and jokes is, instead, just plain silly -- clapping seals, parachuting Indians. Ridiculous, but not funny. Writers who have trouble ending absurd movies like this seem to think that a few minutes of chaotic slapstick will serve. &quot;What&apos;s New, Pussycat&quot; had the same problem, with people running frantically from room to room in a hotel, a Feydeau farce without laughs. &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; thrust everybody into vehicles and sent them racing down a California freeway with nothing to say. Just about all of &quot;It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; was an attempt to substitute destruction and speed for wit. \n\nI saw this movie when it was released and laughed from beginning to end. I don&apos;t find it quite so funny now, (I don&apos;t find ANYTHING quite so funny anymore) but I watch it when I can. It&apos;s an opportunity to live in the unfolding moment."

Compared to the earlier Hitchcock version (which we also like) this story is much more believable and less campy. \n\nWe love it and watch it every few months. Our only disappointment is that our VHS is getting worn and we can&apos;t find a replacement in either VHS or DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "BLOSSOMS OF FIRE is visually appealing and contains some very interesting information on the relationships between women and men, women and business, and women and politics in Oaxaca, Mexico. The wonderful colors that infuse almost every scene are one of this documentary&apos;s biggest draws. That the women of the area make most of their apparel by hand is well known, and many of the dress items are sought after by locals and foreigners alike.\n\nThe women are what this documentary is all about. The focus is on the matriarchal society that once existed (and maybe still does) in this area. Women run many of the businesses, are highly independent, and are deeply involved in the politics of the region. Film makers Maureen Gosling and Ellen Osborne dive into the culture of Oaxaca and take the viewer with them as some of the people of Oaxaca comment on this area&apos;s cultural significance. Some say that there is no matriarchal hierarchy, while others say there is. Perhaps the matriarchal nature of the area is so ingrained in the people of Oaxaca that they don&apos;t even notice it. Or perhaps it&apos;s just a bunch of media hype to make the area more interesting. Who knows.\n\nThe cleanliness of the area is what will impress many watchers, too. Most rural areas of Mexico tend to look unkempt, with hogs and dogs running amuck through tattered streets, and the residence wearing holey clothes. Not so here. The streets are swept clean, the people impeccably dressed, and not a hog or dog to be seen.\n\nThe area is also a hotbed of anti-Mexican governmentalism. Fiercely independent by nature, the women (and men) protect their identity with rabid ferocity. But they also accept change and integrate it into their society ...but in a way that befits their Oaxacan culture rather than one that eats away at it.\n\nThe film does stray some when it starts discussing the acceptance of homosexuality and lesbianism, though. Although interesting, it isn&apos;t what drove this area of Mexico to its current high level of female sophistication.\n\nEven so, this is interesting information and the bright adornments on all the beautiful women is pure eye-candy.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a huge fan of director Kang Woo Suk and his films such as &apos;Two Cops&apos; and &apos;Silmido&apos;. The &apos;Public Enemy&apos; series is unique in the fact that South Korean films rarely have a franchise because even if the first film is a hit, the second and third films flop.(for example, My Wife is a Gangster and Hi Dharma.) &apos;Public Enemy3&apos;is more of a direct sequel to the first movie(because in the second one, the main character&apos;s job and history is all changed), and it was okay, but not great like the first one. \n\nThe film follows the story of our hero Kang Chul Joong(Seol Kyong Gu, who is brilliant as usual), who is sick of being a cop because the job is dangerous and pays almost nothing, not to mention his credit is way down so he can&apos;t even get a loan from the bank. He decides to quit until his old boss(Kang Shil Il, who participated in this movie despite the fact that he has cancer)calls him up for one last investigation. A high school student who murdered a local businessman was found dead in his school. As detective Kang investigates more closely, he finds out that the mastermind is Lee Won Sool(Jeong Jae Young), president of Geo Seong Enterprises, which on the outside is a regular corporation owning restaurants, construction firms and night clubs but on the inside, trains top fighting high school students to be ruthless gangsters. As Kang delves deeper into the case, Won Sool hatches a plan to stop both Kang and the case for good..........\n\nThe best thing about this movie is that it points out the problems of teenagers in society, who think that it&apos;s just cool to fight and beat up innocent people. It shows us that being a gangster isn&apos;t cool, it&apos;s like digging your own grave. The problem is the comic parts. I understand that director Kang Woo Suk called this movie &apos;a mixture from the previous Public Enemy films with his early movies like TwoCops&apos;, but comedy just doesn&apos;t work with a thriller like this with such a serious topic. People might just ignore the message this movie is trying to send because there are just too many funny parts. I give this movie 8 stars because on the whole, I enjoyed it and hope for another Public Enemy film in the years to come, but I hope if another sequel does come out, director Kang returns to the more serious version of the first and second Public Enemy films.",

      "name": "PAST AND PRESENT (Manoel De Oliveira, 1972) ***",
      "reviewBody": "Perhaps the most enjoyable Oliveira film I&apos;ve watched so far also proved to be the most frustrating experience (through no fault of the genial Portuguese director, whom I saw at the 2004 Venice Film Festival): unfortunately, the copy shown on late-night Italian TV was of an atrocious quality  with intermittent picture loss, rampant pixellation and considerable stretches where the dialogue was so low and muffled as to be barely audible (thankfully, the movie was presented in its original language accompanied by Italian subtitles), despite the volume of my TV being practically set at its maximum level! The irony is that this was scheduled again on the very same channel just the other week and, had I known of the poor state of my copy, I&apos;d have tried to record it againthough, of course, I would&apos;ve had no guarantee that they were able get hold of a superior print unless I went through the whole thing over again! \n\nAnyway, having seen it, I&apos;m now able to understand how Oliveira felt so completely at home making that Bunuelian tribute BELLE TOUJOURS (2006); in fact, this has much the same aura of elegant surrealism evident in the Spaniard&apos;s contemporaneous masterpiece THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE (1972), while throughout Oliveira displays an admirably Ophulsian propensity for intricately mobile camera-work. The premise is original and quite delightful: a woman has lost a husband and remarried; she used to despise the former but, now, she realizes how much she actually loved him and, consequently, starts to neglect Spouse No. 2. Also, the first husband had an identical twin brother  so the wife feels closer to him than her current husband; the latter, humiliated by this awkward situation, commits suicide! Then, the sibling of the deceased confesses that he&apos;s actually the man she married and that it was his twin who had died (he just had the inexplicable urge to exchange identities with him!); so, the ex-bride and groom go to court to make their re-union legalexcept that, by this time, it dawns on her that Husband No. 2 is the one she truly loves!\n\nAmid all this, their close circle of friends try to make head or tails of the woman&apos;s whims and quirks; further complications, however, arise out of the subplot involving a man who makes passes at two of the women (one&apos;s married, the other happily cohabiting with her divorced ex!). The latter turns him down flat, while his affair with the former proves no less volatile than the leading lady&apos;s roundabout ways; the man, then, deliberately picks a fight with his lover&apos;s husband  who had earlier also exchanged harsh words with the heroine&apos;s cynical second husband. Though lacking perhaps the cheerful mockery that Bunuel managed to bring to this essentially staid environment (even if the Mendelssohn score still lends it undeniable irony), Oliveira&apos;s script is both intelligent and witty  to which his small cast of unknown actors (to me, at least) respond extremely well. These extend to even the minor roles of butler and maid: apart from indulging in their own romantic dalliances from time to time, the butler is visibly annoyed in having to attend to the mansion&apos;s gates after every vehicle that calls at the premises (in fact, apart from a brief flashback and the church finale, we&apos;re virtually stuck on the grounds of this single location). He also witnesses the second husband&apos;s fatal leap from the window as well as the wife&apos;s escape from the very same room (in which she&apos;s been locked by Spouse No. 1 after her passion for his replacement is re-ignited), while the maid has no qualms about spying on her masters&apos; violent squabbles through a keyhole.\n\nThe ironic ending sees all concerned attending the wedding ceremony of a young bride and groom  with the central couple entering the church together but then taking separate seats away from one another because of lack of room; the emphasis placed on the newlyweds&apos; promises of lifelong devotion obviously ring hollow at this point while, seemingly on a whim, Oliveira decides to end the film on an amusing shot of the church organist (sporting the somewhat clichéd unkempt appearance of the typical musicologist). It should be said here that PAST AND PRESENT is the first entry in the director&apos;s so-called &quot;Tetralogy Of Frustrated Love&quot; along with BENILDE OR THE VIRGIN MOTHER (1975), the five-hour TV serial DOOMED LOVE (1979)  both of which I own and intend to check out presently, as part of my ongoing retrospective honoring Oliveira&apos;s 100th birthday next month  and the as-yet unavailable FRANCISCA (1981).",

      "reviewBody": "This is gritty 70&apos;s B-movie action at its best. The CB radio craze was at its height when this movie first came out (I saw it on a double bill with &quot;Jaws&quot; at an outdoor)and the country was fascinated by the lives of long distance truckers. There were also a lot of violent films portraying the &quot;little guy&quot; sticking up for himself against the powers that be. These concepts coalesce in this fast-paced and tough action movie.\n\nCarroll Jo Hummer is an independent long haul trucker whose whole life is tied up in two things: his wife and his truck The Blue Mule. He&apos;s no angel but he knows corruption when he sees it. When his greasy boss Duane (good ol&apos; boy Slim Pickens) puts the arm on Hummer to deliver illegal cigarettes and slot machines, Carroll Jo refuses to go along. In doing so, he becomes an inspiration to other wildcat truckers looking to buck the system but he also becomes the target of a vicious campaign of intimidation endorsed by the corporate slimeballs in their ivory towers.\n\nThere&apos;s fist-fighting, road racing and down and dirty dialog galore as Hummer&apos;s war with his enemies escalates to &quot;Walking Tall&quot; levels. The concluding image of the Blue Mule smashing the glass emblem of the corrupt corporation is iconic.\n\nThis is a B-movie for sure and no Oscar contender, but the lives of the truckers are portrayed with some grit and realism. There&apos;s some breath-taking footage of cross-country journeys, particularly in a snowy Utah, and there&apos;s hardly a dull moment. Jan-Michael Vincent does fine as Hummer and it may be one of the best roles of his career (he did all his own stunts).\n\nAnd how can you go wrong with a 70&apos;s cast that includes L.Q. Jones, Dick Miller, R. G. Armstrong, Don Porter, Kay Lenz, Sam Laws and Slim Pickens? Only obvious signs of sloppiness were a couple of shots where the boom mike or its shadow are visible. That&apos;s a minor quibble. If you&apos;re looking for a hell-raisin&apos; bare knuckled story that pits a tough man against the odds, chances are this is what you are looking for.",

It&apos;s almost as funny as SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF (1971) and I would almost consider it a welcome addition to my DVD collection were it not for the fact that the current Direct Source Media DVD weren&apos;t so awful. \n\nTrinity (Terence Hill) a dirty, dusty drifter-turned bounty-hunter comes to town to pay a visit to his horse-thieving half-brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) who&apos;s pretending to be the real sheriff. Bambino&apos;s looking for the best way to rustle some of the Colonel&apos;s horses before he leaves and he&apos;s not interested in letting Trinity cut in. In the meantime, the Colonel (Farley Granger) is doing some plotting of his own, not only to get rid of Bambino but also to displace some Mormons who are settling on some land he wants for his own cattle.\n\nThe fights, the stunts and the gunplay Trinity and Bambino play on the Colonel&apos;s men is hilarious. I like it when Bambino uses the bottom of his fist to hit the bad guy&apos;s on the top of the head. And the ending fist fight scene at the Mormon&apos;s camp cracks me up. No wonder this film made Hill and Spencer popular in Europe. \n\nLike I said, the DVD is a travesty with a transfer that&apos;s watchable but looks like it was lifted from a VHS source. The print itself the transfer was taken from is pretty grainy with bad splices and an audible hum in the soundtrack. It deserves a failing grade.\n\nThe TRINITY series needs the Anchor Bay DVD treatment, really bad. Since these Euro westerns were so popular, I&apos;m surprised they haven&apos;t secured the rights to it yet.\n\n7 out of 10\n\n-",

      "reviewBody": "This great picture by the greatly discussed Spike Lee is one of a kind. What really makes this shine through the constant rubble being made by either incompetent directors or inexperienced ones is first of all, the incredible acting and for that you need great characters that are well thought-out and second comes the frighteningly real and tragic story. Which Lee handles with utmost care and outstanding precision.\n\nLee&apos;s trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. The final product feels very polished, but true to the story and it is those small things that some of us notice, those details that separate a veteran from a novice. There are some weak points, but they are only minor.\n\nThe acting here is top notch. Norton convinces once again and makes for a great heartfelt performance and Hoffman is equally impressive. However, I was completely blown away by Pepper. Barry Pepper. He &apos;was&apos; continuously Frank and very consistent in his acting. The scene where he breaks down and Norton thanks him in a way for what he has done is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. It felt so authentic.\n\nFurthermore, I can keep writing about how great this movie is or how good the acting, but eventually you have to decide for yourself. I can only recommend it.\n\nSo, I say to you, if you can, see this movie as soon as possible.",

The movie follows Gael Garcia&apos;s character as he moves back to his mothers home in Paris and finds himself falling for the girl across the hall. Gael&apos;s character experiences reality through dreams and the present, creating all sorts of confusion. The movie has some of the most unique props and eccentric animation pieces I have ever seen, but would you expect anything less from Gondry (Eternal Sunshine..). This movie really can&apos;t be described in truth but holds so much potential for multiple viewings as its so full of life and visual wonders for the eyes. Gael Garcia is just perfect in this role and is fascinating in gesture and laugh out loud funny when the script allows. I think you should definitely look forward to seeing this movie when it gets a wide release, its funny, its art, its pleasure for the eyes and a puzzle for the mind.",

There he meets Clive Durham. Both men develop a strong friendship, which to a certain level, becomes physical. Clive is gay, but Maurice doesn&apos;t want to know anything about it. Until he admits he also has feelings for persons of the same sex, even though in intellectual circles homosexuality is &apos;the love that dare not speak its name&apos;.\n\nMaurice doesn&apos;t know how to behave. Of course he wants to be himself, but society doesn&apos;t accept gay people. When he more or less decides to live as a gay man bosom friend Clive changes his mind, frightened by a lawsuit against a gay man. According to Clive the physical friendship between Maurice and Clive must end and from that moment on he wants to experience real love: the love of a woman. The relation between Maurice and Clive gets tense.\n\nEven Maurice tries to get his sexual preference changed by visiting a hypnotist, but the treatment fails. That becomes very clear when Maurice sleeps with Scudder, Clive&apos;s under gamekeeper. A passionate love develops between Scudder and Maurice, which makes Clive realize what kind of appearance he has to keep up as a &apos;converted&apos; gay man.\n\n&apos;Maurice&apos; is based on the novel of the same name written by E.M. Forster. The film is beautiful and made with a feeling for historical notion. The actors playing the leading roles are straight in real life but act the gay roles in a beautiful way. Actually everything in the film is right: image, usage of language, costumes and music."

      "reviewBody": "Amusing comedy set on Napoles and a far country as South Africa for Bud Spencer enthusiasts , repeating his usual role as comissario , this time dealing with diamonds robbing and drugs . Rizzo (Bud Spencer or Carlo Perdesoli) is a corpulent and bouncing cop from Napoles . Commissary Rizzo gets a phone message from an African man who wants to meet him . One time happens the meeting the stranger is shot , but Rizzo gets a photograph of his little son . Rizzo nicknamed Flatfoot travels to big city of Johannesburg and finds Bodo ( a likable Zulu little boy ) and his former partner (Enzo Cannavale ) who poses as restaurant owner . Rizzo goes to the mansion a rich man (Joe Steward) there he dances with Mary ( a gorgeous Dagmar Lassander) a moving dancing . Later , he goes a safari where meets enemies (Werner Pochath) , facing off dangers, and several adventures.\n\nThis is a good entertaining juvenile for Bud Spencer fans , as he&apos;s delightful . It packs action, fist-play , slapdash , humor with tongue-in-cheek and is quite amusing . This release has some cool and several hilarious moments, though the Terence Hill-Bud Spencer duo films are better . The film isn&apos;t always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions ,it&apos;s frankly delicious. The movie displays innumerable laughters , jokes and slapstick . Enjoyable screenplay by Verucci and Giovanni Simonelli . Catching musical score with noisy songs by Guido and Mauricio De Angelis (Spaghetti Western habitual) and composed by synthesizer , as usual . Colorful cinematography by Alberto Spagnoli who photographs splendidly the African outdoors . The motion picture was professionally directed by Steno , Stefano Vanzina (father of Carlo Vanzina). He wrote and directed in the 60s Toto vehicles (Toto vs the four, Two colonels) ; Walter Chiari and Raimondo Vianello shows (Heroes of the West, Twins from Texas). In the 70s and 80s directed Bud Spencer movies about Flatfoot or Rizzo, also called Piedone, such as, ¨Flatfoot in Hong Kong¨, ¨Flatfoot in Egypt¨ and ¨Banana Joe¨ , among others. And in the 80s directed TV series , ¨the Professore Jack Clementi¨, again with Bud Spencer. Rating : Acceptable and passable , though only for Bud Spencer fans .",

      "reviewBody": "Yet again, the late F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre has submitted a review for a film he clearly has not seen. This picture contains no sighting of the deerstalker hat. Holmes has no side whiskers. Several major plot details are incorrect. If you&apos;d like to hear from someone who HAS seen this film, read on.\n\nWhat you will find if you are able to see this very rare entry into the Holmes screen canon is a moderately interesting early talkie, with a script that too often betrays its stage origins.\n\nAfter vowing that he has completed his final case, Sherlock is lured back into sleuthing by a complicated series of events that include murder, the kidnapping of Watson&apos;s future son-in- law, a double agent in Scotland Yard, and phone hacking (yes, really!) \n\nClive Brook is an agreeable if somewhat subdued Holmes, displaying a few of the character&apos;s quirks but none of his usual abrasiveness. H. Reeves-Smith plays a credulous Watson, who gets little to do other than to occasionally marvel at Holmes&apos; brilliance, while Betty Lawford and Phillip Holmes are stiff as a clichéd pair of Bright Young Things, though they are not helped by some of the sappy lines they are given. Donald Crisp, as a shifty ship&apos;s doctor, is the best of the supporting cast.\n\nFor all the wrong reasons, the film&apos;s standout performance comes from Harry T. Morey, whose dreadfully hammy Moriarty stops the picture in its tracks. What is obviously meant to be a tense shipboard denouement instead comes off as a little ludicrous, thanks to a performance that seems to have escaped from a Universal horror film of the 1930s. \n\nThe dialogue is fairly static and the pace is uneven - which is to say, it&apos;s no worse than most talkies of this early period, and a little better than many of them. Holmesians will find much to interest them in this outing, even if it&apos;s just to hear that famous (if inaccurate) quote - &apos;Elementary, my dear Watson&apos; - spoken for the first time on the screen."

      "reviewBody": "Being somebody who lives with a younger sister who is autistic, I struggle with mental disability every day. She has changed my outlook on life, however, and has helped me understand people who have trouble with just simply getting through the day. I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ve had an easy time living with it and at times I lose my temper and just get really upset. But I am reassured by the fact that my family and I have it far better than a lot of people. I cry for her a lot simply because I can&apos;t imagine how depressing it is to be her and not really be aware of how much anguish she has caused us, but she is a excellent and brilliant sister and I can&apos;t imagine living without her. This film, to me, distorted what it was like to live with somebody who has such a disability and what their experiences are. I am utterly disappointed with the documentary in general. It didn&apos;t feel honest, genuine, and certainly didn&apos;t teach me anything I didn&apos;t already know about autism. As somebody who has Aspergers disorder, I can say that there are good things and bad things. This film didn&apos;t shed any light on any of the good things and offered a half-baked effort in even depicting the bad things. The bad things are mostly all about just negativity toward autism in general, but autism is something that is certainly not all bad if a person took the extra effort to show discipline and a lot of patience with someone who is autistic. I&apos;m not saying that autism is good. In fact, it&apos;s really quite horrible to live with somebody who has the misfortune of having autism. However, there are moments of pure brilliance shown by people who have autism, and those moments are what makes dealing with autism worth it. This film didn&apos;t have any of that. Instead, it was all about the anguish and hell the ordeal is rather than the unique and interesting details. It&apos;s really disheartening."

      "reviewBody": "Up In Central Park marked a successful return to Broadway for Sigmund Romberg as this musical about the Tammany Hall era of Boss William Marcy Tweed ran for 504 performances during the 1945-46 season on Broadway. Instead of the elegant Vincent Price as the powerful Boss of Tammany Hall Civil War and post Civil War, the part was played by Noah Beery, Sr. Now that certainly would have called for a different kind of Boss Tweed.\n\nMusically what Universal Studios gave us is a half baked version of the Broadway Show. Dick Haymes and Deanna Durbin are in good voice for th Sigmund Romberg-Dorothy Fields numbers still left, but because the music is cut the emphasis of the film turns to Price.\n\nYoung Deanna Durbin and her father Albert Sharpe are freshly arrived from Ireland and immediately as was the tradition back in the day, welcomed to the shores by the Tammany political machine. Sharpe takes to the repeat voting the way that Brian Donlevy did in The Great McGinty, but his rise only consists of becoming the superintendent of Central Park which the Tweed Ring plans to &apos;improve&apos; with many kickbacks for themselves.\n\nIn the meantime Durbin comes to the attention of Price, but she also comes to the attention of crusading reporter Dick Haymes. They make beautiful music together and apart in what little is left of the Romberg-Fields score.\n\nIf Up In Central Park had been done at MGM it surely would have gotten the production needed for this musical. Unforgivably the big hit song of the film Close As Pages In A Book was not performed and it&apos;s a duet which I&apos;m sure Haymes and Durbin would have been great at. I&apos;m betting it ended on the cutting room floor. Close As Pages In A Book is heard on the soundtrack as background music \n\nThere&apos;s another nice song called It Doesn&apos;t Cost You Anything To Dream that was also cut. But what I was most disappointed in was a number called The Fireman&apos;s Bride that was not included. It&apos;s a rollicking number that I have a recording of Jeanette MacDonald and Robert Merrill doing and I&apos;m sure it must have been great on stage. When it wasn&apos;t in the film I was truly disappointed.\n\nCasting Vincent Price as Tweed was a stroke of genius. I truly think that a young woman&apos;s virtue would have been far more in danger from him than from Noah Beery. Remembering the villains Beery played on screen, he would have to get really overbearing and physical which he must have on stage.\n\nAs a musical Up In Central Park is disappointing, but fans of Vincent Price will appreciate this actor displaying the fact he could do far more than horror films.",

The other review was correct about consistency, the stock footage switch back and forth between F/A-18 and F-14 footage. A Navy Captain was wearing the wrong size rank insignia. Most of the squadron patches aviators are wearing are U.S. Air Force patches. When an plane is launching off a bow catapult, they depict the pilot saluting a fellow aviator, not the &quot;shooter,&quot; and then they depict the throttle being thrown to full as the aircraft is being released from the launch gear. In reality Hornets are on autopilot and pilots hold their hands up to show they aren&apos;t mucking things up. This is in many respects a low budget attempt at &quot;Behind Enemy Lines,&quot; but that itself was a terrible movie. NEVER, NEVER expend money to watch this film!!! Even if you have the chance to watch it on broadcast or cable television, a drinking game must be involved, that is the only condition under which this movie may seem to be remotely appealing.",

      "reviewBody": "Man, it is hard to digest some of the bile and acrid animosity of many of the comments here. I saw this when it first came out right as I was about to graduate high school in 1970, and I loved it. I had not read John Barth&apos;s novel, so I had no prejudice about the approach. I have watched the film a couple of times since on video (though it is virtually impossible to find) and must testify it more than holds up. Stacey Keach really gives a great, subtly nuanced performance (perhaps the best of his career when he was still getting &apos;serious&apos; roles) as the guy plagued by occasional catatonia, and James Earl Jones is also fantastic as a brilliant, maverick innovator of psychiatry (think Wilhelm Reich by way of Malcolm X) who, at the end, may be a bit too godlike for his own good. I personally think Terry Southern is a wonderful writer, and I love all of the films from his work from the more favorably acknowledged, like DR. STRANGELOVE and MAGIC Christian, to the less so (CANDY, which is probably my favorite). There are some crazy juxtapositions here as well as absurd humor (that would do the 1920s-30s surrealists proud), but the humor is not stupid by any means. Director Aram Avakian and Terry Southern were a good pairing. It&apos;s too bad that they never did another film together. I can only guess that this dark, dark comedy that is about America in the sixties and about human vulnerability, hubris and arrogance touched many raw nerves with not only some of the IMDb commentators, but the few people who saw it on its initial release. A totally uncompromising picture with the courage of it&apos;s twisted convictions. The intention of director, screenwriter and cast was to rattle complacent, uptight people&apos;s cages -and, judging from the invective here, I&apos;d say they succeeded in spades. I will echo: whomever owns the rights to END OF THE ROAD, put it out on DVD - NOW!",

      "reviewBody": "Il Ferroviere is the story of train engineer Andrea Marcocci and his family in good times and bad seen mostly through the eyes of his youngest son. Marcocci is a lover of wine and song but he is also an obstinate proud man, his own worst enemy as he manages to alienate family and co-workers in post war strike prone Italy. The film opens with him in high spirits but he is soon beset by problems which include an unmarried pregnant daughter, a deadbeat older son, a work accident that ruins his career, performing scab labor and a drinking problem.\n\nIl Ferroviere is a rather mawkish melodrama with weak neorealist roots. The child&apos;s viewpoint and the father&apos;s shame echoes The Bicycle Thief but with less of a sense of desperation. Italy is a decade out of the war and well on the road to recovery. The problem is the bellicose sometimes brutal Andrea who brooks no descent or criticism.\n\nLooking and acting like Kirk Douglas Director Pietro Germi casts himself as Andrea. He is all bombast and not very effective at modulating his moods. He&apos;s all rage and melancholy. It is left up to his forever suffering wife to bring out the good in him. Sure he&apos;s beat her but he works hard for his family she reasons. In Patriarchal 1956 Italy this is acceptable behavior and to drive that point home we have a scene where Andrea pummels his pregnant daughter while neighbors listen but do not intervene.\n\nI find it ironic that director Germi who brilliantly eviscerated Italy&apos;s antiquated marriage laws with the classic comedy-satire Divorce Italian Style (61) condones Andrea&apos;s family battering by making him an overall sympathetic character. He is quick to be forgiven but his pride won&apos;t allow him to be as fast.\n\nAs a timepiece Il Ferroviere provides some disquieting insights with it&apos;s sentimental chauvinism but overall it&apos;s little more than a heated family drama with an operatic tone that sounds off key most of the time.",

While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story, and in that regard it does very well indeed.\n\nHidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen, and the backgrounds inserted digitally. One of Hidden Frontier&apos;s greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production. While this does save a great deal of time, it&apos;s also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. \n\nWhile it may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be best to start off watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.",

      "name": "Excellent variation on the classic story",
      "reviewBody": "Frankenstein must be Destroyed is one of the best of the hammer horror series; and that is saying something, as the studio has produced a lot of horror highlights. Peter Cushing stars as Baron Frankenstein, the mad doctor whom everyone and their dog will recognise instantly from the classic novel. This film is an interesting variation on the classic story, and it sees Baron Frankenstein involving himself in the practice of brain transplant surgery. The film doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the classic novel; it doesn&apos;t make reference to it at any time, and it&apos;s only notable similarity to that from which it is based is the character of Baron Frankenstein. Saying that; it doesn&apos;t really matter, as this film stands on it&apos;s own from the original story. \n\nThe character of Frankenstein has been changed a lot from the one that we all know and love. The original Frankenstein was an over-ambitious scientist that got in over his head and later found redemption. The one here, however, is pure evil. He has no remorse for any of what he has done, and he treats murder only as an obstacle that is in his way. He is cold, calculating and overall; not a nice man. The story really takes off when Frankenstein blackmails Karl, a young scientist, into helping him perform the first brain transplant. The two kidnap Dr Brandt, a fellow mad-scientist who has gone insane and is being held in a mental asylum. A lot of the film&apos;s horror is drawn from the character of Frankenstein, who is expertly portrayed by Peter Cushing.\n\nPeter Cushing is a great actor, and is more than up there on the illustrious list of horror legends. He&apos;s not as pronounced as fellow legend Vincent Price, or as malevolent as fellow legend Christopher Lee; but Peter Cushing has a niche all of his own. His persona is extremely creepy, especially in this film. He&apos;s not evil like you would imagine evil to be; he has a much more intelligent, more calculating presence; and that is far more scary than any man in a monster suit. Peter Cushing&apos;s screen presence is in his authority; he isn&apos;t a big and strong man, but he&apos;s not the sort of person that you would want to upset because you just KNOW that something bad will happen to anyone who does. The acting in Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is surprisingly good, actually; from Hammer films, you don&apos;t tend to expect great acting, but this one delivers. Simon Ward stars (almost!) opposite Peter Cushing as the young scientist blackmailed by Frankenstein. He&apos;s definitely second fiddle to the awesome Peter Cushing, but he performs admirably. Freddie Jones is the real star besides Cushing; although no Boris Karloff, his performance as the man turned into a monster is perfectly tragic. Veronica Carlson is the lady of the film, and she does just fine; and some credit must go to Thorley Walters, too; the man that plays the hazardously idiotic police inspector.\n\nThe ending of the movie is great, and draws parallels with that of the original novel, in that it&apos;s exciting, flame-ridden and everyone gets their comeuppance. Credit must go to Terrence Fisher; he has directed a number of Frankenstein (and Dracula) films, and following up on a classic novel and doing it well is no easy feat. Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is a horror highlight, and a must for fans of the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "Set during WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids, starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuee children and a &apos;Professor of Witchcraft&apos;, thwarts a Nazi invasion.\n\nBrilliantly inventive, with loads of laughs, this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O&apos;Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun.\n\nThe special effects are somewhat dated, but let&apos;s face it, kids don&apos;t care too much about these things, so long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect, and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film&apos;s perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.\n\nAnd besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a &apos;Flash&apos; Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me.",

      "reviewBody": "Now don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoy a good SCI-FI flick as much as anybody. Especially when Christopher Lambert is the star. I really liked the first Fortress Adventure. But it seems as if they made a sequel just for the sake of making a sequel. The basic story line is the pretty much the same as the first. Brennick gets caught by Mental, hence Brennick is once again in a prison(fortress). This time in outer space. How will our hero ever escape? I won&apos;t say too much if you havn&apos;t seen it. But what i will say is that this movie opened my eyes to a new kind of science discovery, appearently a person CAN hold his/her breath in outer space without spacesuit or helmet........right... Anyways, if you are looking for a SCI-FI flick and have NOTHING else to watch. I recommend watching this movie. The visual effects are great. Sound is respectable. You might think I didnt like this movie, actually I own the DVD. Even though this movie wasn&apos;t a huge hit, do you think we will get to see a Fortress 3: Banished to the Planet Ziest....(it would be a good tie-in for Highlander 2 or not...)"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Blinker en de bakfietsbioscoop&quot; was my favorite book when i was younger, and i think this movie is a good adaptation. The characters are good, the actor&apos;s well chosen and the sets seem to come right out of the book.\n\nBut for me there are two weak things. First, adapting meant cutting story lines, which they didn&apos;t do enough. They kept most story lines, but due to the tempo they have to maintain in order to keep this movie short for children, a lot of story lines are left dangling, others are taken up and finished in a mere ten seconds, other story lines never take of, and others are introduced at the end. It would have been better to cut some more, and make the movie less close to the book. They tried to keep up with the book too much. Most scenes never take longer than a minute or two, which doesn&apos;t help to make the movie a smooth flowing story.\n\nThe second weak point is the acting. The most heard comeback you&apos;ll get when you criticize the acting of children and youngsters is &quot;they&apos;re only kids, cut them some slack.&quot; In a way i agree that they don&apos;t have to be judged by the same standards that apply for adults. But on the other hand it is my opinion that you can judge child actors by their own standards. The main actors are obviously chosen for their looks, because they are very true to the descriptions of the characters in the book. No one of the main characters had any formal training or experience before, which unluckily shows in this movie. A lot of dialogue sounds fake, and sometimes they even look bored reciting a line out of the script, which doesn&apos;t do any good to the movie. An exception is the main character, Blinker, who does have some very touching scenes, and who carries the movie adequately. Most adult characters in this movie are stereotypes, (like the clumsy dad, the old scary lady, the baroness, the bossy teacher, the &apos;young&apos; grandmother,...) and the bit of overacting is permitted.\n\nBut the strange thing is, i really like this movie, mainly for the general atmosphere, the setting, the funny dialogue and the main character.\n\nThis movie would have been a lot better if it were longer (to improve the story lines), and if some of the actors had received some more coaching. The rather weak acting is probably due to the short time in which this movie was shot, 31 days, so if the same actors had gotten more time, the result would have been much better.\n\nI rated it 8/10",

Brilliant characters, an intriguing storyline, hilarious incidents, sex, violence, the works...\n\nI gave the movie a 5 because Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds were absolutely hysterical and on-point (I&apos;m sure THEY actually READ the book), but aside from those two gems this movie was a disgrace.\n\nWhat happened to the plot?!? What happened to like half the story?!? What happened to my self respect?!? Why change the ending?!? The story was enthralling and thoroughly enjoyable when I read the book, the movie (breasts considered) not so much..\n\nThere&apos;s a gratuitous 3 minute topless dancing scene, followed by 3 minutes of Demi and the little girl crying and being superdramatic. CHOOSE which audience you&apos;re marketing this movie towards! Women won&apos;t respect a nonsense T&amp;A fest and men don&apos;t want to see a bunch of sappy overdramatics when the movie was advertised like a softcore porno flick.\n\nThe fact that a BOOK about strippers was exponentially better than the movie.. that&apos;s saying something.\n\n\n* Anonymous Disgrunted Hiaasen Fan\n",

I finally just found a copy of this film (unfortuanitly on VHS) and figured I would give it a try. This is a decent film with a solid cast. The story is this, basically there is a creature called the Unholy and it is going around and slaughtering priests. Ben Cross plays one of these priests and is thrown out of a skyscraper like 7 stories up. He miraculously survives without even a mark on his body so the Archbishop believes him to be the chosen one to do battle with the Unholy. The main problems with this movie is that it moves way to slow and the dialog is not very good. There is a decent bit of gore in the film but its only at the beginning and at the end of the movie. So for the most part you have to struggle with good actors working with a terrible script. The special effects also could have been better but are not horrible like most people make them out to be. At the end they should have used stop motion animation to be more effective. But all together this is not a horrible movie it just could have been put together much better. 7 stars",

The one category that fits the above description like jam on toast is the airplane disaster flick. What goes up must come down formula. Pretty straight forward.\n\nSo here we are with &apos;Airspeed&apos;. A vapid entry into the airplane disaster genre that feels like it was cleared for television take-off. It deals with a teenage daughter of a software giant who gets trapped on flight 666. Bad weather, lightening strikes the plane and next you know she&apos;s gotta land the plane to ground safely.\n\nI always like movies with an average everyday citizen being able to land the plane - no training needed - always brings a smile to my face. Makes me wonder why we need those highly trained pilots when all you gotta do is pull a lever and stick-shift.\n\nThis movie doesn&apos;t offer anything redeeming worth spending ninety minutes of your time on. It has the feel of a low budget and there&apos;s very little variety. Either we&apos;re on the plane listening to the girl or in the air traffic control tower listening to dialogue we&apos;ve all heard before. I became so bored with the movie I couldn&apos;t help but pick holes in it. The rough acting, implausible technical aspects.\n\nIf it had succeeded in entertaining me maybe I wouldn&apos;t be so harsh. Was &apos;Turbulence&apos; a good movie? No, not really. Did it entertain? Yes. Finally Joe Mantegna shouldn&apos;t be here slumming it for a second/third billed role. Fat Tony would be ashamed.",

I will not go on and on about how this film affected me or made me feel... It wouldn&apos;t do it any justice. Because just like the premise of the film... it is what it means to YOU... It is how it made YOU feel... I will say on my behalf that it was a genuine motivator in wanting to create and establish meaning to the earth; we as it&apos;s keepers treading and roaming it&apos;s soil and countless acres... You do not have to be wine fanatics; let alone Maynard fanatics (which is never a problem), to enjoy the sweetness this film offers. Of course it is punctuated by bits of humor that feels quite Maynard-ish, but the overall message is felt strongly.... Take an hour and a half... enjoy it...",

Quite the opposite, our lead goes through stations in her life we all go through, trying to make sense out of something that&apos;s hard to make sense of - and sex for sure is something that takes a while to figure, make that quite a long while. Our lead actress does a magnificent job leading us through her world.\n\nA very sensible and sensitive film, hats off to all involved.",

I tried to explain to them that in that day and age, it was sometimes necessary. The beautiful Susan Kohner steals the film. It&apos;s a shame that she only made a handful of movies. To me the most heart-wrenching scene is where Annie visits Sarah Jane in her hotel room. She says&apos; &quot;I want to hold you my arms one more time. Just like you were my baby.&quot; I puddle up just writing about it.\n\nIn Lana Turner&apos;s biography, she writes about the making of this movie. It was made shortly after her daughter stabbed Lana&apos;s gangster boyfriend to death. She said that when you see her crying in the funeral scene, those tears were real. When Mahalia started to sing &quot;Troubles of the World&quot;, all of her troubles started to come back to her and she got up and ran out of the church. They had to run after her and bring her back to complete the scene."

The movie is dedicated to all people who disappeared under Pinochet. (It&apos;s estimated about 3,000 people. To put it into perspective: In Argentina disappeared 30,000 during the military dictatorship)\n\nThe actors are bad, and I pity Harvey Keitel, this movie means a low point in his career. The story is boring, not much drama at all, the message to the audience remains fuzzy. To put it in a nutshell: A lousy movie.\n\nDr. M. , Chile (2004)"

I was a young black male in Ninth grade and I could really identify with this film. \n\nNow if you examine films that were released that year or 10 years before none of them featured a story about a young black male.\n\nThe photography was beautiful and memorable. \n\nI walked out of this film feeling proud and out of all the genre of films made during the blaxploitation era this one and sounder are certainly the most universal.\n\nThis was something that could have been done by Disney if they had the vision then that they have now!\n\nI highly recommend this film and book to students in secondary school and university and since I teach at both I do."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is tough to love. Partly this is due to the setting of the film (nothing but grasslands as far as the eyes can see), but most of it is because the two main characters are so flawed and unlikable. In some ways this unlikability is good, as too often Hollywood films of the 30s and 40s present people in a &quot;black/white&quot; fashion and people who fall somewhere towards the middle are seldom seen. However, such &quot;gray&quot; characters are tough to bond with or care about, so I can understand why the film makers generally avoided this. Katherine Hepburn seems like a good character through much of the film, but midway through it, she shows a self-centeredness that make it tough to really see the tragedy in her life. Her initially living with the cruel and lawless Tracy is unforgivable, but her having an affair and then leaving her kids (one the bastard) with Tracy and not seeing them for almost 20 years make her very, very tough to like. Tracy, on the other hand, does stay to care for his kids--but in a very self-serving fashion. He is an emotionally constricted and yet over-indulgent father. As a human being, he&apos;s a lot worse--killing or nearly killing farmers because he saw the plains as his own personal property. The central message that eventually these farmers contributed to the destruction of the plains is lost--Tracy&apos;s not fighting against the farmers due to any love of nature or a desire to preserve the land. No, he&apos;s just a greedy rancher that will do ANYTHING to keep the land without fences.\n\nDespite the problems with the characters, the film is exquisitely filmed--with some of the more beautiful camera shots I&apos;ve seen in a long time. This film is worth seeing, but not one I would recommend you rush to see.",

      "reviewBody": "As a die hard fan of the original from the first time I saw it, it was only natural for me to hunt down this follow up. While the original had a more simplistic, vengeance orientated plot, this sequel unfortunately bites off a bit more than it can chew as it weaves Yuki in with the politics of early 20 Century Japan and the events of the Russo-Japanese war. Overall it feels like the film is just cashing in on the popularity of Kaji Meiko generated by the first film.\n\nThat said, it still manages to entertain from the very start, with a wonderful sequence of Yuki hacking her way through a load of bad guys. Meiko lost none of her charisma from the original, which is really essential here as the film itself starts to trip of it&apos;s own plot after a while. The fact that politics is the theme here rather than vengeance doesn&apos;t give her quite as much to work with, but her ability to convey almost all of her emotions through her eyes is still a joy to watch.\n\nUltimately it is worth watching if you liked the original and find Kaji Meiko&apos;s presence to be enough to hold your attention. If you value a gripping plot over tremendous acting you&apos;d be better of skipping this. The fact that the first film had both these elements and the sequel only has one makes it an inferior but still highly entertaining follow up.",

Acting is brilliant, and it plays out more realistically, almost in a documentary style. It is interesting to see these legal type dramas, and how lawyers (who all belong at the bottom of the ocean) can debate about the Law only - never mind Justice- whatever that is supposed to be. This is also frightening, in that people are probably even now cooking up things to look into our minds. In an old movie from the sixties, the hero was able to read people&apos;s minds, and one might have thought great, but then a judge admonishes him that surely a person&apos;s mind is their last bastion of privacy - or words to that effect. It is true, as observed in this movie, that privacy is not as valued in this century, and this goes back at least to the. Handycam™ era - at least the early nineties, and perhaps even earlier. Then of course the so-called reality TV, which personally I do not like. This movie also explores the idea of what a person might do if another individual wrongs them, and whether one should take the law into their own hands.",

Yes, I just discovered the picture and enjoyed my 2 hours in company of Geneviève Bujold.\n\nThe film is set in a Hospital which feels and looks just like the real one, what verisimilitude! There&apos;s something strange going on, but is she just imagining it or is there a real conspiracy? There are some stunning examples of locations, the Jefferson institute is amazing, I felt so freaked out by it.\n\nGeneviève Bujold gives an excellent performance, really liked her, she had a lot of warmth, really felt for her and she kept her feminity throughout. Michael Douglas is good, but not great. I think the director could&apos;ve added much more to his character.\n\nThe direction is pretty suspenseful, very slick and framed very well.\n\n The screenplay isn&apos;t bad at all, any problems should&apos;ve been rectified on set.\n\nThe film was framed at 1.66:1 \n\nA nice suspenseful picture, deserves more recognition."

This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world.\n\nDon&apos;t miss it!"

Yet, the action is jaw-dropping like a dropped kick that connects.\n\nI actually saw this movie by mistake at the FantAsia Film Festival. Apparently the usher did not care to verify the name of the movie on my ticket. I think she was too busy eyeing me, or at least that is what I tell myself. So as the movie opened, I thought maybe this is a short film before the feature. When I realized I was in the wrong movie and that this one seemed to be shallow and pointless, I almost left, but my girlfriend said that we already missed the other movie&apos;s beginning and that we should tough it out with this Bangkok Knockout.\n\nAs painful as the beginning of the movie is, once the action got started, we were both glad we stayed. The scenes kept displaying some of the most stunning stunts and choreography in the industry. Then, there is a bit of comedy, some good editing, hot girls who can do a few moves too and a fitting ending. By that time, we were cheering with the enthused FantAsia crowd and easily put the poor plot and bad acting in the back of our mind.\n\nThere are some amazing scenes with cage fighting, blunt or sharp weapons, car, spectacular falls, masked assailants, Terminator-style superhuman, martial arts mastery and then... just when you thought you had seen it all, they bring the fight to the real world and bring in guns, motorcycles, trucks for the grand finale.\n\nThis is the martial arts Matrix in a warehouse with no story. Wachowski brothers, watch out. Less guns, more skills, guts and glory.",

      "reviewBody": "In terms of information (concise, lay information at that!), this documentary was spot on. I found it on my DVR from the Discovery Science Channel (I routinely record &quot;space&quot; night every week). Though the film tends to focus on all of Robert Zubrin&apos;s theories exclusively, it&apos;s a great poster tool for pushing the agenda of manned space exploration past the moon. I suspect the film&apos;s title is a reference to the Mars society, and not to Mars geology (which is what I was thinking at first). Although I&apos;m not a member of the Mars society, but I do agree with the case for Mars in general, and this was more exciting than an hour of watching the Mars rovers slowly dig an inch into Mars&apos; surface.\n\nAlthough I like to consider myself pretty familiar with these topics, this documentary really gave me insight into the history and primary concepts of the argument for Mars that I never really knew before. The Mars Underground actually answered many questions that I knew to ask from my experience that I would have thought would go unanswered in this short documentary. In the first few moments, I was already asking about radiation, provisions, bone mass loss (due to gravity), and the overwhelming cost of a short Mars trip only to throw around some dirt and plant a flag.\n\nDr. Zubrin&apos;s very bold plans really throw standard convention and the tendency to inject too much bureaucracy into a simple project. His almost shoestring budget and nearly arrogant propositions are aligned with the same thinking of the Apollo missions, Christopher Columbus, and other major pioneering ventures. But it&apos;s what is needed to take that next step and step out of our reductionist couch comfort to do what&apos;s right for humanity in the name of life itself.",

Abrams) &amp; Piper Perabo star in a very low key Horror movie, that doesn&apos;t even try to make you believe it has any big action scenes in it. It&apos;s more about the characters and how they react to certain situations.\n\nQuite a few people were appalled by the fact, that there is not that much happening in the movie, but I liked it, because it was slow moving, because it took it&apos;s sweet time. Another criticism is that the movie is predictable. Again it&apos;s not so much about where it&apos;s going, but how it gets there (the &quot;road&quot; so to speak, even literally in this case).",

The film is helped by the magnificent direction of Rouben Mamoulian, who knew a thing, or two, about how to create movies that endured the passage of time. The film has the magnificent score by Rodgers and Hart, the leading geniuses of the American musical theater.\n\nThe picture is a joy to watch from the beginning. The opening sequence in Paris, as people go about their daily routine, ending with Maurice arriving at his own tailor shop is amazing. The story is pure fantasy, but it serves the movie well. The time where this movie was made had a different feel and there was an innocent air surrounding the magic the new talking pictures that were coming out in the early 30s.\n\nThe casting proves to be also excellent. Maurice Chevalier, who was an idol in France, made it big in America. He had a personality that put a good feeling to any character he played. Jeannette McDonald, the leading lady was a favorite of the movie going public and it&apos;s easy to see why she was adored.\n\nAlso a young and fresh Mirna Loy, joins Charles Ruggles and Charles Butterworth in the supporting roles. \n\nThis film should be included in any collection of the discriminating movie fan.",

So he decides to conduct his own investigation into the crime. Early talkie from Alfred Hitchcock is notable for featuring the first voice-over in film history. Obviously the film shows the limitations of the medium in 1930. Given those limitations, Hitch&apos;s direction is all the more impressive. You can see some of the master&apos;s burgeoning greatness in some of the techniques he uses and the little bits of humor sprinkled throughout. It&apos;s still a slow-moving and often creaky relic of early sound filmmaking, but it managed to keep my interest. Nice ending, too.",

Maybe writer John Hughes driest script, with dead dogs and dead aunts tied various places, picnic baskets wet with the grossest of liquids, and a great foul mouthed response from Chase to his whiny family.  3 (so far) sequels have followed, which was good for Chase, seeing how this was his only real memorable character (&apos;cept maybe for Fletch).  And a testament to the films popularity: Wally Joyner, a baseball player for the California Angels who was enjoying a great rookie year in 1986, had the stadium he played in decked out in &quot;Wally World&quot; (the familys destination) signs by fans.  So a big hit all around."

This has been something that has been common in a lot of childhood favourite re-watches. Also love foreign cinema, have been seeing even more of it with a broader knowledge of it and the knowledge is continuing to broaden even more.\n\nRemembered with great fondness being on a roll watching many Russian fantasies and animations five years ago, out of interest and nostalgia, and decided to do it again with a little more time on my hands and being in the midst of a calming down period. My experience of Russian fantasy and animation has been one of great pleasure with so many gems and &apos;The Magic Weaver&apos; was another Russian fantasy film to bring all of those fond memories back. Not one of my absolute favourites of all the Russian fantasies but only because of the high quality of so many to count.\n\n&apos;The Magic Weaver&apos; is well made visually and has held up well, or so to me it has. The scenery made me pine for a trip to Russia, and the production design for the underwater kingdom really enchants. The settings are the very meaning of wondrous, enhanced further by photography that is never too flashy or overblown nor simplistic or static. The special effects are not overused or abused and do have a magical charm, don&apos;t think they&apos;ve dated at all. The music and songs are atmospheric, whimsical and infectious, as well as appealing to listen to and not detracting at all from what&apos;s happening.\n\nAlso highly successful is the writing and storytelling. The writing is the kind that made me laugh, cry and probe thought. There are also political elements but they didn&apos;t feel out of place or heavy-handed. The story has a sense of wonder and has a lot of heart and charm, moving swiftly and never feeling tiresome. There is a bizarre strangeness present but it actually added to the charm\n\nCharacters are always engaging and ones worth caring for and while the acting is slightly theatrical but also very spirited.\n\nIn conclusion, magical. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I&apos;ve seen one samurai film prior to this.\n\nFirst off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.\n\nI thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.\n\nSome of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.\n\nI wasn&apos;t surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film&apos;s most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.\n\nIt&apos;s a powerful story, 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Henry Selick&apos;s first feature, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, was a modern classic.  His next, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, had most of the things that made &quot;Nightmare&quot; great - heavily diluted.  One thing that weakened Selick&apos;s second movie was his decision to begin and end with live action footage, when the glory of both &quot;Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Peach&quot; lay in skilful, sharp, gorgeous stop-motion animation.\n\nIn &quot;Monkeybone&quot; Selick has watered the original batch of Nightmare juice still more (note to Selick: it&apos;s time to stop mining this lode - if you make a fourth feature, get a new look), with at least half of the footage lacking the visual trademarks that were probably the reason for making the film in the first place.  There WAS some stop-motion footage thrown in, probably it&apos;s for old time&apos;s sake.\n\nStill, this is a better, more memorable movie than Selick&apos;s last one, and certainly not nearly as bad as the miserable box-office returns and scathing reviews would lead you to believe.  Yes, the film has its flaws, but if you were to judge from its reception you&apos;d think it didn&apos;t have ANY virtues - which simply isn&apos;t true.  There&apos;s Brendan Fraser, for a start.  How can you not like Stu Miley, or the way Fraser plays him?  (If you want to see Fraser&apos;s charm wasted, see &quot;Bedazzled&quot;.)  At one point Stu is forced to temporarily occupy another body (Chris Kattan), and we instantly transfer our affections to the new actor without giving the matter a second thought - which is more remarkable than it sounds, and shows that Fraser really had been WORKING to get us to like Stu.\n\nThen there&apos;s Downtown, which you must admit, looks good.  It&apos;s more of a visual hodgepodge than Selick&apos;s previous two worlds (the first of which owes its look largely to Tim Burton), partly because it was realised through an ill-chosen mixture of costume, CGI, stop-motion and set design ... our eyes must constantly adjust, yet the overall look is strong enough to make it worth the effort.\n\nAs for the film&apos;s flaws, well, they&apos;ve been greatly exaggerated.  I suppose there were (as several American critics complained) some bodily-function-based jokes, but I can&apos;t recall that many - certainly not as many or as witless as in &quot;Shrek&quot;, and besides, at least some of the jokes in &quot;Monkeybone&quot; are actually funny.  That&apos;s because they&apos;re character-based, and not solely reliant on the alleged shock value of someone suddenly farting or burping.\n\nAll that&apos;s really wrong with &quot;Monkeybone&quot; is that it lacks the brilliance a premise this bizarre demands.  Yeah, well, big deal.  So unlike Selick&apos;s first feature it&apos;s not a masterpiece.  It&apos;s still an entertaining, competently made film with a good, solid story, more than inventive enough to justify having been made.",

      "reviewBody": "Alright, so &apos;Father Hood&apos; is not the perfect movie. There have been many of its kind. It isn&apos;t devoid of plot holes and is predictable. However, it&apos;s also an entertaining road movie about an ex-con, Jack, on the run with his kids (Sabrina Lloyd) who were treated harshly (their hands were cuffed and they were abused) in a detention center). The only person on their side is feisty journalist Kathleen Mercer (Halle Berry) who tries to convince Jack to give her an interview (providing information against the youth detention center) and she&apos;ll work out a deal for him so that his sentence is reduced. Jack also drops by his mother&apos;s (Diane Ladd) in Las Vegas.\n\nOkay, so it&apos;s not anything new but that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t be fun. Shot in a typical early 90&apos;s style, Darrell Roodt catches the cross country landscape effectively. The performances are good too. The late Patrick Swayze is brilliant as the reluctant dad. Sabrina Lloyd is cute and vivacious. Brian Bonsall can be annoying at times (but then again his character was a cliché). Halle Berry is charming in her limited screen time.\n\n&apos;Father Hood&apos; holds some nostalgic value for me and it was nice to go back to memory lane for a while. The way to enjoy this one it to take it for what it is."

      "reviewBody": "I would love to hear the story behind how Barracuda got made. My guess is this: someone penned a land-based thriller entitled &quot;The Lucifer Project&quot; (which is the movies&apos; subtitle) that was about a government conspiracy to control the populace through blood sugar manipulation. The film started pre-production, but someone said &quot;hey, this movie called &apos;Jaws&apos; was really successful three years ago and now I hear this new one called &apos;Piranha&apos; is also going to do well. How about we change the title to &apos;Barracuda&apos; and throw in a few scenes of hypoglycemic fish attacking divers to see if we can make more money&quot;.\n\nThe fish stuff really is that obvious of an afterthought.\n\nIf you attempt to watch Barracuda seriously, it&apos;s incredibly bad on many levels: cheesy acting, bizarre plot twists, a hilariously inept police force (complete with the fat comedy relief character) and an ending scene that strives hard for the bleakness that was so fashionable in the late 70s but only ends up being kind of funny instead. \n\nBut I will say this, if you&apos;re looking for a movie to put on with friends, maybe with a little drink, and run your own MST3K style commentary over the top, Barracuda is an absolute gem. My wife and I had a riot watching it. Unlike a lot of the intentionally bad SyFy channel movies (like Sharknado) that come across as manipulative attempts to draw crowds through corniness, Barracuda is an *actual* bad movie, not a manufactured one, and thus is much more charming and fun to experience.",

      "reviewBody": "From the posters and trailers, you&apos;d expect the Farrelly Brothers to be crude and offensive with this kind of material but it really isn&apos;t. It has a much deeper message than it appears. It knows when to be funny and knows when to be serious. Why so many people disliked it and why critics panned it is totally beyond me!\n\nThe movie is about a man named Hal, played by Jack Black, who judges women based on their looks. He keeps failing at it and his attractive neighbor, Jill, even turns him down after he begs her to go out with him. The next day at his job, he&apos;s bummed that he didn&apos;t get that big promotion and happens to bump into Tony Robbins in the elevator while leaving his work. They get stuck in the elevator and Hal explains him his love life. Robbins then puts a spell on him to see the inner beauty in women so that he can judge a woman based on her personality. Suddenly, things starts to change for Hal. His best friend Mauricio (played by Jason Alexander) notices Hal&apos;s fresh new standards with his taste in women and doesn&apos;t like it one bit. Hal then begins dating a woman who is overweight named Rosemary, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. He sees her as a beautiful, petite woman and they hit it off. Mauricio, who is much more picky with women and more shallow than Hal, can&apos;t believe it.\n\nThat&apos;s the plot for you and I won&apos;t spoil anything, but let&apos;s just say that the story is predictable and the characters are memorable. I can&apos;t give the cast enough credit for doing such a wonderful job and it&apos;s interesting to see Jack Black like you&apos;ve never seen him before, departing from his usual slacker/stoner role that he&apos;s given. Shallow Hal is a movie with a lot of brains and heart to it, as well as a great date movie. There&apos;s more to this movie than it appears, so watch it before you say negative things about it and you may be surprised!",

      "reviewBody": "Spielberg&apos;s film is his vision of Michael Morpurgo&apos;s beloved book, which must surely now be essential reading for all kids, if it wasn&apos;t before.\n\nSuperficially it&apos;s about a horse named Joey and a boy called Albert, who become inseparable through a series of unfortunate events – World War I being one of them. A closer look reveals a story of such overwhelming humanity that I was bowled over. Spielberg was the only director for this film because he knows what it means to be a child.\n\nWhether or not it is apparent in the book, there&apos;s no doubt this is a war film, one that ranks with Spielberg&apos;s &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos; and &apos;Schindler&apos;s List&apos;. Emily Watson&apos;s character utters a line about the refusal of being proud of killing, which is the line one might use to summarise the film&apos;s point. Because Spielberg is Jewish, this line is pregnant with meaning. It&apos;s his noble way of saying that, despite the suffering received by his kin, he is willing to forgive their oppressors.\n\nThere&apos;s a scene where Joey is trapped by barbed-wire in no man&apos;s land and is freed by the combined effort of an Englishman and a German, who put aside their differences under the name of human decency. The scene is breathtaking, and it&apos;s the sort which no-one does better than Spielberg.\n\nLong-time collaborator John Williams provides a moving score, regardless of its resemblance to the one he composed for &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos;. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski reminds us of the beauty of our rural regions by photographing the Devonshire countryside with reverence.\n\nJeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Niels Arestrup and Tom Hiddleston form the principal cast and are wonderful. Nothing could have prepared me for how much I&apos;d be moved. There&apos;s no reason why you won&apos;t be.\n\nmoseleyb13.com",

      "reviewBody": "A soldier comes home from the Civil War to his village, and his wife and son.  The South during the Reconstruction period is an austere, impoverished place.  The returning man, Jack Sommersby, quickly establishes himself as the leader of the community and sets about rebuilding the people&apos;s prosperity.  But is he who he claims to be?\n\nHollywood&apos;s version of the Martin Guerre legend, &quot;Sommersby&quot; boasts a good performance by Richard Gere and a wonderful one by Jodie Foster (as Laurel, Sommersby&apos;s wife).  Until it allows itself to be deflected by an unconvincing and unnecessary murder trial, the film is a likeable and sensitive study of love and identity.\n\nThe story moves through the seasons, from the harshness of winter in the aftermath of war to the solemnity of autumn as Jack Summersby is led away to Nashville.  As the opening credits roll, Summersby is literally in the &apos;dead&apos; of winter, surrounded by images of mortality.  He buries a body (the real Jack?) under a pile of rocks, then walks through a cemetery. Children prod the swinging corpse of a hanged man.  Hope returns in the spring, as Jack distributes land to the villagers and launches the tobacco-growing project.  High summer brings the successful maturing of the crop and with it the pinnacle of Summersby&apos;s fortunes.\n\nThe murder trial weakens the film irretrievably.  It does not sit comfortably with what has preceded it, and just does not work as a courtroom drama.  The ground has not been prepared for it, and so the film is obliged to lurch in an unexpected direction.  Laurel is called as a surprise witness for the Defence, and Jack is startled as she approaches the stand.  Is it really conceivable that Jack&apos;s attorney would adopt this strategy without having discussed it with his client?\n\n&quot;Is this a court of law?&quot; asks the prosecutor, and the viewer is inclined to wonder the same thing.  No attorney would say, &quot;I believe the prosecution has proved beyond a doubt ...&quot;   The lawyer&apos;s personal belief has no relevance at all, and it is for the jury to decide if the case has been proved, not the prosecutor.  Taking a straw poll of opinions in the public gallery is utter nonsense, as is the presence of a black judge in a Southern court in the 1860&apos;s.  And judges do not pronounce on guilt or innocence.  Juries do that.  The word &apos;sassy&apos; is hardly likely to have been in currency with its modern meaning in Tennessee 130 years ago.  That a defendant in a murder trial should fire his attorney then immediately cross-examine his own wife, who is HIS witness, is incredible.\n\nThe early part of the film lays emphasis on the human cost of war. Many of the menfolk of Tennessee are maimed or mentally scarred.  Sommersby explains the changes that have come over him by hinting that he has undergone some psychological trauma and personality shift.\n\nLaurel works in the field, trying to hoe the dirt while encumbered by her long skirts.  This is a metaphor of her life as a Southern woman of the period.  She married a man who neither loved nor respected her, then &apos;lost&apos; him in the war.  Now she has the burden of learning to love this man all over again.  Just as her skirts hamper her, as a woman she is restricted socially and emotionally.\n\nTiny Jodie Foster turns in a mighty performance.  Her character is by turns grave, coquettish, withdrawn and affectionate - and at all times bestowed with intelligence and dignity.  This is a woman who yearns to be loved, but whose painful experiences have taught her to be wary.\n\nBill Pullman is good as Orin, the capable, trustworthy local man who was courting the &apos;widow&apos; Laurel and had expectations of marriage until Jack showed up.  His feud with Jack is thoughtfully handled.  Orin helps cure the tobacco bug problem when a lesser man would have enjoyed Jack&apos;s discomfiture.\n\nUltimately, the story just does not ring true.  Would a whole village take a stranger for the man who grew up in its midst?  And Jack&apos;s final choice (which cannot be revealed here) negates everything for which he has striven.  It defies logic."

She&apos;s a tender figure in pop music that acts in a comfort way that makes us feel a close part of her life, and that&apos;s why she has followers and get new ones each new moment for so many years. But we could never be able to deeply know who Kylie Minogue is.\n\nShe&apos;s a public figure that can maintain a good distance of her private life from the media and also from her fans to a point that we could never know if she is really happy as she demonstrates on every picture that she takes, on every show that she performs, on ever TV appearance that she makes. She is an icon, in all its meaning... and an icon - in all its meaning - is something that exists with no life except the one that we all create in our particular minds.\n\nAfter breast cancer Kylie&apos;s private life has never been so bared and she never had been so exposed. We all got thru that with her and felt a Kylie Minogue-drama that we had never felt before, and that&apos;s why all the world stopped to follow her progress, because, for the first time, we could finally see that Kylie is human and not a icon.\n\nWhite Diamond is all about all said above. It&apos;s a deeply cut in what has been untouchable for so many years. Truly is nothing that we haven&apos;t seen before in a personal documentary. She&apos;s happy, she&apos;s sad, she&apos;s bored, she&apos;s tired, she&apos;s funny, she&apos;s friendly, she&apos;s lonely... of course is a &quot;she is&quot; movie like any other personal portraits, but what make this one so special is her friendly relationship with everyone that surrounds her with no distinctions and the way she personally handles her problems and how she deals everything with sanity even at short moments of necessary insanity. Also, William Baker, the director and personal friend, knew how to be subtle and uncommitted, making everything runs spontaneously natural and true.\n\nWe have the possibilities to see, for the first time, how a so public figure can be so unknown and how fragile and small she becomes behind the stage and behind a make up that covers her feelings like a mask. A respectful movie that explores a backstage once unexplored, and a movie that makes us proud to be connected in a cosmic way to one of the most interesting artists of her time.",

      "reviewBody": "Jimi, a computer programmer, is trying to finish his latest role-playing computer game Nirvana for the Okasama Star corporation.  He is surprised to find that Solo, the lead character has developed awareness of his location in the game, the fact that every time he dies he is reborn, and that he is doomed to live out the same life and situations over and over again.  He asks Jimi to delete the game.\n\nJimi needs to penetrate Okasama&apos;s mainframe, and enlists the help of many technological wizards. Chief among them are Joystick, a poor hacker (or &apos;angel&apos;) who has sold his eyes to raise money and now sees with the aid of small black and white cameras in his eye sockets; and Naima, a woman whose memories have been erased and who can only remember things with the assistance of artificially created memories loaded through a port in her skull.    The mainframe is protected by sophisticated anti-hacking devices known as &apos;devils&apos; which feed off memories and mental energy to destroy the brains of the angels who try to penetrate it.  Jimi is also battling painful memories of his own - his lost girlfriend who disappeared from his life leaving only a video recording and a picture to remind him of her...\n\nAlthough there is not much in this film for action buffs, there is conceptually a link to other films about simulated experience such as Total Recall and The Matrix, as well as some existential musings on the nature of memory and experience in the digital age where such things can be easily synthesised.  A delightfully ambiguous ending emphasises the film&apos;s main themes.\n\nGood use is made of a medium budget to simulate an anarchic future world sliding into decay, with a decline in morality and a low value placed on the sanctity of life and the human body - the streets of the slums are replete with organ thieves; and Joystick&apos;s synthetic eyes are a physical complement to Naima&apos;s synthetic memories.  A strong visual style is complemented by an insistent soundtrack."

      "reviewBody": "More an Intelligent drama, with some violent overtones more than the &quot;thriller&quot; it&apos;s packaged as. This has more in common with &quot;Rashomon&quot; than with the latest slick action movie out of Hollywood. \n\nIsabelle Adjani plays a young woman unhinged by the knowledge of her mother&apos;s brutal rape by 3 men years earlier, and she has built her life around seeking revenge. The film&apos;s most striking aspect is the use of multiple switching narrators, so we see the tale unfold from several points of view. \n\nAdjani, as always, has a tremendous emotional rawness, but for me the performance (and the writing) wears its heart a little too much on it&apos;s sleeve. I wish she wasn&apos;t so clearly crazy much of the time. Or that more people seemed to notice just how blatantly manipulative her behavior is. \n\nThe pace is very slow, which worked a lot of the time, but I did find myself frustrated at moments. \n\nBut all that said, this is an interesting experiment in telling a complex story, with strong performances all around. And if it occasionally falls into melodrama, it also is full of moments that are disturbing, moving and shocking.",

There were surprises at every turn, and the acting by the leading man Arturo de Cordova was superb. What began as a pretty standard-looking (though nicely photographed) soap opera wound up transforming into a striking melodrama with some oddly disturbing moments. I don&apos;t know how indicative this one movie is of Luis Bunuel&apos;s general approach, but if the others are anywhere near as interesting, I look forward to trying them out. He seems ahead of his time, judging by this film.\n\n*** out of ****",

It appears to be some kind of comedy, but if so then it&apos;s the kind that just isn&apos;t funny at all, unless crude humour and bad actors mugging at the screen is your idea of a laugh.\n\nThe tale is about a scientific experiment carried out in a laboratory by a couple of dweebs. The experiment has been funded by staunch conservatives in the White House in order to put an end to people&apos;s sex drives, but it ends up having the opposite effect, releasing a pheromone that has the power to alter sexuality. What we get are a lot of lame sex scenes that try so hard to be funny but really aren&apos;t. It&apos;s a frankly embarrassing waste of time and effort.",

      "reviewBody": "The Legend of Zu has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Mind you this was based on the two times I have watched it. Read what I originally wrote about it: Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark&apos;s use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued doing in most of his later productions.) Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. &quot;Legend of Zu&quot; is connected to &quot;Zu&quot;warriors from magic mountain&quot;! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn&apos;t matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know, he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen, you simply won&apos;t believe. I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn&apos;t shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas. This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or X- Men 3 (putain merde, never ever watch this atrocious film. It&apos;s a downright insult to film fans and comic book lovers). The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humour. In most of Tsui Harks&apos;s movies he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humour. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. &quot;Legend of Zu&quot; delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic! When I got the chance to buy the Blu Ray DVD I did not hesitate a second and purchased it from www.dddhouse.com. This was based on sentiments alone. Now after having watched it I am almost completely shocked how badly it has aged. The once so impressive spectacle isn&apos;t that impressive anymore. Because of that I was able to focus on other elements a whole lot more and I have to admit that The Legend of Zu is not the classic I thought it was. However that does not mean it&apos;s a total fail. There are still some elements in the film that are incredibly creative and inventive visually. But the once gorgeous eye candy definitely has lost it&apos;s shine considerably. Could you fault a director for using a technology that is ever advancing? Well, judging from the few scenes I watched on Youtube I can already tell the original, Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain, holds up better than Tsui Hark&apos;s second film in the franchise. (But I will get back to this once I have looked at the original more critically.) If I have to guess it&apos;s because practical effects look better than CGI effects. That and that other elements in the original are stronger. It&apos;s like Tsui Hark got completely caught up into the application of special effects and spectacle too much and very hastily designed the story and characterization around it as an after thought. Naturally this should have been reversed. But this could imply that at least the action is memorable. Which brings me to my main gripe with The Legend of Zu. There are only a few fight scenes that offer the action goodness I crave in these kinds of films. If you remove all the razzle and dazzle there is very little left to enjoy. The saving grace easily is the cast since they all do their best to take the confusing mess seriously.\n\nSo is this still worth watching? If you haven&apos;t before and love Wuxia and Hong Kong films then definitely. But if you are not a big fan then I can&apos;t recommend it since it&apos;s not an easy film to get into.\n\nFor more honest reviews check: www.chrichtonsworld.com",

Along this period, the SS Gestapo lieutenant Gebhardt (August Diehl) tries to persuade Henri, who was born in silver-spoon and member of an influent Luxembourgian family, to convince the local bishop to give-up resisting to the Germans and write a letter to the Vatican in the name of the Catholic Church of Luxemburg convincing the Pope to support Hitler and the Nazi regime. The ambivalent Henri questions himself and the bishop what he shall do.\n\nBased on a true story, &quot;Der Neunte Tag&quot; is an awesome movie and another impressive example of the powerful German cinema, of which I am a great fan. The philosophical duel between the characters of Ulrich Matthes and August Diehl is simply fantastic, with magnificent silence and dialogs. Sometimes, silence associated to the expression of the face is more significant than words. The direction is stunning and very realistic, particularly in the concentration camp; the music score and the cinematography are very beautiful; and the performances are perfect, with the two lead actors deserving nominations to the Oscar. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;9o Dia&quot; (&quot;9th Day&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "To be honest, I absolutely love trash like this! Maniac Cop is a film that clearly isn&apos;t too caught up with trying to establish itself alongside the more professional efforts of the horror genre, and instead simply revels in it&apos;s B-movie status. This gives the film free reign to do whatever it wants to do, as it doesn&apos;t have to worry about coherency or logic and this helps it massively as the final result shows. Actually, surprisingly enough; this is a rather professionally handled B-movie and many of the reasons why it works are down to things like atmosphere and characters, which are the things that the film isn&apos;t supposed to be bothered about. The plot is well worked also, and the way that the mystery pans out is exciting in all the right places. The story follows a problem in New York. Innocent citizens are turning to the police for help as usual; but one officer isn&apos;t bowing to the law, and has taken it upon himself to dish out justice his own way. This maniac cop is exterminating the local population, and it&apos;s up to framed copper Jack Forrest and his mistress Theresa Mallory to save the day! \n\nThe way that director William Lustig portrays the New York streets gives this film a lot of it&apos;s power. It&apos;s gritty, in the same way that many of the seventies cop thrillers were and this, when combined with the thick eighties trash crust, is what makes this film a winner. The scenes that see the maniac cop taking people out are fiendishly funny, but also quite shocking. The police are looked up to in most societies, and it would be a huge problem if one of them were to start dishing out the wrong kind of law themselves. Scriptwriter and B-movie god Larry Cohen seems keen to portray this too, with much of the action taking in the panic that previous events have caused. One of this film&apos;s main assets is definitely the presence of Evil Dead&apos;s Ash, Bruce Campbell. Campbell isn&apos;t quite as over the top as he was in Sam Raimi&apos;s classic trilogy - but he&apos;s playing a different character and just seeing him is a good reason to see this film. He is joined by fellow B-movie actor Tom Atkins, as well as Laurene Landon and Robert Z&apos;Dar, who is perfectly cast in the title role. This isn&apos;t a film that will please fans of serious movies - but if you like your silly B-grade films, you&apos;ll definitely like this!",

It seems that the Germans want to encourage the IRA to renew hostilities against the British in Northern Ireland&apos;s six counties. Why? Well, then the Brits will be so busy trying to put down this rebellion that the Germans will have an easier time beating them in the war. Some quickly fall for the German agent&apos;s appeals...some are wondering if the cost just isn&apos;t worth it in this proverbial deal with the Devil!\n\nThe acting, as you expect, is quite good. The story, although interesting to me since I used to teach history, might not appeal to so many viewers...particularly if they are not Irish or British. It&apos;s definitely one of Mitchum and Harris&apos; more obscure films but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s bad at all. Well worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve heard that &quot;Primer&quot; is a complicated, dense, and difficult film, you heard correctly. This is not simple entertainment, not even complex entertainment, this is a film that demands true focus and attention, and only then is truly rewarding. I can imagine countless bored people who watched and listened to the movie but didn&apos;t REALLY pay attention to it, didn&apos;t think with it. You simply cannot expect to like &quot;Primer&quot; if you aren&apos;t prepared to be an active participant IN the film.\n\nThe film is remarkably good visually, especially when budget is considered. Carruth clearly has a lot of talent. The cinematography is excellent, the shot composition is flawless, the strength of the visual storytelling astounding. Carruth&apos;s script is the best thing about the movie, and really isn&apos;t flawed at all. The dialogue flows naturally and the ideas are absolutely fascinating and captivating, and even the humor is effective. This movie does not use &apos;technobabble&apos;, it uses genuine scientific concepts as a basis for its events, and certainly some degree of knowledge of physics is needed for a proper understanding of the film.\n\nI have seen &quot;Primer&quot; four times and I still don&apos;t completely understand it (or, at least I couldn&apos;t explain it too well to someone else), even after reading dozens of explanations. It&apos;s an incredibly rich and detailed film, and it&apos;s one that not only rewards but actually requires multiple viewings. This will and has already put many, many people off watching the film, but it only increases its greatness in my opinion. It is simply incredible how much these guys came up with using so little. Carruth&apos;s vision was unique and complete, and he made possibly the greatest debut film ever made, and with a 2:1 shooting ratio (the ratio between the total duration of its footage shot and that which results from its final cut) at that. If that doesn&apos;t prove that Carruth knew what he was doing what does? One of the most inventive, original, and unique movies ever made. \n\n10/10"

The first hour is more like the 1930s mystery movie classics of &apos;The Old Dark House&apos; and &apos;The Cat and the Canary&apos; about family ties and inheritance. After the hour the old Universal monsters take charge starting with Ron Chaney&apos;s transformation into Wolfman. Michael R. Thomas, as Dracula, is particularly impressive in his last screen appearance. There is a creepy atmosphere throughout with some ghoulish characters in make-up. The two outstanding are Barlow the monstrous manservant, and the bedridden Vadoma reminding me of the ancient Femm character from &apos;The Old Dark House.&apos; Fans of &apos;The Addams Family&apos; and &apos;The Munsters&apos; and possibly Scooby Doo may go for this although &apos;House of the Wolfman&apos; is definitely not a spoof of old horror films. There is so much respect for old horror and mystery classics in this which faithfully observes the details of those old movies.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the Berlinale film festival 2012, as part of the official Competition section. The synopsis as published by the film festival, prepared us that we would see two versions of the same Lana: first as a very young girl, and later as a young woman.\n\nThe film started with Lina as a very young girl, wandering through the woods, watching animals and their caretakers. She called for her father in the beginning, but we never saw someone acting as her father. She had to find her own way, so it seemed, in this environment, left to her fantasies.\n\nSuddenly, without an indication that time jumped forward, Lina re-appears as a grown up woman. We see her becoming an assistant for a magician dressed as a cowboy, who suddenly and magically disappears from her life. Later on we see her at work as a masseuse at a spa.\n\nAs a bonus we got a crash course in zoology and insights in zoo internals, though I&apos;m unsure it was intentional to educate us. While many different animals were shown, the giraffe seems to be Lana&apos;s main focus. Anyway, we now know more about giraffes than we&apos;ll ever need to know.\n\nNothing much happens in the sense of a plot, yet we were treated on nice views on animals, the flora in a zoo, and the playgrounds for children&apos;s entertainment. And the magician/cowboy was a nice touch to have him included in the scenario, providing for a mini-story within the film. Same, to a lesser degree, can be said about her job as a masseuse. For that reason, this film was not boring to sit through. Nevertheless, I had expected more of a dramatic development, given the announcement text. Don&apos;t expect a coherent story with head and tail; you won&apos;t get any.",

      "reviewBody": "A Vietnam POW called Robert McBain (Christopher Walken) is freed by a valiant soldier (Chick Vennera) who is killed while is trying a state coup in Columbia (though it was shot in the Phillippines and not actually in Colombia as the movie depicts) . Years later , McBain is appointed by his sister (Maria Conchita Alonso) , then he leads a band of veterans (Michael Ironside , Jay Patterson , Thomas G.Waites , Steve James) into battle against Columbian cartel . As Walken and crew do kidnap a character similar to Gotti and extort money from him to finance the coup in Colombia . The posse of mercenaries join together to infiltrate by means of an airplane in Columbia and bring to justice , both , the country&apos;s leading drug crime King -Pablo Escobar- and his own corrupt Prime Minister (Victor Argo) . They hold several risks , odds and dangers . \n\nThe picture is plenty of action , blast , explosion , battles and numerous kinds of vehicles : planes , jets , buses , jeeps get blown up . It&apos;s disconcerting combined , including a little bit of violence when the fights happen , romance between the protagonists (Walken and Conchita Alonso) and brief characterization of the various roles . Christopher Walken is nice as the two-fisted , he-man starring , he is an one army man who wrecks havocs a group of evil-doers . The movie provides fast and furious entertainment and action with no sense developing itself in great agility , fast paced and movement . The scenes shot all around New York City were in fact real locations such as the Drug House, The Hospital , The Brooklyn Bridge and the Hudson River , everything involving Colombia was shot entirely in the Phillippines . \n\nThe motion picture was regularly directed by James Glickenhaus . Being born in New York City where he usually shoots his movies . Glickenhaus served as the chairman for the film company SGE Entertainment from 1987 to 1995; this company specialized in both making and distributing low-budget independent straight-to-video fare . He&apos;s an expert on violent action movies and so-so films as proved in this ¨McBain¨, ¨The soldier¨ and this ¨Shakedown¨ . He&apos;s also directed a Jackie Chan vehicle titled ¨The protector¨ , the eerie thriller &quot;Slaughter of the Innocents&quot; and the attractive sci-fi romp &quot;Timemaster¨ and of course the extremely violent , low-budgeted and successful 1980 movie , ¨The exterminator¨ , a cruel Vigilante drama . And James was the executive producer for the movies &quot;Maniac Cop,&quot; &quot;Frankenhooker,&quot; both &quot;Basket Case&quot; sequels, &quot;Ring of Steel,&quot; and &quot;Tough and Deadly&quot; . Rating : Average , 5,5/10 but entertaining . Mediocre but entertaining .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; (1965) movie is better than K. A. Porter&apos;s book, and possibly the best ensemble top actors movie ever made.\n\nThe movie got two Academy Awards....one for best cinematography, and the other for best art direction. Both deserved.\n\n&quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; (1965) also deserved (but did not get, sadly) multiple &quot;Best Actor&quot; and Best Actress&quot; awards [&quot;Best Supporting Actor/ Actress awards, also].\n\nHigh quality, in-depth acting of true talent and accomplishment have seldom ever reached the levels achieved in this movie, done repeatedly, again and again and again, from start to finish.\n\nThe movie contained at least half a dozen (possibly more) Academy Award winner best actor performances.....at least three best actor academy award winners performed (incredibily) in this movie (Lee Marvin, Vivien Leigh, and Jose Ferrer), and others (some who may have gotten academy awards I overlooked) were also wonderful in all ways (Simone Signoret, Oscar Werner, Michael Dunn, Elizabeth Ashley, George Segal, Gila Golan, Jose Greco, and Barbara Luna....who sang the famous &quot;Dites Moi&quot; song in South Pacific on the Broadway stage when she was a little girl in 1949!).\n\nThe titles at the start of movie are incredible, and deserve to be ranked with the best of all movie titles ever presented (someday, a special award for movie titles will be established....if this has not already been done, it is certainly an unmet need.....movie titles are important, are an art unto themselves, and a major asset to movies when done well.........see the titles for Bullitt 1968 and North By Northwest 1959 as only two examples of &quot;the best of the best movie titles...the &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; 1965 movie titles are part of the &quot;the best of the best.&quot;) The Abby Mann written screenplay is really an original screenplay with an original story, by far better than the best selling Katherine Anne Porter novel also titled &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; .... not at all the same as the book....better! Stanley Kramer&apos;s direction is wonderful.\n\nOriginal music by Ernest Gold in the movie includes a German language song performed very well by Jose Ferrer. The title of the song is &quot;Heute abend geh&apos;n wir bummein auf der Reeperbahn,&quot; and it is a true &quot;gemutlicheit&quot; German language song, indeed, even if it was written in the USA for a Hollywood, English language movie.\n\nThis movie is a true gem, and deserves to be ranked as one of the best movies of all times.\n\nAll movie actors (I am one) should see this movie....it&apos;s a chance to see &quot;the best of the best&quot; one after the other after the other after the other.\n\nActing just doesn&apos;t get better than is the case in &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; (1965).\n\n-------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for movie credits and biography information.",

The protagonist is a Brooklyn woman of Palestinian descent who goes to her ancestral land for the first time. Subjected to a humiliating search in the Israeli airport, she eventually makes her way to Ramallah.\n\nJacir&apos;s movie - which was Palestine&apos;s submission to the 81st Academy Awards as nominee for Best Foreign Language Film- isn&apos;t about political arguments. It&apos;s about what everyone in the area feels like they&apos;ve gone through. Basically, it seeks to find everyone&apos;s humanity while still making clear the humiliation that the Palestinians suffer on a daily basis (and how plenty of Israelis refuse to acknowledge this).\n\nThis isn&apos;t the sort of movie that you&apos;d watch to understand the situation there in detail, but it still gives a good feeling of things. It could be a double bill with Julian Schnabel&apos;s &quot;Miral&quot;. I recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at its Moscow Film Festival screening last night at the newfangled Oktyabr multiplex. Mercifully, they showed it in English with Russian subtitles on a readout below the screen. Thankfully there was no stupid voice-over or dubbing translation, which is what you normally get in Russian cinemas.\n\nTEMPESTA was intriguing in its premise, but falls absolutely flat in terms of execution. The film does show you something of a new world -- that of the profession of art authenticator. The authentication sequences are absorbing in terms of showing how possibly state-of-the-art technology and the authenticator&apos;s know-how are used to determine whether a painting is genuine or not. You do learn things like cobalt being a pigment that was first used in the 19th century and so couldn&apos;t be used in paintings from the turn of the 15th to the 16th century, but it feels like either there should be some more exposition of this kind or that it would be better off in a documentary about art authentication.\n\nThe film&apos;s one redeeming quality is its fairly intricate cinematography, which is well-lit, has some elaborate multiple dissolves and picture-postcard views of Venice. It really made me want to go to Venice. The carnival sequence even has a slight raciness about it that makes one a bit pumped to go for the promise of some Italian hot tuna. I&apos;m a bit surprised they didn&apos;t try to premiere this at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nI went to go see the film on the strength of the male supporting cast; namely, Rutger Hauer, Malcolm McDowell and Tcheky Karyo. Now the former two actors tend to do a lot of straight-to-video schlock, but in the right project, they could be dynamite. This is not that kind of project, and while McDowell livens the proceedings up with his haughty, snooty turn as an art historian with some secrets, Hauer just walks nonchalantly through his role as Van Beunigen, the director of the Galleria dell&apos;Accademia. However, to be fair to Hauer, he isn&apos;t given much to do. Paul Guilfoyle&apos;s stint as the mafiosi Rossi has a bit of spark and kind of reminds me a little of William Hurt in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. The other performances (including the young leads) are pretty wooden and misdirected for the most part.\n\nThe whole story of skulduggery in the Venice art world is pretty anemic. Despite the seemingly dynamic thefts and bravura stiletto-in-the-eye killings, it strangely lacks dramatic thrust and is never in the least bit convincing. The love interest situation is pat and even slightly comical rather than involving or in the least bit erotic. In general, the proceedings have a sort of phoned-in quality similar to the lead character&apos;s conversation with the insurance company that hired him back in New York.\n\nThe initial cast listing on IMDb.com was perplexing as it listed McDowell and Karyo as playing a character named Valenzin. One thing&apos;s for sure: there is only one Valenzin character in the film and Karyo is definitely NOT playing him, which leads me to believe that he was supposed to be cast, but was replaced by McDowell. Oh, well, so much the better for Karyo in a way. At least he doesn&apos;t have another sub-par movie in his resume.",

      "reviewBody": "The Czech sci-fi comedy Who Wants to Kill Jessie is one of the most oddball, whimsical, original films I&apos;ve seen in quite a while. It starts off with a brilliant yet seldom explored premise: What happens when fictional characters find themselves trapped in reality. It then proceeds to explore this idea in a most comical fashion, and to blend fantasy and reality in a way that is both seamless and jarring.\n\nIt all begins with an older married couple. The husband, a mechanical engineer, has become hooked on a comic serial which shares the name of this film. The wife, a neurologist, has developed a method of viewing and modifying a person&apos;s dreams, which unknown to her, also brings their dreams to life. When she hears her husband talking in his sleep about some &apos;Jessie&apos;, she promptly tries out her invention on him. And sure enough, they are soon joined not only by Jessie, but also the villains who have been pursuing her for the secrets to her inventions. Mayhem ensues as the living dreams chase each other across the city, the cops try to keep up, and the wife grows more and more jealous.\n\nWho Wants to Kill Jessie gets high marks for the originality of its ideas, and even higher marks for how it explores them. For instance, the way the fictional characters continue to communicate in speech bubbles, leading one boy to reply &quot;Sorry miss, I can&apos;t read.&quot; Or the way that when someone takes an uppercut, they take a ballistic trajectory over the nearest rooftop. You can tell that something&apos;s off with the jerky way they move, but that only makes it more cartoonish. And in the comic books, it doesn&apos;t matter how much destruction your battles leave, but in the real world, you put a hole in someone&apos;s bathroom wall and you&apos;re looking at a lawsuit.\n\nWhich brings up an interesting question: Can visions be held liable for damages, or are they the responsibility or the one who dreamed them? This and other questions are dealt with in the most ridiculous courtroom scene since Duck Soup. The scientists&apos; attempts to figure out what to do with the figments are equally comic and unorthodox.\n\nNot all of the laughs come from the fish-out-of-water paradigm either. The henpecked husband angle is played for all it&apos;s worth. And the wife&apos;s jealousy has ironic payoff when she finds the man of her dreams. The weak-willed, bribe taking prison guard is also good for a chuckle, and perhaps a subtle comment on the government. More direct is one doctor&apos;s comment about the party&apos;s potential uses for the dream modification technology. One thing about the Czechs; even when they&apos;re cracking you up, they know how to make a serious point.",

      "reviewBody": "I agree with the last reviewer, this has that two fisted feel of a Warner Brothers B film, and a bit more.\n\nIn the driver seat is big guy Brian Donlevy, famous for tough guys, and he&apos;s rough and ready. A whole lotta&apos; fun, produced by 20th Century Fox, cranking out the Charlie Chan films at the time.\n\nDonlevy plays &quot;Hurry&quot; Kane, a race car driver whose at the top of his game one day, and then at rock bottom. He visits old pal Harry Carey, known as Dad, who runs a cab company and gets a quick job as a cabbie. Not so fast! It seems Dad is being pushed around by big shot slickster Barton MacLane (as Jim), who wants all the cab companies under his thumb --or else.\n\nReminiscent of TAXI (1932), an early James Cagney film all about a tax war, and is there ever. Lots of high speed adventure, and some romance with lovely Rochelle Hudson, playing Sybil. See if you can spot all the famous faces, such as Joseph Crehan as the district attorney, and Lon Chaney, Jr., in a bit role as a garage mechanic. Popular silent and early sound film star Jack Mulhall also has a bit.\n\nDirected with style by Malcolm St. Clair, who did lots of comedy in his day. In fact, he was one of the original Keystone Cops. St. Clair was also toted as being the tallest (6 foot 7) director in the biz, and held a record, of sorts, for being fired a lot, in the early days of his long career, and then immediately re-hired, because nobody could handle a cast and crew as good as he could.\n\nSee this for Brian Donlevy at his best, veteran of such classics as BEAU GESTE and the GLASS KEY.\n\n10 Stars. Finally released on dvd, also as a double bill remastered dvd box set.\n\nThank you so much to MOVIES Net for running this gem.",

It&apos;s a truly wonderful role for Olivia de Havilland, as Jodie Norris, and I can&apos;t think of anyone else who could play it so convincingly.\n\nRoland Culver, in his supporting role as Lord Desham, provides a substantial backup for the elderly &apos;Jodie&apos; who meets him rather abrasively during WW2 days but later relates to him the personal tragedy in her youth. He has the presence of mind and determination to see that old wrongs are set aright -- all of which leads to one of the most beautiful endings to a film anyone could wish for.\n\nIt&apos;s a film that poignantly reflects the war years when so many lives were uprooted, hopes dashed, yet carried on with courage. I wish they made more films like this one, it&apos;s a gem.",

      "reviewBody": "This being a movie by The Asylum, then all odds are stacked against the movie already. However, and this did come as a surprise to me, then &quot;13/13/13&quot; was actually one of the better produced movies to make it out of the clutches of the guys at The Asylum.\n\nThat being said, don&apos;t get me wrong, I am not saying that this movie is great, actually far from it. The storyline is adequate, but it was weighed down by some questionable acting and even more dubious dialogue.\n\nThe story is about leap years having added time to the calendar as we know it, and one this unique day dated 13/13/13 the world comes crashing down, leaving a small group of people fighting for their sanity as the world crumbles into insanity around them.\n\nI will say that the storyline had potential, but it was just shot down by a heap of irrelevant sidetracking and really annoying characters and bad performances. There were certain aspects to the story that had potential, and could have acquired so much more had director James Cullen Bressack opted to put more focus on these.\n\nThe outbreak of violence and erratic behavior was interesting, but it never really amassed into something spectacular. And throughout most of the movie there wasn&apos;t an overwhelming sensation of this being a major issue and a world-threatening outbreak of whatever phenomena it was supposed to be.\n\nThe characters in the movie were rather two-dimensional and wooden, never really getting to shine on the screen, and as such, then we end up with a bunch of characters that the audience don&apos;t really care for or come to have any kind of bonding with in any regards.\n\nProduction-wise, then &quot;13/13/13&quot; was actually quite good, and this was definitely a step in the right director for The Asylum, but there is still a long way to go yet.\n\nThis movie came and went without leaving a lasting impression, and I seriously doubt that it will make a return for a second viewing. The movie just didn&apos;t have enough to offer to sustain a second watching.\n\nDon&apos;t get lured in by the interesting poster / DVD cover, which I did, because it is utterly misleading and promises something that has nothing to do with the movie at all.\n\n&quot;13/13/13&quot; gets a mere 3 out of 10 rating from me, given the production value and certain aspects which had potential.",

The corrupt police force does not take any action against him. The Schut holds an English aristocrat and a French merchant for a ransom, then he also abducts the beautiful Tschita (Marie Versini). Kara Ben Nemsi (Lex Barker) tries to find the Schut&apos;s hiding-place in the mountains and free the prisoners. But the Schut has many rogues and assassins under his command who make this search long and dangerous.\n\nHollywood director Robert Siodmak, famous for the Burt Lancaster classics &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; and &quot;The Killers&quot;, directed this picture on location in Yugoslavia. Despite his experience, some fights are not convincing (e.g. Kara holding the weight of both Aladschy brothers on a rope!) and the low budget is occasionally revealed, but nevertheless &quot;Der Schut&quot; is the best movie from the oriental branch of the May series in the 1960s. Solid action and a good sense of humor carried by Dieter Borsche (as Lord Lindsay) and Chris Howland (butler Archie) as well as Ralf Wolter (in the role of Kara&apos;s sidekick Halef) fit well together, recommendable!",

      "reviewBody": "Made in one set, with three principal actors, and over seven days, Aragami impresses far more than the more immature Versus. Setting himself the task of shooting an action movie in one room (itself a possible contradiction in terms) the constraints ultimately make for a much more satisfying and engrossing experience than his previous, overrated breakthrough film - which was too carelessly off the wall and derivative to impress this viewer. As a project Aragami also contrasts strongly with the much more opened out Azumi (another personal favourite), which replaced the gloomy interiors and philosophising of Aragami with something much more kinetic and light hearted.\n\nAt heart Aragami is a film about knowing who you are, and both Osawa (who has since appeared in the less concentrated Sky High) and Masaya Kato are excellent in roles which, like chamber music, leave every flaw in performance likely to be exposed. Obviously written at speed, the film&apos;s pay off could have been more enlightening (but perhaps a touch of obscurity in this sort of thing is a benefit, especially at a time when Hollywood genre efforts typically feel obliged to spell everything out), but fans won&apos;t argue too much and interpretations are easy to make. The wonder of the film is that the director was able to stage and direct two action scenes - one short, one more extended - with such gusto and convincing moves, given the tight shooting schedule and limitation of the set, while still allowing himself time for empathetic set ups during slower moments. It requires the ingenuity and confidence of a Roger Corman to bring this thing off, raising such stuff above straight-to-video fodder, and Kitamura succeeds magnificently.\n\nIgnore those who claim the film is &apos;too talky&apos;, for none of the chat is wasted (there&apos;s none of the narrative indulgence seen in the recent Sky High, for instance), the actors have enough presence to carry it off, and time spent with them never palls. Over 79 minutes nothing drags, and the changing relationship between the samurai and the goblin provide constant interest. The developing duel between the two principals neatly reflects back to the friendly rivalry between Kitamura and his fellow director Tsutsumi which originally initiated the film. If you are tired of bloated Hollywood mega-buck productions and want to get back to the basics of purposeful dialogue, imaginative stageing and thought-through editing - in short, lean, popcorn pumping cinema - then this is a film you need to see."

Set in Houstonville, Texas , where arrives a wayward deputy Marshal :Glen Sasxon who takes on nasty gunslingers and powerful local people as the Mayor : Renato Baldini and the villainous Alan : Nello Pazzafini who hire a tough gunfighter: Gordon Mitchell to smack down the poor farmers.\n\nRegular Pasta Western with ordinary genre stars , in which the sheriff protagonist puts peace and order at a little town harassed by a corrupt Mayor and his hoodlums. The highlights of the movie are the creepy , thrilling hanging and the moving final during the Thanksgiving Day when takes place the ultimate confrontation full of attacks , shots , fights , and deaths . It stars Glen Saxson as a two-fisted and witful marshall , Glen played various Westerns as Django shoots first, The long day of the massacre , Go with God Gringo, Magnificent Texan , though he also played Adventures as Luana, Kriminal and Return of Kriminal . Costars the ugly and hunk Gordon Mitchell playing a pistolero nicknamed Mule or Donkey , he essentially performed Peplum as Ira Achille, Atlas in land of Cyclops., Brennio il enemigo di Roma, Erik the Viking , Julius Caesar against pirates , Battle of Corinth , Giant of metropolis ; but also he made a lot of Spaghettis as Django and Sartana, Arizona Kid , Rita in the west , John il Bastard , Thompson1880 and usually working for Demofilo Fidani. Support cast is pretty good filled with Ravioli habitual faces as the ordinary baddie Nello Pazzafini , John Bartha as a farmer , Philippe Hersent as a deputy , Spartaco Conversi as a sheriff , and Renato Baldini as a malicious Mayor who wants to evict the settlers to take their lands.\n\nIt displays a functional and atmospheric cinematography by Fausto Rossi. As well as an evocative Spaghetti score by Lallo or Coriolano Gori . The motion picture was regularly directed by Alfonso Brescia or Al Bradley. He was an uneven craftsman with a long career who directed several films in all kinds of genres in low budget. As he made Adventure : Ator the iron warrior , Zana Bianca, Amazon women against the Supermen, Loves of Don Juan ; Sci fi : Cosmos, Stars battle; Pepum : Magnificent gladiator, Conqueror of Atlantida, La rivolta dei Pretoriani; WWII : Kill Rommell , Mision arenas ardientes, Hell in Normady .And of course Spaghetti Western such as Winchester Bill, Killer caliber 32, Law of Colt , Days of violence and this Carogne si nasce.",

Although I usually do not like Nick Nolte and the roles he plays, he showed great depth in this film.\n\nViewers who are unaccustomed to abstract film-making will find the plot disturbingly confusing, but I thought the transcendent themes overode the ambiguuities. If you absolutely HAVE to &quot;understand&quot; the film, just listen to the director&apos;s comments on the DVD. Doing this, however, diminishes the abstract beauty of the film--the way an art expert can ruin the experience of a fascinating painting in a museum.\n\nBy an odd coincidence, I had toured the locale for this film only a few months before purchasing it, and I thought the director captured the awesome yet austere nature of western Montana well.\n\nThe film is worth seeing just for the scenery and cinematography alone, and it offers many interesting topics for sociological discussions. I have already recommended it to number of my friends who appreciate esoteric films."

      "name": "Brilliant film, comparable to Pleasantville",
      "reviewBody": "Niceland is the most recent film from Iceland&apos;s master filmmaker, Fridrik Thor Fridriksson and it is a brilliant piece of work. In 90 minutes he manages to capture the emotional essence of life as it is lived and life as it should be lived, both, making us feel happy, amused, sad, hopeful, joyful. The poignancy of the story is so finely tuned and so intelligently crafted that it would be difficult to think of another current film (this is from 2004) that does what this one does.\n\nPlaying like an allegory, Niceland&apos;s cast is comprised of Scottish and Icelandic actors; the leads are, in fact, Scottish and a good number of the supporting actors are Icelandic. What&apos;s both amusing and irritating is that Fridriksson has English subtitles when everyone speaks English! The viewer gets the feeling that this was done to spoof foreign films that require subtitles; another reason, however, is to slightly jar the viewer--i.e., is this a foreign film or isn&apos;t it? If it is, where is the setting? There&apos;s only a single tiny hint that this may be set in Iceland which is when one TV is playing, the viewer hears people speaking in a language that is definitely not English. But all other times, English is spoken--by the characters and by whoever&apos;s on the TV (TV figures quite a bit in the film).\n\nJed and Chloe, young 20-somethings, work side by side in a factory and are somewhat intellectually challenged--Chloe, for example, feels that the purpose of her life is her cat Catey. But it is just this not-quite-normalcy of these two leads that gives this film its tremendous poignancy. We discover as well that Jed&apos;s parents have some problems in their marriage--the father sells TVs for a living--and also that Jed ultimately becomes convinced that he must obtain the purpose of life--of life for both him and Chloe together--from a man named Max who is interviewed on TV and claims to know the purpose of life--although he won&apos;t just come right out and say it.\n\nJed goes to find Max and Max, as it turns out, is a much more complex character than he initially appears to be. The very well crafted interactions of these three characters--Max, Chloe, and Jed--and some of the other characters who surround or support them--Jed&apos;s parents, his friend Alex, Chloe&apos;s mother--are all interwoven so delicately and so thoughtfully that to miss this film would be a real crime.\n\nThe allegorical nature of this film, and its two young leads, recalls a somewhat similar American film, Pleasantville. Although the latter is without question a different film, there is a kind of eerie similarity in that we definitely feel that we are in some kind of familiar yet surreal alternate universe kind of &quot;anytown&quot;, where people are subtly exaggerated versions of the archetypal/stereotypical folks we&apos;ve met before in other films, novels, plays, or maybe even in real life. This allegorical/surreal haze that delicately colors the proceedings lends the film a unique quality that one would, I think, be hard put to find in many other films. Aside from Pleasantville, nothing else comes immediately to mind. \n\nThis is a terrific comedy-drama with subtle elements of fantasy and surrealism that absolutely demands a wider audience. I managed to see this in April 2005 in New York City at a film festival of Scandinavian film (one of the great things about being in NY City is the astounding diversity of available films).\n\nVery highly recommended; one of the best films of 2004, no question.",

I had seen a trailer, which I though was stupid, but since my friend is a great craftsman (e.g. behind the movie &quot;Fritt vilt II&quot;) I went to see this one.\n\nFrom the very first scene I was captured by how intelligent the use of humor was. This is made for teenagers, especially i thought for those who spend a lot of their time playing soccer. But the case is that this is simply a well written, and great acted comedy for all. You don&apos;t even need a family to enjoy this family-comedy.\n\nThirteen year old Jo is a smart thinker of a guy, and has a very vivid imagination, but is bothered by his fellow classmates, and is a rather hopeless soccer goalie. Still he tries to cope with this difficult time in life. He&apos;s doing the homework of the &quot;bad guy&quot; in his class, son of a rich salesman of caravans. Jo&apos;s mother is seeing dangers all around, being overprotective, and trying to hide her affair with the psychologist neighbor. Every kid in the street is trying to get hold of a football-card with the goalie of Liverpool. This is to kill for...\n\nExtra kudos to both Jo and his mother Andrine Sæther. Fritjof Såheim as the football coach, and father of Jo&apos;s best friend is once again brilliant in a role. See this, and be amused. I found myself laughing more than I can ever remember to have done in many years. And this film is not made for middle aged men. But that&apos;s how good it is!",

And there was not enough interaction between Sharpe and Harper! It did show the first signs of trouble for Sharpe concerning his wife Jane! Overall there was enough humor and action to keep you satisfied but the intensity from the previous episode is gone! What i really liked in this episode that they showed what the chosen men are about! I mean they showed respect to true soldiers no matter what colors they are wearing! If this actually happened in that time,I don&apos;t know, but it was a nice touch!",

      "reviewBody": "Though this movie was clearly designed to have mass-market teen appeal, it has a serious side that makes it stand out from other movies of the same type. The premise, a teenage boy&apos;s first sexual encounter turns out to be with his roommate&apos;s mother, is contrived to arouse curiosity among adolescents. Combine this with unsophisticated humor and flaunting of authority and you have the formula for a popular teen romp. But it seems that there is a movie with some sensitivity and drama trapped within this rather restrictive framework. The boy is torn between his friendship with his roommate and his relationship with his friend&apos;s mother. The woman is repressed and intimidated by her husband and finds a sense of freedom in this forbidden relationship which she can&apos;t seem to let go. The result is a movie that tries to be both a high school date movie of the week and an adult drama, landing somewhat awkwardly somewhere in the middle. It does have some laughs though and some before-they-were-famous appearances that might make it worth while.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on Leon Uris&apos; novel of the same name about the tense days of the Cuban missile crisis, Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s `Topaz&apos; is an underrated cold-war thriller  - - underrated by English-speaking audiences and critics probably because the chief protagonist is a Frenchman!  The first half of the movie is especially exciting, starting as it does with the defection (very realistically filmed) of a top Soviet official to the U.S, who hints at the existence of Soviet missiles in Cuba..  Frederick Stafford very adequately plays Andre Deveraux, the French trade official with Cuban connections whose help is requested by the Americans.  Karin Dor is excellent as his beautiful Cuban paramour.  Hitchcock&apos;s initial portrayal of Castro&apos;s Cuba is that of a rather benign place, but quickly changes to a frightening place later in the movie when the director clearly delineates the full brutality of his terrible regime.  Deveraux&apos;s allies in Cuba are tortured and killed.  The last third of the film, set in France, is not as exciting.  The movie takes it own time exposing the members of the Topaz spy ring.  The transition of the action from Cuba to France is abrupt and is another weakness of this flick.  Maybe, `Topaz&apos; should have been filmed in 2 parts, one about the Cuban missile crisis and another about French fellow-travellers!  This is, perhaps, the only movie in which Hitchcock seems to show some sympathy towards those who get murdered, as evidenced by the final scene, which shows the ironical contrast between the superficial newspaper headline about the Cuban missile crisis ending and the grim fates of the unsung secret agents who helped end it.  `Topaz&apos; is one of the best cold-war movies ever made. Critics should re-evaluate it.  But it is only a good Hitchcock movie, not his best."

The series are produced carefully, the actors - only several ones are professionals - played with great conviction. The series where showed only in Switzerland, but with much success, so the producers had the idea to cut from the whole material a motion picture film who was showed also with success.",

      "reviewBody": "There are good films and there are bad films, but my favourite &apos;genre&apos; seems to simply be &apos;entertaining&apos; films. I&apos;m sure most people won&apos;t be putting 1992&apos;s &apos;Freejack&apos; up there with &apos;The Godfather&apos; and &apos;Empire Strikes Back&apos; and there are probably those (mainly professional film critics with no sense of fun!) who would describe it as &apos;bad.&apos; However, I totally disagree. I enjoyed it so much back when I was a teen and I still smile at it now.\n\nEmilio Estevez plays &apos;Alex&apos; - a racecar driver who dies in an explosion during a lap in 1992, only to wake up in the (at the time!) &apos;far flung future&apos; of 2009 where he&apos;s been plucked from his own time a split second before his death and now someone wants to use his body for, er, some nefarious purpose.\n\nWhat follows could probably fall into the &apos;sci-fi/chase&apos; movie where Alex in on the run in his new surroundings while being pursued by shady forces. Now, I should mention that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on the cast list. But don&apos;t get ideas of some great &apos;Hannibal Lecter&apos; performance. He&apos;s pretty much just an extended cameo. We also have Rene Russo as the &apos;love interest&apos; and, like so many roles, she is only really there for the romantic element and doesn&apos;t really get much in the way of character development. However, the best &apos;actor&apos; is not one of these heavyweights.\n\nThe ever awesome Mick Jagger (yes, not really known for his &apos;acting&apos;) is the black leather-clad henchman, in charge of a small private army of futuristic goons hell-bent on brining Alex&apos;s body in for... you&apos;ll find out what. Now, he&apos;s no actor. And it shows. I&apos;m not going to say his performance is &apos;fantastic,&apos; only that you&apos;re guaranteed to remember it for all time. The film may actually be &apos;average&apos; to most, but Jagger&apos;s swagger as the henchmen is pure cinematic gold. He steals every scene - sometimes menacing, sometimes comical, always brilliant and is worth the film&apos;s run-time alone.\n\nNowadays, I&apos;ve seen &apos;Freejack&apos; has developed a small cult following in the sci-fi community and many have put it in the &apos;so-bad-it&apos;s-good&apos; category. That may be true to a degree (especially when discussing Mr Jagger!), but I think it&apos;s actually a good little action, sci-fi B-movie.\n\nDon&apos;t be too hard on it and just enjoy the ride as it&apos;s very well put together and covers quite a few sci-fi concepts that are actually quite original. Plus, when I watch it now I also realise that I&apos;ve been watching &apos;Mike&apos; from &apos;Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul&apos; in this film for all these years and I never realised.",

I had forgotten how stylish-looking it was and it was fun to see.\n\nWhat I did remember were a couple of wild scenes, such as &quot;Darkman&quot; (Liam Neeson) being swung around in the sky on the end of a chain from a helicopter, and the big fire scene early on which turns Neeson&apos;s character into the masked hero.\n\nThe villains in the movie are over-the-top, leading with Larry Drake&apos;s character &quot;Durant.&quot; There also is some outrageous Rambo action which stretches way past credibility, such as people shooting from five feet away and missing our hero!\n\nOverall, not as good as the critics would have you believe, but still entertaining. At least it has two quality actors in Neeson and Frances McDormand. Drake went on to play the infamous &quot;Dr. Giggles.&quot; If you liked this crazy film, you&apos;ll love that one.",

      "reviewBody": "Having just seen this for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised; this is a solid, well-acted and scripted, somewhat tongue-and-cheek but scary horror/sci-fi film with a premise simutaneously nightmarishly banal/outrageous: a petty American criminal (looking like a cheap burley thug, the kind who would &quot;threaten&quot; George Reeves on the cheap sets on the t.v. Superman) hooks up in Europe with a German (read: Nazi) scientist experimenting with neural stimulation, and uses the doctor to seek revenge on his enemies by having the doctor&apos;s lab subjects become zombiefied killing machines, all via t.v. screens and microphones. The scenes of the gangster and the conflicted scientist constantly standing in front of the screens is at once deliberately &quot;boring&quot; and yet so weirdly disturbing. Even more disturbing and nightmarish are the two of them constantly donning radiation suits to crawl through what looks like some sort of embryonic white plastic tunnel to get to the lab and work on the zombies brains. The science fiction is contrasted humorously with the white-picket fence-ish 1950&apos;s domesticity of Richard Denning and his little family. Ah, Richard Denning! Golden wavy-haired, stalwart, fine-figured, supremely handsome, serious yet light-hearted, flirting with his wife yet always ready at a moment&apos;s notice to follow up any lead as a police doctor. One of the delights of this movie is a sort of spoof of pipe-smoking! Denning and a detective constantly light up so much that the detective offers Richard to &quot;try my special blend&quot;. We also get the much used and appreciated staple of 50&apos;s sci-fi movies, the educational film strip, although here it is a bare, er, &quot;bones&quot; demonstration, with just a little doggy who has electrodes on his head. (I do NOT recommend this film for children say, under 12 years old!) The climax has a very &quot;modern&quot; Night of the Living Dead feel to it. The plot moves along at a satisfying pace and never lags. The dialog is punchy and clever. The villains are definitely memorable in a strangely &quot;unmemorable&quot; way. (the genius of the movie, I think!) I highly recommend this to all sci-fi/horror film buffs.",

      "reviewBody": "Glynn Turman plays Isaac &quot;Ike&quot; Hendricks, an amiable law student in New Orleans. One night, in the company of his girl and his friends, he decides to undergo hypnosis, just for the hell of it. However, this enables a restless spirit named J.D. Walker (David McKnight) to possess Ikes&apos; body, all in the name of revenge. J.D. was a lowlife criminal who&apos;d been made to look guilty for a womans&apos; murder back during the WWII era. Now the possessed Ike starts to sound and act like J.D., and indulge in various unsavoury pursuits while going about this mission of vengeance.\n\nA very engaging cast helps to make this watchable. It&apos;s never a great film but it is a decent and enjoyable one. Producer / director Arthur Marks injects lots of grisly slaughterhouse imagery into the proceedings, which get fairly bloody and intriguing if never exactly scary. The movie goes a fair distance on the performances by young Turman (&quot;Cooley High&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;John Dies at the End&quot;). Naturally, he does look to be having a fine time when called upon to imitate McKnight in his portrayal of the slick and creepy J.D.\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. is very lively as the reformed criminal turned flamboyant preacher who also figures into the plot. The cute Joan Pringle is a likable leading lady as she plays Ikes&apos; girl Christella. Also fine in support are Carl W. Crudup, Julian Christopher, Fred Pinkard, the stunningly beautiful Alice Jubert, and Earl Billings. McKnight conveys plenty of oily menace as the revenge-crazed spirit. Rhonda Shear and Bob Minor have bit parts.\n\nWorth a look alongside other genre crossovers such as &quot;Abby&quot; and &quot;Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde&quot;.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

It created the space for SeaWorld and other water parks. As a movie, the story has limited tension. It&apos;s a family picture and it doesn&apos;t get more family than watching the dog swim with the dolphin. They seem to have used all the wind machines to create the hurricane. There is a lot of swimming with the dolphin which would have amazed everybody back in the day. The underwater adventure is good cinema. All in all, it&apos;s a mixed bag.",

      "reviewBody": "I will admit, I thought I&apos;d seen it all when I first saw Charles Laughton bring the snivelling and maniacal Captain Bligh to life. I was dead wrong. Anthony Hopkins, whom I place on the highest rank of accomplished actors, recreates the memorable role with incredible flair and complexity. He shows us not just an insane seaman bent on ultimate subordination, but a man with real concern for maintaining order, knowing the consequences of anything less. &quot;The Bounty&quot;, yet another retelling of the classic tale, is actually an amazing recreation of the sea fable, pumped with real emotion and drama. The writers really understand the characters in this story, especially in Bligh&apos;s case, but also in Fletcher Christian&apos;s as well. Mel Gibson reigns over the role this time, still fresh from his Australian beginnings, and undoubtedly one of the best at perfecting the challenged and affected hero. I proudly rave this version of the famous mutiny, and probably will place this among 1984&apos;s best films. Rating: Three stars and a half."

      "reviewBody": "Martin Ritt was a very good director, but this film is not his best. Probably because the film was one of those he directed after being accused of being communist during the McCarthy&apos;s hunt. Two stars like Sophia Loren and Anthony Quinn together again for the second time (They were acting together in &quot;Attila&quot; 1954) made the film a good entertainment with a very happy end. Quinn&apos;s daughter is too egoist with his father because she does not want to share him with any other woman, and once noticed the new relationship with Sophia, a widow of a presumably maffia man, who also has a son sitting in farm school for children with problems of behavior. Sophia solved the problem Quinn had with his daughter (too simple way of solution) and Quinn was able to get the sympathy of her son and to take him back with them. I wish life could be like it was shown here, it was so simple and easy.",

They see a woman dressed in white and are so alarmed they go report it to the police then have to go to hospital for a sedative. In the urgency, the cops call for their off-duty Luitenant, Bradford, to call off his night at the opera with his wife to go investigate. Un-offically, he&apos;s the resident ghost chaser you know (though the department can not and will not admit it!!).  Anyway, he chooses idiot Cop Paul marco to go join him instead of any of the other guys.  Marco somehow doesn&apos;t actually go with him, but goes alone about an hour or so later after finally managing to get a patrol car.  He spends 1/2 the film in his car outside the mansion fainting from seeing this woman in white and taking potshots at her (as well as a woman in black who has now turned up) Bradford meanwhile, has broken entry to the house and is greeted by a *cough* Dr.Acula.  This Acula guy holds seances.  he spends ages on one seance with Bradford watching.  The viewer is treated to a trumpet that plays by itself, a black man pulling faces as well as a few indescribable objects that look like parts of a car. Anyway, after a (long) while We learn Dr. Ac is a FAKE!!!  The woman in white is infact...a woman in white who has to scare the cops away!!! Bradford, in Ac&apos;s absence goes off to explore the old mansion and spends some time reminiscing about the bannister (luckily(!) for the viewer, we can hear his thoughts).  He bumps into Lobo (who is more hilarious + wooden than ever). Ac finds Bradford with Lobo who lock him up in a room. \n\nMeanwhile Marco has called for help and by now actually gets out the car and enters the place. There are a few confrontations between cops (Bradford escapes from the room with no problems at all) and Ac and the white lady + upon receiving $10K from the seance decide to make a run for it.  He sends one of his &quot;actors&quot; to shoot at the cops!! (for a fake seance??).  Lobo is finally shot dead, but the real twist has just started...\n\nThis is grade Z rubbish.  REALLY bad.  In an attempt to escape right at the end, Dr. Ac actually RUNS TOWARDS his nemesis&apos;!!\n\nNot as &quot;good&quot; as plan 9 (unfortuntely) but worth seeing for Wood-Fans"

She didn&apos;t of course, but had a jolly good try, and Channel 4 have thoughtfully shown the official record without ad breaks immediately after today&apos;s two minute silence.\n\nThere had already been a film of George VI&apos;s coronation in Dufaycolor in 1937 but 1953 proved a particularly fortuitous moment as it coincided with the final flourish of glorious Technicolor. The process&apos;s limitations denied the makers modern luxuries like zooms, so the whole spectacle for the most part looks like the viewer is up in the Gods, but it has the advantage of making tangible the size of the spectacle.\n\nSimilarly fortuitous was that it rained that day, which mayn&apos;t have been much fun for the participants and spectators but that and the constantly changing light provides visual interest (likewise the unfortunate placement of the camera at a point in the parade when the troops marching down the Mall constantly had to skirt a jutting kerb).",

      "reviewBody": "Before becoming the famous photographer and documentary maker he has been for decades now, Raymond Depardon had been a child. Yes, I know, this is no scoop, but the fact is that young Raymond was born into a family of farmers in Haute-Loire, an isolated region of France. His art took him to various places around the world until, ten years ago, he felt the urge to become a witness to those farmers&apos;lives, values and family stories. Mario Ruspoli had done the same thing in the same region (the Lozère) with &quot;Les inconnus de la terre&quot; (1961). So why not him? All the more as he was a native son... But while roaming the world, notably falling in love with the desert, he had become estranged from the countryside of his childhood. Would he be able to give voice to these unknown heroes, who had been clinging to a rather unproductive land and had managed to survive and remain free? Well, there was no reason to be afraid, judging from this third part of the &quot;Profils paysans&quot; triptych. For, although the local people have no particular taste for the spoken language (they favor silence - or in a pinch monosyllables!), Depardon has a knack for bringing into the light what is lurking within them. His method could not be simpler: he just gives the interviewees ... time. He is not in a hurry (nor must we be) and, when the film ends, we finally know the protagonists like the back of our hand. Another good point is the director&apos;s choice of the 35mm format, the 2.35 aspect ratio and the Dolby sound mix. From the very first minute you get the feeling that this is no cheap movie and that the people you are going to meet are worth your attention. In the same respect, there are beautiful tracking shots following the winding roads of Auvergne and two melancholy pieces by French composer Gabriel Fauré.\n\nIn the end Depardon has reconciled with his childhood environment while the townspeople who see &quot;La vie moderne&quot; have with the countryside and its people they all too often disregard. A good deed indeed!",

The movie inspired real feelings of sadness in me.\n\nI also learned a lot about the holocaust, but I must repeat it. Yoni Wechsler, Steven Herman and Emily Binstein almost ruined it for me.

Instead of a story, we&apos;re given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It&apos;s not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren&apos;t actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart, and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick&apos;s 2001: A Space Odyssey in the desert; that&apos;s what this movie is like. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body. A must see. It will change the way you view films. Rating: 10 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Inarritu&apos;s three previous films---Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel---are classified together as the Death Trilogy, as they each depict the exponential impact of fatal or near-fatal occurrences in the interconnected existence of separate lives. They are each epic, punch-packing dramatic powerhouses. But now I see he still had much more to say on the literally infinite subject of death. And he says it with Biutiful, a purely experiential film that pierces through the heart with the acuity of a stingray barb.\n\nThe narrative here is a rail tunnel of raw, sprawling intimacy set in an overpopulated, decaying Barcelona ghetto. We follow Uxbal, and we&apos;re not entirely sure what he does. Neither does anybody, or him really. Much of the things he does are criminal, mainly mitigating between corrupt police and illegal aliens, with often catastrophic results. He is also a dedicated father to two young children whose mother, his ex-wife, is a wreck of alcohol, bipolarity and promiscuity, and worse, knows her inability to control herself and is in a quicksand of bettering herself. Uxbal also has prostate cancer, which is rapidly spreading. Also, he is internally connected with the afterlife. He doesn&apos;t see visions, he doesn&apos;t clutch shoulders and see the manner of one&apos;s impending death. He purely senses a recently deceased spirit in the room with him. He can do nothing about their situation. He just senses them.\n\nUxbal&apos;s ability to feel the presence of departed souls is portrayed like a sort of capacity to hear noise at the volume at which, say, a dog could only be expected to hear it. The film&apos;s setting and happenings are a jerky, spontaneous, lateral rush of urban business, like the sight, sound and fury made by the living to distract themselves from the silence of death. Each scene seems to be a concordance of extroverted behavior and internal behavior, both with equal fervor, yet both on either side of some two-way mirror. Only those characters, namely Uxbal, whose conflicts and dilemmas are constantly internalized, can hear that silence. Eventually, his daughter does as well, and becomes the closest to him, in what one might go as far as to consider the film&apos;s climax, a bear-like hug they both know is as fleeting as every other action in this desperate commotion of a life they lead.\n\nIñárritu intends to drain us. Physically, internally, emotionally. And he cleans out his total cinematic armory to do so. And like death, that is both a blessing and a curse. For however harrowing it is, Biutiful exalts us with the chance to see soul bare, through Javier Bardem&apos;s performance as Uxbal. Watching Bardem absorb, involve and ultimately possess a many-sided role like Uxbal&apos;s is a singular delicacy, and a complete wonder. His eyes speak agonizing tomes. He hauls from an unfathomably mysterious spring of passion, grief, and who knows what else.\n\nOne might be able to delineate that Bardem renders a tragic individual as a fading Barcelona forager who deals in illegal immigrants and connects with the deceased. But every now and then, a story materializes, conveyed in a way that is so sprawling, so comprehensive, that no one premise or implication can classify it. Attempting to definitely describe it limits something that offers the utmost magnitude of whatever an actor&apos;s, a filmmaker&apos;s, and viewer&apos;s, understanding. That is what makes Biutiful so precious.",

      "reviewBody": "Chakra depicts a toxic life, representing hell on earth. It follows a vicious cycle of destruction of hope and faith in life. The movie shows how poverty extracts its toll in multiple ways, with very little scope for the silver lining. Life becomes tenuous, self-destruction being as a big a threat to continuation of life as other demons. The story weaves through the ups and downs, mostly downs, of life in the sub-altern. Naseer has a dialog in the movie that all torment comes from the need of stomach and the organ below it – from the need for survival and sex.It showcases the nakedness of how raw emotions are lived out in public. Privacy of grief and shame is not a privilege available to the poor. Everything plays out in the open, magnifying its bleakness. In some ways, similar rules apply to lives of the very rich also. The ending is seems squished, in its eagerness to dramatize the treachery of Chakra of life.",

Not sure if that really is the case, but it does reek heavily of inspiration from &quot;MIB&quot;. However, &quot;The Wesley&apos;s Mysterious File&quot; just didn&apos;t manage to pull it of in any particular way.\n\nA very weak and predictable storyline didn&apos;t really help the movie progress particularly, nor were the questionable CGI effects in the movie helping the movie in any way. In fact, my toes were curled up in disbelief several times because of the horrendous CGI effects.\n\nThe characters in the movie were one-dimensional and lacked any display of characteristics and qualities that would make you have an interest in them. And it was hard to grow fond of characters that the actors themselves didn&apos;t even seem to be putting their hearts and souls into.\n\nDespite Shu Qi&apos;s, Andy Lau&apos;s and Rosamund Kwan&apos;s attempts to lift up the movie, they failed, as they had very little to work with.\n\nFor a Sci-Fi movie, then &quot;The Wesley&apos;s Mysterious File&quot; was quite weak and anything but enjoyable. There are worse Sci-Fi movies out there on the market, but for a Hong Kong movie, then &quot;The Wesley&apos;s Mysterious File&quot; was a massive swing and a miss.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, yes, I agree with all of the wonderful comments below, but here are a few things nobody has mentioned:\n\n1.  The EDITING is superb. All too often we focus on the actors, music, or cinematography.  This is natural, and in this film all of these are superb. But keep a close watch of the editing - wow, it is perfect and ties the whole film together flawlessly. There are so many cuts that make the perspective magical.(And no, I am not a film editor.)\n\n2.  Look at WHO is dancing together as couples, right at the end.  This, like so many other fine details, carries lots of significance.\n\n3.  When Scott and Fran are practising on the deck at her house, under the instruction of her family, her Spanish father dances with her and says &quot;Muy bien, muy bien, Fran. Very good!&quot;  Notice that he uses her Anglo name &quot;Fran&quot; rather than her Spanish name, and converts over to English. The look he gives her tells us that he is probably seeing his (deceased) wife, via his daughter whom he loves, and that he finally ACCEPTS her and her Anglo boyfriend. This is but one of many small scenes that have more depth than may be first apparent.\n\nMy wife and I grabbed this video to &apos;fill in time&apos; during a quiet weekend. We were astounded at how it captivated us since we had already seen it when it first came out.  Like other comments below, we have watched the end repeatedly, and it always &apos;revs us up&apos; into the clouds. Bravo!",

      "reviewBody": "Kolberg isn&apos;t remotely a good movie, but at the same time it&apos;s no worse than 99.9 percent of the tripe that is and has always been made by Hollywood. It&apos;s hard to objectively discuss this film because of having to precede any actual comments with obligatory expressions of PC horror.  But even more so, the quality of the copy in general circulation is so terrible it is difficult to form a fair opinion of how the film does or does not work as a piece of entertainment and or art. The structure of what I saw is so far beyond episodic as to be virtually incomprehensible at times - and I doubt that a film this professional on other levels could ever originally have been so choppy and unclear.  It looks to be very heavily edited, with a meat cleaver, by a blind person. Perhaps it was cut to remove as much material as possible that would make the German cause sympathetic, or perhaps just for length (it is still quite a long movie). The color (in the copy I have) is close to indescribable.  In fact, when a friend asked me if I saw it in color, it took me a few minutes to think of a way to answer him.  It isn&apos;t color and it isn&apos;t black and white - but it is hideous and must be far, far removed from what Kolberg originally looked like. It&apos;s got a cast of thousands, impressive and beautiful (or so it seems through the dim veil of putrid picture quality that I experienced) locations and sets and some good acting, particularly by the patriarchal male lead. The person who plays the Queen of Prussia is outstandingly beautiful. As to &apos;horrible&apos; &apos;terrifying&apos; etc., propaganda, Kolberg is much subtler and less specific than the typical exercise for the moron millions churned out by Hollywood such as Casablanca, or any number of movies in which Errol Flynn or Harrison Ford single-handedly-defeats-the (fill in the blank), etc. I find it rather refreshing to get another perspective, as the old one is wearing quite thin these 60 years after &apos;freedom&apos; supposedly won, and all that. Kolberg&apos;s effectiveness as propaganda (the dark days descending over Germany) is interestingly substantiated in the history of genocidal mass rape and murder of Germany civilians in the wake of the Soviet conquest of just the provinces in which Kolberg is set.  That the leading actor - an actor, not a politician - was starved to death in a Soviet (you remember the Soviets - our allies in right vs. wrong, freedom vs. slavery World War II?) concentration camp in 1946 certainly gives a certain air of credence to the pronouncements of the film."

In the gifted hands of helmer Michael Cuesta (&quot;L.I.E.,&quot; &quot;Twelve and Holding,&quot; TV&apos;s &quot;Dexter&quot;) the so-so plot gets elevated to art-house standards with Lena Headley and Josh Lucas oozing believable chemistry, and the always exceptional Brian Cox making a lasting impression as a cop with an agenda of his own. Ends as abruptly as a punch in the guts, but it&apos;s definitely worth a glimpse",

      "reviewBody": "I saw a screening of this several months ago and have been patiently waiting for news about when it was going to be getting released because it was one of the most romantic films I&apos;ve seen in a long time. The movie tells the story of Sam (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a young American musician living in London with her British boyfriend Ian (Paul Nicholls). We learn a little bit about the couple in the first 1/3 of the film, and how Ian may be too involved in his work to really pay attention to what is going on in Sam&apos;s life, which leads to the two having an argument right before Sam is involved in an auto accident which leaves her boyfriend in pieces... until he is given a second chance to relive the day. Essentially the film is showing the importance of not taking for granted every second you have in a relationship because you never know when it could be taken away from you, and how all of your actions have tremendous meaning in yours and your loved ones lives. The story is very involving and it has a really emotional ending which makes the impact of the whole setup that much stronger. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the big name here, and she gives a good performance. She&apos;s much more subdued than I&apos;ve seen her in previous films and it helps bring her natural charm to the forefront. Paul Nicholls is an unknown to most Americans, but he is someone I do know from his &apos;Eastenders&apos; days, as my ex-girlfriend watched that British soap on PBS loyally, and I must say he was very impressive. Very charismatic and genuine leading man material. I&apos;m sure all the girls will go crazy over the accent. The two have very good on-screen chemistry, especially with all the highly emotional scenes in the latter half of the movie. Tom Wilkinson was great in a small role as the taxi driver lending his ear to Ian with his relationship troubles. The film is really touching and has some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see of the English countryside in the second half of the film, in which you follow the couple as they relive the day that changed their lives. A very romantic, beautifully shot film. Here&apos;s hoping it gets the exposure it deserves.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Iron Island (Jazireh ahani)&quot; vividly works on at least three levels. Opening with a prayer, the premise itself is visually arresting and the story is simple but imaginative. \n\nSettled on an abandoned oil freighter off the coast of an unnamed Middle East peninsula, a rag tag community of squatters is ruled by a wheeling-dealing landlord, a benevolent, Messianic dictator of a captain, like out of a Werner Herzog film, controlling a limited barter economy with the outside world. The huge hulking ship in the bright blue sea is eye-popping, but it even feels like writer/director Mohammad Rasoulof is just pointing his camera at at a documentary of how traditional families adapt to such a physical and economic environment while retaining their social structure with its rigid gender and age stratification. \n\nI equally believed, on the one hand, this could be a post-apocalyptic society as in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; movies or &quot;Waterworld&quot;, the new &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; or even &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; or, on the other, that it could even have been based on a true story, as much as &quot;Nobody Knows (Dare mo shiranai)&quot; was based on a real incident in Japan of abandoned children.\n\nBut it works equally well visually, emotionally and intellectually as a brilliant allegory, not necessarily of Iran but of any traditional, isolated society with a rotting infrastructure, selling off its resources and émigrés to global capitalism and living off the promises and lies of its paternalistic leaders.\n\nWorking under the captain&apos;s watchful eye, the frustrated school teacher, a Cassandra-like scientist, uses the Islamic madrassas style of repetitive memorization. But with only old newspapers about a mysterious war and enemy as texts, the students are required to repeat truisms about the glories of living on the sea. Unfortunately, the English subtitles do not translate what is on the black board so some subtleties are doubtless lost.\n\nJust as any society has channeled restless adolescent boys into armies, the &quot;Captain&quot; (a marvelously oily and charismatic Ali Nassirian) organizes the boys on board into teams of coordinated manual labor to salvage resources on the ship that have the breathtaking look of &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; teams ritualistically pulling together for a common goal and their choreography is a wonder. Even so, they still keep trying to get snatches of contact to the outside world with satellite TV and radio.\n\nBut we get caught up on in the story of one of these adolescents, his assistant, a lovelorn orphan (played by Hossein Farzi-Zadeh who also movingly played a similar young man in &quot;Beautiful City (Shah-re ziba)&quot;), who stands up to him, recalling &quot;Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, or a more cerebral &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with an even more dramatically wrenching rebellion. How young love finds an outlet even through elaborate burhkas is a touching tribute to the universality of the human spirit. The audience held their breaths as to who would win the battle of wits and endurance.\n\nWomen are especially ground under in this patriarchal society, with physical and labor restrictions and barely puberty arranged marriages around issues of honor. A lack of health care particularly affects the constantly pregnant, child-caring women.\n\nThe premise doesn&apos;t make 100% practical sense and the ending is so ambiguous that the guy next to me optimistically thought it was happy for all, while I was cynically dismayed. But the images are unforgettable.",

This is why I&apos;m glad to report that Make the Yuletide Gay is, well, not bad. It&apos;s not great, but when I was going in expecting another cringe-worthy gay romantic &quot;comedy&quot;, I got a pretty decent... gay romantic comedy. The writer needs a few lessons in subtlety, given the vast number of over-the-top stereotypes and often wince-inducing double entendre in the film, but the actors take the material and make it work pretty well. As a long-time fan of Degrassi: The Next Generation, I primarily was interested in Adamo Ruggiero&apos;s movie debut, and he acquits himself nicely. His character starts off as vain and somewhat obnoxious but becomes sympathetic as the film progresses, and when Ruggiero smiles that beautiful smile of his, I can&apos;t help but love him all the more. It&apos;s a fun little film, and if you can get past some of the writing, it&apos;s worth a watch.",

The story is breathtaking - Trausti, who has become a Christian, returns to Iceland from Europe, but then he is thought to be lost at sea and while he is still not found, his house is looted, his people are murdered and he is virtually alone. Then, his revenge starts. Trausti finds new people who will help him to avenge his family and friends. Finally, he uses a very sly method, with the help of nature - in fact, a geyser, that is used as a water heater there. Then, mostly all of his enemies are destroyed and although Trausti is revenged, the film leaves you with a heavy heart, as so many people are dead. What is great in this film is the brilliant, severe nature, with terrible rains all the time. It is not merely a background for the action, no, it acts and work out as a real hero there, too. Other big plus is the role of the fat, greedy Bishop, who is the actual master of the lands, and he is a vile, sinful, horrid creature, with no drop of Christian mercy inside. His power is enormous and his deeds are so gruesome that you feel a deep disgust to him. The very fact that even in a &quot;baptized&quot; land people still pray to hidden statues of Thor explains much in this film. The faith has not come, and the nominal religion is used for masking the bloody crimes. Watch this splendid and breathtaking film, you really must do it.",

I get the impression that the most interesting answers were lost to the audience through this process.\n\nAn interesting and meaty idea from a provocative and often great filmmaker, undercut by directorial inexperience and poor repackaging.",

The opening rescue scene is full of suspense and the protagonist&apos;s(Jonas) conflict is so quickly established that Paul Ziller and associates put you right into the story immediately.It&apos;s not surprising that Roger Corman, infamous for quick, low budget but high quality horror productions in the 1960s, is the executive producer. The setting and mood surrounding a fire crew camp is quite realistic. There are a lot of original features to this film that make it strongly recommended."

For me, this is part of the attraction as it jumps from one genre reference to another all while paying homage to some classic horror films. The story, although for some seeming to be all over the place, all makes more sense towards the end of the movie. I can&apos;t go in to the how or why because I will be giving away the plot, but it comes together and travels along quite quickly. It&apos;s no &apos;Shaun Of The Dead&apos; (that will hard to beat), but it is different and also takes the p!ss out of the teens of our generation, and who doesn&apos;t like that? So I give this film a 7 out of 10.",

There&apos;s also an effort by the husband (Roger Neil) to get rid of the planchette, which keeps returning, though usually after facilitating the gruesome death of whoever was unlucky enough to come into contact with it.\n\nThis is better than most of the dreck Findlay and her husband made back in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s, when they were two of the most successful sexploitation filmmakers on the NY scene. Michael Findlay was killed in a freak helicopter accident in 1977, and Roberta continued to make movies, mostly hardcore porn, before moving into more legitimate filmmaking like this movie. It&apos;s still not a good film at all, really, but it has enough goofy plot twists and chintzy special effects to make it worth seeing once for bad movie fans.

      "reviewBody": "Michael Winterbottom&apos;s movie is an Altmanesque production depicting an English crew shooting Laurence&apos;s Sterne&apos;s eccentric eighteenth-century literary classic. It begins wittily and appropriately with Steve Coogan exchanging mocking banter with costar Rob Bryden, and then Coogan, with cosmetically enlarged and crooked nose and proper costume, becomes Shandy introducing himself. The essentials of the book are sketched in -- first of all, Tristram&apos;s meandering account of his childhood and birth (not in any logical order -- nor should they be -- and intersperced with Coogan&apos;s caustic comments on the child actors playing him at earlier stages -- which perfectly fits in with Sterne&apos;s tendency to interrupt himself on the slightest pretext); then, Uncle Toby (Rob Briden) and his obsession with his exploits at the Battle of Naumur, which include an injury whose location he studiously avoids explicating. The mishaps surrounding Tristram&apos;s birth start with his name and move on to the forceps -- then a new device -- whose clumsy use by Dr. Slop cause the altered nose. A falling window caused even more crucial damage. \n\nThe moment of birth is dwelt upon -- then the camera cuts back to the crew and the focus shifts to the Coogan-Bryden rivalry again, Steve&apos;s girlfriend and their baby, his own problems in bed, his flirtation with a pale-coffee-colored lady crew member who&apos;s a great film buff. Coogan wants his shoes made with higher heels so he&apos;s taller than Bryden. The filmmakers hold endless confabs over how to do a battle scene and whether to bring in the romance with Widow Wadham (to be played by Gillian Anderson, who agrees from Los Angeles with comic alacrity). Anderson&apos;s presence brings in more money for the battle, and then both the battle and the romance are left out of the final cut. Much hilarity accompanies these details, though the main focus is on Coogan&apos;s stardom and inability to have a minute to himself. \n\nUnfortunately once Winterbottom pulls away from the birth scene, the Sterne novel, which pretty much ranks with Fielding&apos;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; for brilliance and humor, somewhat falls by the wayside never to be recovered till just before the end, when it seems tacked back in as a hasty afterthought. And hasty is one thing Sterne never is: impulsive and quirky, but never, never, never -- oh, my Heavens No! -- not rushed. At novel&apos;s end, his main character, after all, has still not been born. \n\nMaybe it means something that only one member of the cast is reported to have ever actually read &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; through to the end. Neither Coogan nor Bryden seems particularly eighteenth-century in their role, and Bryden&apos;s isn&apos;t a particularly inspired recreation of Uncle Toby. Nobody is amiably eccentric to the right degree. \n\nWinterbottom has made an intermittently quite funny movie that never loses its pace, but he has recreated Robert Altman rather than Laurence Sterne, and when you realize this, if you care at all about the novel, the whole enterprise, despite its frantic energy, becomes, for all its wit and good humor, a little bit of a drag. This is an enormously clever film, but what seems brilliant on paper doesn&apos;t always play for keeps.",

      "reviewBody": "With a sensational animation style and brilliant performances, The Road to El Dorado charms its way into glory by easily being one of the most fun movies i&apos;ve seen in quite awhile. First off, any company challenging Disney at their own game let alone their signature 2D animation style has usually had no luck at ever capturing that same Disney magic- but with El Dorado I say it succeeds tenfold. Not only is the animation breathtaking and colorful, but every single frame is just so well done. You can see the heart and soul put into creating this film, and not even just in the animated sense. The characters of Miguel and Tulio are about one of the most charismatic duos i&apos;ve seen in a film like this in a long time, and I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off the screen due to their incredible charm and fun personalities. Not only that, but they were also brilliantly voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh who just give so much spirit to the role it&apos;s hard not to admire it. Rosie Perez also does a fantastic job in her role voicing Chel, who is just about the most gorgeous female character i&apos;ve ever seen in an animated film. I&apos;m not simping, you are. The music is also quite good, with a soundtrack composed by the great Elton John. It may not have as many familiar songs as The Lion King, but it stands strong in its own right. The pacing is just so well done, you can admire how entertaining it is even if some flaws feel rather predictable and formulaic along the way. We have familiar tropes here and there, but in the end, The Road to El Dorado is as charming as a film can be- and easily deserves more praise than it received on release. Its colorful and imaginative and completely earns its spot among fellow 2D animated films.\n\nMy Rating: 8.6/10.",

While I gave it a 10, I fully expected at least a mid 7 from the IMDb audience. It is a wonderful film that I love to show to my children. What&apos;s not to like? It has a unique plot - that of an Indian coming to life in a young boy&apos;s cupboard, and wonderful acting and music. Through the boy&apos;s experiences with the Indian (wonderfully played by Litefoot) he comes to a new level of maturity. Hal Scardino&apos;s acting is natural and totally believable. If you are tired of the cut-out child actors that Hollywood gives us too often, then you&apos;ll love Hal. What a fabulously underplayed performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids (like &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; - a truly awful film) and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, it&apos;s pretty hard, isn&apos;t it, to write a spoiler for a film which is based on such a well-known, well-loved novel! I will show my hand here and say that I am a Janeite. However, I am not a purist and I like many Jane Austen adaptations that many Janeites don&apos;t (for example I like &apos;Mansfield Park&apos;). I enjoyed &apos;Bride and prejudice&apos; for its colour and fun. The attempt to update &apos;P&amp;P&apos; to a contemporary Indian setting worked well most of the time, with the translation to India being effective because it is a society where arranged marriages are still an accepted way to go. The script did a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the story whilst playing around with some of the details eg cutting out the fifth daughter whose role in the story is pretty minimal, and making the &apos;tyrant&apos; in Darcy&apos;s life his mother not his aunt (a more realistic situation in its modern setting). I loved the &apos;no life without a wife&apos; song and dance routine though it reminded me at times of the &apos;Matchmaker&apos; song in &apos;Fiddler on the roof&apos;. However, the film suffered a little, for a number of reasons, the main ones being that it left the Bollywood- style when it went to Hollywood (which changed the tone of the film), it didn&apos;t really find a good way to make Wickham as wicked as he is in the original, and there did not seem to be the same desperate need to be married as there was for the Bennet sisters in &apos;P&amp;P&apos;. These modern Indian women had jobs and could, it appeared, be independent without having husbands, removing the urgency that drives its &apos;P&amp;P&apos; original. Despite this, though, it does manage to incorporate some of the satire against pomposity and the arrogance of the moneyed class that makes &apos;P&amp;P&apos; more than a simple romance. Overall, then, I found it a fun film and an entertaining take on my favourite novel.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.",

      "reviewBody": "A revenge plot which was supposed to be a prank turns deadly in &apos;The Clown Murders&apos;, a film that saw the debut of legendary John Candy.\n\nA group of young professionals decide to play a practical joke on one of their ex-grilfriends named Alison who ended up marrying a rich man instead of him (Alex). The professionals learn that the rich guy is a about to close a major real estate deal. In order to mess up the deal, they come up with a plan to kidnap Alison. As the kidnapping prank turns unexpectedly violent, the men are forced to deal with the fallout of their actions ... and forced to deal with someone in a clown costume stalking them.\n\n&apos;The Clown Murders&apos; is a very silly film with very little direction. It doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense as to why three of the four men would want to kidnap Alison, and the movie never does it&apos;s job to explain why either. The dialogue is also very simple and generic, with tons of fat jokes being slung the way of John Candy&apos;s character for example. The only parts of the movie that were enjoyable were about 5-10 minutes when they first kidnapped Alison and the mysterious clown showed up. It looked like the movie was heading somewhere, and then bam - nothing. The ending made very little sense on top of all that as well.\n\nI would skip this one despite the cool VHS cover art and intriguing movie title. Those are the only redeeming things about the film.\n\n3/10.",

Castellari unique adaption of William Shakespheare&apos;s Hamlet. It has Johnny (Chip Corman) being taking care of by a traveling circus troupe while he is unconscious dreaming about his dad. We find out, Johnny after shooting two men that he has just returned from serving with the confederacy three years earlier, and learns that his dad has been murdered visiting his grave site inside of a cave. Only for him to be visited by two troublemakers, Ross (Enio Girolami) and his friend, Bill/ Guild (Pedro Sanchez) who often wears green clothing as if he is celebrating St Patrick&apos;s Day including the hat and jacket. They show up to cause trouble only for them to be stopped by one his dad&apos;s best friend&apos;s,Horace/ Harris/ Horus (Gilbert Roland). He then visit&apos;s his mother, Gertry/ Gretchen/ Arlene/ Lana Hamilton (Francoise Prevost) and notices she is now mingling with his uncle, Claude Hamilton (Horst Frank) or Johnny&apos;s dad&apos;s brother making them into an item. He suspects that Claude is up to no good, except that he does not have any proof that he is in fact murdered his dad. And it was soon revealed that Johnny&apos;s dad died as a result of a robbery regarding some missing bags of gold dust. And that according to Claude, he shot the guy or bandit that supposedly to have murdered his dad we find out his name is Santana (Manuel Serrano). Except that Harris also handed him a clue that happens to be a distinctive looking crest he also finds out that the guy who Claude claimed murdered his dad is still alive. One thing leads to another that may also include johnny&apos;s former flame, Ophelia (Gabriella Grimaldi) whose dad also happens to be the sheriff, (Giorgio Sanmartin). Down the line, we then find out that in order for Johnny to find his dad&apos;s killer, he first have to find out the whereabouts of the missing sacks of gold dust and who else was seen wearing the crest.\n\nAlthough I liked the idea of the grave sites inside of a cave, the rest of the movie was not that good as both johnny and his best friend or friend of his dad&apos;s Harris both had many opportunities to get rid of the two troublemakers or pests of Ross and Bill. The movie kind of drags as every revelation has become not so surprising and becomes kind of expected. A much better movie is not based on Shakespeare withe exact same principle is &quot;The Forgotten Pistero&quot;",

As much as Saving Private Ryan introduced a new generation to horrors and heroism of World War II, &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; introduces you to one of the men who lived through it.  It doesn&apos;t attempt to glorify the War, it simply relates what happened to America&apos;s most decorated soldier based on his own story and actually staring him.  While it&apos;s amazing that the baby faced Murphy still looks young enough in 1955 for the story to work 15 years after the fact, the truly amazing thing is that from most accounts, Murphy understates his own role in many of the events described in the movie. The final war scene for instance shows him holding off an entire German regiment using artilery and the machine gun of a burning tank.  The fact is that he held that ground alone for well over an hour before the germans finally gave up.  All the while the tank was burning and could have exploded at any time. Like many great soldiers, however, he had trouble adjusting to life after the war even with a semi-successful acting career aided by James Cagney after the war.  Still, it&apos;s men like this, who risked and often gave their lives on the fields of Europe and Africa and in the waters and islands of the pacific, that we have to thank for the Freedoms we enjoy in the United States today.  Too often we forget this.",

Kathleen and Stokely are two very well-spoken civil rights activists, or freedom fighters if you dare, and that is evident in this short documentary. At the time of this documentary Huey P.

There is a little commentary from the documentarian, Agnes Varda, but just about everything else comes from the mouths of the Panthers themselves.",

Fast paced and funny black comedy about a prostitution ring run from a NYC morgue and odd couple attendants Winkler and Keaton (in an amazing and hysterical film debut) as their pimps.  Great dialogue and sharp direction by Ron Howard in this, his first big-budgeted directorial debut*.  Look sharply for Kevin Costner as a frat boy in the morgue party scene.  Best line: Keaton&apos;s Billy Blazejowski: &quot;Is this a great country or what?!&quot;  Interesting note: closing song &quot;That&apos;s What Friends Are For&quot; sung by Rod Stewart is the same song later sung by Elton John &amp; co. for AIDS benefit proceeds. * I know... Howard directed previously &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; for Roger Corman, so lighten up , Francis!"

He contrives a way to meet her and they connect with a blinding love. However a love founded on a great lie and betrayal. Joan Chen is beautiful and pure, true to her culture and family. Her role here could not have been portrayed by an American-Chinese actress with such realism. \n\nThis film spoke to my heart and I would definitely rate that night in Japan watching this as an unforgettable experience. Watch it if you like films that speak true.",

      "reviewBody": "As a gay Catholic, who has embraced celibacy to conform to the teachings of the Church, I can wholeheartedly identify with the efforts of the Orthodox Jewish lesbians and gays in this film to reconcile their spirituality and sexuality, and to find acceptance in the eyes of God and their community. It is heartwrenching especially to see the havoc that this struggle has wreaked in the life of Israel Fishman. On the surface, he responds with bravado, rejecting the people and the faith that have rejected him. Yet, in one of the film&apos;s most powerful scenes, he vents his sorrow and bitterness, anger and rage, at what being gay has cost him, especially the love of his father.\n\nThe documentary is perhaps not slick and elegant in terms of production values. The constant subtitles, interpreting Hebrew and Yiddish terms for the Gentile viewer, are sometimes intrusive and annoying (especially if the viewer is at all conversant with the Jewish faith). It would have been useful, though, to explain that &quot;Ha-Shem&quot; means &quot;the Name&quot;, i.e., God&apos;s name which may never be pronounced.\n\nWhat it most interesting about this documentary, I think, is that it shows how the main problem may not so much be finding acceptance of onself as lesbian or gay, but rather finding acceptance of oneself as a spiritual person in a secular world.\n\nFinally, although the film clearly documents the trials and difficulties of being a lesbian or gay Orthodox Jew, the joy of loving and being loved by G-d comes shining through. The lesbians and gays in this film suffer much at the hands of their families and rabbis, their synagogues and yeshivas -- but never, it seems, do they question that they are loved and accepted by G-d."

On top of that, we&apos;re never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to &quot;tone it down&quot; or make it &quot;realistic,&quot; but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren&apos;t much to brag about, either. Also, there&apos;s no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. \n\nHowever, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). \n\nI&apos;m all for independent films, but it doesn&apos;t look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). \n\n&quot;worse than Scarecrow slayer.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t recall having seen any Polish films before, let alone any Polish werewolf films, so I unfortunately heaped expectation upon Wilczyca, especially since it is rather well reviewed here. In some ways it does well, but overall I felt a little let down by the experience. The story is a classic Gothic one, a lady, Maryna dies cursing her husband, and the curse is visited upon him and upon a younger lady. Emphasis on traditional elements brings a cosy, pleasing feel to the film, with its spooks delivered in measured fashion, while all round solid performances bring a welcome sincerity. The setting really helps things too, frozen paths, snow fleeced fields, and domiciles of rustic grandeur captured with chilly beauty in the cinematography of Janusz Pawlowski , the film clutches with a feel of Eastern European winter and this feel helps ease the film along even in its weaker moments. Of which there are regrettably too many, the film is overlong and there are several stretches that could have been cut down with little harm. These longeurs are all the more hurtful since the film lacks much in the way of twists or turns and the screenplay is fairly simplistic during the first hour or so I was led to glancing at my watch far more often than I like to. The film also largely eschews exploitative elements outside of a spot of effective violence in the close, more would have been nice, as would nudity, though the cold climate is probably a good reason for the lack in that department. There are some good acting turns to keep things moving though, Krysztof Jasinski makes for a cold gnarled and dignified protagonist, noting mounting strangeness and cowed by things not all as they should be, while Iwona Bielska is terrific as Maryna and her later counterpart, striking features and a performance of wolfish sensuality give the film its best moments, she captivates in the classic European tradition of sinister femininity. Things eventually pick up after a sluggish hour and the final block is fairly good sailing, but still by the end it had the feel of too little too late, the film needed fireworks but what it delivers isn&apos;t much more than a campfire. Altogether, this isn&apos;t one that I&apos;d especially recommend. Technically able and sporadically fun and intriguing, but generally not much more than a more or less skippable detour, one for European horror completists only I&apos;d say.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s one of the best films ever made and one of my favourite films, although the first time I attempted to see it at 14 years old in 1973 I didn&apos;t understand it at all. I tried again four years older and it won me over. Personal tastes vary not only between people but within people over time. Nowadays I can&apos;t understand why some people can&apos;t understand it and get nothing from this timeless world classic - at the very least they could look upon it as the closest the French cinema ever got to Dickens.\n\nMeandering tale set in 1840&apos;s France has whimsically smiling Garance played by Arletty in love with mime artist Baptiste played perfectly by Jean-Louis Barrault but with three other men in love with her too. These are the Dramatic Actor Lemaitre played by Pierre Brasseur (Lucien from Le Quai Des Brumes), the cynically corrupt Lacenaire by Marcel Herrond (Renaud from Les Visiteurs Du Soir) and stiffly possessive Montray by Louis Salou. With Maria Casares as the faithful Nathalie the trouper in love with Baptiste and you have the main cast for your delectation. Just as the characters in the plays at the Funambules depended upon the pleasure of the audience up in &quot;the Gods&quot; so do the actors on the screen – although now thanks to TV and DVD us people up in the Gods are a lot more distant! The main thread is how and why all the tangled love affairs unravel. The film is littered with eccentric characters and heavy poetic observations, backed up with a logical plot, incredible sets and unforgettable acting – all made under the Nazi occupation. Adversity often heightens the senses, but Carne and Prevert excelled themselves with this production. Favourite bits: Baptiste proving Garrance&apos;s innocence of stealing a watch in mime to the assembled crowd; the touchy scenes inside the aptly-named Robin Redbreast pub; Garance and Lemaitre in the deeply shaded box at the Funambules watching Baptiste perform; his calling her beautiful and her response of &quot;No, just alive, that&apos;s all&quot;; Lemaitre revising the play in which he was acting on the stage; his opinion of mulled wine – &quot;Like God slipping down your throat in red velvet breeches&quot;; Lacenaire&apos;s lacerated opinion of everything – especially of Montray; the bookend bustling street scenes at the start and finish; the astounding ending; and on and on – so much richness to see and hear in three hours!\n\nIt&apos;s a world portrayed in great detail and lovingly, done in the best French tradition: dreamy, full of poetry, a frisson of sex and a little violence. As with me, it may need a little patience to cultivate this particular flower, but if you allow it into your heart it will never leave you again. Definitely High Art!",

What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Rather than advancing an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective. \n\nA great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, big-name directors (this was far better than many of Hitchcock&apos;s films), special effects or &quot;clever&quot; plot twists.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, written by Thea von Harbou and Rolf Lauckner with a splendid score by Wolfgang Zeller was given its premiere in 1935 at the prestigious UFA Palast-am-Zoo. Subsequently banned by the allies it was eventually reinstated in 1958 as its propoganda element was not considered &apos;blatant enough&apos; to warrant keeping it on the list of forbidden films.\n\nI consider this not just one of Steinhoff&apos;s best films but also one of the finest historical biopics of all.\n\nThe film belongs to Emil Jannings who is simply magnificent as Frederick 1st. He succeeds in engaging our sympathy despite his tyrannical, authoritarian nature and his scenes with the excellent Werner Hinz as the future Frederick the Great are stunning.\n\nThere are no allusions to the Crown Prince&apos;s homosexuality, unsurprisingly, but the willingness of Lieutenant von Katte to sacrifice his life so readily would suggest a devotion beyond that of the platonic. We are left to draw our own conclusions.\n\nExcellent performance also from Georg Alexander as a foppish Prince of Bayreuth and from the always marvellous Friedrich Kayssler as von Katte&apos;s father who stoically accepts his son&apos;s execution as an expediency.\n\nOne would be excused for not connecting the actress playing Queen Sophie with she who played the imperious mother of Claude Rains in Hitchcock&apos;s &apos;Notorious&apos; but for the very singular name of Leopoldine Konstantin.\n\nThe final scene of the dying King uttering the words: &apos;I lay my country in your hands....make Prussia great&apos; and the lengthy close up on his son&apos;s face sends a shiver down the spine as we recall how he proceeded to do just that.\n\n.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is meditation, a state of concentration. I only wish I wasn&apos;t tired when I saw it last night because my concentration waned, I could feel the movie slipping between my fingers and trying to wilfully sustain the experience can&apos;t work. This is a Buddhist film, but it&apos;s Thai Buddhist (the form they practice in Thailand came from Sri Lanka and is from the earliest strata of Buddhism), it&apos;s spiritual but it&apos;s not esoteric in the manner of the Tibetans, ancient but not arcane. It&apos;s not Buddhist because Boonmee may or may not be recalling on his deathbed his past and future lives, or because there are ghosts and demons and a talking catfish, this is colorful lore, the illusory flowers of mind. It&apos;s Buddhist because it&apos;s aware of the moment. Not so strangely, it&apos;s the fantastical bits that seem to make the film watchable for most people, yet if we come to this film to satisfy our need for something to happen, we break the spell. The spell here for me is the awareness of life as is, the clear vision of a heaven in the present world.\n\nHere&apos;s a camera that doesn&apos;t describe a world, it allows it to emerge in its own time. Sometimes this tests my patience but I appreciate that it doesn&apos;t make amends and concessions. Cessation, stillness of mind, true perception, these are all vital and desirable here, and they can only happen in their own time, they can&apos;t be forced. I appreciate that and I appreciate the limitations of my own viewing. In those moments that my eyes and the movie adjust, I am blissful. Two moments exemplify this, the one is a table out in the verandah by night, insects buzzing around a light and everything is quiet, this is the summer night for me. The other is Uncle Boonmee lying down on a bed in his honeykeeping shed, it&apos;s noon and crickets are humming from the trees, this is the summer day. It reminds me of the remembrance of spring in Kiarostami&apos;s The Wind Will Carry Us.\n\nThe finale is rather interesting, despite the above. A lot of viewers seem to regard it as Weeresethakul&apos;s comment on the alienation fostered by the niceties of modern society. It is its own comment on the place of Buddhism in one such society, where the garments of the monk mean nothing, but instead of inferring that a day&apos;s hard work out in the open is preferable to watching TV Weeresethakul could have not made a movie to begin with (that calls for us to sit alone from one another in a dark room where flickering lights are projected). \n\nBut I don&apos;t think that such a simple conclusion was what was intended. I see vision that wants to encompass the world of ambiguities. The family may be sitting in the silent, staring at a box, but I got the sense of quiet warmth coming from the simple togetherness, a certain soothing affect that is possible only in people who can sit together without a need for words. Who can relax simply in the presence of each other.\n\nThis is valuable work, and I believe it will be cherished by viewers who feel the chakras of cinema should be purified and set ablaze now and then."

      "reviewBody": "In the 1970s much of traditional German cinema was dying due to the advent of colour television. Some of its genres would not be missed at all, in particular the &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; (nostalgic back-to-basics films, set in some rural part of German-speaking central Europe) and the &quot;Schlagerfilm&quot; (films featuring some pop-singers in leading roles, but with a much higher dosage of kitsch than the Anglosaxon variety) have few fans, at least few who would openly admit to that.\n\nThis film threatens a combination of both genres, with Roy Black holidaying in the Lüneburger Heide. We certainly get to see lots of heather (heather=Heide) and although the plot does not give Roy any occasions to subject us to his corny songs, he does it anyway, at random. As usual, Roy&apos;s acting ranges all the way from soft-spoken, slightly grinning charmer to slightly grinning, soft-spoken charmer.  Thankfully, the plot does not require much more than that, although a few moments of self-irony would have helped a lot.\n\nRoy certainly does not deliver on that front, but I have the sneaking suspicion that director Reinl was deliberately mocking the genre conventions of the Heimatfilm by including exceedingly long journeys through the heather-covered landscape.  This was too subtle to be picked up by the film&apos;s target audience (who aren&apos;t used to irony), but perhaps meant as a hint at the producers to spare him from projects of this kind in the future.\n\nThe mood of the film moves between comedy, romance, and a touch of melodrama. The melodrama appears half-hearted and phony, the romance fails to click due to a lack of chemistry (and lack of acting) between the leads, and thus only the comedy elements remain watchable. They benefit from being in the hands of the much more capable support cast, especially scene stealers Henry Vahl and Agnes Windeck.",

      "name": "The Artful Roger",
      "reviewBody": "Roger Swanson is a coldhearted, fast-talking yuppie businessman who has cynically reduced the man-woman equation to its Darwinian essentials.  To Roger, women are objects to be conquered not people to be respected, and he has learned to employ his good looks, charm and over-analytical mind in the service of getting laid.  When Nick, his naïve, inexperienced 16-year old nephew comes to town, Roger decides to train the boy in the fine art of manipulation and seduction, taking him out for a night on the town that the youngster will not soon forget.\n\nAs conceived by first time writer/director Dylan Kidd, `Roger Dodger&apos; is less a full-fledged narrative and more a series of extended conversations. And I, for one, couldn&apos;t be happier, for the dialogue Kidd has come up with is sharp, observant, insightful and witty, as Roger opens up and reveals his unique perspective on the dating scene.   He uses his mouth like a machine gun, shooting rounds of rapid-fire, staccato comments, indifferent to who&apos;s left standing when he&apos;s done.  He really has no qualms about `corrupting&apos; his underage nephew, never seeing or caring about the corrosive effect he may be having on him.  In the process, we learn quite a bit about Roger as a person, most especially the aloofness he feels from others and his inability to make any kind of emotional connection that really works.  Long estranged from his father and sister, Roger is also facing a breakup with the older woman he&apos;s recently come to fancy (his boss in fact).  Roger is a humorous figure but also an immensely sad one, for he really does seem - for all his bravado and bluster to the contrary - to be a lonely, unhappy guy.  We are simultaneously drawn to him by his confidence and charisma and repelled by his smarminess and coldness, just like the characters in the film.  As Roger, Campbell Scott does a superb job bringing out both of those seemingly contradictory qualities.  A non-stop talker, Roger knows how to draw all the attention in the room to himself; he is (at the risk of mixing my metaphors here) like a chattering vortex up there on the screen and we can&apos;t help but be sucked in by his personality and presence.  No wonder Scott won the 2002 award for Best Actor from the National Board of Review.  In fact, I haven&apos;t seen a performance this smooth, alive and energetic in a very long time. Equally impressive is young Jesse Eisenberg whose wide-eyed innocence and youthful decency provide an effective counterpoint to the brash but empty Roger.  Isabella Rossellini, Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals also turn in outstanding performances as the various ladies who play a part in the two men&apos;s adventure.\n\nIn his debut film, Kidd shows himself to be in full control of his medium. He employs a jittery, handheld camera in almost every scene, a technique that may bother some people but which heightens the sense of realism so essential to the nature of the story.  In this way, the audience is made to feel almost like an eavesdropper on the various conversations.  Kidd should also be commended - in this day of maximum special effects and minimal verbiage - for allowing his characters to speak at great length on any number of topics.  Many another filmmaker would have felt intimidated by such a heavy reliance on dialogue.  Kidd, obviously, feels intoxicated by the beauty of language and his intoxication becomes ours.\n\nRoger is a fascinating case study mainly because we feel so ambivalent in our attitude towards him.  Just as we are about to consign him to the category of heartless, cold-blooded b***ard, he wins us over by showing us that barest glimmer of humanity that peeks out every so often from beneath his well-oiled exterior.\n\n`Roger Dodger&apos; is not only an intriguing, amusing and poignant tale of realtionships and sex in the modern world, but a confident first film that augurs well for its gifted young maker."

I could understand any serious filmmaker wanting to take a stab at material that came out of one of the kings of independent American film. But with Gloria it&apos;s a story that could have been told by a lessor filmmaker, a story that might&apos;ve been told anyway had Cassavetes not jumped on it first. With Sidney Lumet&apos;s version, there&apos;s not too much of a difference except having in Sharon Stone in the Gena Rowlands part. That&apos;s not the main issue to have with the film though, as she is a fine actress. It&apos;s the fact that it&apos;s just not entertaining, that the connection between Stone and the little boy she saves is not strong or believable (&quot;smoke when you&apos;re 10&quot; is a line that stuck with me, sarcastic but not all that funny), and the whole gang story surrounding them also just sits like a lump. There&apos;s nothing that Lumet, with all of his skills in his own right, can do to uplift the material or present it in a manner that&apos;s fresh or absorbing. I&apos;d say if you had to pick one go for the original. Then check out the rest of the films by Cassavetes, and with Lumet as well. It&apos;s a New York story for the birds.",

As for Pickford, let&apos;s just say she, along with practically the rest of the film, is a hot mess. Everything about her performance, from the exaggerated gestures to the atrocious French accent, screams trainwreck. As the quote I chose headline with might indicate, the best parts of this, few as they are, happen when she isn&apos;t talking. Beyond that, the source quality on YouTube was barely watchable. I don&apos;t see myself sitting through this again, but it was fun enough this once.",

I mean, the structure of the plot and the themes appearing in this movie are heavily used in many Hollywood movies, including big summer blockbusters. \n\nThe difference, of course is the budget. Due to the lack of enormous amounts of money usually spent on such movie in Hollywood, the filmmakers were forced to work with what they could get. And they are doing the job very well, despite the obvious flaws - the decorations and production design are small and only fragmental, the amount of extras for the battle scenes is limited, the fight choreography of the mass on the background is not very good. \n\nBut these problems are more or less overcomed by good director, good camera work and good editing. The viewer just needs to help a little by being less critical on production values. We are all used to big Hollywood spectacles, and this movie would&apos;ve been glad to be one, but cannot from obvious reasons. It could be easily ridiculed because of it, but it will not be very justified.\n\nI was satisfied with the story, which is clear and straightforward. There are intense moments, the movie keeps the interest and the attention of the viewer by action, plot twists and relationships between the characters. \n\nThis is a bold attempt to make Hollywood like movie, and the result is quite entertaining and watchable.",

The story is predictable and the twists get funny at times. When I first saw the promos with Sallu carrying a lifeless and expressionless Sneha and the sub-title &quot;No time for love&quot;, I thought that that the movie is love story with a terminally ill girl. Thankfully, this is not the story anyways.\n\nSalman acts his age and looks decent. Newcomer and much publicized Ash-look-alike Sneha looks sweet but devoid of life. Hope Sneha&apos;s next movie will put some life in her. Mithun Chakraborthy is a sad bondage to the movie. Adnan Sami&apos;s music is fresh and &apos;Lucky Lips&apos; is a must for your mp3 player.\n\nRating: 2/5  Watch out for newcomer Sneha and Adnan&apos;s music.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: 20th Century Boys 2",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been a relatively long wait for the sequel to 20th Century Boys, and a word of warning to those who intend to catch The Last Hope. Either you have to be a thorough fan boy of the first film to have a photographic memory of what developed, or you&apos;d have just recently watched it on DVD, in order to be able to dive right into this film&apos;s proceedings. Being a fan of the manga series probably wouldn&apos;t help as much since the story would depart from the established mythos, and it&apos;s sad to say there isn&apos;t so much of a recap of key events and characters from the first film. You have been warned, and newbies better stay away.\n\nOtherwise, save for the film starting off with a flashback scene into the 70s, the film is set some 15 years after the climax of its predecessor, where the group of friends are now termed terrorists, and &quot;Friend&quot; is the recognized saviour of the world, having become leader of Japan, and well-respected leader to the world. After all, history is written by the victor, and &quot;Friend&quot; has ensured that the students in school are inculcated into his version of the truth.\n\nKanna Endo (Airi Taira), the niece of Kenji Endo (who doesn&apos;t feature in this installment), takes over the mantle as The Chosen One. Just what she&apos;s chosen for is quite vague, other than her lineage and what could be deemed as super-powers in her fighting ability, which doesn&apos;t get exploited much, leaving a lot of room for interpretation just what her value is to the plot. She suffers from weak characterization, and got bogged down with protecting two transsexuals, searching for her mom, infiltrating &quot;Friend&quot;&apos;s cult camp, and learning some back-story of her uncle and his friends.\n\nThe other characters of course were the older versions of some of Kenji&apos;s gang, from Occho (Etsushi Toyokawa) to Yukiji (Takako Tokiwa), lending again some bewildered moments as they get caught up trying to learn of &quot;Friend&quot;&apos;s identity, and his next scheme. Unfortunately, the narrative&apos;s played out in rather straightforward fashion, and before the mid-way mark is reached, you&apos;ll expect what that would just be, thanks to a careless slip where you see the initial seeds of the plan being worked on, since the childhood days. There&apos;s also a New Book of Prophecy, and rather than come up with some earth-shattering self-fulfilling prophecies like the first installment, it has, wait for it... one prophecy to develop in the whole 2.5 hours.\n\nNew characters were also introduced, and here&apos;s yet another negative point that the film chalked up effortlessly. Many of the new faces just turn up with little background, and you&apos;ve to swallow it as is. Some are added for (poor) comedic effect, like Kanna&apos;s klutzy schoolmate Kyoko Koizumi (Haruka Kinami) and honest, bullied cop Detective Chono (Naohito Fujiki), but a lot of characters were just there for the numbers, such as the Thai and Chinese Mafioso, and well-connected priest Father Nitani (Naomasa Rokudaira). I guess we would only know their extent of relevance come the third film, if they do get an opportunity to show something worth their salt.\n\nThe only plus point which does get tired after a while, is how fanatical any cult follower can be, in complete obedience to their appointed leader. In this film &quot;Friend&quot;&apos;s aims to cement his reputation, and has his own inner circle of members inducted through specially designed camps. One can just laugh at the proceedings, and especially at the camp leaders in their extremely artificial show of sincerity toward all new recruits whom they want to win over. It&apos;s quite scary how uniform they all behave, and their conformity to one another just seem all the more fake especially when someone breaks ranks, and doesn&apos;t exhibit approved behaviour.\n\n20th Century Boys 2 suffered from your classic middle-movie syndrome, being sandwiched as part of a planned trilogy. Not every middle film can stand alone and make sense without too much reference to its predecessor, and I guess the acid test is whether a new viewer would be able to watch this film as the starting point. The fact is it can&apos;t, and with the expectation that this film will definitely come without a real ending, it probably will just frustrate you until the third and final chapter come rolling along. So all you can do for this one, is to sit back after the end credits roll for the trailer of the final film, and trust me, that short clip is equally baffling as this film.\n\nI only hope that this series would be worthwhile investing time in when seen as a whole trilogy.",

There is limited edge. Alba doesn&apos;t have enough street in her. It&apos;s nothing new. The dancing from Alba is good but not acrobatic. Although complaining about this movie is like kicking a new born puppy. This movie doesn&apos;t have a mean bone in its body and it&apos;s perfectly watchable.",

There is so much to talk about, yet, so little that we know about the man, Tomaz de Figueiredo. If you want to be intrigued and fascinated at the same time, this is THE movie.",

Instead, the plan backfires when the computer system takes on a mind of its own, traps the group inside and starts killing them off by manipulating and controlling the electric wiring.\n\nChelse Swain (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) fails to convince us she can tie her own shoelaces, let alone is a genius, and the talented Henriksen is sorely wasted as the human heavy, who&apos;s eventually transformed into what looks like Plughead from the CIRCUITRY MAN films.\n\nHighly implausible plot, amateurish acting, insipid dialogue, painfully annoying characters and offscreen murders mean don&apos;t bother with this &quot;sequel,&quot; which is completely unrelated to the 1993 Tobe Hopper film.",

This film leaves nobody sitting comfortably whilst they watch it. \n\nThis is &apos;us&apos; when the thin veneer of being &apos;civilized&apos; is stripped away. When all that Life has left you is no future, a few rags and a brutalized nature then the consequences can reach unfathomable depths.\n\nI&apos;ve read some of the negative reviews for this film and can understand it when viewers who watch &apos;sanitized&apos; Technicolor visions of what are classed as the &apos;norm&apos;that is their benchmark and they don&apos;t like concepts that stray beyond that. But when one has watched unglamourous brutality and emotions in such good, raw films like Saving Private Ryan, Last of the Mohicans, Apocolypta, Fateless and the superb Kokoda, then one can appreciate what this true-life film was trying to achieve.\n\nThere are no heroes in this filmand no villains, just survivalists. From the uniformed officers and men posted to what seemed a god-forsaken land, to the convicts they had control of, they all had one thing in commonthe desire not to be there!\n\nI&apos;ll not watch this film again for a couple of months as I&apos;d like my senses to be on an even keel next time, but already I&apos;m looking forward to it.",

      "reviewBody": "They definitely could have made this much better. For a movie made in 2005, it felt like it was something out of 1985. The music, which was annoyingly and eerily played throughout the movie, sounded like it was out of the 80&apos;s. The graphics looked 80&apos;s-like. Production was very poor. I have seen some low-budget documentaries, and they were produced much better than Beyond Treason.\n\nThese things made watching this film very difficult.\n\nSicko, Michael Moore&apos;s documentary on the health care system, focusing a lot on the ailments sustained by 9/11 first response rescue workers, was a lot more...entertaining. Its hard to use that word as exposés like documentaries are not meant to be entertainment, but I use more in the sense that the film is made watchable from start to finish, which is not the case with Beyond Treason.\n\nI stopped the movie half way through as the material they were presenting just became very repetitive and not presented in any new interesting way.\n\nThis is not to take away from the information presented. The information is rather accurate and credible. The main focus is the Gulf War as that was a large scale representation of our Government involving our military in a war where we used arms hazardous to both our enemies and our own military. But it was not really presented in an interesting way. It was not aided by the fact that the central points are made by scientists who are rather boring and rather stoic.\n\nWhile the information was definitely credible, there didn&apos;t seem like much organization to it. It seemed like it was all over the place, rather feeling like a big mish mash of information thrown at you about how our government covered up the use of toxic substances on our military.\n\nOverall, it gets its point across, rather early in the film for that matter, but it was produced very poorly making it very difficult to watch from start to finish.",

      "reviewBody": "Lisbon is a city built over hills. You walk by the river, in front of the Pombal illumined downtown, built on the wreckage of 1755&apos;s earthquake and you can view down-up the whole historical centre, protected by the castle. Beautiful view. Go up, reach that castle, and look down, the opposite view, embraced by the river, also great, also gorgeous. The light is special, every cinema lover should know that, Wenders knows it (Lisbon Story). The colors are soft pale yellow, water pink, roofs argyle red. When you get to the castle, pick up a pair of field-glasses, overview the city, look to the other side of the river, and closely the old parts. yellow becomes, vivid blue, you&apos;ll get black and white, high contrasts, and a city that doesn&apos;t come in postcards. Through those field-glasses, you&apos;ll see this film.\n\nLisbon, multi-cultural, multi-layered city. Many languages, many cultures, many differences. I&apos;m glad i got to watch this one just a few days after Alice. The world depicted here is the world that makes Alice possible. This informs the world of Alice. The depiction of immigration as, at the same time, one of the most natural phenomena in our global times and one of the most system exploited ones is the theme that conducts us through the lives of various immigrants, giving us the full portrait, the unmasking of vanities, feelings of progress and happy futures. Of course this is uneven. It has beautiful art shots, in simple great combination of music, routine sounds, off voice narration and real life shots. But it also has highly zoomed no cinematic quality scenes, useful but artless, or scenes filmed in an almost amateur way. Of course... But it holds a special place for what it shows and for the problems it depicts.\n\nIt&apos;s built with boards, episodes, character discontinuity, racial discontinuity, language discontinuity, color discontinuity, mood discontinuity. Such as big cities are today.\n\nThis is not artless, and Tréfaut knows what he does. Watch it, and keep Alice on your side, for higher cinematic affairs.\n\nMy evaluation: 4/5 \n\nhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

It is something I can bring my kid brothers to and the best action I have seen in kids film since ninja turtles (the first one). \n\nGreat Cast- all of the actors really played their roll well. I would have liked to have seen more of bucky, because he was really funny but you will never miss it. Kelly Perine is great comic relief. He is just one funny dude.\n\nThe music is a great throw back to rockabilly era. Nice selecion very different. \n\nOver all great family action movie. Never a dip in the action or story, no one wanted to stop and get pop corn and there was even a few moments that made us all jump. This movie needs to blow up so more people can see it. It is a fun movie.",

It&apos;s all about some chica being cursed by her family because she doesn&apos;t want to marry the man she was offered. Running away to get help in Los Angeles they get aboard a train. From there on it&apos;s one way track to the cheesy end. Before that you will have some stupid conversations to fill the film. You have some green vomit (no not pea soup) coming out of mouths mixed with snakes. Those are real snakes so up to that part everything is still okay. The go into human flesh which looks nasty. Naturally there is some gratuitous nudity again just to keep you watching but it&apos;s the end that makes it look cheesy. The possessed girl somehow put the vomited snakes back in her mouth and becomes a snake. What we have then is so over the top that you must have seen it to believe it. Not for everybody and not for me but men, who invents those kind of stories, please come forward.",

Joan Sims is funny as Ethel and Georgina Cookson is gracious as Lady Mayley. Dennis Price seems an odd and bland choice for the blackmailer. Miles Malleson plays another vague vicar. Despite many disguises for Peter Sellers, Peggy Mount (in a role that seems to have be written for Margaret Rutherford), Terry-Thomas, and Joan Sims steal the show. And there is a surprise ending in a zeppelin! A must for fans of British Comedy and the great British eccentrics on 1950s films."

      "reviewBody": "This is a great film. If this is any indication, than Hong Sang-Soo really is &quot;Asian cinema&apos;s best kept secret&quot;. It&apos;s very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically, but I think I actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films. The overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work, although it still completely fits that style (the camera never moves even once), and somehow I found the film less self-consciously &quot;slow&quot; than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-hsien, which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus, it doesn&apos;t keep it&apos;s subjects quite as detached as Hou does. I felt like the film was also somehow more &quot;complete&quot; and less open-ended (just barely) than some of their work, although that&apos;s not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward-moving plot. I would have a hard time believing that Sophia Coppola wasn&apos;t directly influenced by this film for &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself, and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can&apos;t help but seem familiar).",

Despite some impressive battle sequences and stuntwork, this fiction-based-on-fact epic lacks dramatic force due to its contrived narrative and simplistic, poorly conceived dialogue for the native characters, which meant lines were often delivered in a stilted way. The casting is incongruous, with Susan Hayward&apos;s red-permed hair and milky Irish-Swedish complexion looking far from the archetypal Mongolian princess, and John Wayne, in simulated Asian make-up, was at best an elemental Mongolian would-be emperor, with lines often delivered like a Midwestern man on the range than a Mongol in the Gobi.

I mean, it&apos;s not extraordinary, but it&apos;s still worth watching.\n\nBut now on with the plot: long story short, Mothra&apos;s egg washes on the beach and some corporate businessman wants to buy the egg just so he can put it up as an attraction in his amusement park. Two twin faeries show up and warn him to have the egg returned, but he ignores them and even tries to capture them. In the meantime, a news reporter, news photographer, and professor also find out about it and are determined to help the faeries and Mothra before anything bad happens to the egg. Later, Godzilla naturally comes along and interferes, leading to a serious grudge war between the two title monsters.\n\nMy thoughts/defenses on this movie: okay, so the monster battles aren&apos;t great, but they&apos;re certainly not disappointing at all. In fact, the idea of Mothra against Godzilla apparently did sound like a step in the right direction for Toho, in my opinion. Yes, I know Godzilla is such a klutz in this movie, aside from the fact that his mouth is kinda wobbly in this one, but we certainly can&apos;t blame him &apos;cause the guy in the Godzilla costume can&apos;t see a thing. Okay, so the ending isn&apos;t very climactic, but it still leaves you with a good feeling.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one Godzilla movie that I think that all Godzilla fans should give a try/give a chance.\n\nP.S. To all those who think this movie is bad or overrated, I strongly disagree.",

In &apos;Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban&apos;, the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry&apos;s parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it&apos;s a sign of Grint&apos;s abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry&apos;s darker emotions in a manner that isn&apos;t wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn&apos;t imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black&apos;s determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts&apos; setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he&apos;s responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don&apos;t need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they&apos;d included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon&apos;s face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn&apos;t mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter&apos;s friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it&apos;s still great viewing. I&apos;d give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.",

Where the previous two Jack Ryan movies depended on stunts and quite unbelieveable plot twists this film concentrates on a grubby little military/political incident (more the domain of intelligence men) and the men of honour and integrity (Ford and an under used Dafoe) trapped in the middle of it.\n\nI also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding.\n\nThe Clark character in Clancy&apos;s fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this.",

      "reviewBody": "Gorgeous cinematography, attractive cast, fantastic music. Seriously, I wish I could find the soundtrack for this one. The voices are like musical instruments, full of feeling, and whether we see a performance as a break in the action or hear music and sound effects in the background, it always has an aching, haunting sense to it. Ranen Roychowdhury&apos;s eternal river song was a real highlight. All of it works perfectly for the story, which is about a daughter (Supriya Choudhury) who sacrifices her own aspirations in order to support her parents, two brothers, and sister. What held me back from truly loving the film, however, was in just how much suffering this woman endures. My goodness, talk about misery porn.\n\nThere are just too many times while in a conversation about her hardships, this young woman slowly turns to the camera with a dreamy look on her face and says something beatific. Meanwhile, her poetry-quoting father has his head in the clouds and is then bed-ridden with an injury, her mother harps on her mercilessly, her older brother shamelessly borrows money from her while devoting all his time to music, her sister has her eye on her boyfriend, and her young brother&apos;s focus is on soccer. They are all seriously annoying.\n\nAside from the qualities of the music that I mentioned, I liked how it helped me understand in a subtle way why this young woman would continue to support her brother (Anil Chatterjee) for the ideal of his art. It&apos;s beautiful, and we can perceive that. Unfortunately, much of her other motivation felt like too much for a person to take - even a gentle soul like this one.\n\nWhen her sister (Gita Ghatak) and her boyfriend (Niranjan Ray), who she&apos;s both supported, begin seeing one another without feeling conflicted at all, and then she reacts without saying a word - and even allows her sister to take her bangles - it was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back for me. And that, of course, was not nearly the end of the suffering she has to endure.\n\nThe problem with the story is that while there is plenty of escalation - her woes and martyrdom continue to mount throughout the film - there is just not enough transformation. Deep into the film she mentions &quot;I never protested the wrongs done to me. That&apos;s my sin,&quot; recognizing that she should have stood up for herself, but it&apos;s mild and in a victim blaming herself kind of way. There is never a true moment of realization that her own family is cruelly taking advantage of her, or a hint of bitterness. You could say that at the end, she&apos;s realized something while knowing that she is tragically too late, but by that point, over two hours in, it was too little, too late for this viewer.\n\nThe melodrama is moving and emotional, but I think would have been more powerful had the main character not been the &quot;idealized Bengali woman,&quot; dutiful to the point of annihilation. I also wish it had been a little more explicit in its commentary about the Partition of Bengal, which I understand was one of director Ritwik Ghatak&apos;s main concerns, though I confess that my own ignorance might have caused me to miss unspoken references and cues. Overall though, it&apos;s worth seeing for its visual and aural beauty.",

      "reviewBody": "I am honestly kind of surprised by the lack of reviews in the 4-6 out of 10 range. To me, that&apos;s exactly the range this movie belongs in.\n\nFirst of all, I&apos;d heard of how controversial this film was since I was in high school (around the year 2000) but never quite had the urge to seek it out considering it was commonly described as being mostly just rape, I suppose. Finally, in 2019, I felt it was the right time - and, it lived up to it&apos;s legend, in the sense that the majority of the movie really was just one long, extended rape scene. 2/3 of the film basically revolves around that, I&apos;d say. I definitely haven&apos;t seen that in any other movie, ever, which does give this film it&apos;s own identity. But, as one would assume, it&apos;s not pleasant. It&apos;s also not impressive in the sense of realism, or in any sort of artful manner. So, instead, you&apos;re just choosing to watch an hour of gritty, artless, trash film rape. Since this is the majority of the film, this is what loses it the most points. I seriously doubt I will ever watch it again.\n\nI think the movie is a bit long for what it is. If it were hyper-realistic, the grueling pace would make more sense, but since the acting is schlocky, it would have made more sense to move things along quickly. I really think this film would have served a lot better as a 80-85 minute feature rather than a 100+ minute one. Those 15 minutes of cuts could make a world of difference.\n\nThe complete lack of soundtrack also gives the film a lot of it&apos;s own unique character. While a haunting score is generally one of my favorite elements of vintage horror, I ended up admiring this movie&apos;s complete lack of one. The sound of the motorboat coming really does become I Spit On Your Grave&apos;s &quot;theme song&quot;, and it&apos;s pretty effective in that regard.\n\nOn the plus side, Camille Keaton really does bring a lot to the role. This was a very brave performance on her part and the shift from battered victim to sly vengeance seeker is actually believable and satisfying. Though the final act wasn&apos;t enough to redeem the movie much as a whole, I did find the acts of vengeance to be quite satisfying and memorable in comparison to a lot of forgettable horror deaths throughout history. I also enjoyed the cinematography for the most part - as often stated, it has a very real element of amateurism and also voyeurism to it, which adds a lot to the gritty surrealism of it. All the distant, out-on-the-water shots really did create quite a bit of an out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere ambiance.\n\nThis is a controversial cult classic for a reason. If you&apos;re a fan of gore, exploitation, or movies that push things as far as they can go, then yes you should absolutely see this. If not, don&apos;t even think about it!",

That is not to say that I don&apos;t think that the film should have ended the way that it did, it&apos;s just that I was so sure of what the final frames would consist of. I was absolutely spot on. &quot;Michael&quot; is a very well made film, for sure, but if you&apos;re expecting anything anywhere near as ambiguous or intelligent as even the weakest Haneke film, prepare for a disappointment. I do look forward to seeing what Markus Schleinzer does next as he clearly has a talent for directing films with a disturbing subject matter, but if he has a masterpiece within him, &quot;Michael&quot; certainly isn&apos;t it.\n\nDecent film, but must try harder to achieve greatness.",

The major players are back and attend a conference in Fort Lauderdale only to be bullied again by the dreaded Alpha Betas. Robert Carradine is back, but Anthony Edwards only makes a token appearance and is sorely missed here. The same is true with James Cromwell who has about the same length of screen-time as before, but does not make his presence known as well as before. In all the film is nearly a total waste. There are some good looking women in bit parts and that may be the greatest attraction. A young Courtney Thorne-Smith sizzles as Carradine&apos;s love interest. 2 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "The directorial debut of actor Eric Caravaca, Le Passager is a little known French film which has done some business on small festival circuits. The difficulty I had finding any information on it whilst researching for this review is a sure testament to its miniature status.\n\nThe film concerns Thomas, who has just returned from Paris to the town he grew up in in order to claim the body of his brother Richard. Remaining there to sell the house they mutually inherited from their parents, he checks into a motel run by a woman (Jeanne) once romantically engaged with Richard; his familial tie unknown to her. Getting to know her and her makeshift family, particularly her Godson who yearns for escape from this world of rurality, Thomas begins to see the life his alien brother may have lived.\n\nIn Le Passager, Caravaca is on top form as the unwilling sibling forced to hang around the town he bears almost no affection for anymore. It is clear from very early on that the relationship between his brother and him was one of strain and irregular interaction, his occasional considerations of Richard&apos;s death more curious than emotional. Caravaca manages this well, carrying the relationship solely with his facial expressions. The strangely tense relationship which we see developing between Thomas and Jeanne is compelling, though not nearly as much as the friendship which comes into play between him and the Godson. Theirs is an intriguing dynamic, and one of the film&apos;s best facets to offer; the boy&apos;s idolisation of this mysterious figure leading the film solidly. On the negative side, the film never reaches the emotional climax it should, its escalating elements failing to attain the cathartic denouement it promises. As a result, we leave with a feeling of dissatisfied disappointment, though its ending is satisfactory.\n\nLe Passager, by the time the credits roll, feels as though it has been unsuccessful in delivering what it could have. Though this is a real shame, the journey along the way is an entertaining one. Benefiting from a considerable realism, this is certainly not a bad film.",

      "reviewBody": "Red Line 7000, one of Howard Hawks&apos;s later films, is generally considered one of his worst, thanks to fake-looking racing scenes, hilariously inappropriate dialogue and musical sequences, and ghastly performances from never-weres such as James Ward, Laura Devon, Gail Hire and particularly John Robert Crawford.  But the film is redeemed by the dynamic chemistry between James Caan and the exciting Marianna Hill in their individual scenes together.  Caan shows in this film the intensity and talent that would make him one of the best actors of the early-1970s, and Hill&apos;s performance, on-par with other memorable Howard Hawks discoveries as Lauren Bacall and Angie Dickinson, makes you wonder why she didn&apos;t become a bigger star before fading into obscurity.  Particularly memorable are Hill&apos;s two lusty dancing sequences, at the nightclub and later in front of the Holiday Inn Pepsi machine, as James Caan observes her from afar.  Caan and Hill redeem Red Line 7000 from being a total disaster--the movie should have focused only on their characters and gotten rid of everybody else--but, even with its many weaknesses, the film is still more intriguing than the overrated Grand Prix (1966) anyday."

      "reviewBody": "I like the super-task of the &quot;Сinema man&quot; (The man from Cappuchino boulevard), but I never can understand what made them in 1987 (Chrushev is dead) want to clash the cinema and the Church. This seems to make the movie very very lame. Just answer me, when you hit a God-forsaken American town, how often do you meet an evil, carnal Pastor ? Everyone, absolutely everyone in this town, including the bar owner, the Indian Chief, and the local hit-man Black Joe are good people, at least they have good soul strings. Only Church Pastor stands out as pitch black, as absolute evil. You know, I don&apos;t like such plain con gaming. Even the world of cinema men has good and bad representatives like Mr.First who features good manners, good and high feelings, gentleness, kindness, and everything good you know about the cinema, and Mr.Second who disseminates violence, low style, fights, perhaps toilet humor, horrors, nudity and sex, and everything bad you know about the cinema. But when it comes to Church you have only one pitch black Jewish evil carnal Pastor who&apos;s dream is to rape a lady singing in the bar. Well, even if you tell me that evil, carnal, raping Pastors are as frequent in the USA as Coca-Cola dispensers, this still can not be a reason to bang a traveling cinema man against the Church. Even local hit-man Black Joe turns better than Pastor. What is this ? What thoughts shall this provoke ? The only clue thrown in is Mr. First&apos;s song &quot;without rage and mourning for the benefit of the planet Earth as we dreamed since long but still can not live up to our dream&quot;. Well, perhaps&apos;s that&apos;s it. A spoof of the American dream, a mock of the shining city on the hill ? And the evil lustful Pastor is an American Pastor namely and exclusively? Kh-m, you should have warned me, that this gonna be so, eh, particular. The movie was shot in 1987 when we in Russia were going full speed for universal human values, everything was going to be for us so universal, and an evil Pastor in the US could mean only an equally evil Priest on the other side of the pond. Well, were we really supposed to take seriously that cinema is going to save the world ? And all this garnished with carefully choreographed fist fights in the saloon, fighting Indians, and &quot;Lemonade Joe&quot; style story of how a rotten dangerous hole of American town turned into a descent place thanks to the traveling projector ? Strange movie though, with a message buried more deeper than the eventual plot, otherwise with no message at all. Well, as strange and mesmerizing as Irina Fateeva and Spartak Michulin as Indian Chief couple.",

The movie is based on the tyrannical behavior of village landlords over innocent village people. Mithun and Amrita Singh&apos;s performances are well-crafted. The film&apos;s direction is average, and the music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal is not particularly impressive. Although Kishore Kumar sang three songs in the film, they are not memorable. However, the sad version by Mohammad Aziz is worth listening to. If you&apos;re a Mithun fan and a retro movie enthusiast, you can watch this drama, which is approximately 165 minutes long.",

I failed miserably as a strong, supportive caretaker.\n\nMany of the things Rudi went through were similar to what I imagined my life would become if he didn&apos;t make it.

Story wise it does have a few flaws and acting/character wise you may feel a few bumps along the road too. Having said that, the movie does work more than nicely.\n\nYou get thrown in right from the start, not knowing what is happening, like the main character, but you get it fairly quickly. If you are into Science Fiction, you will be into this. The movie gets a bit cliche towards the end and maybe even a bit predictable for some. Still enough to wrap your mind around too and nice to see this coming from Russia",

Colin Firth, looking truly handsome, goes through a day of torment with remarkable civility. I felt involved and shaken and couldn&apos;t help but make mine his pain. The flashbacks with Matthew Goode are truly vivid and truthful. This is a step forward in explaining through images that love is love no matter who you are, where you come from or what your circumstances are. It could have been a man and a woman, the fact that it&apos;s a man and a man is almost irrelevant. We recognize the feel of it and Colin Firth&apos;s performance is the magic stroke that makes that not only possible but natural. It is a sensational debut for fashion star Tom Ford. True to himself an artist that promises great, wonderful things for the future. I can&apos;t wait.",

The Bonus Disc from the DVD release contains even more and sometime longer interviews which are absolutely ridiculous. Dennis Mascarenas asks and listen to the explanation from those guys very innocently and those people trust him. Please watch this movie ! A must for people who love documentarys, conspiracys, Germany ... Unfortunately the Director looked into the Future of Germany here ...

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fermat&apos;s room&quot; (&quot;La habitación de Fermat&quot;) is a Spanish thriller, in the spirit of some recent American blockbusters, where maths are supposed to play an important role. But do not expect anything close to &quot;Numbers&quot; in terms of scientific depth. Maths here are only an anecdote.\n\nIn fact, this movie is for everyone but mathematicians, who will probably find that the challenges the characters have to face are too trivial and the alleged screw turns of the plot are quite predictable.\n\nThe script and the direction are basically OK, but the acting is quite irregular. While Lluís Homar and Santi Millán (especially Santi Millán, who clearly steals the show) are rather convincing and solid, I do not buy Alejo Sauras and Elena Ballesteros as young math geniuses. Maybe it is not all their fault, as their characters are arguably more stereotypical than the other two.\n\nIn the end, an entertaining popcorn movie for a rainy fall evening... as long as you do not know enough maths.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Stingaree&quot; is a comedy romance with drama, mystery, crime and even music. Much of it takes place in the wilds of Australia, so one might consider it also a Western. Then there&apos;s a fairy tale aspect of the mean step mother and the oppressed girl. It struck me also as a sort of Robin Hood of the bush. One can see bits of all sorts of genres in this film. It&apos;s a sort of swashbuckler romance with an outlaw and a fair maiden with a beautiful singing voice.\n\nSo, what&apos;s not to like about a film that gives an early look at a very talented Irene Dunne with a talented leading male actor from the silent screen age, Richard Dix? The filming location in Sherwood Forest of California represents the pastoral setting of Australia. The scenes of Hilda Bouverie&apos;s (Dunne) theater performances were filmed at Universal studios.\n\nDix and Dunne give good performances, as do all of a fine supporting cast. They include a young Andy Devine, old hands Mary Boland and Henry Stephenson, and Conway Tearle, Una O&apos;Connor and Reginald Owen. As others note, this is one of several early films in which Dunne gets to use her beautiful voice for a number of songs.\n\nThis is an entertaining film that most movie buffs should enjoy - including the fairy tale ending. To some it may be preposterous, but to those of us who are still young of heart, it&apos;s a nice fairy tale for adults.",

      "reviewBody": "Not one of director Feist&apos;s best, but still decent. He seems to be most comfortable in a tight 60 to 70 minute format, but this one is considerably longer and tends to drag. He&apos;s never entirely in control of the mostly maudlin storyline, and never really clinches the romance between Joan Crawford&apos;s gangster moll and Dennis Morgan&apos;s benevolent eye surgeon. The movie has a hamstrung feeling, as if Feist wasn&apos;t allowed to turn loose and be as reckless as he&apos;d like. There are stretches where it&apos;s just too stiff and well behaved.\n\nThere are some things to like about it however. David Brian is another one of Feist&apos;s single-mindedly brutal thugs to rival Lawrence Tierney in the director&apos;s earlier &quot;The Devil Thumbs A Ride&quot; and Charles McGraw in &quot;The Threat&quot; for pure undiluted nastiness. His obsessive, murderous, almost infant-like attachment to Crawford is rather disturbing. Along with brother Philip Carey (a brooding, troubling presence throughout) the Jackson brothers certainly make for a memorable pair of crooks.\n\nAlso liked the moments just after Crawford undergoes the risky operation to save her eyesight. Feist creates a rather lush feeling of disorientation here and at one point Crawford, whose eyes have been bandaged for some time, makes a perceptive comment to the effect that drifting in the dark for so long has its advantages, that one feels completely cut off from reality and all its concerns.\n\nThere&apos;s a fresh, exciting scene involving a liquor bottle ill-advisedly thrown through a speeding camper&apos;s window and the highway patrol cop it almost strikes (Feist seems to like images of roads and highways just as much as David Lynch) and Brian&apos;s fanatic last stand, symbolically taking place in a hospital operating room where Morgan is presumably performing surgery on someone to help them ... see better.",

      "name": "Michael Mann does it again!",
      "reviewBody": "I have been a huge Michael Mann fan for years, but I do have to admit that I approached his latest film &quot;The Insider&quot; with just the teensiest bit of trepidation...after all, Mann is the godfather of the thinking man&apos;s action flick, and I&apos;ve even heard it said that his action sequences are so integral to his movie that they are practically another character in the film...with which I completely agree.  So I was wondering how a movie with no chase sequence, no gunfights, basically no action whatsoever--well, how could that possibly qualify as an authentic Michael Mann signature film?\n\nYes, the action, per se, is missing, but Mann still brings his signature directorial style to life with lots of wide shots, intense close ups, and indirect focus, all bathed in cool blue light and threaded together with an inventive soundtrack (including a reprise of a former track that was used so effectively in &quot;HEAT&quot;; sorry, I can&apos;t recall the title offhand).\n\nAnd what the movie lacks in &quot;action&quot;, Mann more than makes up for in high-wire tension.  He pulls us into the drama of an ordinary man&apos;s life by portraying the myriad humiliations, both large and small, that assault Wigand from the moment he is fired from his job as an R&amp;D VP for a major tobacco company.  The detoriation of his life, from his finances to his marriage to his belief in himself, is explored with the sort of atmospheric detail that is Mann&apos;s trademark:  the play of light or lack of it; the familiar sights and sounds of everyday life, from the patterns of rain on a windshield to the rush of wind through the trees; and camera work that ranges from tight, out-of-focus shots to sweeping panoramas of razor-sharp clarity...all of this creates an environment of realism that puts you into the film.  You can&apos;t just observe Wigand&apos;s struggle; you experience it with him.  My movie-watching partner observed as we left the theatre that he felt exhausted from the tension, as if he&apos;d just been through the corporate wringer himself.  I knew what he meant!\n\nBut atmosphere isn&apos;t all Mann delivers.  Once again, this genius director has placed an unexpected actor in the lead role of his film, with amazing results.  Before Daniel Day Lewis was &quot;Nathaniel Poe&quot; in &quot;The Last of The Mohicans&quot;, no one would have believed he could pull off a major hunk-o-rama role...well, guess what?  He ended up defining the hero of the adventure/romance genre!  In &quot;The Insider&quot;, Mann has opted for the opposite effect, casting  young, potential hunk material Russell Crowe as an older, slightly-pot-bellied father of two.  Wigand doesn&apos;t look like anyone&apos;s hero, and perhaps that&apos;s actually the message of the movie:  an ordinary man--a nobody, really--caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally, I can&apos;t remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe, in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;.  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks:  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver, receding hair and twenty extra pounds which, we are shown, is not the result of costume padding, but Crowe&apos;s own amplified flesh, he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.\n\nThere are, even as I post this, whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director, best actor, best supporting actor. Again, I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away, and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.\n\nThis film is quiet, intense, and ultimately, extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice, the way you do when you&apos;ve recieved bad news or seen something dreadful, so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger, helplessness, and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.\n\nIn summary, I was not at all disappointed in Mann&apos;s direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he&apos;s known for, this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, and HEAT.  I&apos;m a born-again fan!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sayonara&quot; is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a US Air Force major in Japan falling in love with a Japanese woman something that he would never expect since he was against to marriages between American men and Japanese women.\n\nI enjoyed this movie because it had an interesting plot with a beautiful meaning. It presented a very sensitive and important subject of that time, something that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Joshua Logan, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on it since he succeeded on presenting very well the main subject of the movie along with his main characters who did an equally good job under his guidance. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, both the interpretations of Marlon Brando who played as Major Lloyd Gruver and Miiko Taka who played as Hana-Ogi were very good but the best interpretations were made by Red Buttons who played as Joe Kelly and Miyoshi Umeki who played as Katsumi. In conclusion, I have to say that &quot;Sayonara&quot; is an emotional, beautiful love story that I strongly recommend everyone to watch because it will travel you back in time and you will follow this great story."

The two partner up with old pal Lloyd Nolan for some crooked schemes, but soon hear the call of duty, putting them at odds with their criminal lifestyle.\n\nLike his most famous film, The Champ, director King Vidor imbues this with depression-era sensibilities and sentimentality, having lovable bums MacMurray and Oakie find self-respect, romance, and a sense of selflessness, all with a young orphan in tow.\n\nPhotography, direction, and action sequences are all first rate. The performances were a little dated, but adequate. Unlike others, I didn&apos;t find Oakie&apos;s good-old-boy character annoying or unrealistic.\n\nCameo appearances by George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes and Charles Middleton (Ming the Merciless) were a lot of fun too.",

      "reviewBody": "The main reason I saw this film was not because I thought the plot sounded interesting, or even because of the fact that it stars the beautiful Madeleine Stowe; the reason I saw it is purely down to the fact that I remembered seeing posters for it in the video store when I was a kid. With such a nonchalant viewing reason behind me, it probably wont come as a surprise that I wasn&apos;t expecting a lot from this film; and it&apos;s a good job as Blink is a highly disappointing thriller with numerous problems and very little to recommend it for. The plot is not particularly original, and focuses on the idea of a blind woman in peril. There is a slight twist on this theme; as the woman in this film is not quite blind; in fact, she is the benefactor of a breakthrough &apos;eye transplant&apos;, which re-enables her sight after over twenty years of being blind. A side effect of this treatment is the fact that she sees some things &apos;by memory&apos;, and this is a problem when she apparently witnesses a murder as she&apos;s not sure if it&apos;s real or just flashback...\n\nThe film would be described a &apos;psychological thriller&apos;, and the reason why these films are often hit and miss is the main problem with this one. A film like this really needs a central character that is easy to get into; and while I believe that Madeleine Stowe is a great actress, she&apos;s not given the room to do much with this role. The plotting is not good at all, and is often all over the place; and too much of the film focuses on the tentative (and boring) relationship between the central character and a policeman on the case. This relationship feels extremely phoney, and since it makes up a large proportion of the running time of the film; it becomes a pretty big problem. There are a few decent scenes; Stowe is very good despite the poor material, though I would have preferred a lot more suspense, given that this is really supposed to be a thriller. The ending is pulled off fairly nicely, though its impact is lessened by the tepid film that preceded it. For a far better take on a similar theme, see the fantastic &apos;Wait Until Dark&apos;, and skip this.",

Barrymore is at her best here, Goldberg is outstanding, and Parker--while not a varied actress--does solid work. Nice direction by Herbert Ross, who hasn&apos;t been this focused in years. ***1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "Ota, Kobayashi and Nagai are three workers at an electrical company which normally makes vacuum cleaners and the like; their boss assigns them to make a robot to enter into a robotics show, more as an advertisement for his company than anything else. The hapless workers are able to come up with a robotic-looking suit, but can&apos;t make it do anything and with less than a week to go, they&apos;re in despair when after spilling a soft drink on the computer keyboard, the suit goes haywire and leaps out of a window, shattering into its component parts and nothing more. The three have no choice, really, but to advertise for an actor to wear the suit, the primary requirement being that the person have the proper measurements to fit the suit. Their first choice, unfortunately, turns out to be allergic to metal and so they turn to their second pick, the elderly Suzuki (Shinjiro Igarashi aka Mickey Curtis, a one-time real-life rock star), who has recently retired and has nothing to do. Suzuki&apos;s family tunes him out, the caregivers and other clients at a senior centre think he&apos;s getting senile, and this one-time-only gig will give him something to do. But while at the exhibition, he dazzles the crowd with his antics and when he saves a spectator from a falling pole, well, he&apos;s a hero and everybody wants him. But how long can our three researchers keep up the pretence, and how much can they control the increasingly undependable Suzuki, particularly since the young woman he saved has become increasingly enthusiastic about this &quot;new robot&quot;? This is a very funny film that manages to skewer geekdom while celebrating it. One of the best scenes has our trio giving a &quot;lecture&quot; to some college students in which various kids ask how they managed to get the robot to be able to do this and that; they cleverly turn the question around, asking what the students think they did, and busily take notes as the students proceed to explain how to build a robot - that scene alone is priceless! There are no real bad guys here, and nothing terrible happens to anybody, but the sheer premise of the film sets the audience to laughing from almost the first minute, and as for the ending, well, let&apos;s just say it was unexpected! Good fun, and worth looking for!",

To date my favorite performances and the ones I feel were the standard for playing a character who is in some form mentally handicapped were, Leonardo Di&apos;Caprio (the only movie he has actually done anything worth mentioning in to date) in &quot;Whats Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;, and Sean Penn in &quot;I AM Sam&quot;. Now there is a third to add to this list. John Leguizamo in this film. I almost am willing to say that this tops the other two performances, but it is a close call. Up until this role I had yet to see a decent job done in a movie by Leguizamo, feeling that he was a one trick pony, only knowing how to do comedy. After this film, I won&apos;t think that ever again. He puts in a brilliant performance, that stands head and shoulders above this good cast that played with him in this movie, and surpasses a lot of performances for the year. All I can say is he saved this movie from being a total bore, and he definitely did his research! Great performance, and this movie should be watched simply for his performance and how well he nails it!",

There is an eerie silence showing how most of humanity has been wiped out, right at the beginning. (It also helps that the movie was shot in black and white - I find apocalypse movies that have been shot in black and white more effective than those shot in color.) As the characters are introduced, they are promised to be a colorful bunch.\n\nBut after this promising beginning, the movie starts to fall apart. We never learn why the invaders attacked Earth, nor do we learn much about them. In fact, the robots are treated very casually at times by the characters! In fact, the movie feels too casual elsewhere; although this is a &apos;60s movie, it feels more like one of those innocent &apos;50s sci-fi movies; there is a dated feel to this movie. The ending feels unfinished; since the movie runs only about an hour, surely they could have come up with a more concrete ending had they extended things.\n\nIt&apos;s not a TERRIBLE movie, but it&apos;s disappointing - you&apos;ll see the wasted potential."

      "reviewBody": "Eric Von Stroheim (1885-1957) was among the silent era&apos;s most visionary, artistically ambitious directors; Gloria Swanson (1897-1983) was among the screen&apos;s first &quot;divas&quot; and one of the silent era&apos;s greatest stars. With Swanson&apos;s lover Joe Kennedy (father of John, Robert and Ted) acting as money man, Von Stroheim and Swanson teamed to create a film that both believed would be crowing achievement of their careers: QUEEN KELLY.\n\nLess than a third of the script was filmed when Swanson called Kennedy and demanded that Von Stroheim be fired. He was, and in his absence Swanson filmed several scenes intended to round out the story line and make the film fit for release. In doing so she reckoned with Von Stroheim, who had cannily held copyright and who flatly refused to permit distribution--and as the battle wore on sound began to roar, making the film less commercially viable with every passing day. Swanson was eventually able to release QUEEN KELLY in Europe, but it generated little interest and was soon withdrawn. It would not be seen in America until after Von Stroheim&apos;s death. It would be Von Stroheim&apos;s last major work as a director and it would effectively end Swanson&apos;s film career for a decade or more.\n\nIn the interval the reputation of QUEEN KELLY began to grow. It was, many declared, a lost masterpiece much like Von Stroheim&apos;s legendary GREED. And when it at last became widely available it leaped onto every critic and buff&apos;s short list of &quot;important&quot; silent movies. But time has a way of smoothing out peaks and valleys. Seen today, QUEEN KELLY is interesting--but only for what it might have been, not for what it actually is.\n\nThe story is distinctly odd. Prince Wolfram (Walter Byron) is betrothed to Queen Regina (Seena Owen), a vicious, half-mad, and intensely despot he despises. While riding in the country he comes upon a group of orphans that includes Kitty Kelly (Gloria Swanson), who makes an impression on him by loosing her bloomers and then angrily throwing them in his face when he laughs at her. Determined to see her again, the Prince stages a fire in the convent and under cover of smoke kidnaps Kitty and takes her to the palace, where she soon surrenders to his charms. But there is hell to pay when Queen Regina discovers the girl, and before you know it Prince Wolfram is in the dungeon and Kitty has, of all things, inherited a brothel in Africa. Will they find each other again? It is basically at this point that the film footage ends. The Kino release attempts to finish out the story with a handful of stills and title cards, and true enough we do learn the outcome of the story--but it is a very academic proposition, to say the very least, and although it seems to have a certain promise it is very hard to say what Stroheim might have done with the rest of the story. Hopefully more than he was able to do with the first third! For while the existing footage is not bad, it hardly compares with either Stroheim or Swanson at their finest.\n\nIndeed, Swanson seems extremely miscast in the title role. It is utterly impossible to accept her as an innocent orphan raised in a convent. Much more interesting is Seena Owen as the evil Queen Regina, who is sullen, dangerous, and utterly fascinating; in the film&apos;s most memorable scene, in which Kitty is chased through the palace by the whip-wielding Queen, it is Owen who dominates the scene, not Swanson. As for Von Stroheim, he is clearly building a series of visual motifs that reference sex, most notably in his use of candles, fires, and smoke--but with the film suddenly unfinished it is very difficult to know to what end he intended it.\n\nThis is really a film for silent film connoisseurs, and even they may find it frustrating to the point of annoyance. The Kino print is very good, but there is no getting around the fact that the film itself ends at the very point at which our interest in both plot and characters begins to build. Recommended, but as a curiosity only. Trivia: some twenty years later Swanson and Von Stroheim co-starred in the legendary SUNSET BLVD--and the film that silent star Norma Desmond watches is none other QUEEN KELLY.\n\nGary F.

Better than most Adam Sandler movies and minus all the language and sexual content that Sandler and others seem to sneak into movies they try and sell to &quot;kids&quot;.  This is a typical O&apos;Connell role and he plays it well. Estella Warren spices it up and keeps her integrity as an actress in check.  She looks good no matter what she does anyway but the movie does not lower her standards at all.  It is a great movie for the adults to laugh with and the kids in the theatre were having a blast.  Plus, anytime Movie Critics trash a film, the odds are it will be a weekend Number #1 movie and you will like it. It did $18 million on the open and will clear $40 mil easily. Not bad for the budget it was made with. Good Job Bruck... 6 stars out of 10....\n\nHave a great time and don&apos;t be to picky or critical. It is a movie about a Kangaroo after all!!",

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;Leprechaun&apos; films can be seen from either way. Some people will, and do, consider them guilty pleasures not to be taken seriously, most acknowledging that they are not necessarily great films. Others will, and do, dislike them for mostly being cheap, far from scary, too dumb to be entertaining and not very interesting.\n\nBeing on a horror franchise roll recently, after having more free time after such a lot going on professionally and personally, finally decided to see all the &apos;Leprechaun&apos; films to see which above extreme they would fall under. Even when genuinely trying to judge them for what they are and what they&apos;re trying to do, am going to agree with the latter. Disliked the first film as far as the previous three films go, and while the next two were marginal improvements they were not particularly good either.\n\n&apos;Leprechaun 4: In Space&apos; for me is one of the weakest of the franchise. There is far worse in the genre and overall, but apart from a few bright spots most of the film is poorly executed for reasons that are similar and even the same as the previous three films.\n\nOnce again, Warwick Davis is the best thing about &apos;Leprechaun 4: In Space&apos;. He really does throw himself into the role and has enough moments of amusement and grotesque creepiness. The material is beneath him but he gives it all a good bash.\n\nAside from Davis, there are a few mildly amusing moments and the idea was a weird but interesting one. The music is not exactly memorable but it didn&apos;t jar or sound cheap.\n\nHowever, that adjective is a good way to describe how the production values look, very sloppy and hasty looking and the special effects look as if they were made as a last minute afterthought with the small remainder of what was left of the budget. The direction has such an inexperienced or indifferent feel to it, and apart from Davis the acting is awful, struggling to do anything with lead characters that have no personality and irritating supporting ones behaving vaguely and idiotically.\n\nVery like as with before, &apos;Leprechaun 4: In Space&apos; is particularly undone by the script and story. The script is crude and childish in humour, nothing funny here, and everything sounded so awkward and contrived. On top of not making sense to the point of incoherence, the story overdoes the dumb factor, is often uneventful, with some dragging on forever stretches, and there is nothing scary or suspenseful due to the excessive predictability and no atmosphere. The kills completely lack creativity or anything unsettling and there is a good deal of randomness and things added for no reason so it feels gratuitous.\n\nSummarising, another weak instalment. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway was an epochal event. It ended the myth of Japan as a &apos;safe&apos; society, and as the catalogue of atrocities that had preceded the subway attack came to light, the Japanese were forced to face up to some home truths - namely that this particular cancer was home-grown and not a result of corrupt outside influences.\n\nAnyone coming to this documentary looking for insight into why the cult chose to indulge in indiscriminate slaughter will be disappointed. By the time this documentary begins, the perpetrators are incarcerated, on the run, or murdered. The main players here are the new generation of leaders who were apparently (perhaps willfully) unaware of their seniors&apos; machinations. Asked to explain such events, they are baffled and tongue-tied, torn between filial loyalty and overwhelming evidence of guilt. Ironically, they are just like many present-day citizens of Japan contemplating the war atrocities such as Nanjing and sex slaves carried out by previous generations.\n\nThere is, however, insight to be had from A. The camera stays with Araki, the new head of PR, as he navigates through a hostile terrain of police, public and press during the trials of senior Aum figures. An affable, articulate, self-effacing young man, he offers no explanation for why Aum attacked Japanese society. But through his eyes, it becomes abundantly clear why Araki chose to reject that society in favour of Aum. The press pack come across as morons, condescending and ingenuous in their approaches to Araki. The police are goons who simply take the law into their own hands, at one point carrying out an assault on camera with impunity. If the victims were anyone other than Aum members, this footage would be material akin to the Rodney King tape. The public, admirably restrained, nonetheless urge the cultists to find a job, get married, settle down - and are met with bemused stares, and the audience realises that brainwashing is not the exclusive reserve of the cult.\n\nMori paces this documentary expertly. He is compassionate towards the cultists without being in thrall to them. Just when we think they might be decent sorts after all, Mori tries to have them answer serious questions about guru Asahara, and they suddenly talk nonsense about levitation or how people don&apos;t need food, and they are revealed as zealots. These moments are judiciously spaced and remind us that the Aum members are at best lost, at worst seriously disturbed.\n\n&apos;A&apos; is uncomfortable viewing, especially for those of us who live in Japan. There are no good guys here, just a series of social archetypes, each tarnished to varying degrees. For an introduction to Aum that leads nicely into this documentary, read The Cult at the End of the World. Like the documentary, it makes clear that Aum is not the antithesis of Japanese society, but very much a child spawned by it.",

      "reviewBody": "Hollywood produced this one as the war in Europe had barely begun and the US was a couple of years away from Pearl Harbor. They had correctly identified the threat from Nazi Germany, though, and made a pretty accurate assessment of the consequences involved. &quot;Confessions Of A Nazi Spy&quot; is better than it sounds, and is not a story extracted from a cheap novel.\n\nNutshell; Some German-Americans felt an attachment to their Fatherland at the outbreak of the war, and some bought into the narrative and became Nazi sympathizers. Schneider (Francis Lederer) is one of those. He is inspired by the speeches of Dr. Kassell (Paul Lukas) and becomes a spy - more of a messenger - for a local subversive Nazi group. He is discovered by the FBI (Edw. G. Robinson), loses his nerve and informs on the group. Any more of the plot will spoil the story.\n\nThe picture is related in semi-documentary style which gives it a patina of authenticity and is directed by Hollywood veteran Anatole Litvak, who adds the required tension and who made several noteworthy noir and crime dramas in his career. Lederer and Lukas supply the villains and Robinson the hero in this surprisingly good rendition of a story of troublesome times to come for America."

      "reviewBody": "A young man (Christopher Matthews) running from the law ends up at an ominous castle and goes missing. Thus his brother and a friend (Dennis Waterman &amp; Jenny Hanley) travel to the dubious dwelling to find him, but come face-to-face with a formidable fiend (Christopher Lee).\n\n&quot;Scars of Dracula&quot; (1970) is a sort of reboot of the Hammer series in that it&apos;s basically a redo of Lee&apos;s first two stabs at the undead Count: &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; (1958) and &quot;Dracula, Prince of Darkness&quot; (1966), not to mention it mixes in aspects of &quot;Dracula Has Risen from the Grave&quot; (1968) and, most significantly, the plot of &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). For those who question the latter, just reread the plot description above.\n\nSome viewers gripe that this one doesn&apos;t fit the chronology of the series for a couple of reasons, yet these supposed conundrums are easily explained: Dracula was reduced to dust at the end of the prior film, &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1970), but Klove had instructions to seek out and acquire the Count&apos;s ashes if he was ever slain and bring them back to the castle in Transylvania where one of his creatures of the night would supply the blood necessary to resurrect the Prince of Darkness. As for the differences in the look of the castle, Hammer had moved to a different studio and so of course it looks different than it did when they made &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; thirteen years earlier.\n\nAlthough marred by the cheesy bat sequences, &quot;Scars of Dracula&quot; is one of the more entertaining installments due to the spirited Paul, a bit o&apos; genuine amusement in the first act and a generally compelling story (hey, it worked for &quot;Psycho,&quot; why wouldn&apos;t it work here?). The female cast doesn&apos;t hurt, particularly the lovely Hanley as Sarah, but also Anouska Hempel (Tania), Delia Lindsay (Alice) and Wendy Hamilton (Julie).\n\nFor those interested, Hammer did nine Dracula-themed films from 1958 to 1974 as follows:\n\nHorror of Dracula (1958); The Brides of Dracula (1960); Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966); Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970); Scars of Dracula (1970); Dracula AD 1972 (1972); The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974). Lee plays Dracula in all of them except &quot;Brides&quot; and &quot;7 Golden Vampires&quot; while Peter Cushing appears in five of them as a Van Helsing.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot at Elstree Studios &amp; nearby Scratchwood, just northwest of London.\n\nGRADE: B.",

      "name": "The Koreans saw &quot;Castaway&quot;, then proceeded to use the &quot;stranded island&quot; premise to make a surprisingly different film that&apos;s 10 times better.",
      "reviewBody": "Note: Check me out as the &quot;Asian Movie Enthusiast&quot; on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.\n\nI would assume that the director of this film saw that Tom Hanks flick and said to himself, &quot;Hmmm, this is a good idea. I think I&apos;ll take the same general premise and transform it into a unique romantic comedy that blows away genre conventions.&quot; He then proceeded to do exactly that.\n\nSome reviewers will claim that &quot;Castaway on the Moon&quot; (aka &quot;Moon&quot;) is a rip-off of the American flick &quot;Castaway&quot;, but what exactly are the similarities between these movies? Let me tell you. (1) There&apos;s a guy who gets stranded on an island, but that barely counts as a &quot;similarity&quot; because in &quot;Moon&quot; the island is positioned *within the city limits.* A man in massive debt attempts suicide by jumping off of a bridge, but he survives and is washed ashore an uninhabited, tiny island on the Han river. Even though he clearly sees the nearby metropolis, he can&apos;t swim across the river to civilization so he just stays on the island for a while. How is this in any way similar to Tom Hanks being stranded *in the middle of the ocean*? Answer: it isn&apos;t the least bit similar. (2) There are various day-to-day events that are similar (e.g., starting fires, growing a beard, entertaining oneself in simplistic ways, etc.), but anyone stranded on an island would do these things and people have been doing them for the better part of humanity&apos;s existence. These were not invented by a Tom Hanks movie. (3) There&apos;s an emotional bond with a few inanimate objects. Yes, this is one element of &quot;Moon&quot; that could be considered a rip-off of &quot;Castaway.&quot; But that&apos;s quite literally the *only* piece of evidence one could muster. Hardly a compelling case. Heck, it&apos;s so thin that it probably qualifies as more of a homage than anything else.\n\nSo what exactly makes &quot;Moon&quot; so *different* from &quot;Castaway?&quot; Well, for starters &quot;Moon&quot; is a friggin&apos; *romantic comedy!* This is evident at about the 30 minute mark when a hikikomori is introduced. For those who are unfamiliar with hikikomori, it&apos;s a severe psychological condition whereby introverts isolate themselves within a confined area and refuse to interact with other people. What the heck does this additional character have to do with some dude stranded on an island? My dear friends, that&apos;s the reason why this film is so fantastic, why it demolishes romantic comedy genre conventions, and why assertions of &quot;ripping off&quot; Tom Hanks movies are short-sighted and ridiculous.\n\nIf one really wants to milk the comparisons between these films, &quot;Moon&quot; exposes the romantic elements of &quot;Castaway&quot; as run-of-the-mill and dull. Just imagine a Joon-ho Bong film mixed with Chan-wook Park&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m A Cyborg, But That&apos;s Okay&quot; (2006) and you might get a feel for just how quirky and engaging &quot;Moon&quot; turned out to be. These characters are carefully crafted by first establishing a certain psychological flaw, then allowing the characters to slowly face those flaws through the introduction of the stranded island theme. But how do these characters bond if they&apos;re isolated from each other? Watch the movie and see.\n\nOh, and the previous reviewer might like to know that it was Hollywood who remade &quot;A Tale of Two Sisters &quot; (2003), &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; (2001), &quot;Il Mare&quot; (2000), &quot;Into the Mirror&quot; (2003), etc. – all Korean movies. And they&apos;re planning on remaking more because it&apos;s Hollywood that has run out of ideas. If you think Korean films have no originality, you might want to check out &quot;Welcome to Dongmakgol&quot; (2005), &quot;Save the Green Planet&quot; (2003), &quot;Crush and Blush&quot; (2008), &quot;Dasepo Naughty Girls&quot; (2006), &quot;Forbidden Quest&quot; (2006), &quot;Rules of Dating&quot; (2005), &quot;If You Were Me&quot; (2003), &quot;Iri&quot; (2008), &quot;Oasis&quot; (2002), a Chan-wook Park film, a Joon-ho Bong, a Kim Ki-duk film, or about 50 other films that I don&apos;t feel like listing out.\n\nYou know what, I&apos;ll suggest that everyone watch &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;Castaway&quot; in the same evening for proper comparison. It&apos;s obvious that the former has stronger, more interesting, more *creative* characters. A lot more time and effort was put into the script, and it shows.",

Most scenes are like in comics or cartoons, with gangsters, wild chases, explosions, breaking glasses etc. I give seven points.",

It portrays 1960&apos;s London as a poverty stricken bed of prostitution and crime. The main female protagonist seems to always seek male approval. She leaps from one bed to another, loving each of them in much the same way as Diana does in &quot;Darling&quot; 1965. It is hardly an example of feminism and the Radical changes in women&apos;s liberation within the 1960&apos;s. It does, however, possess a view of hope through all the grit. Dave shows how even a criminal can be loving, gentle and kind. The film offers the audience a 2 hour exploration into the lives of the criminals in London at the time. It challenges the classic Hollywood narrative of peace, disruption and resolution. The narrative structure seems to float along with very little climaxs. This gives the feeling of realism, which many people may find dull or boring. Don&apos;t expect your Hollywood Blockbuster. You will find a challenging Independant British film, documenting the feelings of the 1960s in an innovative and unconventional way."

      "name": "EAT THE DOCUMENT (Bob Dylan and, uncredited, Howard Alk, 1972) **",
      "reviewBody": "This was originally shot by celebrated cine-verite&apos; film-maker D.A. Pennebaker as a follow-up to his earlier classic Bob Dylan documentary about his UK tour of 1965, DON&apos;T LOOK BACK (1967); for the record, Pennebaker later also made other notable rockumentaries, namely the all-star MONTEREY POP (1968) and David Bowie&apos;s ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS (1973). This new film was meant to be a visual record of Dylan&apos;s European tour of 1966 where he was unveiling in public his highly controversial, rockier new image; during his live performances, he was being supported by The Hawks (the same musicians who later found fame as The Band). In the middle of shooting, Dylan suffered his notorious motorcycle accident and, once he recovered, decided to take over the footage and, with the help of an associate Howard Alk, re-edit it himself; the end result was summarily rejected as &quot;incomprehensible&quot; by the ABC TV channel, which had commissioned it as part of their &quot;Stage &apos;66&quot; show, and was never officially released.\n\nWhat should have been a precious document of an extraordinary time in musical history and in the evolution of one of the 20th century&apos;s most influential artists, became a uniquely intimate (and embarrassing) portrayal of the jazzed-up images going through a brilliant mind overtaken by substance abuse! Sure, Dylan does get to perform some of his best songs of the period (&quot;Ballad Of A Thin Man&quot;, &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb&apos;s Blues&quot;, &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, etc.) on camera but, as dictated by the wholly jumbled structure of the movie, no complete rendition is ever heard. Likewise, the supremely arrogant figure that Dylan cut during his press conferences comes through as well – as do the feelings of the disgruntled fans horrified by the new-fangled &quot;rubbish&quot; that their treacherous former idol has been heaping on them. Thankfully, there are also glimpses of Dylan in his quieter moments: reading on the tour bus or composing songs with Robbie Robertson in his hotel room.\n\nStill, at the end of the day, this is one big missed opportunity: although footage of the infamous Manchester Free Trade Hall concert (later issued in its entirety on CD) is shown – and was subsequently to reappear in Martin Scorsese&apos;s 2005 documentary, NO DIRECTION HOME – the tell-tale &quot;Judas!&quot; cry is not heard! Similarly, Dylan is shown separately rehearsing with Johnny Cash in the studio and &apos;partying&apos; in a taxi with John Lennon but, truly, asking for context here would have been, as The Beatles would say it, &quot;all too much&quot;. Actually, I later found some excruciating 20 minutes of footage of the latter ride on &quot;You Tube&quot; and, for all of Lennon&apos;s nervous clowning, the sight of a whacked-out-of-his-skull Dylan and his consequent ramblings were hard to take. I do not mind knowing that Dylan was aided by illicit substances in creating his first landmark rock albums (it goes with the territory, after all)but I do take exception at the fact that there exists this wretched-looking and worse-sounding artefact that quite literally (and from the very first shot!) rubs our noses in that fact!!\n\nP.S. Two fellow film-buff friends – Michael Elliott (a Dylanologist) and Joe Karlosi (a Beatlemaniac) – had totally opposite views on this one; my own rating lies somewhere in between but, knowing that even Elliott hated Dylan&apos;s 4-hour RENALDO AND CLARA (1978) has made me postpone that planned viewing of itat least until Dylan&apos;s 75th birthday! The lengthy Scorsese documentary also had to go due to time constrictions, as well as the latest cut of Sam Peckinpah&apos;s PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID (1973)but I still intend paying tribute to Dylan (who turns 70 on in two days&apos; time) with three more films before the month is out!",

With much of the violent mayhem set against a background of muddy rural yards and incessant driving rain, the resonant impression is of a battlefield in which most of the combatants will complete their private hell of isolation and desperation.\n\nA dark thriller which improves with a second viewing, it is compelling in no small part due to its star. Charlotte Rampling is so right as the enigmatic Claire trying to make sense of her own identity and it is difficult to think of any other actress who would be more perfect for this role; Bruno Cremer is quietly effective as her doomed lover.\n\nA subplot toward the end concerning the aunt, another grotesque, merely serves to dissipate the earlier tension.",

Funny how the movie actually was more enjoyable than I initially remembered it to be.\n\nThe movie is a wonderful mix of horror and dark comedy, and the movie never really takes itself too serious. Which is a good thing, because while there is an overlaying element of comedy to the movie, there is still something dark and definitely horror element to it.\n\nI couldn&apos;t remember that it was Katheryn Winnick whom was in this movie, maybe because this was from way before &quot;Vikings&quot; made her famous. It was actually fun to watch her in a movie such as this. And of course it was also nice to see Amanda Plummer in this movie.\n\nAs for the killer, well it wore a little bit thin throughout the course of the movie that he didn&apos;t talk or that you didn&apos;t get to see his face. It has been done in way too many horror movies already prior to &quot;Satan&apos;s Little Helper&quot;. The mask he wore, though, was cool.\n\nThe horror elements in the movie were not over the top, but had just the right of horror mixed with dark comedy to keep the movie interesting. While the movie does have elements of comedy to it, it is not the type of movie that will make you laugh.\n\n&quot;Satan&apos;s Little Helper&quot; is enjoyable to watch, but hardly makes for a horror classic.",

      "reviewBody": "In Australia, New Year finds two different groups of friends, 3 men and 3 women, begin their years in a variety of different ways, however each has ambitions and resolutions relating to their love lives.  However, during the course of the following year things don&apos;t go quite as they would have foreseen or hoped in most cases.\n\nThis film relates to the topic that is hardly new ground - that of love and relationships in our modern age.  In the same way, the manner in which the film tells it&apos;s story will also seem like it&apos;s not doing anything new in a new way, for it isn&apos;t.  The film homage&apos;s (or rips off) several recent (at the time) films such as Shallow Grave and Trainspotting for it&apos;s visual style as well as other `youf&apos; romantic comedies for it&apos;s content (as well as a seemingly pointless venture off into Taxi Driver territory that does nothing but prove the writers once watched Taxi Driver!).\n\nHowever, having said that, it still does manage to be quite entertaining and have it&apos;s own rough bit of charm to it.  It isn&apos;t really very funny at any point but it does manage to be quite realistically downbeat without being totally depressing.  If anything this rather bleak view of relationships is quite realistic and refreshingly honest - a shame then that it goes and plumps for a happy ending of sorts which relies on coincidence and the usual unlikely devices of romantic comedies.  The characters are not that well drawn but they have enough realism to them to make them recognisable and their problems and experiences also relatable.  Having 2 groups of 3 character does overstretch the film somewhat though, and some issues are not really dealt with in any meaningful way (an attempted rape just seems to happen without any follow up for instance), but on the whole it works reasonably well.\n\nI&apos;m not sure if the cast are well known in Australia, but I had never seen any of them before (with the exception of Watts and Weaving of course). This helped the characters a bit, as I only knew them as who they were playing.  Some of the male actors struggled a bit and it is the three female leads that have the best parts - Watts and Karvan having the meatier characters but Garner being cute, sexy and fun!\n\nOverall this film is not original or different from many other films you could see, but it&apos;s bleak view of modern relationships is interesting and involving (until it blows it) and the characters were recognisable enough to involve me in the film for the duration."

This Carlo Caparas opus tells the story of a blacksmith named Flavio (portrayed by Fernando Poe Jr.) who saw a meteor. When it fell to earth, he forged a sword out of the meteorite.\n\nThe meteor turned out to be a harbinger of the sinister events to come. The evil force is led by Lizardo (played by mainstay villain Max Alvarado). Flavio wields his sword against Lizardo&apos;s minions, and ultimately against Lizardo himself. \n\n&quot;Ang Panday&quot; is the first of a series of Flavio&apos;s exploits. The anthology won both critical and commercial acclaim especially during the yearly Metro Manila Film Festival. Offshoots, including an animated and live-action TV series, sprang as a result. During Fernando Poe Jr.&apos;s(FPJ) campaign for the presidency, he used the moniker &quot;Panday&quot;. No wonder, the movie reasserted FPJ&apos;s permanent mark on Filipino popular culture.",

The &quot;best&quot; of the puerile toilet gags that litter the film involve exploding sewage outlets (all over the bad guys, naturally); the eponymous pooch farting after an overdose of eggs; and the dog licking a gigantic ball of earwax. The plot is daft and the baddies so stupid you almost feel sorry for them. The only ray of light (for us girls, anyway) is a drop-dead gorgeous cop right near the end of the film, providing the excuse for the inevitable car chase. But even he doesn&apos;t make it worth wasting time or money on this one."

We spend the entire duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to shed her clothing (for Charlotte, this appears to take a remarkably long time!). Still, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling´s tits really can´t save this disastrous film. MacLean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit-pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books. Poor old Alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out. At least &quot;Bear Island&quot; - which also uses the Maclean name but apparently none of his novel - was a LITTLE exciting. The excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.",

Its good to see a comedian based actress playing parts both funny and serious. If you are a Whoopi Goldberg fan, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlongside Whoopi, Sam Elliott (Mask, Road House) plays a good guy on the wrong side and the chemistry between him and Whoopi shows very well. What makes a good film is when two different style actors/actresses bounce off each other in a positive way.\n\nAlso includes the brilliant actor Brad Dourif (Child&apos;s Play). Never fails to play an excellent bad guy. \n\nNot going to give much away in this review as you can tell, because the movie speaks for itself... However, if you enjoy a good action film with a side of humour, without all the &apos;star wars&apos; special effects... Fatal Beauty should be on your list!",

      "reviewBody": "If I could choose to send one movie into orbit in the hopes of introducing any alien species out there to our species, this movie would get my vote. This is similar in some ways to Ron Fricke&apos;s &quot;Baraka&quot; and Chris Marker&apos;s &quot;San Soleil&quot;, in that it is an omnibus of our spiritual life and its relation to things, people and ideas. That&apos;s a pretty big canvas and viewers might find the whole thing disjointed, but I love this movie for its audacity and for the very fact that it is fragmented. We are a fragmented species that in this modern age, often has to settle for a reflection of reality instead of the real thing (the Elvis impersonators and the Shroud of Turin being the most obvious examples). Why people will embrace fake Elvises while turning their back on fake Rembrants is beyond me, but such are the ways of human folly. Part of the film&apos;s audacity is that it often doesn&apos;t explain what we are looking at, and sometimes it seems almost confused about what it is looking at itself. A ceremony in Benin, complete with dancing spirits, whirling dervishes and a man with an enormous fake penis seems particularly chaotic, but I think that just helps the viewer feel as if they are really there. The film throws us off balance so we can almost feel like aliens from another world who have plunged to Earth and are trying to get our bearings amidst so much weirdness. The pacing of the film is slow but never dull, and unlike the &apos;mondo&apos; movies, there is thankfully no exploitation here. The cinematography in this documentary is stunning; every frame could be placed in an art book, in fact I&apos;ve heard that there is going to be a book of the film soon. If I had to complain about anything, it would be that I would have loved the film to be even longer and that the DVD has no extras, but the film as a whole is a terrific experience!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Nutcracker Fantasy&quot; is unlike any animated film I have ever seen. The puppet-animation, which looks remarkably similar to the later puppet-animation of Rankin/Bass, is exquisitely detailed and beautiful. The story is told in such a fantastic and mystical way that it leaves the viewer feeling a bit dreamy, confused and even disoriented. To tell you the truth, I have seen this film several times and still cannot describe it completely. But it&apos;s basically about a girl named Clara who receives a nutcracker doll from her Uncle Drosselmeyer and falls in and out of a fever-induced hallucinogenic state. Here she dreams of the nutcracker being attacked by an army of wild rats who are led by an evil 2-headed rat. The rest of the story goes beyond explanation but glimpses include the nutcracker doll coming to life and a kingdom where a princess, who exactly resembles Clara, has been kidnapped. It is a wonderful special that I enjoy watching every year on the week between Christmas and New Year&apos;s Day. &quot;The Nutcracker Fantasy&quot; features an all-star cast including Christopher Lee, Melissa Gilbert, Eva Gabor, Michele Lee, Roddy McDowall, Dick Van Patten and others providing voices for the puppets. If you can find a copy of this film, I highly recommend watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched Mario Bava&apos;s Italian giallo classic, A Bay of Blood (1971), on Tubi. The film revolves around a small town by a lake where the land is in dispute following the death of the countess who owned it. As individuals arrive at the countess&apos;s home, they are systematically murdered. The stakes rise as the quest for the house becomes deadlier.\n\nDirected by the iconic Mario Bava, known for Lisa and the Devil, and starring Claudine Auger (Thunderball), Luisi Pistilli (The Good, The Bad and the Ugly), Claudio Camaso (Vengeance) and Anna Maria Rosati.\n\nThis movie embodies the essence of a classic slasher, with an engaging plot, unique circumstances, clear motives, and a captivating &quot;whodunit&quot; element. The cast excels, and the female actors are stunning as always. The film features a classic soundtrack from its era, and the kills become increasingly gruesome as the story unfolds. There&apos;s ample gore, blood splatter, and an entertaining decapitation scene. It uses the iconic red paint for blood and incorporates amusing use of an octopus 🐙 . The final revelation is worthwhile, leading to a rewarding conclusion.\n\nIn summary, A Bay of Blood is an entertaining Italian giallo, not without its flaws, but certainly worth watching. I would rate this a 7/10 and highly recommend it.",

After one of his pupils commits suicide Brasch finds out that he used to work as an state security informant tasks with spying on his classmates. Soon his handler Körner (Martin Benrath) tries to recruit Brasch. Who not only refuses but also makes this connection public. This leads not only to Körner dismissal but also his own. When Körner meets with Brasch a last time, before vanishing to East Berlin, he gives Brash his state dossier and makes him, through this knowledge, an enemy of the state. Having his flat searched and losing custody of his daughter (Meret Becker in her first acting role) Brash tries to reconcile the situation with Berlin&apos;s minister of the interior.\n\nThis film perfectly captures the mood in West German in the last seventies, early eighties among the political left. After the police had been given more and more freedoms because of the Baader-Meinhof crimes, in 1972 the so called &quot;Radikalenerlass&quot; was passed. This was a decree prohibiting members of extremist organisations from becoming civil servants or teachers. It lead to the covert inspection of around 3,5 million people in Germany and the firing or non-employment of about 1500 people. The films plot is of course slightly (or not so slightly) exaggerated and dramatised.\n\nAlways in the background of this film what was back then considered the spy capital of the world, West-Berlin. Even in the scenes where Brasch is just going sledging with his girlfriend you see the American radar station (or weather station we had to called it back then) in the background.",

In mood and style, it&apos;s reminiscent of Godard&apos;s Alphaville, and my reactions to both films are similar: I am intrigued, but a bit bored. And I don&apos;t think either succeed in the end. The American Soldier concerns a haughty German-American soldier, fresh from Vietnam, who struts around killing people for reasons which are kept mostly obscure (he&apos;s some kind of gangster or hitman). The police are after him, though the police seem just as wicked. I didn&apos;t care much about what was going on  no compelling reason was ever given for me to care. However, many elements of the film impressed me. Fassbinder&apos;s idiosyncratic sense of pace and mood pervades. The performances are pretty good. Fassbinder himself appears in a small role and, as usual, he delivers a remarkable performance. He has to be the best actor/director of all time. Peer Raben never seems to write a lot of music for Fassbinder&apos;s films. Instead, he just writes one theme that is used several times throughout the given picture. They are always exceptional, and his theme (and also theme song, which is the same tune with lyrics added) is excellent here. And then there&apos;s this ending. Fassbinder has a talent for unique and notable endings, and the end of this film is one of the weirdest and most remarkable I&apos;ve ever seen. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "A sort of biography of Lucky Luciano the Italian mobster who was deported to Italy by USA&apos;s government after years in the jail, directed by the fine Francesco Rosi, the movie starts in this point when Lucky Luciano (Gian Maria Volonté) has been headed toward to Sicily at Italy by boat, mixed with few flashbacks concerning his violence background, he established at Sicily his homeland and Naples, where he manages all drug smuggling targeted to Europe and America, at its time post war the whole Italy was occupied by USA&apos;s Army and all major positions were chosen by American authorities, suggesting some agreement with local corrupts practices, upon this establishment the smooth Luciano feels free to work hidden over the shadows and becoming untouchable, however the unrelenting traffic ongoing peeves the American justice, sending to Italy an inspector to catch Lucky Luciano, the casting is the highlight of the slow paced picture, Gian Maria Volonté simply is great as Lucky, the almost unknowable Edmund O&apos;Brien as Commissioner Anslinger also Rod Steiger as akind cheap mobster and Vincent Gardenia as the corrupt Colonel Charles Poletti, but don&apos;t expect too much, has many striking flaws strangely allowed by Rosi as portraits a modern New York as if it was on 1946, I&apos;m trying wondering how it should happened over so magnificent director!!!\n\nResume:\n\nFirst watch: 2020 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 7",

      "reviewBody": "I picked up a copy of this movie as I love zombie movies and ninja movies. With a title like Zombie vs Ninja, naturally I expected to see combat between zombies and ninjas. I expected this even more so after reading the description on the box which made a statement about the doors of hell being open unleashing a &quot;zombie horde.&quot; Wow!\n\nImagine my horror to discover that this film is actually a composite of 1)a film about an undertaker, who happens to be able to teach his young apprentice kung fu skills, and 2)scenes that appear to have been shot for the only purpose of being inserted into this film to incorporate &quot;ninjas&quot; into the storyline.\n\nThe actors in the zombie story and the ninja story never appear on screen together. However, an attempt is made to make us believe they are in the same story as closeups of the actors are intercut to make it appear as if they are talking to each other.\n\nThe &quot;zombie horde&quot; is certainly an overstatement as we never see more than three or four zombies at once. The master keeps calling them up to train the young apprentice in kung fu skills, surely a questionable method of training at best.\n\nThe &quot;ninjas&quot; are probably the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. They are caucasians who wear shiny, brightly colored ninja outfits, and have names like Bert, Bob, and Ira. Uhhhh.... not exactly what you expect froma ninja movie. Their costumes appear to be made of plastic and are white, yellow, and blue, which really should make them quite visible in the forest.\n\n The funniest thing about the ninja characters is that they wear headbands that say &quot;ninja&quot; or &quot;nin ja&quot; with japanese writing in between the two syllables. What sort of ninja - arguably the most deadly invisible assassins - wear headbands that announce who they are?! I believe they were labeled as otherwise no one watching the film would ever know they were supposed to be ninjas as their outfits do not look anything like any other ninja costume I&apos;ve seen in any movie.\n\nAlso, there are two ninja forces in the film, but it is not readily apparent. I kept wondering why they were fighting and killing their own friends, until the two ninja leaders fought at which point I realized that up until then I had thought they were the same guy. I believe that the two styles of ninja headbands - &quot;ninja&quot; and &quot;nin ja&quot; were used to differentiate the two bands of ninjas.\n\nWhile this has to be seen to be appreciated, the movie is really bad, but not bad enough to be enjoyable. Watch at your own risk. If you are easily confused, I advise you to stay away."

      "reviewBody": "A young French model (Penny Irving), resident in London having just completed a controversial photo shoot for a men&apos;s magazine, is approached at a party by a charismatic oddball calling himself Mark E. Desade (geddit?) whose dating techniques are strange, to say the least. He invites her to meet his parents, and she foolishly agrees - turns out the old couple (he&apos;s blind and senile, she&apos;s a sadistic retired prison warder) are running their own private prison in the middle of nowhere with the aim of punishing &apos;immoral&apos; behaviour with beatings, solitary confinement, humiliations and compulsory Bible lessons. A couple of equally deranged guards are on hand to guide these wayward young things back onto the straight and narrow, along with several menacing rats. Don&apos;t ask. HOUSE OF WHIPCORD poured napalm on troubled waters with its original release in 1974, when the hang-&apos;em-and-flog-&apos;em brigade were at their most vocal and the likes of Mary Whitehouse and Lord Longford (&quot;Lord Porn&quot;, according to Private Eye magazine) were keeping a beady eye on the increasing amount of sex, violence and bad language on television and in the movies. Pete Walker&apos;s bleak and disturbing take on vigilante justice gets the flesh crawling and the nerves jangling like precious few British horror flicks before or since, offering little comfort to the viewer as a series of ghastly coincidences, shocking deaths and unexpected twists take us ever closer to the resolutely downbeat ending. Ironically (hopefully) dedicated to the vocal minority who find sentencing too soft and the law largely impotent, WHIPCORD isn&apos;t for everyone - the faint of heart should steer well clear - but offers an upsetting glimpse into the heart of darkness for the curious. Ann Michelle and Penny Irving are surprisingly good in their dramatic roles, but the film is stolen by Barbara Markham, Patrick Barr and Sheila Keith, chewing the scenery as the governess, the helpless judge and the most zealous warden respectively. Ray Brooks (the voice of MR BENN) has a few good scenes as Michelle&apos;s sex-mad boyfriend.",

The drama in company is very gritty. Every sequence leads upto a greater motive. The tension in the film feels real and those things make Company a true classic.

It&apos;s a coming-off-age film set in Tel Aviv during the fifties, involving three teenagers (only it turns out they&apos;re in their early twenties – how long do people go to school in Isreal?) trying to get a bit while partying and etc.\n\nIt&apos;s been a few days since I watched this one so naturally I&apos;ve forgotten all their names, but you&apos;ve got your main character, Bon Jovi I think his name was, his fat sidekick Van Halen, and fanny rat Dave Lee Roth. After having all their clothes nicked by some Fonz types, Bon Jovi turns up at his home in the buff in front of all his conservative parent&apos;s friends, paving the way for a lot of male nakedness in the film.\n\nYou see, Bon Jovi is the lovable (you&apos;ll hate him) cute one of the trio, and he&apos;s trying to get into the pants of a certain lady who looks like Anne Hathaway, only attractive. He does this by stalking her until she gives in, much to the chagrin of Van Halen&apos;s girlfriend. Dave Lee Roth on the other hand is just trying to get into the pants of everybody, which leads to much interpersonal drama I&apos;m guessing as I can&apos;t feel anything since I did three tours in &apos;Nam.\n\nSo if you want to reminisce about growing up in fifties Tel Aviv like a Glaswegian who grew up in the eighties in Scotland, you can&apos;t go wrong by this film. It&apos;s got big fat hairy man arses, a scattering of female nudity, a wee bit of how&apos;s your father, and much by way of drama and crappy comedy. Who am I talking to? No one&apos;s gonna watch this one!",

After all, they went to the hellishly hot and rather primitive country of French Equatorial Africa and filmed it on location- -and because of this the film looks great. Yet, inexplicably, at the same time the movie looks so incomplete and sloppy at times-- particularly when it came to many of the characters. As a result, the film&apos;s great message is muted and far less effective.\n\nWhen the film begins, a hunter has already killed four elephants and is about to kill more when he is attacked and beaten up by Morel (Trevor Howard). It seems that Morel is outraged by the wholesale slaughter of African animals (in particular, the elephants) and he&apos;s sick of sitting back and doing nothing. Soon, he goes to see the governor and begins circulating a petition to stop the slaughter--mostly to no effect. So, he and a few followers decide to take the law into their own hands. They burn ivory warehouses and attack hunters--shooting them in the butt! And, in one of the few funny scenes in the movie, they storm a ritzy party and deliver a well-deserved spanking to a society dame who delights in talking about all the elephants she&apos;s slaughtered.\n\nAll this sounds very timely and important, right? Well, yes...but the film manages to take a great idea and make the least of it. While Trevor Howard is fine in the lead (though he&apos;s billed third!), many of the other characters are underdeveloped and wasted. Instead of seeming like real folks, they seem like they are doing a walk-on--like many celebrities that appear and disappear in a Muppet film! Flynn got top billing though he was barely in the film at all. And, when he was on camera, he pretty much played himself--a dying alcoholic (he died a year after this film was made). Orson Welles is an interesting character-- yet his change of heart from hunter to conservationist seemed bizarre and confusing--again because his part was severely under-written. Eddie Albert appears out of no where late in the film--and has a few good moments but is otherwise quite out of place. And, the same can be said about MOST of the rest of the cast! You would have thought that the writer, director and producer would have noticed this big problem. With better writing and directing, the film SHOULD have earned an 8 or 9. Instead, it&apos;s just an overly long and forgettable film.\n\nBy the way, I found this film of particular interest because I just got back from a photo safari in South Africa. In my trips to this country, I was surprised how few animals remain and how those that do are confined mostly to game reserves. Also, while the elephants are the subject of &quot;The Roots of Heaven&quot;, the biggest problems today are the poaching of the rhinos and the near-extinction of species such as the African Wild Dog. My advice is go soon to visit Africa soon as some of these animals simply might not be there in the near future.",

People complained that the puns were stupid and that the humor was aimed at adults. Hello? That&apos;s exactly what made the original cartoon so great.\n\nR&amp;B&apos;s observations on contemporary society are hilarious. The film also pokes fun at politicians, the legal system, and our addiction to TV, with a riotous sendup of &quot;Cops&quot;.\n\nThe film is quite satisfying whenever R&amp;B are onscreen. When it&apos;s just the human actors, things get a little dull. DeNiro, Alexander and Russo all are decent, but these performances would be criticized no matter who was playing them, with the possible exception of Jim Carrey. The best human performer is Piper Pirabo, a total hottie. She has been criticized for a bad performance, but I thought she did a great job.\n\nIt&apos;s not Oscar material, it won&apos;t gross $100 million, and it&apos;s not deep social commentary, but it sure is fun. Anybody with a sense of humor would be hard-pressed not to smile and feel good on the inside after seeing this. I just hope they make a sequel. Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle forever!!!!"

      "reviewBody": "Death Wish 2 is a nasty piece of work, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. There is no pretence about this film, whereas the original Death Wish painstakingly presented Paul Kersey as a victim of violence who had been pushed to breaking point, Death Wish 2 finds him in John Rambo territory, as a borderline crazy person bent on revenge. Unlike the original, Death Wish 2 has no political message and never waivers in its approval of Paul&apos;s vigilantism. While this is by no means as good as the original, which I consider to be a minor classic, Death Wish 2 is a great example of the short lived early 80s embrace of ultra violent entertainment before these kind of movies were labelled &quot;video nasties&quot; and expelled from the mainstream.\n\nThe main reason why the Death Wish series became increasingly ridiculous is the improbability of one man suffering so much bad luck. This time around a group of thugs break into Paul&apos;s home and gang rape his Latina maid. This scene is truly grim and more detailed than most of the more infamous &quot;rape &amp; revenge&quot; movies of the 80s. The scene is particularly distasteful as poor Rosario gets roughed up so much worse than any other female victim in the series - all of whom happen to be white. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think that it is a coincidence, as the entire Death Wish series had dubious racial undertones.\n\nThe action becomes increasing twisted when Paul&apos;s daughter, Carol, still traumatised from the attack in the original film, is kidnapped and raped. The nastiness of this act stems mostly from the creepy smile on Carol&apos;s face. When Carol is subsequently impaled on an iron gate, the transformation from the socially aware film of the 1970s to the sleazy, pure action of the 80s sequel is complete. This time around Paul doesn&apos;t even bother with the police, choosing instead to take all of the thugs out himself.\n\nThe second half of the film is fairly predictable and a bit slow in comparison with the downright nastiness of the opening half an hour. Paul walks around the streets of LA (he definitely gets around), shooting muggers, rapists and his daughter&apos;s attackers. This time around Paul doesn&apos;t hesitate shooting anyone and the conflict he demonstrated in the first film is nowhere to be seen. Instead, everyone from civilians to the police comment approvingly on his particular approach to crime control. Needless to say, Death Wish 2 is about as politically incorrect as they come and yet, endearingly of its time.\n\nMichael Winner does a good job of capturing the atmosphere of early 80s LA, with amusing glimpses of religious fanatics, coke dealers and general crazies. The 80s fashion on display is pretty funny and the scene where the thugs dance to their &quot;ghettoblaster&quot; makes me laugh every time. The acting is highlighted by Jill Ireland&apos;s extraordinarily wooden turn as Paul&apos;s new girlfriend. Her ability to lower the tone of any Charles Bronson movie borders on the supernatural. Lastly, Jimmy Page&apos;s soundtrack deserves a mention, it is different to say the least.\n\nIf you are looking for cheap, nasty, morally corrupt entertainment, then you should enjoy Death Wish 2. I certainly did."

      "reviewBody": "MGM pulled out all the stops for this 1948 version of &quot;The Three Musketeers.&quot; Filmed in color and directed by George Sidney, it has a large, all-star cast consisting of Gene Kelly, Lana Turner, June Allyson, Van Heflin, Cornell Wilde, Vincent Price, Angela Lansbury, Robert Coote, Frank Morgan, Keenan Wynn and John Sutton. Gene Kelly is D&apos;Artagnan, who arrives to join the Musketeers and ends up having to fight three duels in a day with Athos (Heflin), Porthos (Young) and Aramis (Coote). They all wind up friends.\n\nThe Musketeers&apos; first assignment is to steal the Queen&apos;s jewels back for her - a gift of twelve diamond studs from her husband (Morgan). She has given them to her lover, the Duke of Buckingham, but now needs them back to wear in nine days&apos; time. Cardinal Richlieu (Price), anxious to reveal the secret relationship between the two, dispatches his evil mistress, Lady De Winter (Turner) to steal two of the studs. Richlieu wants France to declare war against England and completely destroy the King&apos;s powers.\n\nThe Musketeers have to get the jewels from the Duke and return with them to Paris. With two diamond studs missing, they have an added task of picking up two replacements from a jeweler and getting them to the Queen in time to wear them at a banquet. In the process of all of this, D&apos;Artagnan falls in love with the Queen&apos;s lady-in-waiting, Constance (Allyson).\n\nAll of the acting is wonderful, with the role of Lady De Winter expanded from the original book. Lana Turner is perfect as De Winter - gorgeous, cool, irresistible and deadly. The scenes between Constance and De Winter toward the end of the film are among the best in the movie, very suspenseful (and different from the book). Turner to me looks carefully made up to hide some extra pounds, not to mention being tightly corsetted. The movie was filmed right after Lana had broken up with the great love of her life, Tyrone Power, which may have had something to do with it.\n\nVan Heflin is sympathetic and strong as Athos, who has a past with De Winter and still loves her, and Vincent Price makes an excellent Cardinal Richlieu. Gene Kelly is the ideal D&apos;Artagnan, and his casting is very clever, giving him a chance to show the great athleticism that contributed so much to his dancing. His swordplay is amazing, really making the swordfights entertaining. Though the role has very serious moments, Kelly gives it a lightness and humor when needed. Especially fun is the scene where D&apos;Artagnan, in the dark, poses as Lady De Winter&apos;s lover.\n\nThere are, as mentioned, many versions of this Dumas classic. This one is vividly entertaining, colorful and energetic, with a very attractive cast, good direction, and a thrilling score. Highly recommended.",

Amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (I won&apos;t reveal it in case anyone hasn&apos;t read the series). Other illogical parts feature.

      "reviewBody": "Mr. Billion is a highly entertaining, fast-moving road action comedy in the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; style.  The basic plot concerns an heir to a billion-dollar fortune, an Italian mechanic and race driver played by Terrence Hill, who must travel to California to claim his inheritance within a certain amount of time.  If Terrence&apos;s character does not get to the corporate offices in time to claim the inheritance, the entire estate will end up in the hands of the executor, played devilishly by Jackie Gleason. Gleason&apos;s character continually directs a concerted effort throughout the film to stop the rightful heir from getting there on time.\n\nNow, forget the plot.  As you have probably guessed, the above situation simply sets the stage for the real feature of this movie--the bone-jarring, speed-limit-busting, car-rattling stunts, including a railroad jump stunt you have to see to believe.  There&apos;s plenty of humor in this movie, too, and all of the players (Hill, Gleason, and Slim Pickens thrown in to boot) really have fun with the script and their characterizations.\n\nTo be honest, I first saw this movie on TV when I was about 13, but I often think back on this film and I think I would still enjoy it today (I&apos;m 33 now) if it ever came back on TV.  However, a trip to the rental store would probably be too much effort to expend on this film.\n\nIn summary, if you like road-action pics, this is an excellent kick-back-and-enjoy movie to spend an evening with.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, so first of all the idea for this movie is great. I think the writer did a great job to come up with something original and yet very much within a horror movie genre. It had all the right horror clichés and yet had some bits we had never seen before. Is it a great movie? Not by a long shot, it feels cheap in places and some effects are bad quality. However there are moments when the obvious lack of resource adds to the fact it feels quite real. I thought the American actors who play Hayley and Mr Faber were the best in the movie, along with the British guy who played the major, by a yard stick! The rest were not interesting enough, I do not know if that&apos;s down to the writing, or the actor but I guess ultimately I want to blame the Director here. There is also one British guy who appears to be dubbed throughout the movie, an older character but because of this, it really jerks you out of the film. Fortunately he is not in the picture long enough. I read one of the user reviews saying it was too dark, I didn&apos;t agree. I thought the fact that the movie was dark was a real plus. I found it quite scary throughout but I do agree the sounds quality is just plain bad! I thought the moment when all the soldiers are singing the nursery rhyme and clapping was a little laughable but there were some genuine scares in here. Quite a few to be honest. And some nice twists in there too! Is it going to be the kinda movie that sets the world alight, I very much doubt it, it just doesn&apos;t have the full package. The quality is just not there. It was a refreshing piece though and worth a look for sure. I like scary and this movie had scary.",

      "reviewBody": "When Ring conquered the far east in 1998, then began to spread to the west, audiences were shocked at the nature of new horror. No longer was blood, guts and gore the content used to scare viewers, but sheer unadulterated terror caused by a whole new approach of psychological tension and a surreal dreamlike fear. It spawned a decent sequel which didn&apos;t *quite* live up the original due to convolucence of the plot and slight contrivance. But for the 3rd movie in the series (I ignore the Korean &apos;Ring Virus&apos;) they went back to basics, and told a simple story. Ring 0 is a prequel. Yes, not everything is cleared up, but for sheer story telling and quality of drama Ring 0 is the best in the series. It doesn&apos;t quite contain the same level of fear as Ring, but that&apos;s on purpose to portray Sadako (Who could well be one of the most enduring &apos;villains&apos; in movie history) as a vulnerable girl - to convey her upbringing and troubled existance. And on this level the movie works extremely well, and the viewer identifies with her. But it just wouldn&apos;t be Ring without a scare or 2, and the ending, while not *quite* as terrifying as Ring&apos;s ending (Due to the fact we are now getting familiar with Ring&apos;s &apos;tricks&apos;) is still extremely chilling and will scare you. Overall, excellent movie and thoroughly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "i hadn&apos;t heard much about this movie, but it was surprisingly OK.\n\nGinji is a kamikaze pilot who doesn&apos;t end up flying his last mission because the war ends. So he goes into business with a friend selling stuff on the black market. After being betrayed by this friend, he does 50 yrs in prison. When he gets out his old friend is now the Prime Minister of Japan and is tracking his movements. Of course, he&apos;s an old man himself now and seems to have no real desire for revenge, and just wants to be left alone. Some interesting people cross his path and it seems fate wants him to meet up with his old friend.\n\nAt times, seriously bloody, supernaturally strange, but mostly rather slow and reflective, i liked it more as it went along. OK, but not great. Worth the watch if you like Japanese cinema, watching dudes wielding samurai swords and have time to kill.",

And it has all this &quot;ultra violent&quot; and &quot;droogs&quot; words in it. It´s kind of usual porno movie, but it´s unique in a way. This is one the few porno movies that has a plot in it. It has its moments, it´s funny here and there. Well, some of the sex scenes are enjoyable but if I had to direct this movie, I would concentrate on the characters, even though it´s a porno movie. But it´s not a good movie. Bad acting. But the actors are used to what they´re &quot;doing&quot;. This movie is about four women that &quot;rape&quot; men, but when they´re &quot;at it&quot; the men are taking over. Weird. But, as I said it´s enjoyable here and there. I wonder how Stanley Kubrick would have reacted if he saw this movie? :)",

At this party one fellow is telling some other fellows how Top Gun is nothing more than &quot;a man&apos;s struggle with his own latent homosexuality&quot;. He then proceeds to analyze all of the characters in terms of Maverick&apos;s sexual orientation. I always felt robbed of time, money, and I.Q. points for having sat through Top Gun in the theater back in 1986 but that one comic scene made it all worth it.",

      "reviewBody": "Jeepers Creepers was a fresh and unique movie when it came out. It was creepy, had some good jump scares and enough gorey horror content to satisfy the youthful audience at the time who demanded to see it. Jeepers Creepers has stood the test of time and gone on to become one of horror&apos;s greatest franchises. The movies are often talked about (for the good and the bad) and debated (mostly about the director) but, at the end of the day, this franchise&apos;s first entry will be remembered for many years to come.\n\nEvery 23 years for 23 days, the creeper gets to feast. It&apos;s an interesting concept, and a double-edged sword: it creates an urgency for the creeper as it stalks its prey, but it also causes extreme limitations in terms of sequel planning because the creeper is only around for that limited period of time (it&apos;s like Disney with their moratorium program; get it before it&apos;s gone for years to come!). The acting in this movie is about what you would expect from a slasher. It&apos;s campy, but nobody approaches one of those movies expecting a Shakespearean production. Where Salva&apos;s first horror effort, Clownhouse, was boring and fell flat, when Salva approached Jeepers Creepers, he really had his finger on the pulse of America. He knew that people wanted to see, what they were scared of, and what would make for a good movie. A lot of elements in this movie are dated (particularly the effects), but on the whole this movie is still fun to watch and stood up relatively well. I prefer the second one to the original, but this will always be one of the true greats of horror.",

Without showing any judgment the film show the reality of the Middle-East conflict through the eyes of the children. And the children make the film because they are open to new experiences and are willing to try new things. The film says that any hope for any peace in that region will come if children will meet on a regular basis. It also says clearly that the danger lies in the extremists from both side and it seems that both side have their fair share of extremists children who are growing with hate towards the other side.\n\nLet hope that everyone there will wake up soon and will go and see this film and maybe than everyone will realize that hate doesn&apos;t lead to anywhere and children are the hope for the future as long as they don&apos;t grow up hating anyone.",

      "reviewBody": "Khandan (1965) : Brief Review -\n\nToo much family drama to handle, but that&apos;s what 60&apos;s entertainment was all about. The 60s saw many South remakes in Hindi cinema, and most of them were taken from successful movies and became successful as well. Khandan came from the Tamil movie Bhaaga Pirivinai, which was directed by A. Bhimsingh, and he sat on the director&apos;s chair for the Hindi remake as well. Needless to say that it becomes easier to recreate your own work rather than somebody else recreating it with his own vision. Bhimsingh&apos;s Khandan is a melodramatic affair, and I was kind of expecting that from it. However, the melodrama was over the top and one level higher than what I expected. The elder son Govind becomes paralysed by one hand and one leg, and his aunt despises him for that. Her brother returns from Singapore and starts dividing the house. With his conspiracy, this happy, big family and house are scattered into pieces. There is too much melodrama, too many nuances that play a major role in proving the &quot;karma&quot; factor right, too many villains to hate, but Pran is just amazing. Govind is paralysed, but his son is normal, whereas Sunder is normal, but his wife gives a birth to a paralysed son. Now that&apos;s too much drama, and it&apos;s too conflicting. I don&apos;t see any logic in that or the way Govind is ready to get humiliated every time as if he were a duffer, but maybe that&apos;s what the 60&apos;s entertainment was all about. People hardly care about the logic and went mad over the high-voltage drama that became dated soon. Sunil Dutt, Pran, Nutan, Lalita Pawar, Manmohan Krishna, and Om Prakash have delivered superb performances. This film doesn&apos;t feel crap because of them. The songs are very situational, but the chart-scoring numbers aren&apos;t there. Badi Der Bhayi Nandlala maybe your devotional chartbuster. Overall, a highly dramatic family soap that&apos;s faded away from memories too soon, deservingly.\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "Dark Ages , two witches are condemned for murdering and witchery ; they are executed by the authorities , as Alaric De Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded and Mabille De Lancre (Helga Line) is hung , while Alaric pronounces a curse against their future heirs . Modern time , the descendants ( Vic Winnner , Jacinto Molina Cristina Suriani )decide , subsequently a spiritualism season , go to the castle and lands their ancestors . Several centuries later , both of whom are relived by treasure diggers (Luis Ciges) . Then , Alaric and Mabille continue a murderous rampage .\n\nThis terrifying exploitation picture displays creepy horror ,witchcraft, grisly killing, satanism and lots of blood . B-entertainment with a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story in which sorceresses are brought to life undergoing a cruel slaughter . Lots of blood and gore in several images that impacted the viewers for that time . This tale about a group who is attacked by some malevolent living dead begins well and grows more and more until the frightening and ghastly finale . Revolting, horrible scenes and nasty images take place on cannibal scenes , decapitation , a heart pulled up , and bloody murders with ax and scythe .The movie has a bit of ridiculous gore with loads of blood similar to tomato and is occasionally an engaging horror movie full of nasty sequences , witchery , beheading , and several other things . Sensationalistic and exaggerated performance of Paul Naschy or Jacinto Molina , here he plays three characters. This is the first time that appears Zombies in Spanish cinema, exception to Amando De Ossorio&apos;s Templar living dead . Good make-up that lasted nine hours each Zombie-session by Julian Ruiz and well filmed in the mansion of Lozoya whose owners were the Naschy&apos;s fathers. It packs a colorful cinematography by Manuel Merino and atmospheric score by Carmelo Bernaola .The late Naschy was a good professional , writing, filmmaking and acting about hundred titles , mainly in terror genre. ¨Exorcismo¨ is written by Molina along with 21 screenplays as ¨Mark of Wolfman¨, ¨Night of Walpurgis¨, ¨Vengeance of the mummy¨, ¨Licantropo¨, among them . He directed 13 films as ¨The Cantabros¨, ¨Return of Wolfman¨, ¨The Beast and the magic sword¨ and several others.\n\nThis is the first production realized by Profilmes - the Spanish Hammer- whose chairmen , Ricardo Muñoz and Jose Antonio Perez Giner assigned to Jacinto Molina the writing a rapid screenplay , Nashcy wrote it in two days and as was born the ¨Horror rises from the tomb ¨. Ten years later , Naschy goes back with the Alaric De Marnac role in the film titled ¨Latidos De Panico¨ that acted , produced , wrote and directed in thriller style . The picture is regularly directed by Carlos Aured who was a director assistant to Leon Klimovsky ; this is his first movie and he would on filming for Jacinto Molina as the ¨Revenge of the mummy , House of the Doom , and Return of Walpugis ¨ . Rating: 5,5 . The flick will appeal to Jacinto Molina fans and Euroterror buffs .",

      "reviewBody": "What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized! This is the first filmed version of &apos;Hamlet&apos; to use the full text of Shakespeare&apos;s play, but Branagh didn&apos;t do it just because &quot;it was there.&quot; His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that&apos;s a bargain.\n\nThe setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you&apos;re watching a four-hour movie. Branagh&apos;s casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of &apos;Hamlet&apos; is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.\n\nBranagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with &apos;Henry V.&apos; One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let&apos;s face it, &apos;Hamlet&apos; is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they&apos;ve read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don&apos;t know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.\n\nThere are so many other outstanding performances here they&apos;re almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn&apos;t, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it&apos;s the work of a perfectionist.\n\nNot to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.\n\nDid I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle&apos;s score? No doubt I did. I&apos;ll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of &apos;Hamlet,&apos; and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.",

I remember quietly sneaking in the video cassette and watching it on vcr when my parents were away. The film had an evil force (Ramsay regular Anirudh Agarwal with mud pack on his face), a hot and sexy Jasmin under a shower and typical exorcism tamasha.\n\nAs I watched Ekta Kapoor&apos;s Ragini MMS 2, I was reminded of Veerana. It has all the above story elements only with bigger production design, slicker technical effects and ofcourse, Sunny Leone in place of Jasmin. Still, I aint impressed. Clearly, Hindi horror hasn&apos;t matured yet. Come back Ramsays, you are being missed...\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni",

Here are some of my favorite parts:\n\n\n*  The hardware store guy cutting off the tip of his finger while trimming his finger nails with hedge trimmers after being startled by the girls.\n\n\n\n*  Ike &amp; Adley &quot;Bagging&quot; girls.\n\n\n\n*  Ma&apos;s wardrobe.\n\n\n\n*   Ike &amp; Adley eating breakfast (Trix) out of a galvanized steel bucket with a huge ladle.\n\n\n\n*   The whole &quot;Disco Sucks/ Punk&apos;s Stupid Debate.\n\n\n\n*   The whole girls tied to excercise equipment sequence especially this exchange:\n\n\nTRINA to IKE: You backwards perverted piece if s**t. ANGRY IKE: Don&apos;t you ever call me backwards again. Look around. Were citified.\n\n\n*  Ma yelling at the boys (and making them start over) for allowing Abbey to get one of her hands free while being raped.\n\n\n\n*  The parody of the self improvement seminar Ma is in at the start of the movie.\n\n\n\n*  Ma&apos;s description of her sister Queenie:\n\n\nShe snapped my neck while I was still in the crib...she was born with a full head of white hair...I&apos;ve seen her chase down wolves and rip their throats out just to watch them bleed.\n\n\n*   All the grafitti spray painted throughout the house.\n\n\n\n*   Abbey suffocating MA with a huge set of inflatable transparent tits.\n\n\n\n*   Ike and Adley get up in the morning. Big Bird Alarm Clock: &quot;Wake up sleepy heads Bigbird says it&apos;s time to get up&quot;. Ike proceeds to brush his teeth with beer, pick at his messy hair with a switchblade, and spray deoderant on thru his shirt.\n\n\nAbsolutely great film."

      "reviewBody": "Decent but very flawed film that has so many points to it that it can&apos;t be categorize in simply good or bad. \n\nThe Good: Some of the performances are spectacular and deserving of a much better movie than this. Gene Hackman hasn&apos;t been this good in ages, and he&apos;s one of the few reasons that this movie is watchable. The next reason is Rachel Weisz, who is the only actor Hackman has had in quite some time that is his equal in performance and in acting prowess. She is so good in fact that she does almost steal the film from him and then some. The city of New Orleans is a fascinating setting for this film but wrong because it&apos;s not the original setting of the book. \n\nThe Bad: Dustin Hoffman is not really in the movie and is really a minor character in the whole story. Which is too bad because he&apos;s such a charismatic actor and deserves a much bigger role than what he had. The next problem is the whole spy versus spy angle that makes the whole film into a joke because no one would go that far to rig a jury, especially in a case that would have been thrown out of a real court with the facts that was presented in the film. Which leads to.\n\nThe Ugly: The script is really bad. How bad you say? It took almost four writers to outline the story, which bare in mind does not follow the book at all. The dialog is great in places and bad in others, and the whole structure of the film is paper-thin which is easily to blow holes thru. The story runs out of gas in the half way point of the film and the ideas express seems more like a bias view of what the law should be than a realistic view of what the law really is. I think the biggest offence the movie makes is changing the text of the original novel and making about guns other than big tobacco. John Grisham&apos;s original novel was hugely entertaining and down right poignant in its views about justice. This film seems like it has not idea where it&apos;s at from time to time and lacks a coherent narrative to even try to explain the stuff that is going on right in front of you.\n\nEven with the good points, the bad does out weight the good here. It&apos;s a decent film because of the acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman but they like the viewer are let down with a script that lacks conviction for the subject it covers and a real point of view that expresses the feelings of the reality of the gun issue."

      "name": "Bowie was born on January 8th",
      "reviewBody": "This concert-film, mixed with concert footage, backstage looks and interview clips, highlights Bowie at his best. It is situated in a rock era that was actually coming to an end. Glam-rock was a new style that was very hot in the UK and it got its start in 1971. It would be the style that would help Bowie launch his career from performer to star. It was a style that would end its own reign by 1975. Bowie, after a slow start in the late 60s, would work in experimental music and styles. He again emerged in 1972 as the colorful and asexualized, alter ego, Ziggy Stardust. Complete with, psychedelic colors, gritty film stock and lot of awesome rock-and-roll, this film is an androgynous, flamboyant spectacle.\n\nBe aware that this film is listed as 1983 also, because it was released in 1973, but only in a few theaters and film-festivals. It wasn&apos;t until Bowie got really huge in the 80s that the film was re-released ten years later. The film had a number of problems with the shooting of the concert. Director D. A. Pennebaker, who was only planning on shooting 20 minutes&apos; worth of the concert, was so taken in by Bowie&apos;s amazing aura on stage, that they changed plans and shot the whole thing. Unfortunately, that caused extra challenges due to lack of cameramen, audio issues and lighting problems between the stage and the audience.\n\nHis simple solution for the lighting was telling everyone to take as many photos as possible so the flashes would help with the lighting issue. The initial release of the film in 1973 was deemed a sloppy mess. Even Bowie, who said in the film, that this was their last appearance as the Spiders From Mars, who would bail on the Ziggy persona a year or two later, lost interest in the film, because of the delays in getting the technical issues fixed, until they were able to clean things up for the 1983 re-release.\n\nIf you ask me those technical issues are what make this film so great. The grittiness of the film grain, because of the low light, the streakiness of the lights and colors, because of the film stock and the edgy, vinyl recording sound, all help to create this mood that I feel Bowie was trying to convey.\n\nBowie is all smiles throughout this film too. He obviously is having a lot of fun and thoroughly enjoys his craft. Even in moments when things get serious you still feel a playful positive mood coming off of him and out of the screen. His talent is beyond amazing, especially when you consider this was very early in his career. They do an amazing version of Space Oddity. All the songs are well done. This is a definitive version of what a cool concert film can be and it is even more interesting when you think about the fact that he would have an even more amazing career for the next 40 years after this.\n\n7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

      "reviewBody": "If one were to judge the comedic or acting abilities of Craig Ferguson by his work on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, he could easily be overlooked, passed over, or lumped in with the stereotypically smarmy and scenery-chewing English supporting character types like Christopher Hewitt (tv&apos;s Mr. Belvedere), and Daniel Davis (Butler Niles on &quot;The Nanny).\n\nDon&apos;t be misled.  Ferguson, who is HORRIBLE on Drew Carey, is every bit as wonderful in this smart, well acted, clever and sweet mockumentary which is surprisingly not a Christpher Guest production, and luckily with no Eugene Levy in sight!\n\nThis film is a surprise, it&apos;s a sleeper, and probably did  0 box office in the US, but, give yourself a treat.  Rent it, preferably with a roomful of good humored friends.  An instant party!",

There was barely any talking, the pictures never showed amazing scenery, as you would expect in the Swiss mountains, and no documentary comments either. I think the goal of this film piece is to show how boring the live of a mountain farmer is ... and that really came through ... This piece is not worth be to shown in movie theater, it should be shown in maybe mountain museums ... if at all, since it&apos;s missing any interesting information. I hope this will not again be shown in such a open movie series, it is a waste of time.\n\n\n* Dopas\n",

      "reviewBody": "This 1968 Soviet feature covers well-worn territory, the drama and foibles of teachers and students at a high school. Its themes of loneliness, love, honesty and independent thinking are okay on paper, but hovering over the entire picture is the lack of freedom of expression in the Soviet Union, contradicting much of the story&apos;s message.\n\nMain character is a history teacher who still lives with his 70-year-old mom and has failed in interpersonal relations -no love for him. Leading lady is his former student, now teaching English, who is still carrying a torch for him. The students, fellow teachers and school principal are generally stereotypes, with attempted poignancy of many a scene falling flat.\n\nWorst scene is the climax, where teach is lecturing about the origins of the Russian Revolution, and he castigates a student for belittling a minor figure in said revolution, who the kid considers a failure because &quot;he only received 15 lines in the textbook&quot;. Our hero&apos;s impassioned plea for recognizing the man&apos;s true worth belies all the taken-for-granted criticism of the tsars in this script: of course, no criticism of the Soviet establishment can be raised. You see, it was the tsar who promised freedom of speech and the like and didn&apos;t deliver -he&apos;s the bad guy, not any current officials.\n\nStar Vyacheslav Tichonov looks a lot like Laurence Olivier, but I found his performance all surface and stilted -not for a moment did I empathize with him. The widescreen, black &amp; white photography is impressive, but what occurs in the frame is a lot less interesting or informative than a random episode of James Franciscus in &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, which I watched loyally during this era. And considering the hard-hitting foreign films from both Western and Eastern Europe that were shown at American arthouses during this period, &quot;Surviving Till Monday&quot; doesn&apos;t measure up, and wasn&apos;t released in America."

Soon I noticed I was stuck watching this seemingly plotless movie about a guy, who has driven a taxi in Chicago for about 4 months.\n\nA plotless movie might sound boring, even waste of time, but with great writing, good actors and good director &quot;Chicago Cab&quot; dwells up to be nicely cut slice from a population of big city, in example, religious family, married couple pregnant with their first born, etc.\n\nActing is overall very good, but Paul Dillon makes outstanding job in the role of Cab Driver. Without his subtle performance this whole movie could fall in pieces.\n\n&quot;Chicago Cab&quot; balances between drama and comedy. Some things in this movie are so surprising and well thought of, that they made me laughing out loud. Some things made me sad, or feel compassion towards the Taxi Driver or his customers.\n\nThis is a movie, which can be recommend for people, who want to see little different kind of drama/comedy or are just fed up with all regular actors of this specific genre.\n\n8/10.",

It has got everything you can have in a movie: humor, horror, thrill,romance, action, music, etc. The songs are REALLY good in this movie. I would definitely recommend buying the soundtrack of Chandramukhi. There&apos;s even one song in Telugu. Overall, I liked this movie a lot. Of course it had Rajnikanth in it, which brought quite a lot more appeal to it. There are good fight scenes with attempts of the &quot;Matrix&quot; effect, which is pretty cool. In the Telugu dub of this movie, one of the songs is sung by Carnatic Diva, Nityasree Mahadevan. What more could one ask for? It is a great movie, and I think everyone should see it. It might be a bit scary for young children, but it should be suitable for older ones. Conclusively, Chandramukhi is a great watch, and with stars like Rajnikanth and Jyothika, it is a big success!!",

      "reviewBody": "I was quite impressed with _Rebel Without a Cause_. I expected it to be quite standard, having only gathered its reputation because of the tragedy surrounding James Deans&apos; death. Fortunately, it stood up on its own quite well. Its superficial situations are somewhat dated, which was inevitable, but its themes remain potent after many decades.\n\nThe major theme is the burgeoning relationship between adults and their teenage children. All three of the main characters are at different stages in this process. Jim (James Dean) is surprisingly at the earliest stage of this. His mother is pretty distanced and unresponsive already, but he still seems to communicate well with his father (Jim Backus, who is amazing. His character&apos;s relationship with his wife also provides an interesting view into 1950s gender politics; in one scene, Backus is wearing a cooking apron, which is very obviously meant for a woman). Judy (Natalie Wood, whom I didn&apos;t even recognize here) is almost completely rejected by her father, who feels that her affection is out of place in her teenage years. Worst of all is Plato, both of whose parents have left him alone in the world. He tries desperately to make Jim and Judy his parents (although from this vantage point in time, Plato seems resoundingly sexually attracted to Jim, and he sees Judy as a threat to their relationship. Although the writer/director has denied that forever, no human being can watch it nowadays without that thought constantly crossing their mind).\n\nThe reason that I say this film is flawed lies in the actions of Plato near the end of the film. I felt his escalating insanity was kind of a cop-out. Instead of actually delving into Plato&apos;s true character and motives by having intelligent and realistic dialogue and actions, he is just made to go batty, wherein he spouts off his thoughts as if he were some eight year old or man-child. Plato may have been sycophantic throughout the film, but he was anything but a moron. His actions provide an easy way for the director/writer to answer all questions about his character, and then to facilitate an ending which is tragic, but more than a little contrived.\n\nDespite what I feel is a cop-out ending, _Rebel Without a Cause remains a thoroughly powerful film. I liked it, and I&apos;ll never forget it. 9/10",

There are difficult moments here, where I found myself saying &apos;Don&apos;t do it, don&apos;t do it&apos;, but she does because inexperience and lack of confidence make for poor choices. As soon as you can place yourself in her shoes, you will find this film moving, and very clearly (and poetically) observed. I recommend this film very highly, both for its clean and original voice - and very Australian voice - and the sympathy we feel for its very real lead characters.",

It is about how two brothers have experienced the disappearance of their mother and seek to find her through wormholes.\n\nIn my opinion, I found this film to be brilliant in every way. It has a comedy part that is very interesting, and you can also appreciate that it is very intelligent in the actions of the characters. Also, it presents a mix of science fiction with scientific aspects of time travel that, with the mixture of all the ingredients mentioned above, is really funny.\n\nTo top it off, it touches on thoughtful and sentimental themes that play nicely with the story. Overall, the script is fascinating and manages to connect all the key points of the present with the past and future.\n\nThe last point to highlight is that the protagonists reach out to you, the viewer. At least in several moments they have reached me and I have connected with them.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this movie to go with the family because it is entertaining, touching and different from the traditional.",

      "reviewBody": "What a steamer! I have to admit that I was seriously Gung-ho for this flick because it sounded intriguing and I figured, at the very least, it would be a quality film with Keitel and Kinski involved. Silly me. Star Knight (aka The Knight of the Dragon) comes off like a cheesy mash-up of Starman, Dune and Black Knight, it combines elegant, unearthly production design with ineffective, bumbling comedy and unlikable characters. The alien, his &quot;suit of armor&quot; and his ship were gorgeous, they deserved a film worthy of their design, not this goofy meandering crap.\n\nI wanted to like Kinski, his ice-cold blue eyes and dazzling smile but the vibe his character gives off is decidedly sinister and therefor hard to connect with. Keitel&apos;s &quot;brave knight&quot; is idiotic and it only gets worse when the Brooklyn accent spills forth during his poorly delivered Olde English dialog. Honestly, this was a real forehead-slapper. I suppose the alien &quot;IX&quot; (Miguel Bosé) was okay but he doesn&apos;t get lines and his acting consisted of wide eyes and head nods.\n\nStar Knight was about as basic as they come, &quot;Alien comes to Earth to study our world and he falls in love.&quot; Big whoop, right? Well as simple as it is it really could have succeed (in its own way) had the characters worked better and the film was played straight. They didn&apos;t and it wasn&apos;t though and, in the end, instead of finding myself mildly entertained with a cool time-waster, I was bored to tears by &quot;just plain bad.&quot; I wish I could say that it got better at some point but it didn&apos;t.\n\nIf you&apos;re all about dumb-as-rocks sci-fi comedies like Pluto Nash and Galaxy Quest then you may find this only a little disappointing. Everybody else though should steer clear unless you&apos;re a glutton for cinematic punishment, like me."

      "reviewBody": "Starting with THE Spanish MAIN (RKO/1945) and continuing too the mid 1950s Paul Henried made a series of discount SwashBucklers. LAST OF THE BUCCANEERS is his effort for 1950 from Columbia. Henried plays JEAN LAFITTE a Pirate whose main claim to fame was his participation in the &apos;Battle of New Orleans&apos; during the &apos;War of 1812&apos;. This movie purports to show his adventures after that event.\n\nThe print of the film is in first class shape and filmed in brilliant TechniColor, this is its sole saving asset. By 1950 the days of glory for Henried (and Bette Davis) at Warner Brothers were long gone. Now middle aged he (and her) were no longer suited for those classic romances, made obsolete post WWII. Henried&apos;s accent though was useful and it slated him for these action epics. As long as they were &apos;B&apos; films with a budget that reflected the same and made money he had a job. Another curious casting was in comedic song and dance man Jack Oakie, like Henried now obsolete, though we could never understand his appeal anyway. Today he is best remembered for playing &apos;Benzini Napaloni&apos; in THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). His favorite role for us was when Lloyd Nolan made him eat lead in THE Texas RANGERS (1936) a fate he truly deserved.\n\nLAST OF THE BUCCANEERS is one of those films that if you are channel surfing and nothing else appeals to you is worth a look since it runs only 79 minutes. For real action on the high seas you are better off with Errol Flynn, THE SEA HAWK (1940) or Tyrone Power, THE BLACK SWAN (1942). For JEAN LAFITTE best to tune into THE BUCCANEER (1958). Yul Brynner does a commendable job and it features &apos;The Battle of New Orleans&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "White Fang (1973)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nJack London&apos;s classic story is brought to the screen in a rather good adaptation from director Lucio Fulci. Most people know Fulci for his graphic horror films starting with ZOMBIE and continuing throughout the 1980s. A lot of people seem to forget that he also directed comedies, action films, Westerns, giallos and even family movies.\n\nWHITE FANG is certainly a family movie, although there are enough dark spots to where even the adults are going to be entertained. We have Franco Nero playing the good guy who befriends White Fang and an orphan Indian boy. John Steiner plays the villain who also wants the dog but for a different set of reasons. Then there&apos;s Fernando Rey as Father Oatley and Vima Lisi plays Sister Evangelina.\n\nI was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The cinematography is quite good and there&apos;s no question that you really do feel as if you&apos;re in the Alaskian wilderness, although the opening scenes with White Fang in the trap were obviously filmed on a set. The performances are very good and we&apos;re also given a good amount of action throughout the picture. There are some dog fights that are pretty violent but they&apos;re also quite intense and well-done.\n\nFulci proves here that he was able to do more than just throw graphic violence and gore at the screen. The film certainly contains some flaws but for the most part it&apos;s a very entertaining movie."

In many cases, we may claim that some movies are like wine: the older they are, the better they occur to be. Yet, not many movies are great in the intensity of being captivating on multiple levels. This can be said about ROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI by Count Visconti, a film considered not only by its director to be his best one but still appreciated by lots of viewers worldwide. Let me consider some of its strongest points that I noticed while seeing the film.\n\nThe most important thing that drew my attention in ROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI was the wide range of life situations, themes and feelings which one can enumerate endlessly. The viewer is truly given an insight into profound development of charming affection, bitter humiliation, outrageous mockery, sweet desire, wretched rivalry, Utopian idealism, cruel vengeance, sad disappointment, intense sorrow, indefatigable disillusion, upsetting despair directing themselves towards final hope. By analyzing the content and trying to identify with the characters (note that it is not &quot;observing&quot; the characters but &quot;identifying&quot; with them like in classic Greek tragedies), the viewers dive into life situations which, at the same time, can be present in their own experiences: family ties, unemployment, social status, honor, social pressure, plotting, crimes...are they not all up to date now as they were in 1960? But this aspect cannot be separated from the characters.\n\nCHARACTER ANALYSIS. Rocco (Alain Delon) is an idealist, a very good person but too noble to succeed in this world. He appears to be a sort of biblical king David whose pardoning and love lead him to omit the teaching example and forget those who really care for him. His brother Ciro (Max Cartier), however, is a good realist who knows what the family means, how it matters; yet, who does not ignore the purifying punishment for wickedness. He seems to be as good hearted as Rocco; however; his mind is indeed more &quot;earthly.&quot; He heads for goodness filled with honest intentions but keeping both feet firmly on the ground. Vincenzo is most individual and, thanks to getting married, most separated from the family. The &quot;villain&quot; brother is Simone (Renato Salvatori) who becomes a successful boxer but gradually turns to declining psychological strength poisoned by desire, jealousy and vengeance. In between comes a poor mother Rosaria Parondi (Katina Paxinou) who copes with true psychological suffering of lost hope and humiliation. An interesting character is a &quot;fallen woman&quot; Nadia (Annie Girardot) who is as changeable and as romantic as a classical tragic female in her dreams but down to earth and desperate in her acts. When it seems possible for her to fulfill the dreams of a better life, it is too late... \n\nThere is so much profoundity and complexity in the movie that one could dwell in the themes for long. However, let me focus on the ARTISTIC FEATURES of the movie, too.\n\nVisconti&apos;s movie is a very valuable cinematic work with truly stunning cinematography, perfect direction, excellent script, wonderful moments. Anyone who decides to see this film should not ignore three moments that appear to be the milestone of film&apos;s harmony. The first one is Rocco and Nadia on the top of Milanese cathedral where she opens her psyche to him and, at the same time, his reaction is like a great blow of individual reality affecting the mutual one: &quot;We&apos;ll never meet again&quot; The second moment is the scene when all the family except for Simone celebrate Rocco&apos;s championship in boxing. The two bells that ring: the first one being a mysterious visit, the second one being Simone&apos;s entrance leave critical thoughts and conclusions. The third is the final moment when Ciro talks to their youngest brother Luca about life, future, and errors that should never be made again. However, that is not all. There is something more that makes Visconti&apos;s film an artistic pearl, PERFORMANCES.\n\nAll cast do excellent jobs portraying their characters in a genuine way with a necessary invitation for viewers to identify. Alain Delon is unforgettable as Rocco: gentle, kind hearted, sometimes weak, sometimes very straightforward in personal decisions. The opposite counterpart appears to be Renato Salvatori who perfectly portrays Simone - so wild, so tremendously unstable, so easily led to fear, addiction and tragic despair. Another performance that deserves appreciation is Katina Paxinou&apos;s in the role of mother Rosaria: religious with a bit of superstition, so dominant over her sons, and generally so good hearted. A mention should be made of a minor role of Claudia Cardinale who plays Ginetta, Vincenzo&apos;s wife.\n\nROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI is a must see, a movie that everyone should watch profoundly addressing three levels of attention: first, a sole interest in Visconti being one of Neorealist directors aside DeSica, Rossellini and others; second, the artistic side including cinematography, direction, charm, performances; third, insight into both content and characters, their realistic complexity, humanity of life. Then, these three hours of watching will not occur in vain.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the course of two years, producers and directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato interviewed one hundred two male prostitutes who worked in West Hollywood, exploring their backgrounds, private lives, and attitudes toward their work and paying each fifty dollars for their time. Edited together around certain themes with the occasional more detailed profile of certain individuals, the result was 101 RENT BOYS. It was and remains extremely controversial.\n\nThe central controversy involved arises from the fact that, at least to a certain extent, 101 RENT BOYS can be considered deliberately exploitive. The explotational edge is apparent in the title itself, which implies a certain sexiness; in that interviews are conducted in various hotel rooms which might be used by prostitutes and clients; in that the filmmakers have no qualm in encouraging their subjects to drape suggestively across bed; in that the filmmakers pay their subjects and very deliberately photograph the subjects accepting the money. By doing so, Bailey and Barbato essentially make both themselves and the viewer complicit in an act of prostitution. The irony is that in most instances the act of prostitution is not so much physical--nor can it be; we are distanced by film--than it is both spiritual and psychological. We are not paying for physical touch but for the right to invade the mind of the subjects in ways they would not normally give a client. The result is often unsettling, to say the least, particularly when one considers that Bailey and Barbato apparently have no problem in engaging in it.\n\nNo less so are the various subjects. The majority of the men involved are essentially street hustlers who have been recruited from Santa Monica Boulevard, men who range in age from their early twenties to late thirties; some are remarkably handsome; some are distinctly haggard. They tend to share backgrounds of physical abuse as children and current drug abuse. Even so, they are remarkably diverse and often very articulate and occasionally unexpectedly clear-eyed about their profession and the toll it takes on their lives. A handful are clearly upscale in nature, far removed from the streets; these tend to regard their work as less a matter of a life style into which they drifted than as a business they often enjoy.\n\nNow and then certain individuals pop with their extremes. Perhaps the most disturbing is a man who enjoys physical pain, almost casually putting out a cigarette on his chest (and later and quite shockingly putting out a cigarette on another part of his body) in demonstration of his thought that &quot;pain is good.&quot; Another goes through an emotional wringer as he describes his separation from his long-term lover; one is a gang member who announces he enjoys working as a prostitute much more than he liked being shot at; and several describe girl friends and children.\n\nIn many respects the men are indeed what you might expect, but in each instance they show, perhaps unintentionally, their humanity. They are indeed considerably more than the flesh and bone rented for a few hours by their customers. They are human beings and much, much more like the &quot;average man&quot; than they are different--a realization that adds to the film&apos;s uneasiness and which is, indeed, the ultimate point of the whole thing.\n\nAs a documentary, however, the film has two very distinct flaws. The least obvious of these is the fact that the prostitutes are selling more than their bodies: they are selling illusions, fantasies, and dreams. This is pointed out by more than one subject, and it has implications in terms of how much of their statements we can believe--but the film never really follows this up in any statement-making sense. The most obvious flaw is that it is in some ways superficial; the subjects are taken at their word and that is that, there is no real context and ultimately nothing we can describe as &quot;cold reality.&quot; Both flaws feed into each other and tend to create a &quot;how much of this can we truly believe?&quot; quality.\n\nThe DVD issue comes with several bonuses. The Bailey and Barbato audio commentary track is interesting, but it may not be interesting in quite the way either man desired; they spend a fair amount of time talking about the sexiness of their various subjects. They also note that one of the original &quot;101 Rent Boys&quot; turned out to be underage, thus forcing them to an additional interview, but that only one hundred men actually appear in the film due to the fact that one subject later rescinded consent. It is also tremendously annoying in the sense that the sound mix is bad: the film audio is mute throughout, and it is impossible to know what soundbyte from the film they are actually talking about at any given moment. There are several unedited interviews, which are interesting in and of themselves, and there are the &quot;three minutes alone&quot; segments, in which subjects were give time alone with the camera to say or do whatever they desired. Needless to say, a few of them elected to &quot;do&quot; rather than &quot;say.&quot; As a whole, and in spite of several very obvious and annoying flaws, 101 RENT BOYS is a very interesting film, always thought provoking. If you are looking for something mindlessly sexy, however, you will be out of luck--and I cannot imagine that it will appeal to the people who, rather ironically, would benefit most from seeing it. Recommended.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

The production value was high, for it was easy to believe that what was seen was really a little Russian village by the sea. The ship must have been authentic, outfitted with no less than real, scarlett silk sails! The story is a simple fairy tale, following the adventurous hero and graceful heroine from childhood.\n\nSadly, this may not reach the audience it deserves. Perhaps that just as Western art students are reexamining Soviet creations without the political prejudice of times past, so too should these wonderful films come to light. I&apos;d recommend this to anyone who appreciates classic storytelling.",

But Turner Classic Movies unearthed it a while ago, letter-boxed as it deserves and as they so reliably do with widescreen titles. \n\nNo one was better than Minnelli when it came to taking pure &quot;camp&quot; elements and turning them into the kind of cinematic excess that had to be seen to be believed. This one is a prime example. As a Cyd Charisse devotee, I wasn&apos;t even disappointed that she didn&apos;t get to unfurl those legendary legs and dance across the CinemaScope screen. Made up, coiffed and gowned to look like Delphine Seyrig in &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;(1961), she looks exactly like the sort of vamp who could drive Kirk Douglas to absolute distraction. With Claire Trevor, at her best, sparring bitterly with the immortal Edward G. Robinson; George Hamilton doing an earnest impression of a Method actor (none too good, I&apos;ll agree); and Leslie Uggams crooning a siren song whilst reclining amidst the ladies of the evening in a deluxe Roman brothel...well! It just HAS to be seen to be (dis)believed! Luvved it!"

The bit when the elevator chopped off the guy&apos;s head was a decent effect -- slow motion and relatively seamless.  And the fact that they had references to terrorism in a NY skyscraper -- before 9/11 -- was pretty cool.  Even made reference to the 93 attempt on the WTC and to Bin Laden -- a while before the actual event.  Eerie.  At least someone out there connected the dots. I&apos;d rent it again.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Wackness,&quot; director Jonathan Levine&apos;s eagerly-awaited followup feature to &quot;All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,&quot; premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was immediately acquired by Sony Pictures Classics. I wasn&apos;t able to catch it at the time. Fortunately, &quot;The Wackness&quot; was presented in a special midnight screening not on the official SXSW Film Festival schedule. It was a special treat and quite an unexpected surprise.\n\n&quot;The Wackness&quot; is basically a two-man show, with Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck as psychiatrist Dr. Squires and his patient Luke Shapiro. The twist? One deals drugs and the other takes them. But guess who buys and who sells? And did I mention that Luke not only doles out weed to his doctor but also dates his daughter? Ahh yes...the plot thickens. Yet Squires and Shapiro forge an unlikely friendship not unlike two college buddies -- the boy is just a bit too mature for his age and the man a bit too immature, and they meet at about the same intellectual level.\n\nPenned by director Levine, it&apos;s a complex storyline but &quot;The Wackness&quot; is ultimately a character-driven piece. Kingsley&apos;s performance is a tour de farce in a daring and risky role unlike anything we&apos;ve seen -- this ain&apos;t your father&apos;s Gandhi. Josh Peck, best known as television&apos;s Josh of &quot;Josh &amp; Drake&quot; and to indie lovers as George, the tormented victim in &quot;Mean Creek,&quot; is the biggest surprise here. He carries this film on his shoulders like a veteran. Olivia Thirlby (&quot;Snow Angels,&quot; &quot;Juno&quot;) is delightful as the object of Luke&apos;s affection.\n\nProduction values belie the film&apos;s modest budget, especially given the cost of a location period piece -- &quot;The Wackness&quot; is set in New York City 1994. Music of the era naturally provides the backdrop for the duo&apos;s drug-dealing days and party nights. Drugs (selling and taking) seem to be ubiquitous in the films I&apos;ve seen here at SXSW and &quot;The Wackness&apos;&quot; overindulgence can be hard to watch at times. But what could have strayed into a silly variation on &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; (or the recent &quot;Charlie Bartlett&quot;) is, instead, a touching coming-of-age story as relevant today as ever. The fact that the film remains grounded in semi-reality is a tribute to the talents of Kingsley and Peck in the hands of director Jonathan Levine. This director is a force to be reckoned with now that he has &quot;All the Boys Love Mandy Lane&quot; and &quot;The Wackness&quot; under his belt.",

I guarantee, though, unless her career takes a nosedive to high-budget, low cal Am flicks, she&apos;s going to be nominated and win an Academy Award for some future performance.  She is truly a fine actress.\n\nAs for this film, I am bothered by a pic that has to glom off the success of another when it really has nothing to do with it whatsoever."

      "name": "Great hardcore sci-fi.  Crichton&apos;s best",
      "reviewBody": "The 1970s were a time before some of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; of American culture began to abandon rationality and reject science on pseudo-ethical grounds. Unsurprisingly, then, 1970s sci-fi is often better informed by science than the sci-fi of later decades, and it is also often more thoughtful and intelligently written. The Andromeda Strain is one of the best hardcore sci fi epics from a decade which brought us such genre classics as 2001, Solyaris, Silent Running, and the original Rollerball. Unlike most of these films, however, Andromeda Strain does not strain believability beyond its bounds, nor does it indulge in metaphysical tangentializing or philosophical moralizing.\n\nDeveloped from what I consider to be Michael Crichton&apos;s best book, the Andromeda Strain takes its cue directly from the hard realism of that book, along with its documentary style and scientific background research. Though aspects of the plot defy biological probability, if not law, almost the entire film is plausible. Also borrowed from Crichton&apos;s writing is the general point the film attempts to make - one which is present in nearly all of Crichton&apos;s work - that along with technological advance comes risk. Fortunately, however, this story does not reach the near-paranoid levels of technophobia which sometimes appear in later works.\n\nA great ensemble cast full of not easily recognized character actors represent a team of scientists called together to contain and manage a deadly virus-like organism which has arrived on a crashed space research probe. The virus has already wiped out an entire town, and now the scientists must work at a breakneck, sleepless, pace to determine what the organism is, how it spreads and grows, and how it can be killed or contained. Their only major clues, it seems, are an old man and a baby who survived the initial outbreak. To avoid spoilers, I will avoid any further details regarding the plot.\n\nThe only aspect of the film which really seems dated is the strange electronic soundtrack, which, at times, seems more derivative of 1950s sci-fi than more modern stuff. Suffice to say that this is one of the best uses of the &apos;as-it-happens&apos; documentary film-making style. The entire film is delivered in a very refreshingly straightforward manner, with believable dialog, actors that look like real people, and a pace that builds constantly from start to finish.\n\nHighly recommended.",

It manages to do the LA police/detective/murder story without lapsing into clichés. In fact, complex twists and turns in the plot keep you involved. Just when you think you have it figured out, you&apos;re hit with another sharp left turn. Loved the mix of murky film with animation. I recognized classic Hollywood landmarks. The art direction never gets dull. Angles are unexpected and animated effects are great. Great music by Keller, his first attempt at scoring a picture. He also is the voice of the main character. And the sex scenes.....animation is able to leave just enough to the imagination...it&apos;s better than a lot of filmed sex.",

There is no (further) plot what so ever. Everything looks totally real and homemade. All this plus a subtle background sound creates a terrible atmosphere in addition to the horrific footage. (As I see there is about 0.5 seconds of questionable material, it involves a sledge hammer and a hand; I think the response from the hand might be unrealistic)\n\nI thought I somewhat used to disturbing films since I watch Cannibal Holocaust, Scrapbook, Aftermath and alike with hardly no problems.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to rate this film, one should probably first ask oneself the question (like yamaelle does in a comment): am I already a psychopath to watch this? The important things about this film can probably be fully assimilated without watching it; the only thing you will miss is the (eventual) chock. This film will or have already gone to the history of film creation as the creators probably intended.\n\nIs this art? Well, it&apos;s hard to tell."

Writer/Director James Gunn delivers a story thats equally gripping and comical. There&apos;s plenty of action, suspense, and steely chills to be had as well. The special FX are nicely well-done and provides for some unforgettably wild scenes.\n\nCast-wise the movie isn&apos;t half bad either, although it&apos;s really Gregg Henry who steals the show as the town&apos;s foul-mouthed mayor.\n\nAll around Slither is an enjoyable creature show for those that like their horror films gooey!

      "reviewBody": "This is it; the original Japanese version of &quot;Gojira&quot; (aka &quot;Godzilla&quot;), the film that introduced the now-legendary movie monster. But does the movie have anything to offer besides a man in a rubber suit stomping all over a miniature version of Tokyo? I think so.\n\nIt isn&apos;t too surprising that the film is actually a thinly-veiled allegory for the threat of the escalating weapons race circa 1954. After all, other sci-fi films of the era covered similar ground. However, what I find interesting about this film is how it gives equal consideration to both sides of the argument.\n\nThe script does a good job of building suspense around the creature until we get to his inevitable rampage. From that point on I find that the action flags a little but that may be due in part to the sometimes unconvincing special effects. Then again, what do you expect from a 54 year old monster movie from Japan? The miniatures often look like miniatures and Godzilla is, after all, a guy in a rubber suit. Nevertheless, while the effects aren&apos;t even as convincing as 1933&apos;s &quot;King Kong&quot; I think that they still hold a certain charm.\n\nThe cast isn&apos;t bad and it does include Takashi Shimura of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; fame. The acting didn&apos;t grab my attention much but, then again, I couldn&apos;t exactly catch every nuance while paying attention to the subtitles at the same time. Ishirô Honda&apos;s direction is solid and the Akira Ifukube score provides pretty good support to the action. I thought that the sound was a bit sub-par at times, though.\n\nUltimately, &quot;Gojira&quot; is worth watching despite its rudimentary special effects. In my mind, it&apos;s the underlying symbolism that makes the film special. By the way, forget about the American-ized version, &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters&quot;; it&apos;s a sometimes clumsy reworking that ignores most of the original film&apos;s complexity.",

The acting is acceptable and competent although some of the lines just stink &quot;you&apos;ve never seen an american before, this close&quot;. But if you can get through that it&apos;s a nice if quite bleak action adventure about (quoting from the EIV trailer) &apos;Vietnam, ten years after. The war is officially over, but the fight for freedom continues. The veil of secrecy that blinds the truth is about to be ripped apart. The soldiers that didn&apos;t return are soon to be avenged, while those remain alive at last taste freedom. Four men in a private army. Four men with one ideal. Four men who will change the meaning of bravery. They will bring their own kind of justice, they will bring their own kind of hate, they will bring freedom, they are Cobra Mission. The war is over but the fight will continue&apos; At least that&apos;s the plan. I would certainly recommend that you see it, if you can find it.

I was in tears for ten minutes after that. Had to go back and rewind the movie. I can&apos;t remember laughing so hard, mostly at Melissa McCarthy who gets the best lines. Sandra Bullock is a perfect partner for Melissa in a semi-miss-congeniality-FBI-agent roll. It&apos;s not a perfect movie- there a few predictable plot lines and Jane Curtain is WAY underutilized. But the chemistry between McCathy and Bullock is great. With a team of good writers they could easily pump out another three or four of these and I would gladly fork over my hard earned cash to see them.\n\n8 out of 10",

      "name": "Up The &quot;Hill&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "&gt;  After suffering a divorce, a marriage between a best friend and an ex-lover, not to mention living with a complete slob for a roommate, travel bookstore owner William (Hugh Grant) was just trying to live a peaceful existence in Notting Hill, England with his disastrous lovelife and a fledgling bookstore.  When American film megastar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) comes in to browse for books about Turkey, the two sense a mutual attraction and begin a delicate love affair that threatens both their complicated lives.  The crux of &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is this : can two exact opposites in the complex world of publicity and disposable relationships stay together forever? Screenwriter Richard Curtis&apos;s (&quot;Four Weddings And A Funeral&quot;) goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we&apos;ve come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant.  It&apos;s a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead&apos;s past public lives.  He creates two compelling characters in Anna and Garrett.  They both have very convincing motives for the courtship, it isn&apos;t just a roll in the hay and then the aftermath like most films.  Director Roger Michell keeps the flow nice and the two leads make good on their promise for charm and beauty. I&apos;m a little irritated that so many would consider this a big step for Julia Roberts in the acting department.  She already gave a commanding performance in last year&apos;s &quot;Stepmom&quot;.  With &quot;Hill&quot;, Roberts continues her impressive growth spurt into real adult acting and role choices.  Her work with Grant here is the most easy going I&apos;ve even seen her do(Maybe one too many close-ups of that smile though...).  Hugh Grant does his stammering best to make William seem lovable.  I&apos;m not a fan of Mr. Grant, but I will easily concede that this is his best performance to date.  Rhys Ifans is disgusting (a good thing) as Spike, William&apos;s flatmate.  He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings.  If anyone ever needs an actor to represent an English skuzzball, they should call this guy. If the charming &quot;Notting Hill&quot; suffers from anything it might be the &quot;She&apos;s All That&quot; syndrome.  Whenever you get the relationship ball rolling, it seems in everyone of these movies we need a forced situation to break up the two leads, just so we can cheer when they reconcile.  That&apos;s fine, no complaints.  In &quot;Hill&quot;, this syndrome is put to the extreme test.  We follow this romance through, I believe, at least three breakups.  That&apos;s too many for a two hour film.  We never get sure footing on to why these two should be together and that is a frustrating element.  Director Michell tries to hold onto the reins, but the climax of the film is forced and seriously uncharacteristic of the movie. &quot;Notting Hill&quot; has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts&apos;s character embraces her superstardom or is oppressed by it.  Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within the fishbowl. When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna before meeting her, yet that subject seems too taboo for the film. What we get is just puppy love, no strings.\n\n&quot;Notting Hill&quot; is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. It&apos;s a concoction that&apos;s hard to resist.  You&apos;ll come out of it with a warm fuzzy feeling in the tips of your toes.  It&apos;s nice to have a film that just wants to please, I just wish they didn&apos;t lay such a heavy topic wet blanket over the proceedings. --------------- 8"

      "reviewBody": "John Akomfrah&apos;s extraordinary film &quot;The Nine Muses&quot; isn&apos;t so much a documentary as a visual essay on the theme of immigration from the West Indies to the UK in the 1960&apos;s as it alternates between a forbidding Alaska, (for purely visual reasons, I&apos;m sure) and a winterly Britain, both past and present. It looks amazing although the highfalutin narration, taken from everything from the Greek Myths to Shakespeare to James Joyce, and which gives the film its title, may put some people off.\n\nWhile not in anyway similar it reminded me very much of the films of Andrew Kotting and of &quot;Sleep Furiously&quot;. There&apos;s something a little precious about the cross-cutting between the images of a totally inhospitable Alaska and an unwelcoming and grimly bleak UK as the black immigrants pile off the ships for a life lived out in steel mills and sweat shops. It isn&apos;t necessarily a film to draw you in; you are kept at a discreet distance. This is an art-house exploration of the immigrant experience that most people will fail to identify with; a video installation, more at home in a gallery than in a cinema. That said, once you find yourself set down in front of it, it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Documentary films may be many things but few are as much a work of art as this one is.",

      "reviewBody": "...it&apos;s just that Americans are so used to these cookie-cutter mainstream slasher, CGI-Alien invasion and &quot;psychological&quot; new horror movies.  It&apos;s a movie about giant freakin&apos; mosquitos, did you expect it to be a blockbuster hit?  It&apos;s about a UFO that lands in a park in Colorado and the aliens get bit by some mosquitos in the forest.  The alien blood makes them grow to the size of a small dog and they begin wreaking havoc on the park and it&apos;s workers.  The only complaint and the movie&apos;s one HUGE weakness that makes it seem bad is the ACTING.  Good god, i&apos;ve never seen acting this bad, not even in the voices in a dubbed movie.  It&apos;s like the actors are shooting for fun and they won&apos;t take their roles seriously.  Once you watch it for about a half an hour, you&apos;ll get used to it though, and it even seems better after a while.  The special effects, while they may not be Alien Resurrection-caliber, are still okay for the budget that the crew probably had.  There&apos;s a lot of stop-motion photography with the flying mosquitos, but each one is hand-crafted and in my opinion, looks a whole hell of a lot better than this new CGI crap nowadays.  One part was so over the top that I&apos;m surprised nobody mentioned it.  A giant mosquito impales Junior (redneck character) through the chest and begins sucking his blood.  Junior&apos;s face begins to shrivel, snot starts to gush from his nostrils, then his eyes, twice as large as they were before the camera panned away and resembling softballs, pop out of their sockets a few inches, and then explode. What?!? Anyway, this was an extremely funny, ridiculously bad-acted, and blood-drenched sci-fi mutant bug epic.  If you liked this, then I would recommend a few others that rivaled Mosquito in acting, special effects, and violence.  These are Slugs, Ticks, and The Nest, being probably the nastiest and scariest killer bug flick I&apos;ve ever seen."

      "reviewBody": "A young English man named Brian(Michael York, in a character based on Christopher Isherwood&apos;s experiences) develops a relationship with a reckless young American girl named Sally(Liza Minnelli at a wonderful performance to the edge of tragedy) in Berlin during the 30s in which Hitler is rising to power and racism, anti-Semitism and determinedly amoral behavior are growing. They&apos;re both then seduced by a German rich aristocrat named Max(Helmut Griem). Meanwhile Brian works as English teacher for an elegant young Jewish(Marisa Berenson) and his friend Fritz Wendel(Fritz Wippel), both of whom falling in love. All the roles are linked by the Kit-Kat club where perform Sally and an androgynous master of ceremonies(Joel Grey , he deservedly won Oscar to best support cast).\n\nIt&apos;s a magnificent musical-drama well set on Germany where are increasing horrors of Nazism taking place on its grim moments. Atmospheric nostalgia piece from the stories of Christopher Isherwood and successfully creating a portrait of a nation falling into moral decay. It&apos;s one of the most perfect examples of accurate timing over a sustained period ever put on cinema. This dynamic film packs excellent musical numbers full of aggression, fire and turn out to be unmissable experience. Liza Minnelli, Michael York and Joel Grey give the acting of their lives. Glamorous and evocative cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth . Based on the John Kander&apos;s hit Broadway musical and soundtrack by Ralph Burns full of classic songs. This story was formerly brought to life by Henry Cornelius (1959) with Laurence Harvey(Brian role) and Julie Harris(Sally role) in a good drama no musicalized.\n\n¨Cabaret¨ is an impressive picture splendidly directed by Bob Fosse(1927-1987) and winning three Oscars. Fosse was a director, actor, choreographer and dancer. He choreographed : ¨My sister Eileen, The Pijama game, Damn Yankees¨ and directed another films with awesome musical sequences such as ¨Sweet charity and All that jazz¨.",

      "reviewBody": "Good Iberian Western well realized by the best Paella Western director , Joaquin Romero Marchent . A farmer family is attacked by a duo of outlaws (Luis Induni, José Luis Martin) and it results in father&apos;s murder . Later on , the mother (Gloria Milland) teaches his three children to carry out a relentless revenge . Once grown-up the three unequal brothers (Richard Harrison , Robert Hundar , Miguel Palenzuela) seek revenge for the murder of their father . Each of them goes on divergent paths , Richard Harrison becomes an enforcement at law , Robert Hundar turns into a gunslinger and Miguel Palenzuela as a good family father . They follow different ways while seeking out vendetta for their dad&apos;s killing .\n\nEnjoyable Chorizo-Spaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation ; it doesn&apos;t follow the Sergio Leone wake and being proceeded in American style . This interesting Iberian western contains a story full of vengeance , good dramatic pace and slick direction . This one has a historical interest , being the first shot in Almeria , subsequently there was filmed a lot of Westerns during the 60s and early 70s . This is a classical western before Leone&apos;s style , it is an ordinary example of American western though it is partly Spanish and partly Italian . Interesting screenplay by director Joaquin Marchent himself and his brother Rafael Marchent who usually collaborated each other , it results to be a thrilling as well as very sad western with great fatalism . The film packs action , shootouts , drama , good feeling , high body-count , it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining . It&apos;s an intelligent western with spectacular outdoors and breathtaking confrontation among protagonists , three different brothers : Richard Harrison , Robert Hundar and Miguel Palenzuela against the heartless enemies such as Jose Truchado , Luis Induni , Aldo Sambrell , and of course , the ordinary nasty Jose Luis Martin . Acceptable action sequences with spectacularly exciting shootouts along with rodeos and round-up . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . The notorious American Spaghetti actor Richard Harrison is fine in his usual tough role , and Robert Hundar -pseudonym of Claudio Undari a Sicilian actor specialized in western films- is magnificent as his violent brother . Fantastic performance by the always great Fernando Sancho in a likable role , subsequently he would play similar characters , furthermore the slimy, menacing outlaw played by Aldo Sambrell , here in his ordinary role as a bandit and in a cruelly baddie character . There appears as secondaries the habitual in Spanish/Italian Western , such as : Francisco Sanz , Rufino Inglés , Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González , Luis Induni , Rafael Vaquero , Emilio Rodriguez , Alfonso Rojas , Jose Riesgo and many others . Furthermore , Carlos Romero Marchent who always appears as a young secondary in films of his brothers Joaquin and Rafael Romero Marchent . The musician Riz Ortalani composes a nice soundtrack , well conducted , this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie; as it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background and with agreeable leitmotif . Very nice cinematography , though being necessary a perfect remastering , filmed by cameraman Rafael Pacheco on locations in Tabernas and desert of Almeria , as usual ; including good sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia who carried out the most Production Design on Westerns shot in Spain .\n\nThe movie titled &quot;Three Ruthless Ones¨ or ¨Gunfight at High Noon&quot; or &quot;Sons of Vengeance&quot; or ¨3 Implacables¨ was well produced by Centauro Films/Joaquin Marchent and PEA/Alberto Grimaldi , previously to produce his successful trilogy of dollars/Sergio Leone . The motion picture was professionally directed and in traditional style by recently deceased Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent (1921-2012) at his best . He was an expert writer and director of good Western . His first film was ¨El Coyote¨ and the sequel titled ¨Revenge of Coyote¨ shot in Mexico . After that , he filmed ¨The shadow of Zorro¨ and ¨Revenge of Zorro¨. He went go directing Western as ¨ Riding to death ¨ , ¨Adventures in the West¨ , ¨Three good men¨, ¨Sabor Venganza ¨ and the most popular and violent ¨Condenados a Vivir¨ . Plus , he wrote for his brother Rafael Romero the followings Western : ¨Manos Torpes¨, ¨Ocaso un Pistolero¨ and ¨Garringo¨ . Rating : Above average , a nice Tortilla Western that has its entertaining moments.",

Threats of torture? Kidnapping? But they were just wasted. They looked like they couldn&apos;t believe they had been forced to do such awful drivel.\n\nWhat killed it was the story. The original was a wonderful novel. It has been done quite well at least three times before, with Gregory Peck, Patrick Stewart or Jack Aranson as Ahab. Orson Welles made a short of it. A new version is coming out with William Hurt as Ahab, and I look forward to it. Even if the script had been decent, I think Barry Bostwick would have been out of his league playing Ahab.\n\nThe special effects aren&apos;t that bad, but it takes so little to do that these days. What was AWFUL was how they used them. The whale looks to be the size of an island, simply bigger than any animal has ever been found to be.\n\nI could go on and on and on. The only pleasure from it was like that of watching an airplane about to crash. You know it&apos;s a disaster in progress and it will be famously horrible.",

And while Higgins is no Sherlock Holmes, this is not supposed to be any Holmes either ... there are elements of Giallo I reckon in this ... with the fake red blood and the killings ... and the story quite frankly. A nice little movie and throwback ... when criminals coorparated after you apprehended them ... for no good reason at all....",

The film faired poorly at the box-office, but seemed to have received generally positive reviews. The best element of this film is the atmosphere, which truly resembles the time period in which the film takes place. The story of the romance between the two writers is interesting on its own, but the great acting gives it a boost. Overall, a highly worthwhile film that will come as a pleasant surprise. The 6.3 rating is too low. I would say it deserves at the very least a 7. Ill give it an 8.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is about a young man who has to drop out of vet school after his parents&apos; sudden death. He joins a circus by chance, and his life is never the same again.\n\nCircuses have become increasingly ignored and irrelevant in modern day lives, as the number of options for entertainment exponentially increases. A romance set in a circus setting may not exactly appeal to the public, and hence I had doubts about &quot;Water for Elephants&quot;. It turns out to be a good film, it is quiet and subtle, and yet enchanting throughout. I particularly like the ending black and white shots, they remind me so much of the feel in &quot;The Notebook&quot;. These every day snapshot scenes are simple, and yet effective and touching. The only one complaint I have is that the plot is predictable. Robert and Reese are hugging on the poster, which already gives the whole plot away."

The songs ,in English (&quot;who are you&quot; ) sung by a Dutch band ,Wallace Collection ,would nicely fit in a commercial for Martini.The critical reception was so disagreeable in France at the time (&quot;a film made of brics,bracs and thingummies&quot;) that Keigel was not to made another movie before 1977.And it was his last one.",

Billie Ross (Polly Shannon) is a female detective trainee who Gannon is assigned to show the ropes to. Other cops are after him after he goes to the feds and rolls over on his fellow boys in blue. One of my friends in the UK sent this to me saying that he liked it and he think I would too. Plus he knows I like seeing movies before they&apos;re released in the states. What I saw was a fairly standard cop action drama flick. But a better than average as far as Dolph Lungren is concerned. Not a surprise that it went straight to video in the least, as it adds nothing new to the genre at all and the whole film is strictly routine.\n\nMy Grade: C-",
