I&apos;m tall (5&apos;10&quot;) and this coat has lovely long sleeves and the length hits at low hip. I had tried on the Patagonia Nano Puff but it wasn&apos;t as long as this jacket. The sleeves have additional thumb loop covers that can be tucked away when not needed. The collar has a soft fleecy lining which is very cosy feeling. The jacket feels well made and is comfortably warm down to 0C. Two easy zippered pockets keep my phone, keys, and dog poo bags from falling out. There&apos;s also a zippered inside pocket which is handy. All in all, I&apos;m very pleased. I did also try the Powder Lite jacket from Columbia but felt this jacket had a slight edge as far as length, features, and quality.",

These seem like they have the same quality construction with fully adjustable mounting hardware to fit any bike rack. The internal zipper pocket keeps things organized and the outer pocket provides easy access to a lock, lights, etc. The detachable shoulder strap provides convenient portability off the bike.",

We brought the panniers on the boat. We were stuck out for hours in torrential downpour. Everything stayed completely dry, bags exceeded my expectations for them. Ortliebs mounting system is a breeze to use with all our racks. This made me an Ortlieb customer for life! Also, Backcountry had the best deal on these and shipped quickly! I had to call because of an error I made with my card and the rep I spoke with was awesome and super helpful.",

Spouse used the 90 L wheeled duffle in the Transporter line and one of the Transporter Global carry on. Turned out this was a winning combination for one person. So much so, we are buying the exact same combo for me for this year&apos;s trip to Iceland. Iceland Air has small carry on restrictions and this seems to be the ideal carry on that has backpack, handle, and carry strap for a multi-option choice and it can easily be slid onto the 90L for the ultimate wheeled experience. Loved the material as we worry about things getting wet on boats or wet climates. True, as others have said, it can look a bit beat up after the first few uses but it is very sturdy. Loved all the features for the Global...lots of storage options and works well with or without packing cubes.",

        "reviewBody": "Not much to say on this one. It fits, it is comfortable, it gets the job done. Nothing special about it but hey its a helmet. It has a solid safety rating, it uses recent construction tech, and its comfortable on long rides. I would recommend this to friends without a problem.\n\nOne comment on size. I have a small head and thus helmets are always a problem when it comes to fit. I would say this runs true to size. What is nice about Bell is that they overlap their sizes well which gives you two options if you are right on the line like me. I went down to the smaller size and open the adjustment almost all the way. I found this more comfortable than going larger and tightening it up most of the way.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought a terraframe 50 last summer to use as a backpacking pack, and I liked it so much I bought another for work this spring. I love the guidelite mt frame, it’s incredibly comfortable and versatile. I’ve removed the bag and just used the frame to pack fence posts. The three zip design is the best pack set up i’ve ever used, incredibly easy to get into quickly. The big water bottle holders and side strap are great for holding tools, and the daisy chain on the back is useful to lash things to. I have both bags set up with a stick it plus, water bottle holder, bear spray holder, and a large forager pouch. I also have a hunting lid I use when backpacking.\r\n\r\nWhile the pack is nearly perfect, there are still some improvements that could be made. The biggest thing is how the top of the bag attaches to the frame. It comes with buckles that clip it to the frame, but they are too long and the top of the bag will sink down. I used paracord to hold the top of the bag up, which keeps the top pouch accessible. I would also love to see a slightly larger 3 zip bag, and one that uses a more durable material like 1000d cordura.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this bag, and more broadly the guidelite frame to anyone looking for a serious pack.",

Rifle fit fine in the side pocket, a drop pocket option for rifle would be nice so it doesn&apos;t ride so high. Just need to be cognizant of size of gear you want to bring if hunting big game.

With that in mind...\r\nBecause of my unique role, purchased the Terraframe hoping it would cross worlds really well. I am out-of-my-mind happy with this pack. First of all - just like listed on site, demo&apos;d in videos, etc., this pack has insane space inside as well as build-out options on the exterior. For my needs, I can deploy the shelf and store a plate carrier whether going on a ruck, establishing FOP, etc. It&apos;s excellent. Cinching down on the straps keeps the weight near the frame and doesn&apos;t hinder pack storage at all.\r\nHere&apos;s the insane part: I can even stash the assault pack inside the Terraframe with plenty of space leftover. For example, I&apos;m rockin&apos; a K19 with a proprietary assault pack that attaches to the carrier itself. So I can haul the plate carrier, assault pack, and all necessary gear in the Terraframe - and do so comfortably! - and then when ready, deploy the shelf, grab the assault pack, and I&apos;m ready to go.\r\nCan&apos;t say enough good stuff about this pack!",

Daily loads range from 20-60 lbs and the frame + yoke could easily handle more. The pack material is tough and holds up to sharp tools and grease as well as near constant rain and mud. The zippers, straps, and buckles all have held up beautifully. I&apos;ve used the overload shelf to haul grip-hoists, wire rope, stone drills, and splitting gear without issue. This is a great pack and is overbuilt in every way.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this pack a little over a year ago and immediately started putting it to the test with rucking, backpacking, and hunting. Overall, I really like this pack, but some design features are just killing me. \r\n\r\nThe water bottle pockets are good quality, but basically unreachable while hiking. They could be about 1.5x the size as well, seeing as this is the only outer storage option for this pack. \r\n\r\nThe upper clip holding the pack to the frame is so frustrating. The fact that every clip around the pack is your standard buckle-clip, and this one is a special &quot;push&quot; clip makes no sense. Every. single. time. I&apos;m loading weight on my frame, it is such a pain to clip in without unclipping it along the way due to the awkward placement. A standard clip here would be much better. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I scored this pack during a sale which made it at least $100 cheaper than any hunting pack in the same size. Great quality, holds weight pretty well, and keeps moderately dry in wet weather (PNW). I&apos;ve carried it for several multi-day trips and it&apos;s been good the entire time.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this pack several weeks ago in advance of a trip to hike, camp and fly fish Hazel Creek in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The pack provided plenty of room for the four night trip with a trail weight of about 40 pounds.  The external frame and &quot;load sling&quot; make it easy to haul ackwardly shapped or heavy items that would not otherwise fit in a traditional top-loading or roll-top backpack.  I found it to be a very comfortable pack, although a tad on the heavy side (5 pounds total)  for those considering an AT through hike or other extended trip. Mystery Ranch is known for its quality and the construction of this pack is top-notch:  330 Condura Lite Plus with a Carbon Fiber frame.  The pack has three zippers--two diagonal and one vertical.  This makes it easy to open up the entire pack or to simply stuff gear in through the top.  There is a hydration pocket inside and the pack features two top lid pockets that close with high quality zippers.  There are also two open side pockets for tent poles, water bottles, etc.  Numerous, extra-long  external compression straps make it easy to carry your tent body or sleeping pad,  Sevaral webbing loops and MOLLE loops provide additional flexibility for lashing additional gear (like fly rods) to the pack.  \r\n\r\nThe pack features an adjustable length frame system.  I found that I did not properly adjust the height of the shoulder pads relative to my torso length, but made sure to do so before returning.  A velcro backed yoke makes the adjustment quite easy.  The frame itself is flat and it seems to flex dynamically as you move on the trail.  It has a wide, stiff hip belt that locks securly but comfortably over the hips.",

I picked up a pair of Stance 96 skis - 2023 (182), S/PRO MV 100 boots, Strive 12 Gripwalk bindings and Arctic S3 poles.  I took them out the first time, on what ended up being very icy conditions.  The equipment performed great and I was very pleased.  A few weeks later I was skiing Jackson Hole.  Skied all over the mountain taking on a variety of difficulties.  No equipment issues.  Then, on what turned out to be my last run of the day, I fell.  Both skis came off.  The brake on my right ski engaged, the brake on my left ski did not.  The last I saw my left ski, it was racing down &quot;Sundance&quot;.  I ended up walking down the rest of the run looking for my ski, but never found it.  I understand that sometimes these things happen, but I&apos;m very disappointed that it happened on just my second day of use.  Now I am back to renting for the remainder of the season.  I will buy another set for next year, just not sure what brand I&apos;m going to go with.",

        "reviewBody": "Never owned a Crank Bros pedal set before. Shimano SPD always. \nMany pedal brands have been in short supply since 2020,  or if available, priced to unaffordable.\nI have always been weary of trying C.B  Pedals.  Many people dislike non adjustable clip-less pedals and I was part of this group.   I needed new pedals and every model I wanted was &quot;back ordered&quot;  or way overpriced.\nI took a chance and bought these Dbl Shot 3 pedals.  Lots of &quot;pro&quot; reviews rating less than positive but I like the look of them and the fact that the model has been evolving. C.B. Is not correcting mistakes with each upgrade, they are taking input and making them fit more riders needs  No pedal is perfect for every person, I took this into consideration and made the order.\nI have only had them a day and I can say without pause they are equal at least to the best pedals I have used in 40 years.  They have a tight spin, meaning you can&apos;t spin them a dozen times with your hand.  They stay in the position you took your foot off on.  I love this about them.  Perhaps they will loosen a bit over time but I hope they don&apos;t.\nThe platform is so nice. The length is ideal, most pedals I have used are same dimension side to side/front to back. The platform provides incredible grip and security, better than I have ever felt. No fiddling needed,  anti-seize the threads, put them on and ride.  \nThe subject of clip-less is very individualized.  I am not a big fan being a full suspension rider but use them in different situations, climbing, etc.  I ride platform 90% of the time but like clip options.  All my pedals have been dual, I find it easy to switch mid pedal, no problem.\nThe CB clip design surprised me. Easy to clip in from 1st try.  After riding all day I have zero issue with clipping in. Releasing is not easy but the pedals and clips are new.  I can switch to easy release / less degree clips later If bothered by them long term.  Setup is quick, shoe worked perfect with provided clips 1st install.  \nNice looking, perfect pedal bearings with no wild free spinning, great platforms, light weight, adjustable by clip change, spacing for my size 11 wide shoe is ideal, no crank rub clipped in.\nIf the price is anywhere close to some other brand you are considering, I would get these.\nLong term this review is not, but one day of riding 40 miles in them I am a big fan.\nI ride 1000&apos;s of miles a year, this is just day one,  but I would bet these pedals will last me years.\n5 star short term,  4 star due to leaving room for long term aspect",

        "reviewBody": "First off these fit very slim. Luckily the fit is very athletic but pay attention to the size chart. If you are on the border, go up a size. The liner has a low profile waist band so if you are a little bigger in the hips you know this isn&apos;t the most comfortable for undergarments. The liner is nice too, doesn&apos;t feel that awkward. But I am a huge fan of the light weight of the shorts and how flexible they are.",

I am normally biking with my kids and like to have easy access to it to snap a photo or check trail forks. I haven&apos;t been out with them on the bike yet, but the pocket fit my phone and seemed easy to get to!\n\nSizing... I typically wear a size 4 or 6 pant/short or a Size Small. I was struggling to get a grasp on sizing based on reviews so I ordered and 4 and 6. The 6 fit way better, especially with a chamois. The 4 was a but snug around the hips and thighs. I would say it probably runs pretty true to size given that I wear a 4 or 6. But I would err on the side of caution and order your larger size if you also wear two differnt sizes.",

        "reviewBody": "I saw these shorts and decided to take a chance on them.    I read the other reviewers&apos; reviews to get an idea on sizing.    I was between sizes on the Wild Rye Size Chart.    I am 5&apos; 100lbs.     I ordered both the 2 and the 4.      When  I tried them on,  the Size 2 fit me much better than the 4 which was too big everywhere.     I have and use both compression and baggy shorts when I mountain bike.   I usually do not look great in the baggy look.   I am petite and tend to look overwhelmed or lost in them.    When I tried these on,   I was quite pleasantly surprised.    They actually looked good on me.   I think it is because they have a different profile or outline to them from most of the baggy mountain bike shorts  out there which I think are designed for men .    They are not that wide in the  thighs and quads, but then flare out  a little around the knee.  The nearest thing I can liken  them to is  a capri/knicker  bell-bottom or flare pant.   Additionally,  the length of these shorts  in the size 2 was just right for me even though I am short. It hit at the knee.   Most of these baggy shorts are usually way too long on me.     The material is four way stretch,  an improvement over most other mountain bike shorts which are only two way stretch.   There is no adjustment for the waist either on the outside or the inside of these shorts.   So,  they either will fit you or they won&apos;t.    Fortunately for me, they fit.    I usually take anywhere from  a size 2 to a size 6 in  most pants/shorts, so ending up with the Size 2 is in the ballpark.",

They are very stretchy and as other reviewer said they stretch out. 6 would still have worked and 4 a little tight at first but  they stretch out (I am 5&apos;8&quot; 139 more broad shoulders and slimmer thighs if that helps anyone).",

        "reviewBody": "Purchased swirl dot (blue) in size 6. For reference, I&apos;m size 4 petite women&apos;s workwear (e.g. Loft), size small North Face shorts, size 4 Marmot hiking pants, so I figured 6 would be nice and comfy. I was wrong. Material was great, but shorts were tight everywhere you&apos;d want space while mountain biking (hips, thighs). I don&apos;t like wearing long shorts, but I took a shot on these just to give them a try - took this as a sign that I should stick to my mid-length shorts for casual riding and regular cycling shorts for more active riding pursuits. Called number with return question and had someone on the phone in less than a minute (pretty unheard of in my customer service experience). Thanks to Ryan for making return process easy and for Backcountry for making shipping and returns process/policy (and charges) transparent on their site.",

        "reviewBody": "The jacket is very well made and warm, but it is a little tight at the bottom. I ordered a small as a 5’9” 170lbs man and the top part fits perfectly the bottom goes to about mid thigh and is a bit tight. I can’t fit my pistol in an owb holster and zip it.  If you’re using it for that I’d order a size up but it may be a bit big up top then. There is a multitude of pockets and they are well sized and most have zippers so I would definitely recommend it; I just wish they had a size exchange. It should be fine if you’re unarmed or carry appendix. Just know due to the length you cant slide it up to draw either",

No complaints on the overall weather resistance to it, as I bought it for daily use in the interior of Alaska Winters. \nThe arms deviate from the woman’s design and has down padded insulation  and are a little loose for my taste. I usually need to have a bulkier jacket to fight the chill when wearing it , opposed to my other winter jackets. \nI’m more of an athletic build so the solution could be buying a Small opposed to medium. \nOverall, great jacket.",

Arm length perfect. Torso great. The only issue is at the neck line. Fully zipped the darn thing is almost choking me! I put up the hood and that relieves the pressure and feels great. But who wears their hood all of the time?  Coat is warm and all that. If I had tried them both, the XL and the L, on in a brick and mortar store I likely would have purchased neither...",

        "reviewBody": "I just returned from reporting on a blizzard in the Sierras for a national television network. I spent most of five days outside in blowing snow in the low 20s (Fahrenheit). This jacket is incredibly comfortable. I was warm and dry the entire time with just a midweight wool layer underneath. The hand pockets are lined with soft fleece material and are perfectly placed (not too high, not too low) for all-day ungloved comfort. The utility of the rest of the pockets on the jacket is awesome. Lots of secure, dry storage space. If I had one complaint it&apos;s that the zipper is sometimes challenging to engage at the beginning...like it&apos;s a little undersized for winter conditions. But once you&apos;ve got it on it&apos;s like being indoors when you&apos;re outdoors. I&apos;m 5&apos;10&quot;, 195lbs and the Large fits perfectly.",

I&apos;m a big fan of the pocket options as this jacket provides the most/best options of any other jacket I&apos;ve ever tried. The only reason for the 4/5 stars is that the sizing is way way off. I haven&apos;t worn smaller than an XL in 12 years but this jacket in XL was comically large. In fact, the L is almost too big as well, but I&apos;m keeping it in case I need to layer on bulky clothes underneath. If you can find the right size, then this jacket seems is a great choice.",

The way it works is as follows:\nYRDAYXXXX#\nYR –Year of Manufacture\n08 –2008\n09 –2009\n10 –2010\n11 –2011\n12 – 2012 etc…\n\nDAY –The day of the year on which the product was marked\n004 –would be the 4th of January\n032 –would be the 1st of February\n344 –would be the 10th of December\n\nXXXX –Individual serial number\n0001 –would be the first component marked on that day\n0050 –would be the fiftieth component marked during the day\n\n# – The machine with which the component was serialized\nA = Rotary Laser Marker\nB or M = Max Box Laser Marker\nC = Dot Marker\n\nExample: 081001450A\nYr 2008 – Day 100 – Serial Number 1450 – Machine A",

This review is more about backcountry as a whole than it is about the product (though, not entirely). \n\nFirst thing I did was an inspection of the plate and I noticed the manufacturing date was from 2007!!!!\n\nDMM states that their metal products have no lifespan for obsolescence (good forever from the date of manufacturing). \n\nHowever, I still find it odd that the bat plate I received from backcountry is 14 years old (that&apos;s some OLD inventory). Just something to consider for those buying any climbing products.",

          "Wow! A valid concern that needs to be addressed by backcountry with transparency.  Recently ordered some Beal dynaloops and received inventory from 2019!  For soft goods valid concern that on some things you&apos;re receiving with 1/2 of their recommended lifespan from manufacture date up or more (some petzl gear that&apos;s the entire lifespan)!  It would be nice to let us know that we would be receiving inventory with &quot;xxxx-xxx&quot; date of manufacture range."

        "reviewBody": "I bought a pair of the Washburn 42&apos;s in May 2023 after the rep in the chat recommended them. I had just bought a new bike whose tires were not tubeless compatible. I currently have 3300 miles on these and the rear is worn pretty well, the front still has some life left in it. The only issue I have had is on the rear tire recently. It got a small hole in it and started leaking, so I added some more sealant and it sealed up. That is when I noticed how worn the tires were and decided it was time to replace them. I&apos;d say that&apos;s pretty darn good life for a tire. I have done road rides, smooth gravel, chunky gravel, singletrack, mud, rain; it&apos;s a do-it-all tire for sure.\nI was going to try some different tires this time around but figured since I had such good luck I would go with the Washburns again.",

I bought it based on other positive reviews, but was unfortunately super disappointed. This coat did not stand up to the cold, and the wind went right through it. My husband’s Patagonia nanopuff was perfect for him, so thankfully, I used the extra sweaters he didn’t need. This coat might be good for fall, but I absolutely would NOT recommend for cold and windy weather. I’d way rather have had a Patagonia or my old bulkier Columbia puffer that I used previously.",

I used them on a 10 day hike in the arctic(fall conditions) and they surpassed all my expectations. They performed well in the dry sand, tundra bogs, through rock and boulder scrambles, driving rain and snow as well as the muddy quicksand. They stayed in place well, the draw cord at the top held fast. The waterproofing was excellent and maintained its breathability. Hanging them or laying them out under the tent&apos;s fly/vestibule allowed any mositure accumulated through the day to be dry by morning. For these type of conditions I would highly recommend them. I would be suspect of the durability to low branches and brambles in the south, but OR has solid options for that.",

Pants are very comfy. \n\nThe bad: These pants are REALLY THIN. They look more or less painted on. You can see the outlines of the pockets and everything inside. I got the khaki color and either I needed to size up more, go with a darker color, or both. I just felt a bit awkward wearing these pants, like I was wearing see-through tights. I also took a star off because the stitching on the side right above the bottom zipper has come out on both sides (i.e. not just bad luck). \n\nSizing: I got a 0 which is my normal size, but by the size chart, I&apos;d be a 2. The fit seemed comfy and good, just fit more like leggings.\n\nIn sum: if they were on sale (given the stitching issue), would try these again in a dark color and sized up.",

It is possible a 4 would have fit better than the 6 (although may have been too tight in calves, for me), or a short?  I am 5&apos;4 for reference and the 4 short in the Quandary pant ending fitting well so kept that one instead.",

They really are like yoga pants, as another reviewer mentioned, except even less restricting and lighter weight/more breathable. I had a hard time trying to decide if I should keep them because they are so comfortable. However, in the end I am returning them because they are so thin and almost skin tight (which is fine for daily wear, but I needed these for work). I love this fabric though and wish I could find a design that was a little more flattering/forgiving for work-friendly attire.",

In fact, the larger size started falling off my hips which required me to adjust the interior drawstring string.  They are extremely durable,  and I appreciate all the pockets, the slim leg style, and the ankle zips.  Just wish I could order the kale green in my (smaller) size.

        "reviewBody": "This is the 2nd in LaSportiva&apos;s effort to come up with a worthy competitor to the venerable Scarpa Drago. The first, the Theory, just seemed to be a hodgepodge of &quot;technologies&quot; that maybe confused prospective users.  The Ondra Pro is a true winner! As someone who is &quot;heavier&quot; that most of you, I have always wanted a soft shoe but always lamented how they would roll off smaller features due to their softness at the perimeter.  Well, the stiff &quot;horseshoe&quot; around the perimeter of the toe of the Ondra Pro DOES INDEED give you just enough support to stay on small features. And VOILA! If you are willing to try a full frontal &quot;Smedge&quot; on one of those small features, you will be shocked at how the combination of very sticky rubber and that &quot;horseshoe&quot; grips and cups the feature; just like Adam Ondra said it would! FWIW: There is an insinuation that maybe you should go up .5 size and that your toes do not need to be scrunched into the toe box. I disagree.  The shape of the toebox will definitely more your leverage towards your first two toes, and the sort of &quot;thin&quot; rubber around your toes does give somewhat, so you&apos;ll break in comfortably. Be advised, these badboys fit like a glove!  They are challenging to get into and ever more challenging to get out of; but in between, they have among the best &quot;perfect&quot; fit of any shoe I&apos;ve ever tried on.  If you are looking for the besta-of-the-besta in a Bouldering shoe, look no further; and if you have found the Drago just a tad bit too soft for smaller features, the stiffer edge &quot;horseshoe&quot; inside the forefoot edge of the Ondra Comp will instill a newfound confidence in your project moves. Highly, HIGHLY recommend. Expensive and worth every penny.",

        "reviewBody": "This is my favorite harness that I&apos;ve ever owned. The reason why is because it&apos;s so light and compact, I never question whether or not I want to have a harness with me. I just toss it in the pack, and it disappears. When I need it, I&apos;ve got it. I love how it can disappear under the hipbelt of a pack. Something that frequently irritates me with other harnesses while climbing and skiing. The packbelt, and harness are fighting for the same space and the pack ends up losing and riding up on my torso. When I&apos;m not wearing a pack with a big belt, this harness has nice, but minimal gear loops that can hold my crevasse rescue, rappel, and other climbing gear (as long as I keep it to a minimum or rack in trees off of my carabiners.)\n\n     For anyone who is considering purchasing this harness but is concerned that it may be too specialized, I would suggest that it&apos;s much more versatile than you might initially think. I&apos;ve used the Choucas Light for alpine routes, rappels while skiing, ice climbing, summer scrambles that get a little too technical, self-evacuation from chairlifts while ski patrolling, and even glacier travel (which was probably its original intent). \n\n*I am an ambassador on the Blue Ice athlete team and received this product to test and use.",

I was very disappointed to find that Patagonia had shortened the zipper, change the access to the thigh pocket from top to the side where it is less secure and less accessible, and shorten the main front pockets so that my cell phone bumps my pelvis with every step and is uncomfortable when seated.   \r\nThese are still good shorts that while  I gave the old version five stars, the new version is enough of a disappointment that I could only rally for three stars.\r\nIt appears to me that it was changed just for change sake because there are certainly not functionally improved",

Wanted long and wondered if the 10 inch length would be enough. Seems to be the same length as Prana 11 inch shorts. As far as size is concerned, they seem to run a little big. This 36 inch waist is bigger than my Faljraven, Outdoor Research, and Black Diamond shorts.  They come in odd sizing so will get the 35 inch next time.",

As with any new boot or shoe, there have been a couple of &quot;hot spots&quot; that I&apos;ve had to figure out, but all in all the boots have worked out. I wear an 8 (39) in most shoes but need an 8.5 in these to accomodate heavier socks.",

The one BIG problem it has is that the ball of the foot is gigantic, I can place my little finger on the side even though the toes are very crammed (but not excessively as I still wanted flexibility for smearing on credit card-like edges in less than vertical terrain); although the foot stays stable enough, is annoying that the foot moves side by side and if I wanted a tighter fit I would went with a more downturned slipper or velcro shoe for easier remove.",

        "reviewBody": "This is a really stiff-toed shoe so it&apos;s really good on vertical climbs with small edges. but since it&apos;s so stiff, it makes smears (especially high feet smears) really sketchy. toe hooks felt really nice but I would have preferred a slightly softer heel to feel them better. I wear size 14 street shoes and got a size 13.5 but I really should have gone half a size smaller; I say this because when my feet start to sweat, my toes wouldn&apos;t stay right at the tip of the shoe. I blame part of that also on the felt that lines the inside of the shoe, it&apos;s comfortable but becomes really slippery when you sweat. The only other complaint would be that on my second session, the tongue of the left shoe fell off; most of the stitches on the tongue weren&apos;t actually connected (this didn&apos;t affect performance but it did look goofy). besides the tongue falling out, the looks of the whole shoe were superb. I got six months before the toe right above the sole rubbed away (mostly due to the smears that I was doing which are not what it&apos;s made for). overall, these shoes are really good for outdoor vertical walls and not for smears (still work, just not as well as a softer shoe). for future shoes, I would like an inside lining that&apos;s more focused on performance instead of comfort and a touch more rubber just above the toe of the shoe.",

When they arrived I was putting them on for the first time and the right shoe&apos;s tongue ripped out as I was pulling on it to put my foot in. The shoes fit fine otherwise, and I figured it was simply a fluke. I returned the first pair and ordered another. And wouldn&apos;t ya know, the exact same thing happened the second time around. It seems odd that an aggressive shoe, which must be pulled very tight, has such weak material in the tongue. Very disappointed.",

        "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s start off with the good news: this shoe is a good fit for people with a wide forefoot and narrow heel looking for an asymmetrical shoe that doesn&apos;t bend the big toe distally. Street shoe size is was spot on for a snug but not uncomfortable fit. I am glad to see companies catering more for the wide forefoot/narrow heel foot shape since most shoes on the market pander to a narrow, Egyptian style foot shape. \nNow to the execution: this shoe utterly fails at being comfortable and supportive on multipitch applications for two reasons. 1. It is not nearly stiff or suppotive enough. The toes turn upwards significantly when standing on an edge. 2. Upward deformation of the toes tensions the slingshot rand, clamping down on the base of the Achilles tendon, causing instant discomfort to those suffering from bursitis.\nIf this shoe were significantly stiffer, used a firmer rubber compound, and used an underfoot active randing tensioning system to resist upward deformation of the toes, it would get 5 stars. However, it is useless and painful for its intended application. There are plenty of great, softer, downturned shoes for overhung climbing. \nBy trying to be good at everything, this shoe ends up bring good at nothing. Look elsewhere for a stiff, cambered edging shoe.",

She can wear it all day without any chafing or interruption to running/ playing. EXTREMELY durable for a very naughty dog. I especially like the handle right on top.",

The 2 elastic loops to presumably hold your trekking poles are so big, their elastic function it’s worthless since they cannot wrap tightly to trekking poles let alone anything else less bulky. It also runs big. On top of that, I can’t return it because Backcountry charges a ridiculous fee of $7.99 to process the return, meaning it makes no sense since I’d be losing money. Do not buy this belt, it’s a waste of money.",

        "reviewBody": "I was skeptical when i bought this that it would actually hold what i wanted it to hold, and still be comfortable while running. Im happy to say that it exceeds expectations in both categories!\n\nWhat did I want it to hold? Good question! I actually got this as a solution to carrying dog stuff (collapsible bowl, 500ml softflask, snack bag of dog treats, a few shitbags and hand sanitizer, gu/energy chews, my phone, headphone case, and keys) and it works like gangbusters to keep things all together and organized in the 4 total pockets. I typically dont fill the flask all the way as it fits better about 3/4, and doesn&apos;t put pressure on the bite valve preventing leaking. \n\nWith it all loaded and situated where it needs to be it really keeps things in place and with the flask in it does have some bounce, but ultimately less than another UD belt ive had. For runs where I dont need the flask in it it pretty much doesnt bounce at all, and again less than an different belt ive used from them. Little loops above the pockets make them easy to find and pull open to get at whatever you need. Ive also used them to clip the dog bowl or a pair of gloves to. Havent used the elastic straps for trekking poles yet but its a nice place to loop a layer through if you need to drop a layer. \n\nCan be worn under or over clothing, i wear it under and havent had any issues chafing wearing it next to skin. Easy machine wash too! Overall really pleased with this, had it out for up to 12 miles fully loaded (w/flask) and think its a great vest alternative for cooler weather or shorter runs.",

The bag was perfect and outperformed my expectations.\r\n\r\nI stayed warm on cold nights and loved the ability to open the gills for added breathability, which was crucial in never feeling too swampy if it was a warm night. I ended up swapping the stock stuff sack for a waterproof compression sack, and it packed down quite small for a 0 degree, fitting well into my panniers and 35L backpack when skiing.\r\n\r\nI&apos;m 5&apos;9&quot; and the regular length fit me well - my pillow tucked very nice and snugly into the hood, so sleeping was always quite comfy and cozy.\r\n\r\nNo complaints, issues, etc. Happy customer here!",

While the Nemo Sonic 0 Degree Sleeping Bag has awesome features and the best draft tube I have ever tested, it still did was not in the top percentile of all the sleeping bags I have tested. Using USDA certified thermometers, it only got up to 79 degrees on the inside of the bag. When compared to Therm-A-Rest Parsec, Feathered Friends Ibis ES and Mountain Hardware Bishop Pass GoreTex, it was well below those bags 82+ degree performances. Budget or expensive, it was just meh in terms of warmth performance. \n\nWith all that being said, the Nemo Sonic 0 Degree Sleeping Bag would most likely work well from 10 degrees up to 40 degrees since it has the venting option. But I would not take it below 10 degrees. Also, if you are 5&apos;11&quot; or above, do not get the regular. I am 6&apos; and it was short for me, causing my feet to be cold at 8 degrees.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this in time for my 4 day solo backcountry hunt. Temperatures were projected to be in the mid teens at night, but a cold snap occurred and dropped down to single digits (Fahrenheit). This bag saved my trip. It was so warm that I was able to sleep in my boxers. I&apos;m 6&apos;2&quot; tall and 230 pounds. The long bag allowed for plenty of space to move freely. My size 14 feet didn&apos;t feel cramped in the toe box. Condensation in the morning was easily brushed off with a towel in the morning and the bag always dried quickly. I don&apos;t think the insulation ever got wet. The baffle cinches with an elastic cord and traps in the heat. The gills did a great job of regulating heat. I think it packs down to a reasonable size with the stuff sack, and I think the stuff sack was well-matched. I don&apos;t believe I could have compressed the bag much more. There&apos;s a pocket near the zipper, just below the face opening. This fit my Iphone 12 mini, but I don&apos;t think it would fit anything much larger.\r\n\r\nI have suggestions for the design in the future. Because of the wallet/phone pocket&apos;s location, in the morning, it was usually covered with condensation. This made trying to open the pocket only slightly more difficult, but was still annoying to deal with the cold and damp. It&apos;s also not accessible unless I were to open the main zipper and let out heat. I&apos;d prefer a pouch, interior to the bag. This way it&apos;s insulated from freezing temperatures. The baffle velcro could be a bit stronger too, or designed to sandwich between flaps for better purchase. But these are very minor issues. What matters most is that the bag is warm, roomy, dry, and of a reasonable weight and pack size. Having this bag has opened up so many more opportunities for cold weather outtings that I cannot wait to explore.",

        "reviewBody": "Used as a quiver of one for ski day trips, short overnights, and technical summer daytrips for a year of heavy use. In general the pack worked ok, but definitely has some flaws. A 40L pack without a decent internal frame is hard to understand. Fully loaded with skis, boots, skins, crampons, ski crampons, rope, rack, helmet, ice axe, etc. the pack carries very poorly. Other flaws include the flapjack cover being non removable and getting in the way when using the brain, bad diagonal ski carry system, weak buckles prone to breaking, bad ice axe carry system, and lots of confusing and unnecessary straps. The pack has lots of unnecessary features while still missing a few important ones. Compared to similar bags it is also quite heavy. Overall a decent bag that is spacious and durable, but carries load poorly and has a poorly thought out feature set.",

I will say I find myself not using the full valume available but I’m stoked I went for the 42 over the 30 because then I need the extra space it’s so nice to just loosen the straps and fit everything I need for long days out on the snow. I can not recommend this pack enough for any situation where bringing gear out for long days in the snow is needed. If your just looking for a pack to take with you on short trips to the snow the 30 will probably be enough for you but if you want a pack which can do it all I’d stick to the 42. The only thing I’d change is I’d have a second retaining strap for the brain retention strap as It would just make the straps a little nicer for when you don’t have much in the pack",

However, we actually frequently use this to carry our photography equipment. The whole back panel can unzip to the base! This gives you great access to larger more fragile equipment. We just place a padded insert in the bag to keep the equipment protected, and love the wide opening. This is obviously meant for getting better access to equipment while putting the snow/water proof material &apos;face&apos; of the bag on the snow, but it&apos;s a versatile function that we love.\nThe straps which allow for A-frame ski carry and snowboard carry is useful for more equipment as long as you are creative! We&apos;ve carried tripods, snowshoes, poles, and more with them.",

Tire fitting aside, the wheels do not disappoint.   The Zipps spin up fast and are fairly stiff.  Thanks to the wide internal width, I’m running only 52 and 56 psi which removes a lot of road chatter.  I switched over from Bontrager Aeolus 37 Pros and for about the same depth (37 v 40), the Zipp wheels feel a faster.",

You have the option to select hubs, and in the product description it gives the total weight of the wheel SET. However, when the box arrived, there was only a rear wheel. This is extremely confusing, especially because the reviews all talk about the &quot;wheels&quot;, not &quot;wheel&quot;. Furthermore, there is no product page for the front wheel, which, if it existed, would have at least made me suspect that I wasn&apos;t going to receive 2 wheels. Alas, this wheel will be returned.",

I needed to wet the tire bead with a little soapy water to help slide it over the rim and I was able to get it mounted without much trouble. Note that there are two drain holes in the rim, you can&apos;t see them in the pics. Those holes were not finished smoothly as they had a some carbon splinters, both rims were like this. SRAM confirmed that two holes is normal. I was able to seat 42 mm tires just using a floor pump, on the first try. No compressor needed. These definitely roll a lot faster than the aluminum WTB ST wheels that came with my bike. And the freehub is not very noisy either. I only have a couple rides so I can&apos;t speak to durability but so far I like the ride.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been riding these wheels for about two months now and I feel that I can provide some insight into how they perform.\n\nInstallation: After receiving the wheels I installed a pair of 28 mm SCHWALBE Pro One Evolution tires. The tires mounted without the need for an air compressor and inflated with a floor pump. Both wheels showed some leakage around the valve stems initially but this quickly sealed when the Stan&apos;s sealant was injected and there were no issues with their holding air subsequently. This is the 5th tubeless installation that I have performed and it was by far the easiest.\n\nPerformance: I was initially skeptical regarding the tire pressures recommended by Zipp for these wheels. For a rider of my weight, around 200 pounds, pressure of 65 psi in the rear and 60 psi in the front are recommended. As it turns out these pressures work very well. The 28 mm tires have taken on a very low and wide profile and dampen vibration and grip well with no squirming suggestive of inadequate inflation. After about 800 miles of riding I have had zero punctures. The freewheel is loud and I like the sound. There have been no issues with the hubs so far. Initially the bearings seemed sluggish, but after a few hundred miles they spin well. The wheels have remained true despite some punishment and appear to have been built well. I am unable to comment on the claims regarding power savings due to the improved compliance but I will say that the wheels feel fast. This is especially noticeable on chipseal roads and broken road surfaces, where there is a sensation of giving up less energy to the road than with other wheels that I have used. The wheels perform well in crosswinds despite their medium depth.\n\nOverall impressions: I think that this is an excellent wheelset and a great choice for the type of long distance riding that I do, where the compliance is very much appreciated. They look great. They are not inexpensive but I think that they are a good value given the quality and should last for many years.",

My initial impression was that they were going to be way too warm on the mountain, especially with the liner glove. But, lo, the first few weeks of the season have had some below-15 temperatures, so these have been perfect for the conditions, even without slipping a handwarmer in the back-of-hand pocket. My hands have been super dry and cozy, and the liner gloves are awesome for getting boots on and the rest of my kit set up while in the parking lot. Warmer days might call for a lighter mitt (or just the liner glove?), but for the icy days I&apos;ve had so far, these mittens are doing their job.",

Unfortunately, even with the inside liner gloves, my fingers get really, really cold while out on dog walks when the temps get below about 30F. They would probably work much better for someone doing active winter sports where you work up some body heat. You know, like snowboarding (which was clearly stated in the description yet I chose to ignore that bit of information).",

I bought this one specifically for a road trip where I was going to be carrying lots of musical gear in my SUVV for a show (Toyota 4Runner). I bought the black color 2-man size so I can cover my load in the back so prying eyes won’t be able to see even through the 5% tint I have in the back. And sure enough, even in direct sunlight, you can see the seats but my equipment was covered in the back and all you see is black. I am not trying to encourage people to leave stuff in their cars. I think people should be responsible with what they keep in their cars. For this review, I just want to say, “Great Product!” Great for camping, road trips, also camouflaging. 🤣. Highly recommend!",

I always have to bundle up when we camp because I get so cold in the Colorado mountains. The first night we used the double at around 11,000’ elevation, I was FINALLY warm! I even woke up and took off a layer because the Rumpl kept us nice and toasty. We ended up replacing our 20* sleeping bags with the Rumpl original puffy plus a thin wool blanket. The two keep us warmer than our sleeping bags alone did. Definitely recommend the Rumpl as a camp staple!",

I tried both the small and the medium because I am often between sizes, and the problem was the same with both sizes.  I wanted to love these pants but I couldn&apos;t get past the bunching, so I sent both sizes back.  Please, MH, fix this issue and I&apos;ll gladly repurchase these.

I live in NW Washington and freeze in any temperature less that 70 degrees, so i was looking for something to keep me warm this winter and these are them 100%. I disagree with all the reviews saying these are high waisted, I would say they’re midwaist, sitting bellow the belly button. I’m 5’9” and 125lbs so i went with the XS Long and they fit perfectly. Im not sure how it would be for the girls over 5’11” though since i didn&apos;t have much extra fabric at the ankle. They even somehow make my butt look good? Which i wasn&apos;t expecting. I think if your unsure size down. Just hoping they keep restocking so i can buy more and maybe add an ‘extra long’ option for my fellow tall girlies who want to keep their entire leg warm lol.",

It is very comfortable over their shoulders and the weight of the pack is not overbearing. The pack is made out of very high quality material. From immediate inspection, you can easily see and feel how well made the pack is made. Adjusting for different girths and lengths is very easy to do. The compartments are intelligently placed and are good sizes. It&apos;s back friendly and I love the hip fins. I am very pleased with this pack.",

This is the most durable, amazing backpack that I&apos;ve ever owned.  I have owned a few backpacks in my day where my fiance and I love to go hiking and camping.  None of them even compare to the Deuter Futura Air Trek.  And what&apos;s even better is that it&apos;s designed for women!!!!!!  \r\nDeuter is an all around amazing brand. If something happens to your pack they promise to repair it free or charge!!  How amazing is that??\r\nThe Future Air Trek SL is so comfortable.  It adjusts to fit any body type and it keeps you well ventilated which is amazing in those hot temperatures.\r\nThe SL version is for women like me who have short backs.  I&apos;m a short bodied woman and this backpack is the perfect size for me!! \r\nYou will never have to worry about packing multiple bags again.  This pack has so many places for storing items that it&apos;s unbelievable.  And everything is perfectly ventilated so that if you have to pack up your wet clothing or anything with moisture in it you won&apos;t have to worry about it ruining because there is plenty of ventilation.  \r\nYou will never have to worry about packing lightly.  You can fit all of your needs into this amazing backpack for a long distance trip and never have to worry about anything else.  If you haven&apos;t purchased this pack you should give it a try.  The price is a little on the expensive side but for good reason!  This company is amazing and so are their products.  My fiance is going to order a backpack for himself soon!!!",

Going by the manufacture website (and measured my foot) of being a wide boot I bought my normal size of 7. They were just too small. I then got an 8. Still too small. Returned for a 9.5. These worked for me. They have kept me warm and secure in all the weather here. Icy conditions are not a problem.",

The fit is very long in the arms and normal/short where it rests on the hips; it is also a little wide at the hips so may not be good for preventing cold from coming in from the bottom of the jacket. Overall, the fit is maybe a little too boxy, and could benefit from having a more natural shape. I am returning for those reasons. \nHowever, the fleece was softer and a more manageable thickness for being active, than some other polyester fleeces that feel scratchy and bulky. You would want to layer this in colder climates.",

        "reviewBody": "I agree with what Nicholas wrote, quoted below; the plates and bowls lose utility due to fact they do not nest in one another. Whether camping, or at home, each plate or bowl takes up space and cannot be stacked into each other. Not even the heaviest dishware I know of has that problem. MSR is one of the most important outdoor gear companies, manufacturing the best stoves, and other gear. Cookwear also the best available. These plates and bowls are great, but, not being able to stack them is a real detractor. I bought three each of a two bowls and plates, am glad I did, but, they take up the space of like 20 full size bowls or plates in my kitchen cabinet. Presumably MSR has considered this and determined that the product is best as is, maybe ? Personally, I vote for nesting/stackable versions, similar to any old school tupperware. \n\n&quot;NicholasVerified Buyer\n1.0 star rating\n08/13/20\nDisappointing that these bowls do not nest\nReview by Nicholas on 13 Aug 2020review stating Disappointing that these bowls do not nestThese bowls seem sturdy enough, however I have no idea why they are not designed to nest. The lack of this feature makes them virtually unusable for backpacking. I had to purchase another set of bowls",

        "reviewBody": "It took three pairs of these shoes to finally find the right fit. Based on my experience, I recommend sizing-up, especially if you are in-between the available sizes.\n\nI have had great luck with other brands, especially Giro, but I wanted to try something new. This is my first pair of shoes with a BOA system and I&apos;m pleased with the results. The build quality, comfort and style are spot-on as well. The price was right as well. I have about 300 miles on them at this point, 10k+ feet of climb... so far, so good.\n\nLong-winded, additional details: As for fit, I generally wear a 43.5 in a regular width for most cycling applications. Upon occasion 43.5 can be ever-so-slightly too big, so I tend to tighten the buckles/straps/laces close to the maximum or simply size down to a 43. The Shimano XC502 shoes barely slipped on to my foot in a 43. Given the impossibly snug fit of the 43, I foolishly ordered the 44 high volume shoe. The HV space was way too loose. Ultimately, sizing-up to the 44 worked. The best aspect of this purchase/return/purchase/return/purchase saga was working with Competitive Cyclist and their &quot;gearheads.&quot; They made the entire process as easy as possible and I appreciate it.",

These fit my hands very well and are generally better than fingerless gloves in cooler temperatures (50-65F; 10-18C).  \n\nI&apos;ve worn them multiple times and find the padding is a bit thin relative to my fingerless gloves but hasn&apos;t caused me discomfort.  A typical ride for me is 75 min, 20miles, mix of flat and cat5 climbs/downhills.  When the temperature drops below 50F/10C, the fabric on the backs of hands is definitely too thin by nature of it&apos;s breathability.",

        "reviewBody": "I was excited to finally replace my older model Dragonfly with the newer Osmo version. But, my excitement waned when I started putting up the fly. 4 stakes on the fly to keep it taught - uugh. I bought a freestanding tent so I didn&apos;t have to spend extra time at camp finding a soft spot for stakes. Or finding rocks for securing guys... If you don&apos;t get the 4 stakes in good places, you just can&apos;t get the fly taught and it flaps loudly in the wind. Also having uneven ground seemed to really tweak the fly layout. I don&apos;t even use vestibules for anything, so it&apos;s particularly maddening. Oh well, the Osmo fabric will be worth it - right. Well, sort of. Because it&apos;s hard to get the fly taught, it was really easy to get water splashing or rain driven under the cut out. So yup, rain in the tent. Osmo didn&apos;t help due to fly staking requirements. I wish I would have skipped this model and just done a trekking pole tent that uses fewer stakes than the dragonfly. Sorry Nemo, this needs to go back to engineering.",

We had a few nights where it rained almost all night, and we were completely dry in the morning. The fly is the best I&apos;ve seen on a tent from NEMO.. some clever little touches that allow it to stay further away from the primary tent structure. It&apos;s also very easy and quick to set-up - intuitive and simple.\r\n \r\nA few other things... We especially liked the reflective string of the fly tie downs that you see with your headlamp. We noticed a lot of other tents and tarps on the trip lacked this feature, but when you&apos;re walking around at night you really notice the difference and feel safer with the NEMO tents.\r\n \r\nMaterials all feel very high end. I really felt like this is one of the nicest tents I&apos;ve used from NEMO - even better than the Kunai which I also own.",

        "reviewBody": "Upon the first use of my tent, I had my initial concerns about the rain fly being too short on the &quot;tall&quot; end of the tent.  I had my tent set up on high ground and we had moderate rain for entire 1st day and had significant puddling of water on top of the tent foot print.  I didn&apos;t notice the puddling water unitl we packed up on the 3rd day.  The rain fly on the &quot;tall&quot; end of the tent needs to extend all the way to the ground like the other 3 sides.  Water ran off the fly, onto the tent wall and down and under the tent and puddled on top of the nemo footprint.  Perhaps using the guy line loop fly on the &quot;tall&quot; end would have helped this issue but a full length fly would most certainly help.  Also nemo needs to add a loop on the &quot;short&quot; end of the tent fly to pull the fly away with another guy line.  Fly was in contact with the tent wall and our sleeping bags were damp at the toe end.  I will say I was very grateful the fabric on the bottom of the tent was very water proof as i only had one small spot where there was a very small amount of seepage in the standing water.  I do like the ease of setup, the compact packed size, the light weight and the roominess of the 3P tent for 2 people.",
