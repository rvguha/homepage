      "reviewBody": "Absolute Power may not be an overly special film but it was the first movie I saw in the cinema after leaving high school. I was certainly not the target audience but it had my attention from the first scene and maintained the suspense for the during of the running time, even if it doesn&apos;t build to much.\n\nClint Eastwood plays Luther Whitney, an expert thief who targets billionaire industrialist Walter Sullivan (grouchy old EG Marshall, in his last theatrical movie) while he is off on vacation. While in the midst of cleaning out the vault the President of the United States (Gene Hackman) enters the room with Sullivan&apos;s wife. Whitney hides in the vault, which has a two-way mirror, and witnesses the President get a little too rough with the woman, which ends in her fighting him off and being murdered by the secret service. The Chief of Staff concocts a plan to cover up the murder not knowing that Whitney is watching the whole thing. As the group leave he escapes, taking a crucial piece of evidence with him.\n\nInitially unsure what to do, Whitney decides to taunt the President, though it&apos;s not clear what his complete plan is or even if he&apos;s just free-forming. If one should fault Absolute Power for any reason it&apos;s that it establishes a lot of plot and potential but never really does anything with it and ends with an anti-climactic cop-out.\n\nWhere it succeeds is with the small cast of characters who really make the dialogue and relationships work. Ed Harris as the confused but dedicated cop investigating the case, Laura Linney as Whitney&apos;s resentful daughter, and the austere Scott Glenn as the self-doubting agent make every scene effortless even when there&apos;s not much happening.\n\nAdapted from (and streamlined and improved in the process) the bloated novel by David Baldacci (I call them &apos;Airport novels&apos; – those 600-page bricks with generic covers featuring nothing but the title and author in giant gold letters in a tacky font) the screenplay makes many changes but they are all for the better. Eastwood&apos;s direction is slow and steady – or &apos;mature&apos;. The pace and framing is the antidote for anyone bored to tears with the nauseating aesthetic of today&apos;s comic-book movies and CGI nightmares.\n\nA curious thing about the beginning of the movie is that Clint Eastwood only has 2 lines of dialogue for the entire 35 minutes. I don&apos;t understand why he didn&apos;t cut them out and remain silent, which would give the film a peculiar edge.",

      "reviewBody": "This is it, kiddies, the Grande Dame of camp classics. The sheer ineptitude of everyone involved is staggering. Mark Robson directs without a trace of nuance or subtlety; Patty Duke and Susan Hayward come off as boozy drag queens; Sharon Tate and Barbara Parkins look and act as if they had taken one downer too many; Dory and Andre Previn&apos;s musical numbers are as funny as those in &quot;The Operetta&quot;--the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode which parodied musical theater; Billy Travilla concocts some of the most glamorously god-awful gowns ever seen; and Kenneth (of Hairstyles by Kenneth, of course) must be personally responsible for the hole in the ozone layer, so lacquered, teased and towering are his creations. But, you know what? IT ALL WORKS. The source material--Jacqueline Susann&apos;s groundbreaking, scandalous novel--begs for sledgehammer direction, overripe acting and eyepopping fashions. Certainly, subtlety was not a hallmark of Jackie&apos;s work. If anything, VOTD should have been even MORE over-the-top. Due to restrictions of the time, the film is sadly devoid of such juicy plotlines as Jennifer&apos;s lesbian affair, Tony&apos;s preference for - ahem - rear-entry intercourse, and Neely walking in on Ted Casablanca&apos;s tryst with another man. What we have, instead, is an endlessly entertaining piece of cinematic trash that is nowhere near as racy as it would like us to believe; and that&apos;s part of its twisted charm. Because it fails on so many levels--as true art, as explicitly sexual titillation, or as a faithful adaptation of a popular book--it&apos;s downright inspiring that it comes together so brilliantly. VOTD&apos;s ultimate triumph is that, despite its incredible waste of talent, time and money, 30 years later, we&apos;re still watching."

I had a terrific time discussing this movie with the director, whom I think has an excellant sense of humor and definitely has his fingers on the pulse of comedy / horror films.  I thought the movie was well shot, particularly with the budgetary limitations he encountered.  The actors were well laid out and had just enough background to make me care about what happened to them.  The movie included some film/story tricks I haven&apos;t seen used so effectively before (such as the slow-motion close ups and the rewind effect at the end of the film - hope I didn&apos;t spoil it for anyone!).\n\n All in all, a great film that should be watched by anyone and everyone who even vaguely likes comedy/horror.  A true classic that will certainly go down in history with other comedy/horror greats, such as Evil Dead 2.  5 stars out of 5!",

CAPTIVE WOMEN is extremely well produced -- excellent production design and visual FX by Hercules standards -- and that&apos;s both its big plus and its big minus. The Retromedia DVD is very, very good -- in 2.35 Cinemascope, nice transfer -- and it&apos;s terrific to see a Hercules film given this kind of loving treatment. BUT -- it does point out some of the shortcomings of CAPTIVE WOMEN. Which are, mainly, that not a helluva lot happens. Herc goes sailing, a buddy goes overboard ... and he winds up in Atlantis, where the Evil Queen (note: Queens are almost always evil, and extremely smokin&apos; hot, in Herc movies) gives him a magic potion designed to make him fall in love with her. Second note: magic potions figure prominently in a LOT of Hercules films, and they&apos;re almost always administered by smokin&apos; hot Evil Queens trying to get Herc to fall in love with them. That&apos;s what we love about these films. Anyhow ... great production values but a bit, well, stiff somehow.",

The story of the character played by Rekha is based on true story, but all the other stories are also very much based on true stories to some extent. Technically the film is great. Scenes to watch out for: Mahima kicking the &apos;baratis&apos; @$$. Madhuri&apos;s (one of her best performances to date) well, her complete part is gripping right from where she&apos;s introduced dancing to Madhubala&apos;s &apos;Jab pyaar kiya to darna kya&apos; to where she cries out her heart for loosing her child. Rekha pleading for help while the villains try to rape her (specially whn she mentions that one of the guy was like his son). There are many many scenes in the film worth an applause. all the actors (including character actors) are amazing. Anil Kapoor is worth mentioning. His character gave a little comic relief in this tragic story along with Jonny Lever.",

I also liked him in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation but those were more dramatic roles.\n\nI loved the way that Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss played off of each other. I don&apos;t want to say too much or I&apos;ll give away what happens between them through the movie but I thought they did a fantastic job at creating comedic moments. The scenes where Bob horned in on Leo&apos;s family moments and right into their home were incredible. I laughed out loud through the entire movie. And it&apos;s a good family movie anyone can enjoy.\n\nTen out of ten from me."

It obviously wasn&apos;t tailored to Danny Kaye&quot;s unique talents, which his earlier comedies were. It&apos;s much too generic. But worse, it&apos;s simply not funny.\n\nAnd since Danny Kaye can be an incredibly funny performer, the fault obviously lies with the weak script, which plays like a throwback to an old Buster Keaton silent movie - without the laughs.\n\nDon&apos;t waste your time. Instead, go watch one of Danny&apos;s classic comedies, like &quot;The Court Jester&quot; or &quot;Wonder Man&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I thought the original sleeper &apos;Screamers (1995) (with Peter Weller) was an agreeable, if unspectacular sci-fi thriller, which at the base had an intriguing story but this cheaper and straight to DVD fare doesn&apos;t do anything out of the ordinary but to stew up the same get-up linked together by a bunch of uninspired ideas and devices. The background of these deadly creations doesn&apos;t pull you in anymore and the throwaway script could&apos;ve done a lot more than the predictable situation we found the story opts for. The sub-standard special effects were reasonably catered for such a production, they weren&apos;t great nor were they terrible. Even with its crisp look, better than expected performances (led by a stern Gina Holden and a small part for Lance Henriksen) and some bloody pulp (with some very vicious attacks). However it did lack a relentless sense of paranoid intensity for any of the thrills to work and made the pace completely haggard. Every now and then I would check the timer on the DVD player and to my surprise it was going to be a drag a real slow viewing. Tell me, you couldn&apos;t see that sudden revelation coming too? As it is, &apos;The Hunting&apos; is a bland b-movie which makes you appreciate the original even more.",

This film is one of the best, perhaps because of the good chemistry between Heesters and his leading lady Lizzy Waldmüller, who&apos;s fate it was to be killed soon after the film was finished during an air raid on Vienna. Definitely not an important film, but an acceptable parlour comedy with beautiful tunes by Peter Kreuder."

Although I think Kurosawa has done better (&apos;Rashomon&apos;, &apos;Ikiru&apos;, &apos;Yojimbo&apos; and of course &apos;Shichinin no Samurai&apos;) &apos;Ran&apos; definitely belongs to his best.",

      "reviewBody": "Just Before Nightfall is another Claude Chabrol film that focuses on infidelity and again it&apos;s an intriguing drama and an excellent exploration of the human condition. The film starts with a murder - but this is clearly not the point of the film as the murder happens right at the start and it&apos;s off-screen; the main focus of this film is the guilt felt by the lead character and the whole film focuses on that and it&apos;s effect on the character as well as all the people in his life. The film is based on a novel by Edouard Atiyah, and the basic plot is rather simple and really serves only as a base for the central focus of the film. The plot focuses on Charles Masson. Charles is having an affair with Laura, the wife of his friend François. The two practises S&amp;M with one another and Charles&apos; life is thrown into turmoil when he accidentally strangles Laura to death. He later learns that Laura&apos;s marriage with François was not the average marriage as both had other partners, but he is still consumed by guilt and it impacts his life with his beautiful wife Hélène and their three children.\n\nAs is always the case with Chabrol&apos;s thrillers, this one is not heavy on action, suspense and tension; but that is more than made up for by the central character study. All the main characters are developed well and believable. The main character, Charles, is certainly the most interesting of the piece; the way that guilt overtakes him provides a different take on the common murderer theme and makes for a very interesting watch. As ever with Chabrol films, the production values are excellent and the performances are superb. The central cast of Michel Bouquet, François Périer and the beautiful Stéphane Audran are all perfectly placed in their roles and provide the film with a strong backbone. The film doesn&apos;t move particularly quickly but Chabrol always keeps things interesting by keeping the focus on the lead characters and the central situation. Overall, Just Before Nightfall is an intriguing and thoughtful film handling the burden of guilt and I would not hesitate to name this film as one of Chabrol&apos;s very best alongside the likes of This Man Must Die, Le Boucher and Wedding in Blood.",

Think about &quot;Batman Begins&quot; but in a less fashion way. \n\nSanto looks badass and even when walking slowly while investigating inside the castle. \n\nHe has now more magic tricks. As if his wrestling techniques weren&apos;t enough! \n\nSure, you can say all you want about the cheese factor but this time it tried to be less obvious. I mean, the direction, cinematography, and f/x were intended to be stylish and that&apos;s always something good.\n\nNot the best Santo effort but it&apos;s a great addition to his great legacy.",

I think the films gore was decent in spots but there just wasn&apos;t enough to excite &quot;gore fans&quot;. in terms of comparing this film with other films released by Brain Damage Films (i have 3 films signed with them), i would say that this film is in their &quot;upper tier&quot; of releases during the past few years. nice effort, keep it up.\n\nLen K",

This film follows the unions decision to pull their workers after Hormel reported a $29 million dollar profit and then asked their workers to take a pay cut and have their benefits reduced. While this film doesn&apos;t reach the same heights as HARLAN COUNTY, there&apos;s no question that this here is still a pretty remarkable documentary in its own right. There&apos;s no question that Kopple knows how to tell a story and more importantly find the passion, fire and energy of a story and exploit it to make sure the message of those individuals get across for the viewers. The documentary was clearly on the side of the workers as this is where we spend the majority of the running time. The first forty-minutes of the film focuses on the pre-strike as we get to know the main people involved and we get a very good idea of the working conditions in America at the time and it&apos;s clear that going on strike is very dangerous for a number of reasons. The final hour of the picture deals with the strike as the workers get dragged along for months and the end results aren&apos;t anywhere close to a happy ending. As someone who has worked for a union I can see both sides of the coin but it really does seem that the majority of the people lost here and that&apos;s a real shame. Kopple does a remarkable job at telling this story and there&apos;s no question that your attention will be glued to the film from start to finish."

      "reviewBody": "To me it&apos;s pretty obvious what this movie tries to attempt. It tries to put together many different story lines, featuring different characters, that all come together pretty fast into the movie. A storytelling technique that later got much better used and done by for instance director Alejandro González Iñárritu.\n\nThe movie is basically being presented as one big adventure movie, in which a whole bunch of characters go on a quest to safe a little boy&apos;s life. Only thing is, this &apos;adventure&apos; is done as a drama. It has a s serious story, which just doesn&apos;t connect to well with the movie its quirky characters and all of the unlikely events happening in this movie. \n\nThe way all of these characters get thrown together in this movie is pretty weak. Basically they have absolutely nothing to do with each other but still for some odd reason they all stay together throughout the entire movie. At times the movie desperately tries to connect all of their stories together and weave them in with each other but it&apos;s all really thin. Everything that seems to happen in this movie seems as a coincidence and the movie is really hanging together from its coincidences.\n\nAnd the characters aren&apos;t much good either really, despite the fact that they are being played by some well known actors. So they basically all have their issues but you just never get to care enough about any of the characters to to care or to feel attached to any of them. Their problems also aren&apos;t too &apos;deep&apos; and the way everything gets resolved is again also hanging together from its coincidences and comes across as some lazy writing. It&apos;s almost as if its writing and its directing don&apos;t connect at all with each other, as if the director had a totally different movie in mind than the writer had, which is strange, considering that both were the same person.\n\nFor most part I still liked watching this movie but toward the end things really got worse, when the movie seemed to run out of ideas and everything just became less and less interesting and more and more of a pointless dragging movie that was heading towards an ending that wasn&apos;t much satisfying either. Once you start thinking about this movie, nothing gets really explained or resolved, so watching this movie is a very unsatisfying experience.\n\nStill the entire idea behind this movie must have been good, not in the least because all of these great actors seemingly showed up for free to appear in this movie. Because it just didn&apos;t seemed as if this movie had an actual budget to work with. It&apos;s also a really cheap looking movie, that has a sort of TV look, or as if it got done by a couple of friends shooting a movie in their weekends.\n\nYou could say that the movie still have plenty of redeeming qualities, that still keep the movie somewhat watchable, such as its acting for instance but overall, in the end this is a very unrewarding movie, that is literally hanging together from its coincidences and some highly unlikely events, which all comes across as some weak and lazy writing.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Why hasn&apos;t anyone become a superhero?&quot;\n\nThat question is at the heart of Matthew Vaughn&apos;s &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, a deconstructionist superhero movie that sees awkward teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) actually don the spandex and venture out onto the rooftops ... who then proceeds to promptly gets his ass kicked on more than one occasion. \n\nBut the question gets away from Vaughn, as the movie introduces a larger narrative and centers on a violent pre-teen girl (Chloe Moretz) who, as the sidekick to the Batman-esque Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), eschews a normal childhood in favor of ACTUALLY kicking ass. \n\nFor the most part, it&apos;s a fun ride. Cage gleefully chews the scenery in his gun-wielding Batman ripoff role (complete with Adam West dialogue impersonation). &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; features more bloody fight scenes than you can shake a stick at, with Moretz doing most of the anatomical damage. And unless you&apos;re Roger Ebert, there&apos;s some deliciously twisted humor to be found in those ass-kickings. And Mark Strong shines as the big bad guy crime boss (unexpectedly hilarious). \n\nThere are moments of adolescent angst, the &quot;hero&quot; actually does get the girl (not really a spoiler, here) and the words, &quot;With no power comes no responsibility&quot; are actually uttered. What better time for this movie&apos;s release than at the height (I hope) of Hollywood&apos;s superhero fetish. \n\n7/10",

The foreshadowing scene at the very start of the film gives a sense of foreboding doom that pervades the rest of the story.  Pam (Ashley Judd) is a woman torn between living on the edge and having a normal, storybook life. Chris (Luke Perry) longs for such a life, but also seems to be excited by Pam&apos;s wild side.  He goes from cop to bank robber in a first successful, but then futile attempt to make things right, which only seems to excite Pam more.  Eventually their luck runs out, and the inevitable ensues.  The last 15 minutes of this film are the best part with some surprising twists right near the end.",

A quick change of pace for the\n\nman.  Showing that he&apos;s not all slapstick and parodies.  Hopefully he\n\ndidn&apos;t give up on his bread and butter animation!\n\nRecommended.\n\nB"

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps I&apos;m mistaken, but I had my expectations set on Confucius the film being a tale of the man himself, one of the greatest and earliest philosophers and thinkers that had vast influence over a number of ideologies today, including the system of ethical governance. The trailer had suggested that besides being a learned man, he&apos;s quite the military strategist as well, like a precursor to Zhuge Liang, which of course is way off the mark as far as I&apos;m concerned.\n\nIt seems like director Hu Mei had been influenced by a number of war films set in Ancient China from Battle of Wits to Red Cliff, and had been inspired to do her own, even if it had to involve Confucius. Good thing though she didn&apos;t put the philosopher, played by Chow Yun- Fat, into a suit of armour, but rather, starts off the narrative focused on his ascension to enviable political positions starting with the Law Ministry, before being Acting Interior Minister for the state of Lu.\n\nA tale of two parts, the first half danced along the narrative tread of political intrigue, with court official envy and being the favourite adviser of the ruler, laying the groundwork for some serious rivalry and treachery to be dished out, especially when a talk of alliance with another state goes awry, if not for a Plan B up in the sleeves to bail them out of trouble. But hold on, was Confucius ever a politician to begin with? I do not know, but it didn&apos;t matter much, as there were glimpses of how his mind ticked, with discussions of ideals and ideas with his disciples being some of the highlights that one would have come to the movie for.\n\nThe second half though, was a let down. Unappreciated and driven away, Confucius starts his self-exile, and together with a small group of dedicated disciples whom we know very little of save for their names and titles appearing on screen, and most given extremely limited screen time, they wander around the film from city to city, and very much echoed the sentiments of the viewer - when will they settle down and get themselves into some serious classroom teaching? It&apos;s a pity that this section of the film decided to focus on how frail and aged Confucius had become with the passing of time, but little more. Pacing seems a little hurried as well, especially when dealing with subplots involving his disciples, with resolution being only a few minutes after.\n\nEven Zhou Xun&apos;s cannot save the show, as she&apos;s given a combined screen time of not more than 15 minutes thereabout to turn on her charm as the consort of a kingdom that Confucius and his disciples pass through. In other words, a flower-vase role that completely underutilized the talents of this wonderful actress. Chow Yun-Fat cuts an imposing figure of Confucius and probably had what it takes in the first section, before the weak storyline in the later half muted his performance as a senior citizen with major issues to address for himself and his disciples, the first being the basic theories of Maslow in getting food and shelter for his followers.\n\nI figured I would have enjoyed a film about Confucius more if it had taken a more in depth look into his character, his inspiration, his influences (that goes just beyond the churning of learned disciples to execute their like-minded philosophies) and of course, having all these done more through the narrative scenes, rather than through inter-titles which tell a lot more than the film itself. I think one is better off digging out Confucius epics of old, than to watch this spruced by version with very fake looking CGI.",

How did Renny Harlin go from something easily watchable and entertaining like this, to The Legend of Hercules? I just don&apos;t get that.

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies which is for karate, tae kwon do, kung fu and kick boxing fans, and of course, practitioners. This low budget martial arts movie, which is, as most of them very simple when it comes to the story, characters, directing and other stuff. There is simply no real complex stuff, no real dilemma between characters and no development. It&apos;s a typical good VS evil story with the haunting past element. A fighter Nick (Michael Bernardo) returns to his good friend Ruben (William Zabka), and upon their reunion they decide to sign in on the underground fighting tournament, held by Mr. Lee (Martin Kove). Nick founds out that the fights are brutal and sometimes to the death. But, Ruben is persistent and wants to fight. So, Nick asks for help from Ruben&apos;s teacher Shingo (Bolo Yeung), to save Ruben&apos;s life. \n\nSo, the movie is actually nothing special. Pretty bad when it comes to some stuff For example, actors can&apos;t act. Well, most of them are martial artists. The real actors are maybe Edward Albert, Richard Eden and Maryam D&apos;Abo (and I still don&apos;t understand how did she get here?). Edward Albert and Richard Eden are not bad actors, but they really appeared in much of the low budget films. Martin Kove is also not a bad actor, but his villain Mr. Lee is just evil and that&apos;s it. He is evil and he looks kind of deadly. Nothing more. Though Kove posses some kind of charisma. Michael Bernardo didn&apos;t do much with his character, he just under played it. William Zabka was not that bad, I think he was decent. Though his character is somewhat irritating. Just wouldn&apos;t listen and he is too prideful. And not in an interesting, complex way he is just a jerk. Zabka did not move from these kind of films, he remained well known for being martial artist on the film, or rather a bully, just like in &quot;Karate Kid&quot;. And for the last I saved Bolo Yeung. What can I say? This man cannot act and he doesn&apos;t have to. This man has such a powerful appearance on the film, such a powerful charisma and character that he simply doesn&apos;t need to act. He played himself basically, but this time he was the good guy. Go, Bolo, go! He is the main man.\n\nThe other things in the movie are nothing special, OK, the most important – fighting scenes. They were good, plausible. Well done filmed. Though, there are some that were ridiculous. And I think that music score is pretty interesting, especially in training montage. I recommend this film to all martial arts movie fans.",

      "name": "&quot;One doesn&apos;t easily forget, Herr Baron, an arm torn out by the roots.&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "When Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone) arrives to take over his father&apos;s estate, the locals immediately begin to fear for the worst. Wolf&apos;s father created a monster that terrorized the community and the townsfolk want no more of that. Wolf assures everyone that he has no intentions of creating a monster. But when Wolf finds Ygor (Bela Lugosi) living in the ruins of his father&apos;s laboratory, he is soon headed down the same path of destruction that claimed his father.\n\nOver the years, there have been volumes written on the Universal classic horror movies. Realizing that it would be foolish of me to attempt to improve or add much to the writings of these scholars, I&apos;ll instead focus on a couple of areas that make Son of Frankenstein so special to me.\n\n1. The Acting. Son of Frankenstein features a Who&apos;s Who of the best of the classic horror actors. Joining Rathbone and Lugosi in the cast are Boris Karloff and Lionel Atwill. While each gives a noteworthy performance in their own right, Lugosi&apos;s performance is generally held up as the best of his career. And while I agree, Rathbone makes Son of Frankenstein a joy for me to watch. There are very few actors that I can think of who could have played Wolf with the same type of intelligent energy that Rathbone exhibits. He&apos;s wonderful. As for Karloff, I&apos;m glad he decided to make Son of Frankenstein his last as the monster. By the time of the second sequel, Karloff&apos;s monster became little more that a prop for Lugosi, Rathbone, and Atwill to fight over.\n\n2. The Sets. I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say that the sets in Son of Frankenstein are among the best I&apos;ve ever seen. The sets are amazing with their bizarre angles and shadows. Two that immediately come to mind are the dining table set and the staircase set at the beginning of the movie. They are in a class of their own.\n\nEvery fan of horror, or just good classic movies in general, owes it to themselves to see Son of Frankenstein. It may not be as well known among the casual fan as either Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein, but it many ways it&apos;s the equal of those two films (if not better).",

Terrible acting, virtually non-existent plot and the cheesiest special effects I&apos;ve laid eyes on make this a title that no one should view. Ever.\n\nCannibals? Flesh-eating little boys? A character strangely reminiscent of Lord Voldemort?\n\nThis film is absolutely terrible, one for the garbage bin and not the DVD player. I&apos;d rather watch golf and eat paint chips.\n\nFor anyone considering viewing this tremendous crock of film feces, I&apos;d suggest you instead pick up a few Richard Simmons tapes, collect the neighborhood fatties and sweat to the oldies.

I&apos;m already a great admirer of old black &amp; white pictures, and I enjoyed The Great Illusion as well. This one is rather different from Illusion, though from the same era and also with Jean Gabin as the quintessential Frenchman. It&apos;s hauntingly sad, quietly emotional, and even if it&apos;s a bit dated in some places (the pathetic hood played by Brasseur) it still manages to creep up on you and leaves you absorbed with the motifs of human loneliness and the not unreasonable, but ultimately impossible human dream of happiness. So it&apos;s not a laugh-riot, and you don&apos;t leave the cinema with a happy feeling, but you do feel good about having seen it. It&apos;s a masterpiece in French cinema history, Jean Gabin is ideal as the tough-as-butter soldier with a doomed soft spot for Michéle Morgan&apos;s beautiful waif, and in the end all you remember is the quiet mists of Le Havre harbor, and the sense of ill-fate and lost chances. Not to mention the beautiful eyes of a very young Morgan!"

      "reviewBody": "The King of Queens is at it again and he hit this one out of the park! Salma Hayek also put in a fun performance as did Henry Winkler. Kevin&apos;s real life brother offered up some of the funnier moments dealing with domestic realities. Every character in this film made me laugh until it hurt. This film is a sure crowd pleaser as it has the Asians, Hispanics and the white crowd both old and young covered quite well. Most of the comedy is from the older actors in this film so I think the older crowd will appreciate this film as much as teens will. At times you know you are watching a comedy. At other points you know there is good heart touching drama added in with a comedic touch. And then when the fighting kicks in you feel like you are watching a real fight. If you have a heart for music studies you will cheer these characters on! If you enjoy the UFC/MMA fighting then you&apos;ll have a blast watching Kevin James dive into this world and get/give a good whooping! A lot of the real players/announcers/refs from UFC are in this film adding to the feel of a real UFC match. It&apos;s a smart film in it&apos;s comedic moments. On the other hand, as contrived and predictable as many elements in this story are, you will still find yourself cheering the players on and maybe even feel your eyes water due to feelings from either end of the emotional spectrum. I had given up on comedy films in recent years as most of them our just way too raunchy. But the PG rating on this film...I applaud all those behind this production. This movie works and it will make anyone laugh!",

      "reviewBody": "The Three Supermen are back for once last adventure 7 years after their previous battle against the Godfather. As this is the only Tre Supermen film made in the Eighties it looks and feels a bit different than all the others. It also stars only one familiar Superman: the verbally challenged Sal Borgese, who is joined by two young blood Daniel Stephen and Steven Martin (no not the gray haired one) as well as a sexy blond FBI agent played by singer Gena Gas. \n\nHaving traveled to Santa Domingo on the trail of a gang of dirty counterfeiters who are printing fake dollar bills, our trio almost immediately gets involved in a very silly fight. Battling about 35 men, this action sequence features more reverse shots than your average Six Million Dollar Man episode. Naturally the entire fight was just a diversion so the international villains can kidnap Gena. So the Supermen pretend to be Russian sailors by using the word &apos;tovarisch&apos; in each sentence just like Colossus. \n\nAlthough there are no children in this film, the intended audience seems to be aimed at under tens. The supporting characters look like cartoons, the music is repetitive, the action is too silly for words and while a couple of attractive women appear briefly, much more time is spend watching the supermen change their outfits in their hotel room. On the other hand, the drug lord does use a whip on two of his female accomplices, but then again, he speaks Spanish. \n\nAs usual two of the three heroes dress up in drag and join a group of women on a yacht and most of the latter part of the film takes part either in the harbor or in the jungle (familiar territory in the Tre Supermen series). \n\n6 out of 10",

      "name": "A true hidden gem, and a fitting exit for the legendary Boris Karloff",
      "reviewBody": "Ageing horror actor Byron Orlock (Boris Karloff) has just finished what will be his final film. The campy nature of the horror films he stars in, and the decline in moral society leads him to believe that horror films are no longer scary, especially when compared with what is happening in the real world. Young director Sammy Michaels (Peter Bogdanovich) has just written a great script especially for Orlock, and tries to persuade him to re-think his retirement plans on the build-up to Orlock&apos;s final public appearance at a drive-in for his new movie The Terror. Meanwhile, suburban husband and gun-obsessive Bobby Thompson (Tim O&apos;Kelly) is planning a massacre using his sniper rifle, starting with his wife and family.\n\nAs usual when it comes to Roger Corman productions, the story behind the film is just as interesting (often more so) as the film itself. Karloff apparently owed Corman a couple of days work, so he was handed to Corman protégé Peter Bogdanovich, and told him to make whatever film he liked - as long as it was cheap, quick, included footage of his film The Terror (1963), and drew on the recent Charles Whitman killings. So, with the help of screenwriter Samuel Fuller, Bogdanovich crafted an intelligent, shocking, and extremely interesting film that what way ahead of its time.\n\nTargets is many things. On one hand it is a warm love-letter to the legendary actors of old. In one scene, Michaels enters Orlock&apos;s hotel room, them both being drunk, and watch the end of Howard Hawks&apos; The Criminal Code (1931), which starred a younger Boris Karloff. They briefly discuss the genius of Hawks and Michaels comments on what a fine screen presence Orlock (really Karloff) was, and still is. It is also a first-rate thriller. Tim O&apos;Kelly is very effective as the clean-cut, all-American boy, who is becoming increasingly shaken about the person he finds himself becoming. In real-life, Whitman was found to have an aggressive brain tumour that was believed to be the cause of the sudden killing spree. The violence, though not gratuitous or exploitative, is shocking and nasty. The murder scenes are shot with a slow and detailed precision that are scary given the real-life occurrences.\n\nMost interestingly, the film is a commentary on the generation gap, in both society and in cinema. Michaels states that &quot;all the great films have already been made.&quot; Of course, this is not true - America was about to enter its true golden age, when the likes of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Michael Cimino, and Bogdanovich himself shook Hollywood to its core. But Michaels is reflecting Orlock&apos;s fear of the new. Orlock is retiring because &quot;it&apos;s a young person&apos;s world,&quot; and he feels he no longer has his place. The film builds up to the inevitable meeting of Orlock and Thompson - the old vs. the new, if you will.\n\nTargets is quite hard to sum up. It is genuinely a hidden gem, and a true original that should be seen by anyone interested in cinema. Karloff would sadly pass away a year after this film was released, and he gives what is possibly his finest career performance. He has no scary make-up or sets to drown him out. He is simply an old man, walking stick and all. Although he made a couple more films after this, Targets seems his true and fitting exit from cinema. This is close to an &apos;A&apos;-movie that I&apos;ve seen a B-movie get, and again proves that Roger Corman was a true cinema genius.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

What makes it so great is that just like &quot;The Longest Day&quot; this film looks at the events that led up to and during one of the most momentous moments in the history of not only this country, but Japan as well. I also loved the acting in it. Martin Balsam and Jason Robards should have been nominated for their performances as Admiral Kimmel and General Short, respectively. Also, I wonder how much different it would have been if Akira Kurosawa had directed the Japanese scenes as he originally was supposed to. I also wonder if the fact that it dealt with one of the darker chapters in American history had something to to with its poor box office showing on this side of the Pacific (ironically, it was a box office smash in Japan). However, it is still a great film and I especially loved it at the end when Yamamoto made his famous comment &quot;I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with terrible resolve.&quot; How right he was."

      "reviewBody": "Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and many of my fellow Horror buffs will agree that the man is one of the all-time Horror greats. Films like &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977), &quot;Profondo Rosso&quot; (1975) and Phenomena (1985) range among my all-time favorites, and Argento&apos;s repertoire includes several other masterpieces of Italian Horror/Giallo, such as &quot;The Bird With The Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970), &quot;Opera&quot;(1987) or &quot;Tenebre&quot;(1982). After several inferior films that he made in the 1990s, such as the decent &quot;Trauma&quot; of 1993 and &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; (which he made with fellow Horror-deity George A. Romero in 1990) and the disappointing &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the master returned to his old style - and old greatness - with this &quot;Non Ho Sonno&quot; aka &quot;Sleepless&quot;, a tantalizing and ultra-violent Giallo, in 2001. The good-old Giallo premise is still working greatly, and the fact that Argento borrows many elements from his older films does in no way downsize the greatness of &quot;Sleepless&quot;. On the contrary, this is the absolute proof for us Italian Horror buffs that great Gialli can still be made in the 21st century.\n\nIn 1983, young Giacomo has to witness the brutal murder of his mother, who is one of the many victims of a Turin murder series. 17 years later, Turin is struck by a murder-series again, and the horrid crimes seem to resemble those from 1983. Even though he has spent the last 17 years trying to forget, Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi), who has since moved to Rome, decides to come back to Turin. Since the police make little progress, Giacomo and the retired homicide detective Ulisse Moretti (Max Von Sydow), who was working on the cases in 1983, begin to investigate themselves...\n\n&quot;Sleepless&quot; brings the old-fashioned Giallo-greatness that we&apos;re used to from Argento. A creepy atmosphere, stunning suspense, ultra-bloody murders, an excellent cinematography and especially another ingenious score by Progressive Rock band Goblin - this film delivers all the great elements that we love Argento for. Argento has once stated that this is the most brutal of all his films which is not exactly true. The violence and gore are extreme, no doubt, but films like &quot;Tenebre&quot;, &quot;Phenomena&quot; or &quot;Opera&quot; are at least equally violent, if not more. Dario Argento is not exactly known for his tameness when it comes to violence, and this is yet another (immensely stylishly) ultra-brutal Argento experience. As I stated above, Argento uses some elements he has used in his older films - but he does so in an great manner. Elements like a creepy nursery-rhyme are downright ingenious and give this the tantalizing and superb atmosphere that is typical for Argento. An absolute must-see for Horror fans, especially my fellow Argento-enthusiasts can not allow themselves to miss this! Great!",

They are just features of his &quot;alternative future&quot;. Remember that so much of the world we live in goes by, unexplained. It helps break this film away from the Hollywood-spoonfed blandness.\n\n A real treat not commented on is Keith Carradine. A veteran of Alan Rudolph films, he has a wonderful transformation. Without any commentary, he goes from a rural-type (flannel shirt &amp; jeans) to a denizen of the city (wild clothing, make-up, boufant hairdo). And his behavior gets more bizarre with his change in locale.\n\n Also, watch for one of cinemas most unique murders. Let&apos;s just say it involves water, a major feature of the movie, but it takes place in a location you would never fathom.\n\n This is one film I would love to see get the deluxe DVD treatment. Widescreen, director commentary, deleted scenes. It is an overlooked wonder."

This movie has been compared to Northwest Passage but i think this one is better. Cooper is good as usual and so is the rest of the cast.",

      "reviewBody": "At the end of this movie, I wasn&apos;t sure that I&apos;d enjoyed it. But as the day wore on, I found myself continually thinking about it. Often, I leave a movie thinking I&apos;ve enjoyed it and never give it a second thought. I wasn&apos;t sure for a lot of the film exactly what the point is other than the relationship between Peck (An outlaw with Scottish descendancy) and Billy (A half-breed Native Indian). But actually, this is the point and the characters are what make this movie work. Gregory Peck could never be accused of being type cast and he gave a valiant attempt at pulling off a Scottish accent. A lot of the words he nailed but then the accent completely disappeared for run of the mill dialect. A little more direction and time and his language would have matched an otherwise strong performance. Billy seemed a straightforward character to start with but layer upon layer are revealed as the movie progresses including an explanation for an otherwise daft movie title and you really find a sense of his history and upbringing. The sheriff gave a worthy performance but I was particularly impressed with the Apache gang and the stuttering wife. The Apache were made all the more terrifying by their random nature and personality so far removed from stereotypical Apache. The guy with the white parasol was the best of the bunch. The parasol is mentioned but no reference is made to how he obtained this. Some things are best unsaid, had he massacred a previous wagon and removed this as a trophy from some poor unsuspecting traveller? The stuttering wife was beautifully played. Her husband&apos;s answer to this disability was to slap her round the face. To her and her guests, this was nothing more than abuse but the husband clearly thought he was &apos;Rattling her brain box&apos; and helping her out. Her vulnerability, loneliness and desire for love were superbly portrayed and I wish her love for Billy had been explored more fully. The movie reached a stand-off climax and there is a moral about how we treat our dead at the end which again leaves you thinking. Give this movie a chance, you may well draw a different conclusion but it is a little gem worth giving a chance.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Rokuro Mochizuki started his career in the Japanese porno industry before making his name with some strikingly characteristic work in the 1990s, a success contemporary with other industry colleagues such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Takashi Miike. Unlike these two however, Mochizuki has made less of an impact in recent years and, together with his Another Lonely Hit-man (1995). Onibi - The Fire Within is probably his best - or at least judged so from those seen so far in the west. As is frequently common practice in the conservative Nipponese film industry, where art house work is typically &apos;smuggled&apos; to audiences in the guise of genre pieces, Mochizuki often works within the yakuza film, creating his own distinct style within the frequently considerably stretched boundaries of the gangster narrative. The &apos;fire within&apos; of the title here refers to the flame of existence, something akin to essential essence, or the soul. At one point in the film there is reference to the ghost of a victim, materialising next to the killer immediately after an assassination and hero Kunihiro affirms its existence. But it more specifically refers to the hero&apos;s special kind of strength, recognised by those who befriend him upon his release: &quot;You&apos;re just like a cultural asset,&quot; says his new boss, before Kunihiro&apos;s dry response: &quot;and you want me to explode when necessary.&quot;\n\nAfter so many years in prison he has had to rely upon this inner spirit to survive, a process that has become formalised through a love of classical music. He has also made the close acquaintance of Hideyuki Sakata and the suggestion is that their relationship, at least while inside, is more than that of close friends. Refusing a large amount of money to welcome him back to the gang immediately upon his release, Kunihiro has problems settling in, and there&apos;s a sense that he feels ill at ease with the gangsters of today. Instead of money from his new contacts, Kunihiro unexpectedly asks for a camera, through which he captures elements of his new environment, as well as establishing his own presence and viewpoint within it. Initially unable to connect even on the most rudimentary physical level with the female piano player Asako the film sees Kunihiro seeking to re-enter society though a series of what might be called meditative vignettes, the success of which brings him closer to Asako and her plight. Just as in Another Lonely Hit-man, it takes a woman to draw the chief protagonist back into normal life, and with similarly disastrous results. Similar to the earlier film too is the importance of photography. It is only when Asako asks the hit-man to help kill a man who has nude photographs of her that his re-assimilation begins in earnest, to the point that he later breaks into her house to retrieve her photo albums (which, ironically, she then refuses to look at). Some have seen the director&apos;s especial concern with cameras as a wider metaphor for his own interest in the nature of representation - Mochizuki was educated at Image Forum, an experimental film academy - an interpretation born out, perhaps by the final image of Kunhiro at the close, the most artificial shot in the film.\n\nThe Fire Within&apos;s source is from a story by a former lawyer of the Yamaguchi crime syndicate and presumably the original was based in brutal fact. Mochizuki brings a whole dimension of his own to the adaptation, in an exploration of outward image and real identity. Critic Tom Mes, for one, has no doubt as to the success of the result calling Onibi &quot;the best Japanese film of the last 15 years&quot; - a judgement at which this viewer, at least, would hesitate. Mochizuki&apos;s film is an extremely subtle one - but it has to be said that its calm surface is rather like a mirror, in which the more one stares in the hope of seeing, the more is reflected back - opportunities for this activity existing aplenty due to the slow, emphatic pacing throughout. Does Kunihiro distance himself from his fellow gangsters through an existential desire to be free for instance, or is he simply stunned and still trying to readjust to the new set of operations after 27 years? Chief actor Yoshio Harada (seen more recently in Azumi, 2003) and the also excellent 9 Souls, has had a long and distinguished film career. The depiction of Kunihiro was something of a change for him, as previously he had cultivated a macho action image on screen, &quot;a long haired whirling dervish of controlled passion and anger,&quot; in such films as Fukusaku&apos;s Triple Cross and on that basis had amassed a large following. In the present film he excels in showing a great spirit in repose rather than action, turning himself into a different kind of actor completely.\n\nThe casual viewer will find the trance-like elements of this film either distancing or profound, according to taste. Notable is a scene set in a swimming pool (shot under difficult conditions during an E. Coli outbreak in Osaka) where the camera spends long moments on the participants, finding its own rhythm and pleasure though the play of elegant instrumentals. Mochizuki&apos;s use of music like this, to bring out the inherent mood and raptness of scenes, reminded this viewer of Kubrick&apos;s Barry Lyndon - a very different film indeed, but one which also contained moments of stillness and poise where the score, too, hinted at emotions laying below calm exteriors. Another director who springs to mind, closer to home, is Takeshi Kitano. He similarly places moments of Zen-like calm in his gangster films, including a fondness for water, only to interrupt such placid moments with abrupt violence. If Mochizuki is not quite as memorable as Kitano, his film is one which repays re-viewing for the patient fan, although those who seek their yakuza flicks with more up-front concerns will best advised to look elsewhere.",

I don&apos;t know what the day to day texture of life tends to be like for Turks in Germany -- I don&apos;t even know if the characters are ethnic Turks or Kurds -- so I have to trust the movie. But I don&apos;t know whether I should. Yes, the outlines of the plot come from a true story. I can forgive the movie for ignoring that Germany and Turkey have both signed the Hague Abduction Convention, which would allow the father to get his son back. Yes, many parts of the Muslim world share the sense that honor is tied to being able to control one&apos;s women, and honor killings happen. Yes, some children in a family may acculturate differently than others. And, yes, it was nuanced. But that does not necessarily mean that the nuances are there in life rather than only in the director&apos;s head. Ingmar Bergman comes to mind, and Amos Gitai (some of whose movies I somehow forced myself to watch all the way through). My suspicions were also raised by When We Leave&apos;s contemplative quiet, which is common in this kind of art movie but not in real life. But, let me re-emphasize, I don&apos;t really know that the picture is a fantasy, I only suspect.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Donovan&apos;s Reef&quot; is set on an island in the Pacific, which is basically getting by on its own merits without much contact with the modern world. John Wayne and Lee Marvin team up to portray two navy buddies that seem to have two things in common--the same birthday and a desire to punch each others&apos; lights out because of a quarrel that started several years before on that birthday.  The rest of the cast occupy themselves trying to keep the two &quot;friends&quot; alive because they genuinely are decent guys.\n\nInto this island bliss comes Elizabeth Allen, portraying a lady from Boston who is attempting to prove that her father, played by Jack Warden, has been living on the island in standards less than acceptable by Boston customs so she can claim his share of a family shipping business.  Through one scene after another, the film takes a merry romp through its plot and gives the viewer a very enjoyable time.",

Steve Bucemi pops up briefly and good as always. i would say give this movie a couple of tries as i bought this for the 3rd time after throwing it in the trash twice, it grows on you. the music score is perfect. The best line is &quot;im with the bagatelle&apos;s now and you owe them money, this time next week you will not owe them money capish&quot; Jimmy Corona/Jimmy Keys..",

Johnny ( never though he was such an idiot), Joey ( a darling that never said anything bad about anyone), Marky and the rest of the musicians...and Areturo Vega the designer of their logo and official Ramones website and merchandising.\n\nThe early footage from the CBGB (1970 ish) it&apos;s incredibly funny and endearing along with arguments on stage that will make you laugh till you die, they were really excellent.\n\nI am just a fan of this band and I will always have them close to my heart for their music, their attitude, their sense of humour and above all they cheer me up when I am down and this film just made me feel even closer to them.",

It is actually impossible to even accept the basic setup for several reasons. While the cinematography is arguably one notch over a passable High School project, everything else pulls the movie down into an amateur ditch – it sinks even lower than many of the other unfortunate horror-releases of newer time. The direction is awful and the acting is really quite terrible. The script problems are obvious and nothing has been done to attempt to fix cringe-worthy plot holes. It really makes no sense. The movie is also full of hand-me-down elements from many previous horror movies, and it does a remarkably terrible job copying them. Something Wicked boils down to an unengaging experience due to the general poor quality, and it is not worth neither time nor money. It is particularly sad to see the last rolls of film of the late Brittany Murphy, which, without a doubt, was the only reason that this was ever released. Murphy looks tired, strung out – and it can be argued that it is in poor taste to publish this unfinished and confused nonsense in her wake. I think this movie is cursed. If this is the case it may be a good horror movie after all. But it is still a three... Stay clear of this release, friends!"

      "reviewBody": "Just a couple of points to add to the general accolades above:\n\nHere in England the BBC have twice shown a version of The Warriors with a prologue scene, edited from the released movie but restored to a point prior to the opening &apos;Wonder Wheel&apos; shot. It shows Cleon (an otherwise very underused character), sitting on the Boardwalk in the late afternoon sunshine waiting for his eight footsoldiers to show, while his girlfriend pleads with him not to go to the Bronx. When the others arrive and line up he designates their roles, including the &quot;Swan: War chief and second in command&quot; alluded to later in the movie. Ajax gives an early sign of his belligerent nature, voicing his disapproval with bringing a boombox-guy and a graffiti-artist: &quot;They&apos;ll only slow us down&quot;, but seems happy to be labelled as &quot;Heavy Muscle&quot; along with Cochise. Much of the dialogue from this scene is re-used in the credit-sequence, with the shots of Coney and the gathering forces intercut with short interchange between Warriors. However, the prologue scene ends unforgettably with a crane-shot of the nine striding up the Boardwalk and into the distance, casting long shadows on the decking and with Cleon&apos;s girlfriend trailing in their wake. Over this, a slow sixties surf-tune booms out as the waves wash against the shore. Bloody wonderful.\n\nUnfortunately I have never found a store-bought version which includes this material - DVD community, do you know?\n\nAnother thing I heard was that the original idea was that the movie was set &quot;Sometime In The Near Future&quot;, but Walter Hill dropped the idea of having a caption stating as much at the start of the film. This explains some of the discrepancies with the actual New York gangland, being more about delinquent youth and &apos;Colours&apos; than Organised Crime syndicates and shiny suits.\n\nThird - a fantastic action movie full of colour, vim and attitude, but which also never fails to break my heart every time I watch it. There are a couple of scenes like this - mostly Deborah Van Valkenburgh&apos;s - but the main one is with Swan and Mercy on the Subway as the High School &apos;Preppies&apos; complete with ruffled shirts and massive lapels sit down opposite, their laughter and smiles soon fading as the contrast becomes blindingly obvious to them as well as us. Walter Hill plays this scene perfectly: with no dialogue as such, and with Swan and Mercy not even looking at each other as he takes her hand from her hair and places it firmly by her side. Och, goosebumps even thinking about it!\n\nFinally, having also read the original &apos;Anabasis&apos; (I had to) when I was studying Ancient Civilisations of the Med at University, as a piece of pure drama The Warriors could shove a bat up it&apos;s ass and turn it into a Popsicle. Can You Dig It?!"

      "reviewBody": "Everyone in Poland has heard of the Katyn massacre but I&apos;ve been surprised and saddened at how few people in Britain know of the atrocity. In the early part of the Second World War, more than 4,000 Polish soldiers were executed in the Katyn forest near Smolensk in western Russia. This was part of an organised effort to eradicate the military, political and intellectual leadership of Poland and a series of executions in various other locations removed some 22,000 Poles from their loved ones and their nation.\n\nSo, who did this? The Germans claimed to have uncovered the bodies in 1943 and blamed the Soviets in an effort to embarrass and divide the Allies. The Soviet Union categorically denied the crime at the time and for decades afterwards, only in 1990 admitting what the Poles and any independent assessor of the evidence knew: Stalin&apos;s NKVD perpetrated the horror on his express command.\n\nThe incident has now been made into a major Polish film by the acclaimed Polish director Andrzej Wajda whose own father was killed at Katyn and who is now in his 80s. The work was premiered at the Berlin film festival in 2007; it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2008; and it finally arrived in Britain in a few cinemas in the summer of 2009. It is an exceptional work - both powerful and moving - that deserves a much larger audience.\n\nStarting in 1939 with the simultaneous invasion of Poland by the Nazis and the Soviets, it takes us in several jumps to the immediate post-war period and underlines that the shame of Katyn was not just the deaths of the 22,000 in 1940 but the denial of the truth by so many people for so many years afterwards. Through the device of a prolonged flashback, the film concludes with a return to Katyn with close-up scenes of the sheer brutality of what was unquestionably a war crime.\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Andrzej Mularczyk and revolves around a number of fictional families with a fair bit of location work in Krakow, a city centre that looks today much like it did in the 1940s and which I have visited. The photography and acting are both excellent and selective use of wartime film footage simply adds to the sense of verisimilitude.\n\nFootnote: To my utter astonishment, at the Renoir cinema in central London where I saw the film, as I descended the stairs to the screen, I was given a leaflet by a representation of something called The Stalin Society which insisted that the massacre was carried out by the Germans in 1943 and that Wajda&apos;s film is simply part of a sustained attempt to discredit communism at a time of economic crisis when so many people would see it as the obvious alternative to capitalism."

However, the story left a little bit to be desired. In fact, the non monster scenes almost cause this movie to grind to a halt. At least the battle at the end featuring the new monster King Seesar helps to keep the film from going totally down the tubes. Also, this film isn&apos;t really for the faint of heart due to the fact that it is probably the bloodiest of all the Godzilla films. This film may not have been among the best in the series, but it still was pretty decent."

      "reviewBody": "American Scary (2006) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nGood documentary covering the history of horror hosts in America. Through interviews and clips, we see how this phenomenon started off in just one city and before long they were popping up all over the country. Among the people interviewed are Mike Price (Baron Daemen), Joseph Fotinos (Professor Anton Griffin), Leonard Maltin, Joe Bob Briggs, Jeff Thompson, Donald F. Glut, Maila Nurmi (Vampira), Bob Burns, Forrest J. Ackerman, Tom Savini and John Zacherle. Dozens of other hosts from various cities are also interviewed so more than likely you&apos;re going to see your favorite if you grew up with these sort of hosts. I grew up with a couple horror hosts in the late 80s but I think most people my age were just familiar with Joe Bob Briggs and his days on TNT. Those older are the ones that this documentary is really going to hit a core with because they discuss how studios were just starting to open their vaults to TV so these hosts had a whole slew of horror movies to show people. The hosts each talk about what they wanted to do with their cheap sets and what they did or didn&apos;t want to do with the movies. A lot of people look at these hosts (and stuff like Mystery Science Theater) as insults to the movies because they cut the films up and sometimes super-imposed themselves into the film. Maltin talks about being a film buff and looking back at some of this stuff and being horrified at what they were doing but he admits that as a kid he loved it. Fans of these hosts are going to love hearing from them after all of these years and if you never got a chance to see them then you&apos;re in luck because the documentary is full of clips showing some of their highlights."

As brothers Aamir and Ajay are perfect.The scene when Aamir tries to escape the other is hilarious. The fights b/w Kajol and Aamir is also funny. The plot gets serious and Kajol is supported by Aamir as a best friend. There is plot and it is beautifully executed with super songs. The climax is expected but the change in the fathers minds is surprising. There is a friendship b/w each other and is also good because of the background scores. Each character get equal role in each segment. Overall a wonderful creation that makes us watch every time we see it.",

Perhaps the closest to the above is &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is about rediscovery and peace of mind. &quot;Mr Smith&quot; is politically and small town oriented and &quot;Mr Deeds&quot; deals with the same except without some political yawn.  George Bailey should have had a better dosage of the &quot;You Can&apos;t Take it With You&quot; policy in &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.\n\n Here is a play that exercises Frank Capra&apos;s famous adage with all humour already built in. Why shouldn&apos;t it work? \n\nThe stage version was a phenomenal success, written superbly by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. If their story is slightly lacking, look no further than the delightful cast of characters. Mr Poppins, toy and mask maker. Alice&apos;s Father who meddles with fireworks. Essie the ballerina, Penny the playwright and the wonderful Russian ballet teacher. The uptight Kirby banking corporation. Then there&apos;s the &quot;Mr Smith&quot; duo, Tony (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice (Jean Arthur). \n\nThe stand out performer here, is naturally the lovable Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderfhoff. Although the first film in which the damaging effects of his arthritis began to show, Capra had his leg put in a cast and had him move around on crutches. He relishes his performance. \n\nI have heard of complaints which discuss the fact this film fails to address corruption and greed in a similar manner to &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; which successfully played its part going against the American capital. Once again, Capra emphasises his favourite theme of the little guy up against the world and succeeds, but &quot;You Can&apos;t Take it With You&quot; basically does not even make a mild attempt to criticise the American system of government, past or present, even though I know very little about it. \n\nOn different levels, look at this film in the light of discussing heavier issues, as the aforementioned greed and corruption. I just don&apos;t think Mr Capra would have liked it as much for one of his works to be remembered like that, especially with the basic message staring at us right in the face. \n\n Nevertheless, it is another of Capra&apos;s life saving feel good movies. All it is encouraging us to do is to have a little fun. \n\nRating: 8/10"

      "reviewBody": "The performances were good, and (in Eddie Vedder&apos;s offerings) even splendid, making something poignant and powerful as well as rambunctious and ground-breaking out of the Ramones&apos; songs. The visual production is no-frills, which is appropriate to its subjects, and most of the guest stars and inserted commentators are both passionate and of relevance to the Ramones&apos; legend, although - in this regard - I do wonder how Lisa Marie Presley managed to squeeze her way into the proceedings, since she is not punk, scarcely a modern musical presence at all, and of no particular interest in her comments here. Still, the importance of the Ramones to many of the people in the film is both well expressed and (at times) moving. I have no essential problem with those two aspects of the movie: the musical homages, and the oral essays. My concerns start at the point where they were edited together, and this is where one of the most common errors of these &quot;tributes&quot; emerges in full force - the performances are constantly interrupted by talking heads, very few acts find their tributes in full array. I don&apos;t need to be told (in the middle of a song) how important the Ramones were to this or that personality. The adulation can wait until song&apos;s end, because the music is what it is ALL about. A disappointing and very Middle of the Road format.\n\nAs an aside, Johnny Ramone was in the process of dying and though eager to be there that night, was finally too ill to attend. So - as stated - they held up a cellphone so he could hear? Why couldn&apos;t some type of audio-visual remote have been set up so (at least) Johnny could have experienced the concert, if not also so he might himself be seen? This struck me as odd, considering the level of money and talent that attended.\n\nDefinitely worth viewing, for the few full songs, the passion displayed in some acts, and the occasional stills and video of the Ramones themselves. But not an exemplary production.",

      "reviewBody": "This film didn&apos;t try to do much more than bring us the songs. And that was good. It was wildly anachronistic -- the early number with Astaire and Vera Ella was danced to jazz that had to be some 15 or 20 years later than the date of the film, which at that point would be early 1920s, the age of the Turkey Trot, when bands were still coming out from their military origins. But the later sequence in the capacious ballroom of the ocean liner to &quot;Thinking of You&quot; was lovely. And the shot of the liner was the Normandie, wasn&apos;t it? Queen Mary was a four stacker. Vera Ella was a wonderfully acrobatic dancer. Al Schacht WAS a pitcher -- for 3 years (1919-21) for the Senators. The poster who said he was a catcher may have been thinking of Ray Schalk, a hall of fame catcher for the White Sox (including the 1919 nine, though not implicated in the throwing of the Series). And Barris, Rinker, and Bing sang with Paul Whiteman, not Duke Ellington. The MGM color in the 40s and 50s was magnificent -- and this film shows it off superbly. This one is a very enjoyable musical, one of the best of a period that produced some great ones.",

      "name": "As each &apos;Big Parade&apos; passes, it becomes increasingly more hollow",
      "reviewBody": "This movie traces three men from the same American town. The men are from different social and economic backgrounds. Jim (John Gilbert) is the rich son of a mill owner, &apos;Bull&apos; (Tom O&apos;Brian) is a bartender, and Slim (Darl Dane) is a riveter in construction work. When America joins the Great War in Europe all three enlist. As usual in movies of this type, there is a patriotic fervor in the town at the time that they join up. Jim&apos;s girl, Justyn (Claire Adams), is one of the first to assume that Jim will enlist and make her proud. This is the first use of the term, &apos;The Big Parade&apos; on the movie&apos;s title cards—the big parade of patriotic people sending boys off to war. For the first 75 minutes of the movie, we get to really KNOW these three lovable and fun-loving guys, long before they actually go into any battle situations in Europe.\n\nWhile in a French village waiting for a battle, Jim meets a villager, Melisande (Renee Adoree). The movie spends time with Jim and Melisande as they try to communicate with each other in two different languages and have lots of fun and laughs together. When Jim and his buddies are actually called into action, Jim promises Melisande that he will be back. The long convoys of trucks and marching soldiers advancing into battle is the second use of &apos;The Big Parade&apos; on the movie&apos;s title cards.\n\nThe battle scenes are very well done showing bombing, large guns, mustard gas, aerial attacks, and hand-to hand combat. Much of the time, the three soldiers are in trenches or in bomb holes. When the commander orders one of them to clean out an enemy stronghold, the question is which one will be &apos;IT.&apos; Slim sets up a spitting contest to determine which of the three will go. Slim easily wins--which means that he will go. When he doesn&apos;t return, his two friends become very anxious about him. Slim dies. \n\nBull later dies in another assault. Jim gets hurt in the leg and is sent to an army hospital in another &apos;Big Parade&apos; sequence. While in the hospital, he finds out that it is near the village where he left Melisande. In a search of her, he only finds a deserted house in the bombed out village. He is again wounded and sent home. Of course, his homecoming is another &apos;Big Parade.&apos; However, after the term is used several times on the movie&apos;s title cards, it becomes increasingly more hollow and sarcastic.\n\nAfter seeing this movie and Vidor&apos;s The Crowd (1928), I am convinced that he was one of the really great SILENT directors! His movies stress beautiful images and bustling action rather than broad acting gestures. They are both playful and sad; the are replete with a realism that conveys genuine emotion. \n\nAs one watches these movies, they don&apos;t seem contrived; they seem to be about REAL PEOPLE living real lives. Vidor&apos;s magic seems to be in the WAY he captures people and events without the use of sound. At least in these two movies, he is not afraid to let the story unfold naturally. These movies seem as fresh today as they were when they were first released.",

Actually there is not much more in this movie. We see the usual bunch of touristic pictures of the bounty island and well photographed pictures of Gemser. This by the way is her debut movie. And the weird thing is, this movie is almost identical to all movies she made later being &quot;Black Emmanuelle&quot;. This is even extremely close to &quot;La Spiaggia del desiderio&quot; , the third Emmanuella negra film. The English titles confirm this: &quot; Taboo Island&quot; and &quot;A Beach Called Desire&quot;. The only differences are the higher pace of this movie, the fact it looks like the budget was lower for this one and Emmanuelle is called Janine here. The title may suggest there is a lot of sex in this movie, but there is surprisingly little of it and the scenes are much shorter than to be expected. This movie is quite dull by today&apos;s standards. The only reason you would have for wanting to see it, is Gemser in her first movie (if you are a fan of hers). Not too bad a movie, but quite boring. I rate it 4 out of 10.",

The acting is quite simply atrocious, the plot and dialogue (when the cast remember the lines) is just awful and minimal in the usual way of teen horror flicks the story is just there to get to the next scary bit....sadly they seemed to have forgotten to put in both a story or any scary scenes.\n\nI honestly can&apos;t think of anyone who would like this sort of movie, it has a fair amount of rap music and a largely black cast...but I can&apos;t see fans of &apos;black&apos; cinema or rap music liking it. It&apos;s a horror film that won&apos;t appeal to hardcore horror fans or those just looking for a cheap thrill. Avoid at all costs.",

Sony Classics will release it this summer (I just saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival) - go and see it if you missed it. Hard to believe that they apparently had a hard time raising money for this, but now it seems to have all been worth it. It was also the country&apos;s official Acadamy Award entry for best foreign language film (though it didn&apos;t win).\n\nGot a chance to talk to the director after the screening, such a nice man, too...",

It stars the great German actress Hannelore Elsner (of Heimat 2), and features fine performances by its three leads, interesting Central European locales, and beautiful music by Frederic Chopin and Peter Thomas. It has been available on sell-through video (PAL, German language only), distributed by Polygram Video of Hamburg, and sold I assume by Amazon.de. This is how I came across it. Hannelore Elsner and Istvan Szabo both attracted me to it. They never are in a bad project, so rest assured it&apos;s a well-made film. It is not however in the same league as MEPHISTO, HANUSSEN, or the wonderful recently released SUNSHINE. Worthwhile anyway for a certain public.",

Even though I&apos;m not Jewish, I found the film totally entertaining. This film is more than slap stick comedy woven into a worn out display of one-liners. The characters are not static, and there is a serious current underlying the funny moments. It&apos;s a redemptive story about family being more important than money--in grand style. Good job, guys!",

First of all, if this kid managed to survive the first 5 minutes without getting an arrow put through him or beheaded by a broadsword, and he managed to avoid being taken prisoner and made a gay soliders plaything, he would most likely die of many diseases that his body wasn&apos;t accustomed to. Also, even you do have a magical place to plug in a stereo you play rock and roll for guards at a middle age castle, youll be labled as a heritic and executed.  but dying aside, the middle ages just werent that cool, disease and warfare were everywhere, people lived in disgusting conditions that even mother theresa would run away from, and there was no place for the weak, you either fought or you died and if you werent tough, you were probably killed. But enough about that, what i have to say is for young kids that enjoy the &quot;kids outsmarting the stupid grownups&quot; genre, like home alone (that ones off the hook though, still entertains me even at 19 and will continue to) go see it, but for older people that know what the middle ages were really like, dont bother.\n\nIf you want a closer to real life version of what a person time traveling would be like, read the scottish highlander book series (highlander, the fiery cross, etc) or listen to the recorded books  tape or cd"

I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

This one in particular shows some of his more excentric, if not marketable, passions in filmmaking that make movie buffs and connaisseurs alike enjoy this stylized and emotional film.\n\nYes, it is melodramatic.  Yes, the acting is often over the top.  But what many critics of this film fail to recognize is that this is precisly the point.  By staying very true to the source material(until the Elizabeth thing) and the significant changes that WERE made are clear evidence of this.  The book was melodramatic.  What Kenneth Branagh does here is stay true to the spirit of the classic gothic novel.  The great close-ups define the characters, and through them you can understand them.  Do not mistake stylization for poor film-making, because this is a wonderfully made and presented film, that if understood captivates you from the first spoken words(a quote from Mary Shelly, setting up the stylization) to the last frame.\n\nKnow what you&apos;re getting into, a passionatly made film about what drives one to both excel and what drives one to madness, and the dangers of excess beyond reason.  If you have read the book, regardless of whether you liked it or not,see this movie.  You will love what they have retained, and will embrace what they&apos;ve changed.  this is not a film(not a movie, a film) for everyone.  But for those who are willing to have an open mind, it is pure bliss!",

It only shows the lives and daily tasks of several people in Havana. I do not say &quot;poor&quot; people because I do not know who is rich or wealthy in Havana. The director showed the reality of the lives of these people, and I do not agree with those who say that this film was to denounce the critical poor situation in Cuba. No, showing the reality and the truth cannot be a denunciation. The fact is that here one can observe how Havana is coming down day by day, it is a city showing the same level of destruction of any other city that suffered war. However, Havana never suffered any war. The houses of the town are in a very tragic situation, colorless and the walls demanding immediate restoration. It is sad to see the walking sides of Malecón avenue with its stony walls in very bad state. And the people are poorer than ever. It will take decades to restore Havana city and the country. It is amazingly incredible that Academy Awards of 2003 did not include this film among the candidates for the best foreign film. Let´s hope it can be included for the next 2004. The film is very original and an excellent material for all those who want to know the present Cuba.",

The last piece in a longer story of artistic struggles between the actor and the two directors Sternheim and Lubitsch. Both films complement each other, The Patriot being Lubitsch&apos; and Jannings&apos; artistic reply to the predecessor. Just look at the difference in Janning&apos;s acting styles in the two films. From what I&apos;ve read it was also the final nail in the silent film coffin, and Jannings, with the first ever Oscar in his hands, left for Germany, and ended up with a ban on working by the Allies after WW2.\n\n(And may I say that it only costs coppers to digitise it, but that&apos;s not really the argument here)"

      "reviewBody": "First off, I definitely don&apos;t think this movie deserves to have such a low rating. Mind you, I thought this movie was going to reek to high heaven when I saw the trailers. My expectations were extremely, extremely low. I enjoyed the other films the Wayans Bros. did. There is no doubt that they are all talented comics. I just feel that they&apos;re a little overrated. Sometimes people seem to talk about the Wayans Bros. like they&apos;re the new Zucker brothers. I don&apos;t think they will EVER reach those heights in comedy. One of the things I feared about &quot;Little Man&quot; was most of the humor was going to consist of bathroom gags. The movie has its small share of bathroom humor, but never overdoes it. After seeing the previews for movies like &quot;The Pacifier,&quot; I was afraid there was going to be some joke involving diaper-changing. Stuff like that was funny back when &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; came out, but now it just makes me want to roll my eyes and cringe. &quot;Little Man&quot; didn&apos;t have one of those stupid gags, and that was a breath of fresh air for me. I found myself laughing through about 70% of the film, and the cast does a fine job. The only weak link was Tracy Morgan, who was funny on SNL, but the character he plays in this movie is just plain obnoxious. The gorgeous Brittany Daniel, who was also in &quot;White Chicks,&quot; provides some great eye candy. And the monotone-speaking comedian Fred Stoller provides some really funny, scene-stealing moments. Even Chazz Palminteri gets into the act, playing a gangster (I know, not exactly a stretch for him, but he adds some class to the film). Keep on the lookout for Rob Schneider, who has an amusing cameo. And last but not least, John Witherspoon never fails to please. Marlon Wayans&apos;s rubberfaced comedy style gets a little annoying at times, but I can&apos;t deny that the mere image of him as a midget is pretty damn hilarious. My advice is ignore the low rating and tons of bad reviews and give the film a chance. As I said before, I thought this was just going to be another brainless comedy",

      "reviewBody": "Reviews of this film are more interesting and thought provoking than most. A number of them convey critical insights that certainly deepened my appreciation. Yes, the film is flawed, but it also resonates beyond standard soap opera mainly because of its tragic central premise. That the movie doesn&apos;t fully realize its aim, I&apos;m sorry to say, is largely because of limitations in Seberg&apos;s performance. I agree, she&apos;s a lively and compelling screen presence with a freshness that&apos;s genuinely appealing. However, the role of Cecile calls upon more emotional depth than Seberg manages to convey, especially with the absence of troubled emotions. Thus the sense of tragic outcome stems from sources other than Seberg&apos;s performance. Now, there are several ways of looking at Cecile&apos;s emotional make-up and maturity, but there&apos;s one I believe that most strongly recommends itself and also puts Seberg&apos;s performance in the best light.\n\nOn this view, Seberg has Cecile&apos;s character just right during the sunny Technicolor phase. Cecile is simply too immature to realize the potential consequences of her scheming actions. Thus, Cecile (Seberg) attaches no more gravity to breaking up her father&apos;s relationship than she does to skipping her studies. She&apos;s all spoiled selfishness wrapped in a winsome smile. And it&apos;s not until the car crash that she realizes the consequences of her selfish act, and experiences an emotional depth for the first time. Her scheme thus results not from making a wrongful choice but from not even realizing that a choice is being made. This view would vindicate nine-tenths of Seberg&apos;s unconflicted Technicolor performance, but not the black- and-white phase where Seberg fails to convey the conflict required. This view would also explain the added features of narration, color change and Saul Bass graphics once Preminger realizes that Seberg&apos;s performance is not enough to convey the necessary sense of tragedy.\n\nDespite this central flaw, the movie remains oddly haunting. Maybe it&apos;s because of a sun- washed paradise so carelessly lost, or of a summer of such promise turned into a lifetime of regret. I really like the observation that father and daughter behave as though actions have no consequences. As a result, their humanity is only realized once the importance of this lesson is tragically driven home. Only by then, it&apos;s too late. In my view, the movie remains regrettably underrated."

When planning to beat up Kajal&apos;s father, he sees her and instantly falls in love with her. Kajal ( Karisma Kapoor) hates Karan at first, but gradually falls in love with him as well. Her father, not knowing her secret, arranges a marriage for KajAL with Raju (Salman Khan), a family friend. When Raju crosses the same crime lord, Karan is hired to kill Raju and the unexpected happens.\n\nThis film is engrossing, sometimes moving, and always entertaining. It is quite violent, not atypical for Bollywood, and contains some impressive musical numbers. Deol is fantastic in his role, and is especially chilling as a killer. Khan was a bit over-the-top in his interpretation of Raju, but was as charming as ever. Kapoor played her emotional scenes spectacularly well.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent film and well worth watching for Bollywood fans.",

Dredd was a law enforcer in a future time where there were no juries, no trials, just instant justice dispensed on the spot. If you were guilty the emotionless Dredd would issue whatever punishment he saw fit.\n\nBack to the movie anyway. It&apos;s not always easy to translate a comic book hero to the big screen without changing things but they did a great job with this movie. If you were to look at a photo of Stallone in this movie and compare it to a drawing of the comic book Dredd you would see no difference. Stallone was Dredd down to a tee.\n\nThe story is great as well. Dredd is accused of a crime he did not commit and he must prove his innocence. The action scenes in the movie were fantastic.\n\nAll in all, a brilliant film. I just wish there&apos;d have been a sequel."

Helene Hanff really was a special writer. She gave an identity to 84 Charing Cross Road to last a lifetime. Her letter writing relationship between a bookstore and herself is one of legendary stories to become part of London and New York. Sadly, she died 5 years ago. I am sure that 84 Charing Cross Road will always remember the writer, Helene Hanff, who inspired such a legacy. Anyway the film has a wonderful cast like Anne Bancroft who is ageless in the role. Sir Anthony Hopkins as the bookseller. Dame Judi Dench as his wife and Maurice Denham in a supporting role. Also, I have been to London three more times since I wrote this review and sadly this time, I made the effort to visit 84 Charing Cross Road, sorry folks, it&apos;s a Pizza Hut and I had dinner there tonight anyway. THere is no plaque. I still think Anne Bancroft was superb now that she&apos;s gone. So has Maurice Denham since I last wrote this review. God Bless them wherever they are.",

This was a nicely photographed film and a pretty memorable one at that but it kind of bothered me that there wasn&apos;t much dialogue or narration and when there was in different countries there wasn&apos;t any subtitles which was a bummer because I was really interested on what other cultures talk about on an normal everyday basis and their input on parenting and because of that it made the pacing sometimes sluggish with a series of clips that you could probably find on youtube or home videos but that still doesn&apos;t make it lose its charm. Overall there isn&apos;t much else I can say about Babies, it wasn&apos;t a brilliant documentary but a very adorable one that will lift your spirits high and I recommend it for mothers or parents to be but that&apos;s pretty much it. Worthy of a rental. More of a 2.5 out of 5 stars.",

      "name": "Full-on MGM musical classic!",
      "reviewBody": "The movie musical of the 1930s studio system period arguably offered the only 100% use of the film medium. All singing, all dancing, all talking&apos; was not then simply a catch phrase; it was what the audience demanded, entertainment pure and simple, 70 minutes or more, during which time they could escape the lingering effects of the Depression. Although Warner Brothers and Busby Berkeley were responsible for the rise and rise of the 1930s musical, MGM came out with Broadway Melody of 1936&apos; which subtly lifted the genre a step higher through the talents of the greatest dancer ever to appear on the screen, Eleanor Powell. Fred had grace (and Ginger) and Gene had strength but Eleanor had both grace AND strength. She needed no partner, either! \n\nThree numbers stand out in Broadway Melody of 1936&apos;. The first, Broadway Rhythm&apos;, is a hypnotic combination of music and dance which stands the test of time well no matter how you approach it. For example, the lighting and photography is simply stunning, not unusual from the best musical crew available at any Hollywood studio at the time - possibly any time. The musical backing is likewise; this is a number I&apos;ve watched and listened to hundreds of times without loss of enjoyment. Francis Langford&apos;s wonderful (dubbed for Eleanor) voice grips you and before too much longer, once Eleanor moves onto the dance floor, you are swept up in the feeling of the times. It&apos;s difficult to believe this was her first starring role; as Eleanor dances into the camera, her eyes sparkling, you know she&apos;s dancing just to please you. There IS love at first sight and this surely must have been the effect on audiences back in the 1930s who took this great performer into their hearts, as box office takings proved. In addition to Eleanor, we have the lovely June Knight dancing with Nick Long, Jr and these two are great together. What a pity they never paired in any other movies. Likewise, Buddy Ebsen and sister Vilma, who are a terrific duo. Yes, I could probably write a book on this number.\n\nI&apos;ve Got a Feelin&apos; You&apos;re Foolin&apos; is equally as memorable as Broadway Rhythm&apos; for similar reasons. Technically marvellous (how were the pop-up&apos; effects achieved?) and great fun to watch, we have the sight of arguably the most handsome guy ever to grace the movies, Robert Taylor, bursting into song and yes, he&apos;s good, helped by the words of a great song. Stage actress June Knight is a perfect partner, with her facial expressions adding another dimension to the experience. The refrain brings Nick Long, Jr on stage for a knock-em down performance, the first part of which sees him seemingly bouncing with little effort over a row of chorus girls, one by one, followed by a double pirouette. Then comes the return of a sensual June Knight encased in the sexiest dress ever to grace the screen (just my opinion), white and complicated though split to the waist at the front. June and Nick then go into a dance in which the lady offers herself to the gentleman in a manner similar to that seen in films of wildlife in the African jungle. June spins into the camera and my, what a great set of legs!\n\n Finally, You are My Lucky Star&apos; sees Eleanor Powell (voiced by Francis Langford) follow up the song with an exhibition of ballet which must have left the audience with heads spinning. So many memorable moments in one movie and a lot of hard work for the participants, according to Eleanor in an interview with John Kobal (People Will Talk&apos;, Aurum Publishing, 1986). For this third number she often had to remove blood-soaked ballet slippers at the end of the day and soak her feet in ice. Originally production of the movie shoot was supposed to last a month (for which Eleanor asked a fee of $1250) but it eventually ran for four months. The final result, though, was a 7-year contact from Louis Mayer for Eleanor.\n\nAlthough this movie hasn&apos;t arrived on DVD, it&apos;s only a matter of time. The three numbers reviewed are available on the special 2-disc edition of Singing in the Rain&apos;, being songs sourced for the later movie.",

(The DVD additional interviews featured as an extra feature are actually more amusing than those in the film itself).\n\nCukor&apos;s homosexuality is noted, as is his infamous Sunday men only parties. However the Clark Gable rumor as to why he was really fired from Gone With The Wind is absent, and we are told that Cukor sadly never had a significant other. (The GWTW firing is said here to be due to David O Selznick&apos;s megalomania and Cukor&apos;s objections to his on-set interference).\n\nApart from film clips and interviews, we also see Paulette Goddard&apos;s screen test for GWTW, home movies of Hepburn and Tracy, behind the scenes footage from Sylvia Scarlett, and Joan Crawford announcing his 1962 Oscar for My Fair Lady.\n\nSome interesting points raised are how Judy Garland was partially responsible for the idea of the Born In A Trunk sequence being added to A Star Is Born, which Cukor was against, and which lengthened it to become cut.\n\nAlthough we are told Cukor hated the label &quot;women&apos;s director&quot; which stuck to him, general opinion is that A Star Is Born is his masterpiece, and his 50 year 10 film relationship with Hepburn is a cinematic record of collaboration."

      "reviewBody": "A Cape Canaveral space probe to Mars causes an unexpected response for the lead scientist and his family.\n\nThe cheezy title along with the hokey first shot of a robot on Mars had me prepared for the worst. However, the storyline quickly turns around and makes the most out of a limited cast, a single location, and a neat Bodysnatchers premise. Hiring movie vets like Taylor and the great Marie Windsor was a shrewd move, since their experienced acting provides needed credibility. Then too, that grand mansion and elaborate grounds makes the storyline&apos;s walking both suspenseful (what&apos;s around the corner) and slyly scenic. And thankfully, the production avoids padding budget runtime with a lot of static dialog. Instead, there&apos;re atmospheric tracking shots down woodsy corridors that provide a few sudden jolts. This sort of technique makes the comparison with the great Val Lewton features of the 40&apos;s an apt one, though this film doesn&apos;t reach that quality level. Nonetheless, the results, including the surprise ending, are certainly better than the ratings (TMC and IMDb) indicate. No, the movie&apos;s no sci-fi classic, but it is a shrewdly done, often subtle, little film that doesn&apos;t settle for rubber monsters or the obvious."

The special effects, the storyline, and, of course, the cataclysmic confrontation between the Big Green Guy and this malignant, super-powerful force of destruction appropriately named DESTROYAH!  He smothers King Ghidorah as Godzilla&apos;s most powerful adversary after just one battle!\n\nThis truly isn&apos;t your father&apos;s Godzilla, and the sheer brutality of this new series proves it.  With the creation of these movies, Godzilla has reclaimed something he hasn&apos;t had in a while: ATTITUDE!  Meaner, bigger, and more powerful than ever, a true &apos;G fan&apos; such as myself loves it!\n\nThe ending was a heartbreaker.  Godzilla&apos;s body could no longer take over 40 years of radioactivity, as well as an ongoing war with Destroyah (he is one, bad...shut yo&apos;mouth!)  Now I hear that a new Godzilla movie is looming on the horizon.  I knew that this movie couldn&apos;t be the last one.  Godzilla is IMMORTAL!  I would like to see him take on Destroyah in his vintage form.\n\nOn a Godzilla movie scale of 1 to 10, I give &apos;Gojira VS Desutoroia&apos; a TWELVE!"

Many comparisons have been made to Saw and other torture movies, but really, it&apos;s not the same kind of thing at all. But make no mistake, this is not for the squeamish, it is quite gruesome. But it is not gruesome for gruesome&apos;s sake. Many of the gory parts are implied rather than shown, which I think is done so you can connect to the story rather than the gore. The acting and directing have done an outstanding job to pull off what I think is a great success in what could have been a dismal failure, given the plot. There are also a couple nice twists at the end to give it a bit more credibility. \n\nIt held me captivated because it wasn&apos;t just predictable guff. If Big Brother was more like this, maybe I would have watched it.",

I also think the costumes used were quite authentic and the references to wild animals were on point. It&apos;s certainly no Gone with the Wind, but definitely left me with some wind.",

      "reviewBody": "I will start by saying that I have read the book and it is one of my all-time favorites. The movie stuck pretty close to the book, right down to several quotes taken from the book. There were a few changes that surprised me. For example, in the book, Miles is a mild mannered person. In the movie, he&apos;s extremely bitter because of what happened to him due to his immortality. (Sorry, no spoilers) It was a good change.\n\nThe casting was amazing. Alexis Bledel plays Winnie Foster. Like Rory on Gilmore Girls, Winnie is very serious, but wants to have fun. William Hurt didn&apos;t strike me as someone old and wise, but he portrays Angus Tuck very well. Sissy Spacek was great as Mae Tuck, showing her character&apos;s motherly side toward Winnie.\n\nBen Kingsley plays the Man in the Yellow Suit (TMITYS). TMITYS is a great villain in the same league as Lex Luthor. He has no superpowers, but his mere presence can send super humans (immortals) running for cover. In the book, he&apos;s a vague character. He doesn&apos;t even seem to be a villain until later in the book. All we know is that he wants to find the Tucks and their spring. In the movie, TMITYS is presented as a villain, and we find out more about what he wants and how he knows about the Tucks. Bravo, Mr. Kingsley!\n\nOne last thought... (I know I said &apos;no spoilers&apos;, so I&apos;ll be as discreet as I can.) Don&apos;t let the ending disappoint you. I told my cousin the end of the movie and she said it was a terrible ending. It wasn&apos;t terrible. One character just made a choice. I strongly recommend this movie to people of all ages.",

The secondary characters were amazing. The chemistry was off the charts (of course, they are friends off screen). The plot was nothing special: we have seen this thousands of times. But Hilarie and Robert (Tyler, Danneel and Antwon) made it special for me.\n\nMy only complain was the loud music during certain scenes and the lack of scenes with Danneel and Antwon. I&apos;m pretty sure any Hallmark/Lifetime fan will enjoy it. But One Tree Hills fans will love it.\n\n(now give us a Joy and James movie please!)",

But the good part is that within the few minutes you will understand why this film had to be made. A person cannot stop his talent for longer. This is happening with Jafar Panahi, the Iranian director who is fighting with his government. He has to stay inside his house without making films and he might go to jail. In the middle you might feel a little bored because of no change in location but eventually you will understand his limitations and the desperation which caused him to make this.\n\nPROS: The film is slow but to some extend you will want to forgive for everything. He tries to make the documentary interesting by telling some of his previous films experiences and those are really amazing. His pet will keep you alive all the time. In few words, I would say that this is one of the best documentaries.\n\nCONS: Got a little bored in the middle.\n\nMessage: &quot;Don&apos;t stop because of obstructions.&quot; Verdict: &quot;A must watch documentary.&quot;",

But to compare this with those really good movies/series would be unfair. Unfortunately though, one of the biggest assets this movie could have, is not really in the front seat (literally).\n\nI&apos;m talking about Mark Hamill of course. The movie is also pretty decent in the beginning (having some other heavies in it, like Alan Ford), but does lack a stability to it. Characters seem exchangeable and you don&apos;t really care for most of them. The revelation isn&apos;t done properly, the effects seem decent (though there is nothing big on display here). Logic is thrown out of the window (no pun intended) and other things will annoy you too. Not completely bad, but descending pretty quickly (whatever you might think of the predictable ending).",

      "reviewBody": "With the gradual loss of his sight, Dr Alexander Thorkel calls out to other scientist to come to his deep jungle retreat to assist him. When Drs Bulfinch and Robinson arrive (with Stockton and Baker with them) they are astonished to learn he literally wanted them to confirm a sample with his microscope. Bulfinch is so annoyed that he refuses to leave and the group remain while Thorkel locks himself away in his lab. When Stockton finds some small bones, Bulfinch is excited at the discovery of a new species. However the whole group is even more pleased at the discovery of large quantities of valuable ore and deicide to take it for themselves. Mad with isolation, Thorkel prevents them from leaving and uses his research on his guests.\n\nI&apos;m surprised that so few people appear to have seen this film (judging from the low number of votes for it on this site) because it is a cool piece of Technicolor adventure with some impressive (for the time) effects. The plot is a bit clunky early on as it stutters to the premise we all know is coming when the visitors get shrunk. At this stage it becomes a bit more enjoyable even if it isn&apos;t as exciting and spectacular as I wanted it to be. This is perhaps an unfair complaint because of the age of the film and it does provide a small scale (sorry) adventure where the novelty value of the special effects tends to dominate the development of the story.\n\nIt is a shame because Dekker gives an intense and interesting performance in the title role. He easily towers over his co-stars (sorry) who are mostly pretty wooden and unconvincing. Halton is OK but Logan makes for a very unconvincing scientist. Her chemistry with Coley is poor as indeed he is as well, although Kilian has a bit of a stiff sway about him. As said before, the effects are the majority of the show and they are impressive.\n\nOverall this is a basic story that goes just where you expect it to but does have entertainment value. The effects are good for the time but, thanks to the heavy Technicolor, still retains a sort of retro cool for modern audiences. The cast aren&apos;t that good (although I did enjoy Dekker) because the material isn&apos;t there for them, but for what it is it is worth a look."

Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as &quot;Thin Man&quot; and in lesser vehicles. &quot;Confidential Agent&quot; is one of those lesser vehicles, yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway, despite lackluster direction, the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer&apos;s depictions as (respectively) British and Spanish, and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads. In some ways, this last &quot;problem&quot; actually begins to work in the film&apos;s favor, for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person&apos;s tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene&apos;s complex and guilt-ridden psychology, which pervades the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was compelled to watch, not by any great acting (although Boyer is marvelous as usual, managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness, tragedy, hope, and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes), but by the down-spiraling rush of one man&apos;s slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art, and thus cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere entertainment, and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. The lack of glitz, of &quot;bubble,&quot; of narrative &quot;bounce&quot; help to make this movie very worthwhile.\n\nAnd there is no happy ending, for history wrote the ending.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure it hasn&apos;t dated all that well, but look at this 1986 hit as a nice time capsule of L.A. from that time period. A period that basically ended with the sobering and terrifying riots of 1992. Down and Out in Beverly Hills deals with a well-to-do yet dysfunctional family having its priorities rearranged by a bum who first attempts to drown himself in their swimming pool. Nick Nolte, looking only a little scruffier than his 2002 Hawai&apos;ian shirt mugshot plays the Jerry Baskin character on different levels. Early on he seems much like the typical run of the mill schizophrenic homeless person chasing after a dog who found himself a better owner. Then, after his dunk in the pool, we see that he is actually quite intelligent and observant. Almost instantly he sees what is wrong with everyone in the household. He just can&apos;t seem to point any of that intellect toward improving his own situation. Even when it is laying there right in front of him.\n\nThe patriarch of the family is Dave Whiteman who embodies some of Richard Dreyfuss&apos;s better work. He is very successful, yet he it just too uptight. Something seems lacking for him. It isn&apos;t the appearance of the bum that sets him off. He actually is the one who most wants him to stay if perhaps to live vicariously through him in some ways. Bette Middler is on hand as Dave&apos;s sexually unfulfilled wife who mostly spends her time with worthless self-help gurus. She even has one hired for their cutesy little dog. Nolte is apparently the only man around who has what it takes to recharge her batteries in bed! The family has an attractive yet obviously anorexic daughter and an androgynous son. A sexpot Hispanic maid is also on hand for Dave to use at his will... that is until Nolte moves in on her as well. The film takes place over about a month&apos;s time and there really isn&apos;t much plot to speak of other than seeing how these characters are altered by Nolte&apos;s character.\n\nThe film has several funny moments, and thankfully Ms. Middler is not allowed to sing too much. The theme song by the Talking Heads is always welcome to the human ear. Some of the comedy, mostly involving the cutesy dog reactions and Little Richard&apos;s exasperated yelling are more annoying than anything else. There are some great performances and many funny observations about successful Angelinos at that time. Not much of a message to be learned from any of it, however. Maybe that is why it works. 8 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

      "reviewBody": "Documentary-style film. So a young person gradually sinks into depression, seeing the fast and pressing rhythms of life, really loses the meaning of life, doesn&apos;t know what to do. He follows what the doctors suggest, but all treatments are just symptomatic, they don&apos;t solve the problem... So he&apos;s thinking, if no solution is found, he&apos;s going to put an end to this at some point. So he accidentally hears about shamans and some plants in Latin America and decides to leave on his own, to make a journey to salvation. It&apos;s quite difficult, of course, to trust someone, since many just look at profit and don&apos;t offer a cure. So a long journey until he finds someone who can really help and doesn&apos;t look at profit. He will go through some stages that will make him not solve depression at once, but to be able to really start fighting it for the first time. A fairly interesting documentary-style film about depression and all the futility of so-called Western society, which is actually all developed countries. It is not its structure in the style of a normal film, but more a documentary about the journey to salvation. Definitely recommended and it&apos;s something different, it won&apos;t tire you at all.",

      "reviewBody": "A reason why many people believe films and politics shouldn&apos;t been together is the fact most films dealing with social political issues have in their nucleus the use of an abundant and wasted verbosity in which nothing is said, things are half done and the movie becomes other thing than a movie. Sometimes these movies get so preachy about a case that end up sounding idiotic, looks like they selling something to its viewers. And in the end, people who already don&apos;t care about the importance of politics in their lives will never understand it how influential this power is. Now, what &quot;Cristo Si è Fermato a Eboli&quot; (&quot;Christ Stopped at Eboli&quot;) achieves in its deeper premise is showing how politics have to do with the humblest people of a country and the way it affects them, mostly for the bad things since this is a film about Italy during the Fascist regime in the 1930&apos;s and 1940&apos;s. \n\nThe main character Carlo Levi (Gian Maria Volonté) is an exiled painter and also a medical doctor who helps the peasants of Eboli, a small village to overcome their daily problems by assisting them with some medical treatment (since the local doctors don&apos;t care about them properly) and listening to what they have to say. He&apos;s there almost like a prisoner, he can&apos;t write letters criticizing the government, can&apos;t read Montaigne, can&apos;t go outside of the city limits but he has some liberties here and there. And despite being marveled by the simplicity of the peasants life and how things work for them this is a man aware of the politics importance and still seems to, quietly, fight the Fascism on its own way, giving some trouble to the city mayor. In one of the most fascinating moments of the film, the poor cause a great commotion in the city hall, urging that Carlo must be their doctor, something he couldn&apos;t do it at the moment since the regime wouldn&apos;t allow him.\n\nAs being an observation to life rather than a dramatic picture, this Francesco Rosi&apos;s film is quite interesting when it gets to this social theme but it disappoints by going for too long and showing so less; scenes are quite distractive, long, some dialogs are uninteresting; and after seeing as a whole the movie didn&apos;t work as I expected, it was quite meaningless. I like slow-paced films but this is just too much. Volonté&apos;s performance is very good, he&apos;s very versatile, pleasant; the cast is quite good; the film is beautifully shot and the locations are wonderful but only that can&apos;t make a film better. One scene I&apos;ll hope to remember in years to come is the Christmas mass with the drunken priest who lost the paper with his nice speech, to later be found with him saying: &quot;This is a miracle from God. I&apos;ve found my speech.&quot; And what it turns out to be his speech? A denounce against the Fascist. It&apos;s a very funny memorable scene. \n\nIt&apos;s not a bad film, it&apos;s just a little weak. Worths a view for curiosity, for its themes and some good elements already pointed out in this review. 5/10",

Whitehead manages to create an astonishing level of intimacy with the world&apos;s premier rock band which would be unthinkable these days. Even the taciturn Charlie Watts is coaxed out of his shell and shares his feelings and philosophy (for perhaps the only time on film). Brian Jones&apos;s narcissism is palpable; A topless Keef displays his early mastery of the guitar jamming on &apos;Salty Dog&apos;. The scenes of fan craziness in the pressure cooker fame game of the early 60&apos;s are viewed ironically from a distance like &apos;A Hard Day&apos;s Night&apos; directed by Godard. The film also works now as a sort of social history of Ireland in the evocative detail of a vanished era. The occasional melancholy tone is one of the idiosyncratic touches that sets the film apart from any other pop doc. before or since.\n\nA personal highlight is the hilarious scene where Watts tries to take a cigarette from Wyman but is repeatedly outwitted by some painfully simple sleight of hand."

      "reviewBody": "Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. &quot;The  Avengers&quot; would have been that next &quot;big&quot; thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It&apos;s release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.\n\n&quot;The Avengers&quot;, which, at best, is a second rate version of the original &quot;Batman&quot; has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put &quot;Godzilla&quot; to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world&apos;s weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster&apos;s attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.\n\nThe cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn&apos;t even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, &quot;The Avengers&quot; is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn&apos;t look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won&apos;t enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it&apos;s strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director&apos;s cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it&apos;s way to video. Which I&apos;m sure will be soon.\n\nOut Of Four - **",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s Easter, and as my parents sit in the living room watching television with the volume turned up to 86, here I sit in my bedroom, typing a review for the movie we just saw, &quot;Big Trouble.&quot; It was my father&apos;s choice, a choice I assume he quickly began to lament, as the movie almost immediately begins with a scene of a man sucking the toes of his incredibly attractive maid. I mean, if you thought watching sex scenes with your parents was awkward, just try watching foot fetishism.\n\n&quot;Big Trouble&quot; is one of my dad&apos;s favorite comedies, and honestly, I can understand why. It&apos;s a breezy, quickly paced, and fast moving little flick that&apos;s charmingly irreverent and definitely unpredictable. With a surprisingly star-studded cast and everything from bumbling hitmen to a street full of goats to Johnny Knoxville trying to rob a bar, &quot;Big Trouble&quot; has enough characters and plot points to fill the first two seasons of a CBS television show. And somehow, the movie makes it work, most likely because of the overall bizarness of the story.\n\nBen Foster, Tim Allen, Zoey Deschanel, and Rene Russo all have parts to play in this film, including a laundry list of other stars too numerous to mention. And part of the fun of watching this movie was seeing who was going to show up next. All of them have their own role in this movie, and all of them get into scenarios so unrealistic, bordering on cartoonish, that at times this movie felt like a live-action Looney Tunes epsiode. But, and I hate to say this, it adds to the films charm. I mean, this movie is so out there that I guarantee you&apos;ve never seen anything like it. It&apos;s a very weird, almost surreal movie, but it&apos;s fun.\n\nThe overall bizarness of this story made it enjoyable for me to watch, and the one liners and running gags sprinkled throughout made me laugh harder than I expected. I&apos;m not as big of a fan of this movie as my dad is, but it had more than enough wackiness to keep me entertained throughout.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;God Told Me To&quot; is in many ways Larry Cohen&apos;s best picture, which probably isn&apos;t saying all that much to people unaccustomed to the confines of schlock cinema. Viewers who never watch anything that doesn&apos;t play at the local Cineplex will look upon this picture with a sense of mounting dread over the low production values and haphazard plot lines. I, however, am the Queen of Bad Cinema, and my realm contains a round table where Sir Cohen sits with Lord Herschell Gordon Lewis, Baron William Castle, and Sir Roger Corman of New Concorde. I can take the offering that is &quot;God Told Me To&quot; and pronounce it good and godly. And I will, because Michael Moriarty appears nowhere in this film. Cohen seems to have a thing for the squirrelly actor of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; fame, casting him in at least three of his major works--&quot;The Stuff,&quot; &quot;Q: The Winged Serpent,&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s Alive.&quot; After anxiously looking around for Moriarty&apos;s name anywhere near this film and not seeing it, I settled in for what I hoped would become a wonderful experience.\n\nAlthough far from perfect, &quot;God Told Me To&quot; is immensely entertaining. Did I mention I don&apos;t care much for Michael Moriarty? Here&apos;s a movie any B-movie fan can really sink his or her teeth into. Imagine New York City in the 1970s (I know, it&apos;s unpleasant, but do it anyway). The streets bustle with activity as people drive, walk, and ride their bikes to various destinations. Why, look there! Here comes a chap peddling along without a care in the world! Then we hear a shot ring out and the poor guy does a header into the pavement. Do angels ride bicycles? Anyway, more shots ring out and more people tumble to the pavement, presumably incapable of ever rising again. It looks like some guy channeling Charles Whitman is up on a wooden water tower playing target practice. Fortunately, tough cop Peter Nicholas (Tony Lo Bianco) assumes the highly dangerous task of talking the hunter down. He fails spectacularly, but before he does the gunman tells Nicholas that &quot;God told me to&quot; murder all of these people. This cop will continue to hear this phrase in the coming days after a devoted father slaughters his family, after a police officer (Andy Kaufman!) goes off the deep end during a parade, and after a few other highly unpleasant incidents unfold in the Big Apple. In other words, what we see happening here is just a typical day in New York City. What&apos;s the big deal? Well, Larry Cohen isn&apos;t content to merely let his movie founder in the degradation of the typical police thriller genre. No sir! What starts out as a series of seemingly unconnected crimes turns out to be something so sinister that the human mind boggles while attempting to conceive of it. Turns out Nicholas is a highly devote Catholic with a wife (Sandy Dennis) and a young girlfriend (Deborah Raffin) who feels as though he&apos;s different from everyone else. The whole &quot;god told me to&quot; thing finds the detective discovering exactly why he never seemed to fit in. His investigation into the crimes turns up reports of an immaculate conception years before, a shadowy cult that worships some nut named Bernard Phillips (Richard Lynch), and Mason Adams playing an obstetrician. Then things get really weird. Nicholas tracks down a woman who tells him a story he would rather not hear, complete with on screen flashbacks, about an alien abduction that took place years ago. Again, this type of stuff is par for the course in New York City, but you wouldn&apos;t know it by watching Detective Peter Nicholas&apos;s reaction. He races out of the building on a quest to track down the enigmatic Bernard Phillips, with good reason. The very future of the human race could well depend on our hero putting a stop to the supernatural shenanigans going on in his beloved city. Wow! \n\nI&apos;m not quite sure what to make of &quot;God Told Me To.&quot; The film doesn&apos;t fit in any single cinematic genre, so I&apos;m not sure it would appeal to fans of pure cop dramas, or pure science fiction, or pure apocalyptic films. You sort of need to transcend boundaries with this movie or you&apos;ll only end up liking chunks of it. I do think that Tony Lo Bianco did a wonderful job as the conflicted and tormented Detective Peter Nicholas. As proof of this assertion, I ask that you view closely the scene where he listens to the father talk about butchering his family. The rage slowly building in every fiber of Lo Bianco&apos;s being as he digests this string of spoken atrocities appears so genuine that I thought he was really going to deck that guy when he finally blows. So I guess you can say the acting isn&apos;t too bad. The special effects, on the other hand, ain&apos;t that great. You get a cheesy showdown between Phillips and Nicholas at the end involving a lot of camera shaking, collapsing walls, and flashing lights--hardly the stuff of big budget effects teams working with state of the art equipment. But ultimately, &quot;God Told Me To&quot; is entertaining because it&apos;s creepy and offbeat.\n\nCohen&apos;s films are seeing a big resurgence on DVD thanks in large part to Blue Underground. Included as extras on the disc are a commentary with Cohen, a poster and stills gallery, a trailer, a Cohen biography, and seven television spots. I learned by watching these extras that &quot;God Told Me To&quot; also went by the name of &quot;Demon,&quot; which often means that the movie tanked under its original title so the distribution company slapped a new moniker on it in order to release it somewhere else. If you want to explore the Larry Cohen canon, this picture is a great place to start.",

I really hope they release it on DVD with English subtitles because i don&apos;t understand German sadly.... I am (almost) willing to learn German just so that i can enjoy this film on DVD. It&apos;s that good :) The film is about this girl who is afraid to die, so she&apos;s taking a course preparing her for her death, and some strange vodoo man moves into her building. And if i remember correctly she&apos;s having an affair with her boss, or at least with someone who works with her, and it&apos;s a disaster... Her desperation and loneliness is easy to identify with, as well as her struggle for love and direction in her life."

      "reviewBody": "first off, this is low budget and the filming debut of this director (or so it seems). Judge it as that... of course it&apos;s not perfect, as the people behind it are still finding out which of their ideas work on screen and which don&apos;t. This film then, for the most part works, and if you think it over afterwards it works even better.\n\nYou gotta admire the vision and care that went into each of the 4 stories that each touch on a different side of the same subject: how humans relate to machines and then relate back to real life. The story about the comatose boy his mother and his action figures was especially touching, as was the one about the older man that just wants to die, both beautiful roles by the mother and the sculptor. It seems the director is at best when making a &apos;small&apos; story, he does it with a tenderness and visual power rarely seen. This leaves the actors plenty of room to present their characters in subtle ways and not having to carry the weight of the story by overacting.\n\nThe acting from the predominantly Asian cast is very good, and it&apos;s nice to see asians in a non-stereotypical role in American film. The imagery shows the low budget, but the locations are well chosen and it&apos;s well directed. The only weak point is when it gets exciting the director has trouble picking up the pace and really conveying the sense of fear and adrenaline the characters must feel. These moments are very sporadic (just one in the first story..my least favorite anyway).\n\nThis is a movie to watch, if you have an open mind and can relate to the people on screen. If you&apos;re looking for more traditional sci-fi themes.. look further. Calling this movie sci-fi just because it deals with robots is missing the point. This is more geared towards drama. And it&apos;s good.. especially for a filming debut. Definitely a director to watch for in the future. A man with vision, ideas and original stories to tell.",

The only problem with the film was that all the way through I was waiting on Nick Frost to make at least a cameo appearance - talking of which the David Walliams scene will bring a smile to those Little Britaners out there.\n\nGreat film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins with a retired gunslinger by the name of &quot;Shane&quot; (Alan Ladd) riding up to a small house somewhere in Wyoming to get some water. Although the owner of the ranch house &quot;Joe Starrett&quot; (Van Heflin) initially has no problem with this, his hospitality changes when some other cowboys are seen in the horizon riding toward him causing him to suspect that Shane is part of this group of men who have been harassing him and other settlers in the area. However, it&apos;s during the subsequent altercation with these men that Joe realizes that he has judged Shane wrongly and hires him to help out as a ranch hand. But what neither Shane nor Joe fully comprehend is just how badly a cattle baron by the name of &quot;Rufus Ryker&quot; (Emile Meyer) wants every last settler out of the area. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of the best Western films made during this particular time period due in large part to the new wide screen technique which captured the beautiful Wyoming scenery along with a couple of graphic scenes of violence enhanced by certain innovations which were introduced to audiences worldwide. Naturally, the special effects are much more advanced now but even so this film was not only enjoyable but clearly ahead of its time as well and for those reasons I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",

      "reviewBody": "Dharmputra (1961) : Brief Review -\n\nSevere Hinduism against its own blood with an identity crisis amidst a partition backdrop. Too much mess to handle for young Yash Chopra. Yash Ji debuted with a bang with the classic &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; (1959), where a Muslim man adopts a Hindu child. Dharmputra sees a swipe as a Hindu family adopts a Muslim woman&apos;s child. I somehow didn&apos;t like the idea that both films showed the mother of the child in a bad light. &quot;Jawani ki Galti&quot; or &quot;Jawani ki Bhool&quot; can&apos;t be an excuse for an educated girl and a boy. If they were uneducated and lusty, it would have been a different case. Mala Sinha plays that woman in both films. For a change, in this film, she is happy that her son has grown up to be a good guy, but as a Hindu extremist. DKP played a masterstroke by keeping the character as a kid because then we have to teach them what they don&apos;t know. Dharmputra lacks that innocence and hunger for knowledge. Half the film is already over when you see the lead actor of the film, Shashi Kapoor, a Muslim boy who is brought up by a Hindu family and is unaware of his identity. He is an extremist Hindu leader who wants to eliminate Muslims from society, not knowing that he himself has Muslim blood in his body. That&apos;s the only trick this film gets right, while the rest of the narrative seems too messy. Young Yash Chopra tried to join the scattered pieces but didn&apos;t really get what this gutsy story deserved. I am not saying that Dharmaputra is a bad film, or even an average film; it&apos;s a good film, but it does not match Chopra&apos;s previous classic &quot;Dhool Ka Phool,&quot; which attempted a similar topic from the other end. The film won a national award, and I don&apos;t wonder why. The kind of topic it tackled was too risky at the time, even though we had Chhalia made a year ago. Nevertheless, it is stuck to the &quot;Unity&quot; message, and that might have wowed the people then. In my opinion, as a cinematic outing, it could have been better.\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Berlin Affair&quot; is worth seeing, but you should be aware that it&apos;s far from great. This is because the story seems choppy...as if some things were left out of the story. It also leaves the viewer a bit confused...as if they somehow missed something.\n\nPete Killian (Darren McGavin) is some sort of agent for some sort of spy-like agency. You really are not sure if he&apos;s exactly a spy or more like a mercenary or what have you. And, you really are not sure who he&apos;s working for and what they represent other than they are headquartered in Geneva. These folks have an assignment for Pete...to locate some old friend for them. Why? And, why do many people want this guy? You&apos;ll just need to see and try to piece it together yourself. This made for TV movie is part spy-type picture and romance, as Pete romances a girl in order to hopefully find his target.\n\nOverall, this is a decent but confusing picture. McGavin is fine and the international locales are nice. But the story isn&apos;t 100% satisfying.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Berlin Calling&quot; is not a documentary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that would be &quot;Berlin Falling&quot;. Nor is it a documentary on the 80&apos;s New Wave extraordinaire band Berlin (smell a severe case of &quot;biasism&quot; since it is my all-time favorite band), that would be &quot;Berlin Hailing&quot;. The &quot;Berlin Calling&quot; I am referring to is the powerful independent German film &quot;Berlin Calling&quot;. Professional Trance Music Disc Jockey Paul Kalkbrenner stars as D.J. Ickarus, a passionate &amp; talented German trance spinning musician who also spins too many methamphetamines, hallucinogens, and narcotics in his daily social tunes. D.J. Ickarus drug-addiction downfall lands him in a Berlin psychiatric center, which Ickarus finds too icky for his taste. Ickarus does cause havoc in the psychiatric center a la Jack Nicholson&apos;s character in &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot;. Rita Lengyel effectively plays Mathilde, Ickarus&apos; devoted but gradually frustrated girlfriend who tries excessively to help Ick get out of the icky ills of his drug addiction while at the same trying to salvage his career. Corinna Harfouch psyches up her acting portraying Professor Dr. Detra Paul, the authoritative psychiatric center director who is a cross between Nurse Hatchett and Dr. Phil. She feels that Ickarus is a danger to others and possibly himself so therefore she pulls her own mental control spins on him. Kalkbrenner&apos;s performance as Ickarus was mind-boggling and put me in a trance of acting endowment. Moreover, the multi-talented Kalkbrenner&apos;s musical trance mixes caused me to want to get on &quot;The Metro&quot; and go &quot;Dancing In Berlin&quot; in Kalkbrenner&apos;s Tranceylvannia village! Writer-Director Hannes Stohr has many compelling and masterful plot lines &amp; visuals stored for you in his imaginative film-making orchestration of &quot;Berlin Calling&quot;. An innovative narrative of the music trance environment captured in film-making has been long overdue. I was elated that Hannes had the upper hand in its origination! &quot;Berlin Calling&quot; also called to my attention its chart-topping cinematography, art direction, and of course musical score. Hannes&apos; &quot;Berlin Calling&quot; screenplay was also quite a comedic but yet gripping one that did not need &quot;No More Words&quot; to be regarded wordy adequate. I did have the pleasure to experience &quot;Berlin Calling&quot; at The Miami International Film Festival in March 2009. Hopefully, a film studio distributor will sign up the film so everyone could be in the mix to the surreal cinematic art form of the brilliant &quot;Berlin Calling&quot;. ***** Excellent",

      "reviewBody": "OK, I never saw Mary Carey in a porn film till after I saw her on &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, probably a mistake for my appreciation of her sexual performance.\n\nI have some serious doubt about the ethics of Dr Drew Pinsky televising any medical treatment, and about the ability of addicts to give informed consent for him to do so, but I do think he is trying to effect the best outcome he can for his patients in this situation.\n\nSo Mary Carey, having been treated for alcohol abuse, swore off porn. She never did quite get it that she couldn&apos;t keep drinking, and kept trying to weasel a way to not give up the sauce.\n\nSo, not surprisingly, she had to fall back on porn to make a buck. That in itself is a little sad, but I could live with it. One of my favorite porn stars, Christy Canyon has just returned from her 6th or 7th retirement. What really distresses me is that Mary decided to make a porn parity of her treatment. Had she no respect at all for the effort that was made on her behalf, or no concern for legal risk this might put her in? I should know better, she&apos;s an addict, of course not.\n\nNow all of that aside, the sex, with the exception of one scene, was fairly dull. Mary herself stuck to girl-girl which I could care less about. Penny Flame (later a much more successful Patient in &quot;Celebrity Sex Rehab&quot;) wins the prize for most ironic performance. The only scene that got a rise out of me was a MMF threesome, ruined in the end by the actors pretending to pass a coke vial during the sex.\n\nI guess I&apos;m getting old, I don&apos;t go for porn just for the sheer taboo-breaking nastiness anymore, if I ever did. I like to watch people have sex that they seem to enjoy, I don&apos;t need to see anybody spit on, hurt, or verbally abused. If a performer finds that porn is bad for them, I support their decision to stop, no matter how much I may have enjoyed their performances.\n\nFor another view on leaving porn check out Penny Flame&apos;s blog &quot;Becoming Jennie&quot;. Maybe someday Mary Carey can become Mary Beth again.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen tons of movies and read many critics in IMDb, but this is the first time I find a film so touching that leads me to write an opinion about it. On start, &quot;Rati&quot; is a pun: it means &quot;Tira&quot; (&quot;Shoots&quot;) written backwards; a funny name for cops, referred to their unofficial motto &quot;shoot first, ask later&quot;. The title summaries the whole film, a journalistic documentary, well carried and with the director as protagonist. Piñeyro takes a journey through irregularities, lies and the horrific plot around the famous case of Fernando Carreras. Conclusions perfectly illustrate the reality of Argentina&apos;s police and the concept of &quot;justice&quot; that prevails in some state institutions, shown with both humor and indignation. Mixed with TV reports, interviews and real images of the trial, this piece of art constitutes a rarity: a political but objective film, mixed with breathtaking moments, where no artificial ingredients are needed since truth prevails by its own weight.",

Those who appreciate great acting in a movie won&apos;t be disappointed. (Did you ever see a movie Edward Norton was in that he wasn&apos;t absolutely great..well, maybe a couple that he may have did for the just the money..lol. His absolute best was &quot;American History X&quot;) The movie itself moved along a pace that one keeps looking at his/her watch waiting for the ending. And the ending, again, is the latest Hollywood type...it sucks. Storyline was interesting but never got you interested to a point where one found it entertaining. This was a 98% dialog movie. You could be listening to this entire movie and never watch the video portion and understand the entire script. I am a big fan of Norton and Jovovich but this movie I could have passed on.",

He also struggles with coming of age, as he finds he has feelings of attraction to a girl. \n\nThe story has a slower pace, allowing us to really experience and contemplate the daily life of this boy and his poverty-stricken family. Their struggles and the oppression they face feel more meaningful because these things are not exaggerated in the name of drama, instead realism is the focus.",

It is a gripping story, one that unfolds like a well-told drama, all the better because it is true! It is touching, frightening, uplifting, romantic, all the trademarks of a good story. The filmmakers do a great job of weaving pictures, audio and live interviews to tell a story that happened 50 years ago. It is very moving to hear the actual voices and words of people that were involved in the story. There is a movie coming out next year by this same production company, based on this story. Be watching for it, it promises to be a gripping and high-quality movie. This documentary is a film for the whole family."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m an Iranian, but I&apos;ve never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I&apos;m a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can&apos;t really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady&apos;s previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director&apos;s success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.\n\nAsghar Farhady&apos;s obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge&apos;s seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I&apos;m almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.\n\nDespite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I&apos;m pretty sure it won&apos;t be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).\n\nAfter seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady&apos;s success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",

The principal of the school,is a detestable man who abuses students and teachers equally. You&apos;ve seen the plot before, of course, and some of the characters are &quot;stock&quot; sorts. But the acting of the lead, the teacher who &quot;saves&quot; the students by luring them into singing, is portrayed charmingly by Gerard Jugnot. Mostly bald, a bit stocky and no beauty, he is nonetheless disarming. The boy soprano, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, has a wonderful voice, and the chorus is splendid. Particularly fine was the score, almost entirely original, by Bruno Colais. I was looking for something inspiring on this bitter cold inaugural day in the U.S. Les Choristes made my spirit soar and reaffirmed that kindness, generosity of self and the gift of music still have the power to change people&apos;s lives.",

Surprisingly, it seems it was filmed state-side, so that may explain why this effort looks a little better than many of their Bulgaria films. Some of the special effects aren&apos;t bad for what was a low budget, and the movie is shot and lit fairly well. Still, I was disappointed with this movie. Although I was not offended by the opening as some viewers will be (the movie was made BEFORE 9/11), the movie manages to feel rather flat and surprisingly not exciting despite all the chaos that happens to the protagonists. Those who think this is one of the worst films ever made simply need to expand the amount of movies they see, so they can see real turkeys. Though as I said in my summary line above, I still wouldn&apos;t recommend the movie to anyone."

When he finally awakens, he discovers that his once-demure and squeaky-clean girlfriend (Raquel Alessi) has apparently dropped her abstinence-only policy in favor of a career as a Playboy centerfold model. His best buddy, the goofy Tucker Cleigh (nicely played by Trevor Moore), decides to spring Eugene from the hospital where he&apos;s undergoing physical therapy and drive across country to the Playboy Mansion to help the recently awakened young man get a second chance with his girl.\n\n&quot;Miss March,&quot; co-written/directed by Cregger and Moore, is another one of those seemingly limitless sophomoric raunch-fests that have been flooding the cineplexes ever since &quot;Animal House&quot; hit the fan back in the late 1970s. The jokes - which mainly center around poop and physical disabilities - range from the clever to the just-plain-stupid, with the ratio, unfortunately, weighted far more towards the latter than towards the former. However, almost in spite of itself, the movie still manages to generate a few good-natured laughs from time to time. And though he doesn&apos;t have much going for him in the acting department, Hugh Hefner does have a good time parodying himself in a cameo appearance late in the movie.",

She is traumatized and chops up his body and sticks it in the fridge. She tells no one, and is unable to cope with what happened. Soon, she&apos;s finding empowerment by using the gun to dispose of any man that may potentially take advantage of her or other women.\n\nI am not a fan of the rape/revenge genre, but this compelling film miraculously manages to avoid exploitation on nearly every level. The rape scenes are disturbing but fortunately not as explicit as in many genre movies. While the content of &quot;Ms. 45&quot; is obviously over-the-top and exaggerated, it manages to retain a sense of dignity that rises above tacky movies like &quot;Baise Moi&quot; and &quot;I Spit on Your Grave.&quot; Zoe Lund is incredible as the lead actress, depending on her versatile facial expressions to portray what mental state the character is in.\n\nMy Rating: 7.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "😱 First Impressions: From the synopsis I thought it&apos;d play out from the victim&apos;s perspective when she befriends the old lady for the first time. I was genuinely surprised that Ann instead was the main star.\n\nPros: 😋 Actress who plays Ann is very brilliant- she immediately exudes all the characteristics that make her character to be &apos;off&apos; the moment we see her. It does not wear off until the credits roll...\n\n😋 The story is well written and I could feel immense sympathy for the main character / antagonist. Who is mentally unstable yet emotionally (and financially) manipulated by the girls that ironically she eventually preys on.\n\n😋 There are some very unusual kills in the movie. A constant air of creepiness and threat that never unsettles because you know never know what might happen next.\n\nCons: 😪 I had some reservations about the way the movie jumps back and forth between the past and present. Sometimes it does so without indication (which is great) but others it blatantlys uses a &apos;rewind&apos; effect which just spells it out for the audience.\n\n😪 The plot while quite original- I could actually see coming; a whole hour away when it came to the fate of the first girl. Yes, it&apos;s still shocking when it is eventually revealed but I thought it could have been handled better.\n\n😪 The child actors and actresses sometime just ruin the scenes. That&apos;s not to say they don&apos;t shine either! They have their moments especially the actress who plays Alice who is probably the oldest among the children so it&apos;s understandable. Nothing too distracting though~\n\n😇Verdict😈 I thoroughly enjoyed the unnerving and at the same time melancholic story of Ann. The pride and effort she takes in maintaining her collection is frightening. The only issue I had were some qualms about the direction and creative decisions. Overall, a solid thriller with a memorably developed antagonist who just for all we know needed some therapy and pills. It&apos;s so sad.",

Without computer imaging, green screens, or fast-paced fight scenes, the movie relies on old-fashioned costumes, sets, and extras to bring the travels to life. It is also the film that brought the idea of &quot;cameo&quot; appearances to the movies-famous stars (including Ronald Colman who came out of retirement for his &quot;role&quot;) appeared in small roles delighting audiences...a practice that is continuously used today.\n\nStarring David Nevin in his favorite role as Phileas Fogg and the popular Mexican star Cantinflas in his first English-speaking role as Passepartout (a Frenchman in the book, but rewritten for the comedian), Around the World in 80 Days is an exploration of the world, adventure, and transportation in the late 1800&apos;s as filmed in the 1950&apos;s-full of stereotypes and scenery.\n\nAlthough by today&apos;s standards, the movie can seem slow and silly, the role that this movie played in the future of film cannot be denied.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the second feature film by Dror Shaul. Set on an Israeli kibbutz Bet-Gvurot in 1974, this provocative film explores life on the kibbutzim in its most hilarious and dark forms. Dvir (Tom Steinhof) is an adventurous 12-year old who protects his mother Miri (Roni Yudkevitch), a single parent who is emotionally unstable. Miri forms a long-distance romance with an older man in Switzerland Stephan (Henri Garcin). When Stephan comes to visit, Miri emerges from her darkness and for an instant, her life shines. When Stephan&apos;s actions bring him into conflict with the leadership of the kibbutz, he is banished and Miri regresses. Dvir&apos;s brother Eyal (Pini Tabger) goes off to fight in the Yom Kippur War and Dvir is on his own and restless as he approaches his Bar Mitzvah. The film paints an unflattering image of life on the kibbutz, raising issues such as alcoholism, promiscuity, and acute isolation. When Shaul offered an advance screening at a kibbutz in Israel, they were reportedly shocked and offended. A poignant and funny film with a bitter-sweet ending.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Painted Skin",
      "reviewBody": "Based upon the classic literature of Liao Zai, Painted Skin is an adaptation of one of the stories that dwell on fox spirits. If you&apos;re someone expecting either a supernatural spook fest, or an amalgamation of ghosts and kung fu, you might be disappointed to find out that it&apos;s actually a romance through and through, with complicated relationships all around that you can weave a complex web of love and lust amongst the players involved.\n\nChen Kun plays Wang Sheng, a general whose army recently overrun the camp of a group of barbarians. In their battle, he rescues a beautiful girl from the grasp of the enemy, and brings her home out of pity and suggestive lust, given that she looks like Zhou Xun. OK, so Zhou Xun plays Xiao Wei, who unknowing to everyone else, is a fox spirit (touted always as beautiful beings in their human form) with an appetite for human hearts in order to maintain her beauty and youth.\n\nThus begins a tussle for General Wang&apos;s heart by both Xiao Wei and Vicky Zhao&apos;s Pei Rong, who is the dutiful and demure wife of Wang Sheng. Pei Rong is indeed wary and beginning to suspect Xiao Wei&apos;s supernatural abilities when a spate of killings surface with her arrival, but with no proof, Xiao Wei starts to sow discord between the man and wife in order to try and become the new Mrs Wang. It&apos;s quite an interesting attempt through the characters to tell of the varying degrees and types of love, one of possession in Xiao Wei&apos;s ruthless means to reach her objective, and one of sacrificing for the love and well being of the other half, as established through Pei Rong&apos;s selfless courage.\n\nBut that&apos;s not all. Throw in Donnie Yen as an ex-general Pang Yong, who also shares the hots for Pei Rong, and one time rival of Wang Sheng for her affections, a bumbling lowly ghostbuster Xia Bin (Sun Li) who is in possession of a fabled mythical weapon (opportunity to show off some special effects here, and quite a sight to behold too in its temporal usage) and denying her affections for Pang Yong, and Qi Yuwu as a lizard spirit whose infatuation with Xiao Wei ensures that she gets her fair share of food without the need to get her hands dirty. Connected the dots yet?\n\nFans of Donnie Yen will probably be a tad disappointed by his limited screen appearance, and for the most parts he&apos;s either playing the joker, where his jokes will likely be lost in translation, going by the English subtitles that didn&apos;t manage to truly capture the essence of his lines, and the remaining screen time having to see him execute some action, but nothing groundbreaking and not seen before. We know what Donnie Yen can do, and perhaps in seeking some form of redemption, the story has a flashback scene where he dons armor yet again (anyone remember the dismal result of An Empress And Her Warriors) and does battle in a scene which Jackie Chan has already stamped his authority on.\n\nOne could have expected the Gordon Chan is familiar with shooting decent action sequences, but you don&apos;t really get a lot of that in Painted Skin, save for some generic rooftop chase in the night, and a be all and end all finale where no punches got pulled, though it really got marred by all the tight shots that all you&apos;d probably get to see is a blur. The narrative also got a little choppy in the mid section, and you do feel that a huge chunk of detail got summarized to keep it running generously under two hours, with subplots dropped that I suspect involved the growing affection and admiration between Pang Yong and Xia Bin, in order not to distract the audience from the main love triangle of Pang Yong, Xiao Wei and Pei Rong.\n\nAll in all, this is recommended for Zhou Xun&apos;s face off with Zhao Wei, especially with the former playing the temptress role to perfection. The last where we saw two prominent Chinese actresses square off was between Zhang Ziyi and Gong Li in Memoirs of a Geisha. Otherwise, Painted Skin held a lot of promise, but didn&apos;t deliver that level of oomph in its final product, lapsing into mediocrity throughout.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1956 Doris Day was cast in Julie between two of her best pieces of work, the highly dramatic Alfred Hitchcock thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much and her best musical The Pajama Game. Usually those two films are either or both listed on Doris Day&apos;s top ten. Julie never is.\n\nThere was nothing new by 1956 in leading ladies marrying psychopaths, Ingrid Bergman had done it twice already in Rage In Heaven and in Gaslight. But both of those films were intelligently done while Julie goes into the hysterically melodramatic.\n\nDoris is cast in the title role in Julie as a woman with an obsessively jealous second husband in Louis Jourdan. Louis married Doris after her first husband committed suicide and about all there is to recommend him is that he&apos;s a great concert pianist. But after another pathological outbreak Day seeks some solace with an old friend in Barry Sullivan. And she&apos;s determined to leave Jourdan and give him the slip.\n\nBut Jourdan is one grimly determined psychotic. When she returns to her old job as an airline stewardess, Jourdan stalks her and ends up on her first airline job. After that things get real interesting over 15,000 feet. \n\nJulie actually won two Academy Award nominations, the first for original screenplay. Impossible for me to believe but as Casey Stengel used to say in baseball, you can look it up.\n\nThe second Oscar nomination was for Best Original Song. That year Doris came out a winner of sorts because while the title song Julie didn&apos;t win Doris came home a winner with Que Sera Sera, a much better song from a much better film.\n\nThe over the top melodramatics throughout the film made what could have been a spine tingling climax into something quite camp and quite laughable. I won&apos;t reveal what the midair climax is, but just to say that it could have worked under different circumstances.",

How the cop, the girlfriend and the assassins all interrelate is the film. I didn&apos;t know whether director Benny Chan was serious or not. Chan a good director (New Police Story) for the most part though occasionally he tries to do too much and the pieces don&apos;t come together (Rob B Hood). Here nothing seems to work and it all seems like a TV movie. The action isn&apos;t real, its done for artistic effect- the early strangulation where the victim claws the paint of the truck for example.Whats worse its laughable- the sequence where our hero finds the picture of his lost girl in his car and takes his foot off the brake while on a steep incline had me howling. Actually I just gave up on the film and jumped to the end. For me its one of the real disappointments I&apos;ve seen recently, even if it does have a couple of good sequences-the plastic bag fight for example.",

      "reviewBody": "Frente de Madrid (1939), feature film by Spanish director Edgar Neville , shot in Italy in a double version. During the Spanish Civil War, a Falangist (Fosco Giachetti ) battling in the University City is ordered to tour Madrid posing as a Republican militiaman to deliver a message to a leader of the resistence Amalio (Juan de Landa) . Once the order is fulfilled, he takes the opportunity to visit his fiancee (Conchita Montes) , she is under the protection of the father of his maid, a faithful Republican opposed to the purges who lives on Serrano Street. Things go wrong when the Falangist returns to the University City, and he is seriously wounded and takes refuge in a hollow in which is also injured a young Republican .\n\nEdgar Neville was called in by the Bassoli Brothers in Rome to bring to the screen his novel set during the Spanish Civil War and that had been published in Italy. The title of the Italian version is Carmen fra i Rossi and it had practically the same team, unlike the main protagonist, who in the latter case was not Rafael Rivelles but Fosco Giachetti. The Spanish version of the film is lost, while the Italian version was recovered and shown at the XX Ritrovato Cinema Festival in Bologna, in July 2006. Attractive but sad war film dealing with a nationalitst soldier passing beyond enemy lines on the Republican front in a destroyed Madrid . It has a message of sacrifice against a fraticide war , understanding the futility of a civil confrontation , and ultimately redemption . As the main issue of the movie is the dangerous mission of the starring who disguising as an anarchist militiaman has to deliver a message to a head of the resistance and also take the opportunity to visit his girlfriend Carmen, who lives under the protection of her maid&apos;s father, a Republican however, then the soldier returns to Ciudad Universitaria ; he is seriously injured; and he takes refuge in a hollow with another soldier who is also hiding, subsequently together they will spend the last hours of their lives, . Main starring Fosco Giachetti and Conchita Montes give nice performances along with a notorious plethora of secondaries as Juan de Landa, Blanca de Silos , Carlos Muñoz and special mention for the always sympathetic Manolo Morán.\n\nThe motion picture was competently directed by Edgar Neville , who also wrote along with his sweetheart actress Conchita Montes . Neville , Count of Berlanga de Duero , was considered to be one of the best filmmakers in the Francoist time . He was a notorious playwright , screenwriter and director , standing out the following movies : La torre de los siete jorobados 1944 , La vida en un hilo 1945 , El crimen de la calle de Bordadores 1946 ,El traje de luces 1946 , Nada 1947 , El marqués de Salamanca 1948 , El último caballo 1950 , La ironía del dinero 1955 , El baile 1957 , Mi calle 1959 . He also made documentary as La Ciudad Universitaria, Juventudes de España, Duende y Misterio del Flamenco. Cante Jondo, among others .",

      "reviewBody": "What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980&apos;s and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.\n\nAll in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80&apos;s films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80&apos;s.\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10.",

This was when she was sixteen. So naturally, she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. Other than that, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate, in character, and cute. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute, PG movie that I throughly enjoyed because I, unlike most people my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or profanity.",

A few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find Augustine, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of Jonathan&apos;s family.\n\n&quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; is a strange movie about a weird young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family to not forget them that seeks the past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to USA. This bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family that owns an amateurish travel agency specialized in helping Jews to find missing relatives, and together they have an almost surrealistic road-trip through the country of Ukraine. The movie begins like a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Uma Vida Iluminada&quot; (&quot;An Illuminated Life&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS&apos;s P.O.V. series. It&apos;s based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, Tintin&apos;s creator, from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comic books. Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge&apos;s dreams. I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children&apos;s Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn. My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham&apos;s Treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn&apos;t get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them. I do have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge&apos;s death. Haven&apos;t read it yet. This film also covers the artist&apos;s personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07-I&apos;ve now read Breaking Free. Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he&apos;s staying with. The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly. They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact. Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless. Oh, yes, dog Snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running over the police!) and the dedication page.",

The technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory.\n\nSome of the following may have significant spoilers.\n\nEven as a youngster, I knew the premise is silly. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (though loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that, the &quot;cabin&quot; (the area with the controls, whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the &quot;correct&quot; orientation (so that when they landed, why didn&apos;t they land standing on their heads?) and where, at least in near-earth space, the rocket engines had to be running continually -- with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer. When the engines quit, the rocket stopped _dead_ in space, and couldn&apos;t start going until a PhD chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer. This time, the rocket recalled it had momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they&apos;re near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew such a minimum-energy trip would take over 200 days).\n\nThey land, find the air was breathable (though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). They decide to camp outside the ship, and even build a campfire. They come armed, even though they were supposedly going to the Moon, where firearms wouldn&apos;t be needed.\n\nThey get a sight of a collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians who look just like people, develop an anti nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to get back to the home planet, and die in the attempt by crashing on the Earth! To do that would require such a long orbital period, they&apos;d have died of starvation long before approaching their destination.\n\nThe film it preceded, Destination Moon, used real science most effectively (even though their &quot;rescue&quot; with the Oxygen Tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank&apos;s center of gravity to the output nozzle). This film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it&apos;s on a par with the old Flash Gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals, and whose engines were always on.\n\nThe story on this one I considered banal, and I can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes.",

      "reviewBody": "On the surface, this is a simple yet moving love story. However, through its twin protagonists, this film explores our relation to the past and how various parts of it may be idealised, suppressed, or distorted, in part based on our assumptions about others that usually go unstated and unchallenged. This latter point is reinforced through a subplot involving (female) Itsuki&apos;s grandfather and a past tragedy.\n\nThe film is very striking visually, in turns showing sweeping landscapes and intimately detailed portraits. Emotions are at times powerfully conveyed by a camera movement accompanied by a well chosen musical score. The limited use of a hand-held camera jarred with the serene beauty of the rest of the film, which no doubt was the intent, but I found it to be a minor distraction.\n\nAll in all, a very poetic missive delivered to us by the skilled hand of Shunji Iwai.",

I start wondering if my taste of movies is that bad because most of the time when people hate it I love it. But then again I&apos;m not the only weirdo because my wife liked it as well. Okay the actors might not be the best ones you will ever see, even though I don&apos;t think they gave us a bad performance. On the contrary I enjoyed the acting. But what I enjoyed the most was the story. Very entertaining to watch, everything I search for when I want to watch a movie about aliens. Suspense, evil aliens, conspiracy theories, all ingredients were there to make it a nice movie. And that&apos;s what it was to me, a nice movie. I will watch it again in the future.

      "reviewBody": "First, let&apos;s talk about the acting: it sucks. Jen Dance is annoying. Shaun Paul Costello doesn&apos;t ever actually act. Chelsey Garner just runs around. David Bonner is over the top at times and a little unbelievable in the role he is given, and that makes Brian Gallagher WAY over the top (a killer in hunting boots...OH NO). Chris Ready gives an average (key word is average) performance. Nikki Bell doesn&apos;t belong in ANY movie EVER because she can&apos;t act and is also good to laugh at. Seriously, I don&apos;t even think she could be in an adult movie where you don&apos;t even need to act. And Matt Nadu just stands around looking pretty. \n\nNext, let&apos;s talk about the special effects: laughable. Was that tomato sauce or ketchup? I like Lauren Palmer&apos;s review below (evidently she did the effects). Her work is about as good as her grammar and command of the English language, which is to say VERY BAD. Next time you give your own movie a 10/10, make up a fake name or something.\n\nThen, let&apos;s talk about the editing: Who did this? I especially like the &quot;party scene&quot; where the same footage is just played over and over again. It&apos;s day. Then it&apos;s night. Then, it&apos;s day. Then, it&apos;s morning. Then, we skip day. Then, it&apos;s night again. I CAN&apos;T KEEP TRACK.\n\nIt&apos;s 77 minutes long. And 77 minutes too long if you ask me. It&apos;s boring. And I laughed through most of it, which you aren&apos;t supposed to do in a horror movie. I especially laughed when Brian Gallagher delivers his never ending speech that belongs in some classroom, not in a movie.\n\nThe blooper reel is proof none of these people should be making movies, and it&apos;s sad that they said this was their &quot;best shot&quot; because then you know they are really bad at this.",

      "reviewBody": "Joan Crawford is a jewel thief trying to break into society in &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney,&quot; a 1937 film from MGM also starring William Powell, Robert Montgomery, Nigel Bruce, Frank Morgan, and Jessie Ralph. It&apos;s a remake of a 1929 film which starred Norma Shearer. Crawford is a sophisticated and glamorous woman we first meet on board ship as she&apos;s maneuvering and flirting her way into the company of a society crowd. While doing so, she meets Lord Arthur Dilling (Robert Montgomery). He and Lord Kelton (Morgan) pursue her. Once in London, she wangles the one thing that she and her gang of thieves (led by William Powell as her butler) have been waiting for - an invitation to Lady Ebley&apos;s country home, and a crack at Lady Ebley&apos;s fabulous pearl necklace. All doesn&apos;t go as planned.\n\nGiven the star power, the film has some interesting moments, but for the most part, it&apos;s played too straight. A lighter touch was needed. This is perhaps a directorial problem (there were several) or the fact that Joan Crawford was better at drama than at comedy, and William Powell better at comedy than at drama. Powell does a great job, but it isn&apos;t much of a role. Audiences probably left the theater disappointed - perhaps part of the reason the film flopped at the box office. He doesn&apos;t have a lot to play off of, and no chemistry with Crawford. Robert Montgomery is his usual self in one of those roles that fit him like a glove, but the star trio is too somber.\n\nJoan Crawford looks fabulous, and with a strong director who had a concept of the script, she would have been fine. She didn&apos;t have a grasp of playing comedy, but she was a hard worker who seemingly took direction well. It&apos;s a shame MGM spent all that money on what was a first-class production only to have it just lay an egg. Apparently some of the racier parts of the play version had to be left out due to the code. At times, the film drags.\n\nSeveral of the comments blamed Crawford, some the script, but I do believe with the right director, &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheney&quot; could have been a lot better.",

      "reviewBody": "Not being familiar with any of the &quot;Dead Space&quot; games, or the first animated movie, I have nothing to compare this to, so this is all by what I thought of this 2011 animation.\n\n&quot;Dead Space: Aftermath&quot; had a nice enough story and it was easy to follow. The story is about a small group of four survivors who are rescued after a tragic occurrence, but now they have to tell their stories to people who seem to have little regards for their well-being. As I said, not being familiar with anything prior to this animated movie, then I have no idea how true or far from the original plot lines this movie is. The storyline was nice and well told.\n\nHowever, the solid storyline was brought down tremendously as they had opted to use various styles of animation and art styles. Most of these, sadly enough, were not in my personal liking, and thus it brought down the enjoyment of the movie for me. Especially the CGI animation, that was just horrendous. It looked like it was released before they had applied the finishing touches to it. In my opinion, then &quot;Dead Space: Aftermath&quot; would have fared better had they opted to stay with just one style of art and animation (in my opinion, the style they used when they were telling doctor Cho&apos;s story).\n\nAs for the voice acting, well then I think they really did manage to put together a good group of people for the voice acting. So that was really working out well for the movie.\n\nI am sure that this 2011 animated movie is a great thing for fans of the games, but it failed to fully ensnare and captivate me. I am giving &quot;Dead Space: Aftermath&quot; a 5/10 rating because of the story alone, the different art styles and animation styles was the knife that killed it off for me.",

Some locations familiar to spaghetti western fans are revisited, the cast is full of familiar faces like Frank Brana and Lorenzo Robledo, and the always charismatic Garko leads the way as Bryan, a decent man crazed by the rape and murder of his wife by renegade Union deserters. No longer a believer in justice he turns against his rescuer, Daniel, the man who dragged him out of his burning house, and takes up a life of crime. Daniel, on the other hand, becomes a sheriff and vows to bring Bryan in. As they say, complications ensue. One of the problems with Taste of Vengeance is that Garko is just too good as the villain; you tend to like him more than Sean Todd (Ivan Rassimov), the good guy, who frankly is written a bit bland. Music is nothing to write home about, and some of the English dialog sounds stilted. Garko gets crazier and crazier and by the dramatic shoot out at the end I really didn&apos;t care too much how it ended up. One point; at the beginning Bryan takes a bullet to the stomach as his home is invaded. He passes out and when he wakes up, having been rescued by Daniel, his wound is miraculously healed, and never mentioned again. Sloppy film-making, but partially redeemed by a strikingly filmed ending. For SW enthusiasts only."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;My Gal Sal&quot; is not an unpleasant musical, but it gets a more lavish treatment than it deserves. It&apos;s a typically fictionalized musical biopic, with Victor Mature playing Paul Dresser, a popular Midwestern songwriter of the &quot;Gay 90s.&quot; (For younger readers, that&apos;s what the 1890s were called, though the description had to do with high spirits, not sexuality.) Rita Hayworth is Dresser&apos;s love interest and the title character. Several of the songs in the movie were not even the work of Dresser, though the title song is. As the movie notes at the beginning, Dresser, born Dreiser, was the older brother of famed novelist Theodore Dreiser, author of that grim classic &quot;An American Tragedy.&quot; The screenplay is supposedly based on Dreiser&apos;s reflective essay &quot;My Brother Paul.&quot; But if it were, this film would be a bit of a drag: Paul Dresser&apos;s fame was fairly brief and he died young, and Theodore Dreiser never wrote anything light. Hollywood was wise enough to make up some harmless stuff, pick a beautiful leading lady and play it all for fun."

      "reviewBody": "I love scary movies, and I really love &quot;scary&quot; movies-- from Blair Witch to Paranormal Activity, I&apos;ve always been a huge fan of shaky cameras and found footage. Ghosts and aliens scare me, and classic terror tropes work wonders on me! Things jumping out from behind other things and unexpected screams are my idea of a fun movie night.\n\nIf you are looking for a scary movie with aliens as the focus, I would recommend picking up Dark Skies, or John Carpenter&apos;s The Thing... but not Area 51, because this is a terrible film. I put it on expecting to be shock-scared, or at least creeped out... but all I got was progressively more and more annoyed.\n\nThe first half of the film does absolutely nothing but establish that the viewer should lack empathy for the main characters-- they are vapid young men who enjoy drinking, planning ineffectively, and disrespecting professional entertainers.\n\nThe second half of the film is meant to heighten the viewer&apos;s anxiety and presumably scare us, but it falls disappointingly short in that respect. Instead it devolves into lots of running and flailing, lots of awful camera work, and terrible physical acting. When the end finally comes, it&apos;s more a relief than anything else.\n\nThe only positive thing I have to say about this movie is that the main characters&apos; treatment of their female colleague was basically respectful, which is more than what I can say for most movies that are structured in the &quot;x number of guys + 1 girl&quot; model. Nobody grabs her breasts or calls her disgusting names or belittles her intelligence based on her gender. That&apos;s awesome.\n\nThe rest of the film? Really not so much.",

      "reviewBody": "For starters, I&apos;d like to thank the many reviewers who so astutely point out that, in fact, dinosaurs and humans did not co-exist. What a startling revelation--why didn&apos;t someone hip us up about this sooner? Now if they can maybe tell us how to spell DUH...\n\nThis film will appeal to fans of the celebrated &quot;cavegirl-meets- caveboy&quot; genre. Its time-honored, trademark conventions are all there, the stop-motion animated dinosaur effects artistry, and general ambiance of geological upheaval and turmoil, and of course the primitive Stone Age language they speak (with its all- English phonics). Hokey? You bet. But... this genre is refreshing in general for its unflinching, unpretentious attitude about the sexes and human relations, plus its visual celebration of physical beauty as an icon of attraction. There is an exuberant defiance of repressed, &quot;post- modern,&quot; pseudo-intellectual nerdiness in this genre, which fans rightly admire and appreciate. These films are not for Oprah, nor NPR.\n\nOf course, &quot;One Million Years BC&quot; with Raquel Welch is the definitive epic of this type. &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled...&quot; is not quite as taut by comparison, but it still delivers. The dinosaur scenes are generally good, even if none of them have quite the punch of some of those from &quot;One Million Years BC.&quot; Likewise, our leading cave lady Victoria Vetri is Very Nice, and indeed racks well in her cavegirl outfit, but for sheer screen presence she cannot really compare with Raquel. \n\nIn fact, the cavegirl bikinis here have a bit less of the magnificently rough-hewn deerskin-rawhide look of &quot;One Million...&quot; But they make up for it as best they can by actually being even skimpier (hard to imagine, I know...). And Victoria and her cavegirl cohorts do a prodigious amount of running, jumping around, and just general jiggling, putting the best foot of these unbelievably teeny weeny bikinis firmly forward. For this film, its what&apos;s up front that counts, big time. I must say, those guys at Hammer studios sure do know how to costume, light, and photograph their cast. By the way, the guy&apos;s outfits are also extra skimpy (not sure what they were trying to prove with that exactly). Nothing offensive though, it is all within tasteful limits. \n\nCompared with &quot;One Million Years BC,&quot; there is a generally lower energy, less crackling intensity to &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled...&quot; The themes are intact, though -- we still get the catfights and violent interpersonal antagonisms over pecking order ranks, and access to mates that made &quot;One Million ...&quot; such riveting fun. But the characters here are not quite as sharply drawn compared to the standard set in &quot;One Million...&quot; They seem a bit pale--not as much personality, not as much charisma. That goes double for the guys, none of whom could have taken on single-handed the rowdy carnivorous therapod of &quot;One Million...&quot; that attacks in the orchard, the way John Richardson did. In fact, the guys are all pretty much a bunch of putzes in this movie, its hard to root for them. But still, if you liked &quot;One Million Years BC&quot; you will definitely want to take in this one, just don&apos;t expect it to be quite as good.\n\nPerhaps the only aspect in which &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled...&quot; surpasses &quot;One Million Years BC&quot; is in its extensive use of bear tooth necklaces. Everyone has got them, and they are totally stylin&apos;...."

Unfortunately that bit of reality which audiences in 1946 knew well that keeps The Mask Of Dijon from becoming a top flight melodrama. The cheapness of a PRC production also doesn&apos;t help.\n\nThey combine to defeat the incomparable Erich Von Stroheim who is playing a formerly great magician with an insane jealous streak that makes Othello look well adjusted. His Desdemona is Jeanne Bates a nightclub singer who runs into her old accompaniest William Wright who persuades her to come back and take Von Stroheim&apos;s rusty magic act as a package deal.\n\nWhat both don&apos;t know is that Von Stroheim has been studying the art of Mesmer and he&apos;s going to use that to settle old scores, real and imagined. I can&apos;t say much more, but I will agree with another reviewer who did love the ending that Von Stroheim met.\n\nWould that the rest of the film was that good.",

      "reviewBody": "DAISY CHAIN is another example of how you can take a sow&apos;s ear and make it much worse through tinkering. This star-studded German junker is rendered unwatchable by the typical pornmeister approach of adding American-shot footage and new wraparound material.\n\nBut it&apos;s not converted into porn -that might have been entertaining. No, it has a disgusting host/narrator Steve Eckardt pretending to be a sexologist, to turn the light farce into a pretend-white coater. The setting is pointlessly shifted to Paris, probably to capitalize on Catherine Deneuve&apos;s presence in the cast and an obvious diss to Germanic cinema.\n\nThe four segments, with suitably lovely leading ladies, are wildly different in tone, but all of poor quality (admitting of course that they would have played better in German rather than the dubbed version I&apos;m reviewing). Rolf Thiele&apos;s segments are unfortunately not as sexy as his porn classic GRIMM&apos;S FAIRY TALES FOR ADULTS, concerning here some very tired bedroom farce involving Curt Jurgens as a philandering orchestra conductor who outwits his wife, played by the classy Nadja Tiller (way too classy to be in this film). Other Thiele effort has Catherine Deneuve pulling a Brigitte Bardot nude-from-the-rear scene as a sleepwalker married to of all people Gert Frobe.\n\nA game Anita Ekberg whose bath runs over, becomes involved with next door neighbor Peter Alexander, a major Austrian star who stinks in this assignment for German helmer Axel von Ambesser, who was banished to directing TV after this clunker. He did a quality film THE GOOD SOLDIER SCHWEIK several years earlier, however.\n\nFor the American version a 4th segment titled &quot;Dorothea&quot; by Alfred Weidenmann was apparently dropped, and substituted is material from some other film which I haven&apos;t been able to identify supposedly directed by Rolf Olsen, featuring (judging from the credits) Blanche Aubrey as Laura, a ditzy blonde cheating on her old husband, with two (count &apos;em, two) guys hiding out under her bed.\n\nEckhardt introduces these four segments as case histories and a few brief &quot;Love American Style&quot; bawdy vignettes are tossed in to kill time. It&apos;s an indigestible, bad, bad package."

Up to now, this film was only available from VHS recordings of AMC&apos;s Film Preservation Festival from 1999. \n\nAfter being called back to their ship during liberty in Shanghai, the sailors of the S-13 are struck by another passing vessel and sink to the bottom of the ocean. While waiting to be rescued and with oxygen levels dwindling, the men of the S-13 fight for their lives and sometimes each other in suspenseful anticipation to see who will make it out alive. \n\nIn addition to Ford&apos;s direction, the cast of characters makes the movie an enjoyable experience and makes you care for each of their fates. Kenneth McKenna as the Naval officer with a secret, young Frank Albertson as a rookie ensign who is unexpectedly thrust into being a leader for his men, Warren Hymer as a ruffian sailor hiding a heart of gold, young Stu Erwin as the S-13&apos;s radioman and Ford stock player J. Farrell McDonald as the old navy veteran. Be on the lookout towards the end of the film for young John Wayne as a radioman up on the surface. \n\nThe film has been restored for Fox&apos;s MOD DVD release and I&apos;ve never seen it clearer and more beautiful. Kudos to everyone involved in getting this film restored and released because it&apos;s a true unsung gem in John Ford&apos;s very long directorial career.",

      "reviewBody": "Reading the reviews of people who didn&apos;t appreciate this movie, I am struck by the complete void that must exist in their brain where there is supposed to be some semblance of artistic appreciation, intelligence, and creativity.\n\nBill Hader and Conan O&apos;Brien brought me to this film, based on their endless love and support for the film. It does not disappoint and is a tour de force for how to make an ambitious, fantastic, and exciting film based on the smallest possible premise - a man stuck in a room.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but I struggle to comprehend how much of an idiotic Luddite you must be to not understand how good a film this is.\n\n&quot;The shots are repetitive&quot; because Hitchcock was the first director to use these shots, which became so iconic, they were copied everywhere. This film was made in 1954 and has shots that would be at home in 2024. That is how ahead of his time Hitchcock was with his directorial style.\n\nTruly a lesson on how to take the smallest possible premise for a plot, a man stuck in his apartment, and spin it into a deep, evocative, and compelling story about a murder mystery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood has plenty to complain about, but this film is indicative of a bygone era that we can only hope to return to. We just don&apos;t have directors like Hitchcock anymore, able to create a film so ahead of its time.\n\nIf you are whining and complaining about not understanding this movie, maybe go back to watching the Fast and the Furious movies, maybe that is more on your level. Considering that excellent writing, directing, and production don&apos;t seem to be your forte.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very clever movie, made with serious intentions, coming out with both a funny and serious side to it. I am talk about the Julia Roberts drama, Something to talk about&apos;. I have seen many movies that look into the issues concerning relationships and infidelity, such as 2002&apos;s, unfaithful&apos;. Yet this film looks at a different side of the problems that can hurt a relationship and also shows that one couples problems can be the talk&apos; of the town. \n\nGrace Bichon has a picture perfect life. She helps manage her father&apos;s riding-stable and has a great husband and little daughter. That is until she discovers that her husband Eddie is deceiving her with another woman. After confronting him in the middle of the night on the streets of their small home town, she decides to stay at her sister Emma Rae&apos;s house for a while, to make up her mind. Breaking out of her everyday life, she starts to question the authority of everyone, especially her father&apos;s, thus causing a stir in her parent&apos;s marriage, too.  \n\nWhat a great story this film has. I love the way that the audience get the chance to experience what a place it is that poor Grace has to live. It also shows that being part of a relationship is not an easy thing. Another clever addition to the story is the use of gossip, which is perfectly incorporated and performed by the movie&apos;s actors. You really believe that this town&apos;s people want to know what is going on in the lives of the Bichon family&apos; and that is ultimately why it was called Something to talk about&apos;. This all being said, the film has many characters that I did not like, which is credit to the film&apos;s story, allowing me to actually like it. The screenwriter for Something to talk about&apos;, is Callie Khouri, who did a film last year, that I want to see, called Devine secrets of the Ya-Ya sisterhood&apos;. Callie wrote a most enjoyable script from where I see it.\n\nThere are flawless roles from all involved in the movie. This movie&apos;s main star is a gal I like, that being Julia Roberts. I remember reading that someone said Robert&apos;s needed to do this movie, to save her career from going down the wrong path. Well she shone in this most likeable of roles. I love the way that her character goes through so many emotions, especially the hot-headed temperament, but for good reason. I had to laugh when Grace is so abrupt, asking all her friends at a meeting, has anyone and everyone in the town been sleeping with her husband. The next line is priceless.\n\n The men in Grace&apos;s life are not so great. Husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is in a most uncomfortable of situations, which he put himself in. Eddie is upstaged by Grace&apos;s sister, Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick), who brings Eddie to his knees. Then add in the scene when Grace tries to get revenge on her husband. It is a movie that shows Eddie has done many things wrong. What Grace does might seem a little extreme, but I have no doubt that hurt people will go to such lengths to feel better about themselves and their situation. Grace&apos;s father, Wyly King (Robert Duvall) is a man who cares not so much for his family, but more about the disgrace one of his daughter&apos;s will bring to the family name, reputation and business. I was shocked when he blurts out All of our friends complain about how their kids grow up and run off and they never hear from them anymore. Why the hell can&apos;t that happen to us?&apos;\n\nDirector Lasse Hallstrom did a good job with this movie. He certainly seemed fascinated in making a movie which shows how dysfunctional a family really can be, and on more than one level in this film. There was also one name that came up as a bit of a surprise to me in the casting credits, that being Goldie Hawn. She was executive producer of the film, and in some way, you can feel the comedic touch she brought to the film. \n\nSomething to talk about&apos; hit home personally for me, as I have been part of a family break up, via one parent being unfaithful to the other. It is very hard for kids to understand what is going on when parent&apos;s relationships are disintegrating right in front of them. I have resigned to the fact my parents will never be back together again, but this film shows that not all relationships are a lost cause as I am sure they are not. Julia Robert&apos;s role in the film was so compelling from where I see it, as she was well within her rights to be as upset as she was. Her role justifies to me, why she is a star in Hollywood today. I guess the only downer for me in this film was the language, which I found just a little slack and disturbing. Roger Ebert said in his review of the film: that Something to talk about&apos; is the kind of film where you start out wondering how all these people are related, and end up knowing all to well&apos;. I could not agree more, but I guess that is what you get when people start to gossip and talk!\n\nCMRS gives Something to talk about&apos;: 4 (Very Good Film)"

Kong and Baldy managed to reprimand the brother/sister duo, but all were later apprehended by the authorities and sent to a prison in China.\n\nThis movie starts off pretty good with the daring heist by the brother and sister, but things get later meshed up with all the chaotic scenes of King King and Baldy trying to reprimand the thieves to the boring prison scenes in China. The movies relies a lot on slapstick silliness and forced action, leaving little room for suspense, though there are still some neat action scenes. Samuel Hui and Karl Maka seemed too over-the-top in their roles and Leslie Cheung and Nina Li Chi didn&apos;t have great chemistry. The absence of Sylvia Chang&apos;s Supt. Ho character was sorely missed. Overall, the weakest of the Aces go Places movies.\n\nGrade C-",

      "reviewBody": "The closest you can get to Lewis Carroll&apos;s Through the Looking Glass in French is by watching Mortelle Randonnée. It&apos;s a haunted classic a stellar noir and a fatherhood fable rolled into one. You thought you got that one right, Hollywood? Let&apos;s take a trip down memory lane, thirty three years ago.\n\nThe movie is Shakespearean but mundane. It includes the best giallo murder not filmed by Argento. It does not end well. It is devastating, devastatingly so.\n\nThe original material is a pulp novel by Marc Boehm, titled The Ice Maiden. Hollywood remade it with Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor as The Eye of the Beholder (1999, obviously losing the paternal dimension. The movie is about what you see and what to refuse to see; what you chose to see instead. Scopophilia and fantasy, spectacle and dream.\n\nMain character The Eye (Michel Serrault, formidable), is tasked by his bitchy boss, the fantastically named Mme Schmidt-Boulanger (Genevieve Page, a monument to French diction) to follow and report on the heir of a Belgian shoe-making dynasty. He soon discovers said heir has been victim of a praying mantis (Isabelle Adjani), whose neuroses reflect his: she&apos;s lost her father and him his daughter. Only at the end of the movie those two will come across and both will die, one symbolically. A feel-good movie it is not, even though it ends on a soothing note.\n\nThe Eye is jaded by a job too easy for his capacities. One look, just one look, case closed. But the Ice Maiden proves to be a tough nut to crack, leading him off track, across Europe and within himself. His opening monologue is anything but a conventional voice-over. It deceptively sets The Eye as a man in need. He&apos;s not. It&apos;s all crosswords for him, enigmas piled on riddles. He&apos;s looking for meaning. He won&apos;t find any, or only of the darkest kind. A quantum of solace, too.\n\nIt starts in Paris by a carousel and drifts from there, under the pretense of PI work. If you speak French, the movie is delectable from start to finish : it was the last one to benefit from the work of dialog- writer Michel Audiard, father of director Jacques Audiard and author of some of the most cultish sentences in French cinema. It&apos;s the French version of screwball comedy, both elegantly written and playfully delivered. Actors here do not miss a syllable or a comma for effect. It&apos;s clockwork, respectfully served by director Claude Miller.\n\nThe Virgo, symbol of the sweetness of things is revealed as a Capricorn, symbol of winter. In the novel horoscopes played an important role and so do they in the movie. Lucie (the light), as she is first introduced, bumping on The Eye by a carousel, has no plan. She is adrift, as he is. The eye has to travel, so he will follow her, fuming but enthralled.\n\nShe seduces men and kill them singing La Paloma (the dove), another virginal deceit from a witch. There is a lot of blood on the first murder scene. The Eye decides to let it slide and they embark on a not-so-merry-go- round. She&apos;s now Eve, another maiden. She reaches the peak of her trade: &quot;A mink! Emeralds! What a nice companion you are!&quot; she enthused before killing a second guy she was engaged under a third name. She&apos;s a child, she has no ethics or guilt. She&apos;s a go-getter, whatever it takes.\n\nGuilt is on The Eye&apos;s side after he kills a blind man (ha!), the Ice Maiden&apos;s true love (Sami Frey, dashing). It&apos;s a sacrifice he will regret to exert and try to cope with, to no avail. It&apos;s a zero sum game, a lost- lost. But still they go, relentlessly, from a daylight version of Malcom McLaren&apos;s Madam Butterfly video set in Baden Baden to Rome, where the sacrifice takes place.\n\nThe way it spirals downward from there is too painful to tell. A very dark comedy, Mortelle Randonnée is as venomously funny as it is tragic. It leaves a strong, bitter after-taste. One has watched this movie repeatedly and can&apos;t get tired of it. It&apos;s a tantalising object, much too dark to be watched but through the looking glass, and it&apos;s impossible to forget. Impossible to un-see.",

      "reviewBody": "This truly lavish melodrama really knocked me out. I simply did not find any significant weaknesses to this film, at least none of which others have alluded. Films of this type can easily become maudlin, insignificant, and flat. However, &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; is the result of a set of elements that are incorporated vibrantly. The film simply has a grand sweep to it, lifting it high above many others of this genre.\n\nThe staging and sets (in conjunction with Ory-Kelly&apos;s costumes) are as good as any movie that I&apos;ve seen, along the lines of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, or &quot;Long Day&apos;s Journey into Night&quot;. The use of silence and spaciousness, along with noise and density, is brilliantly carried out and is extremely well-balanced by the characters&apos; non-verbal responses to each other. It&apos;s hard to describe without providing details of given scenes - I would suggest that you watch it with this perspective and see what you think.\n\nSpeaking of scenes, length is the common enemy of films of this type, but not here - each scene plays out like a shining entity that still provides momentum and underpinning for the entire story. I counted at least 12 very memorable scenes. Humor is added strategically to most scenes to balance the starkness of the story and is nicely understated to avoid a sense of camp. Director Vincent Sherman has polished each scene like a diamond, and the effect is very powerful. The scenes really do stand on their own almost like a set of montages.\n\nBette Davis&apos; performance is decidedly affected as she plays Fanny as a young girl, but the pure talent and visual power of this actress makes one believe that she is truly the beauty that she is supposed to be. Notice how her movements and responsiveness reinforce the sense of someone almost 15 years younger than herself. While others have complained about the makeup of the older Fanny in portraying her change in age, I found that the makeup perfectly embodied the older Fanny because Davis plays the character so consistently to her advanced age. I would place this performance in Bette Davis&apos; top tier, along with &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, and &quot;All About Eve&quot;.\n\nClaude Rains plays the title character with restraint, integrity, and great love for Fanny, but the sense of pathos that he communicates really helps to give the movie a lot of power. The other acting performances are uniformly excellent, particularly Walter Abel as Cousin George. Without the strength of Abel&apos;s characterization, this would have been a far weaker movie.\n\nFranz Waxman&apos;s score has been criticized by some as being extravagant and overly dramatic to the point of being startling. I really enjoyed it - Waxman incorporates a lush late romantic style that has a stronger &quot;classical-music&quot; feel than other scores for movies of this type, which tend to emphasize strings as accompaniment. The result is a feeling of complexity which shades the story along with the other elements.\n\nThis is easily Vincent Sherman&apos;s best work, one of Ernest Haller&apos;s best, and one of the best melodramas that I have seen. 10 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Knocked Up is a comedy about pregnancy, love, and marriage, that has far more intelligence and emotional depth to it than somewhat its flippant title would suggest. Ben (Rogen) is a layabout bum who lives with his stoner friends, &quot;working&quot; on a celebrity porn movie website. Alison (Heigl) has just been promoted at E!, and when she heads out to celebrate, their worlds collide with disastrous and of course hilarious consequences.\n\nThe comedy is clever and insightful, loaded with little self-referential moments and pop culture references (the Munich one is particularly awesome), and while it occasionally veers toward the puerile, the movie&apos;s subject matter ensures that the humour remains considered and intelligent for the most part. The performances are outstanding, but not just in terms of comic timing. Rogen appears built for this sort of balanced role as he realises that he has to grow up to meet the challenges of relationships and parenthood, and Heigl is just as effective as she learns to accommodate Ben&apos;s lifestyle and releases her grip on her career. The support from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann is also brilliant. While their conflict-ridden marriage doesn&apos;t make them the greatest of role models for Ben and Alison, it certainly provides lots of laughs, and the clashes between Mann&apos;s overly paranoid Debbie and Rudd&apos;s laid-back Pete provide an interesting projection of how Ben &amp; Alison&apos;s relationship could turn out.\n\nThe Rudd &amp; Rogen moments make for some of the movie&apos;s better lines, but their humour is finely balanced with that emotional depth that I mentioned before, making the characters far more than punchline machines, which benefits the movie immeasurably. The awkward intimacy of Ben &amp; Alison&apos;s almost-forced relationship also provides touching and comic moments, as Apatow examines what happens &quot;when life doesn&apos;t care about your plan&quot;. Even the serious, emotional scenes are laced with a sort of ironic, bittersweet humour, which again gives the characters a sense of realism but also makes the movie that bit more comfortable and reassuring.\n\nA subject that could have been treated with a crass touch, Apatow remains in tune with his previous effort, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and chooses to focus on the impact the pregnancy has on the lives of the characters, allowing their actions and interactions to create the comedy as they come to terms with their new situation. His light touch makes Knocked Up touching, insightful, and very, very, funny.",

      "name": "Acceptable Walter Hill film with action-packed, thrills , shootouts and lots of violence.",
      "reviewBody": "Jimmy Bobo (,Sylvester Stallone) is a tough and relentless hitman from New Orleans who, after his last job, suffers an unexpected attack by Keegan (Jason Momoa), an unstoppable killing machine who ruthlessly executes anyone he has as an enemy or for whom he is hired. Determined to take revenge, Jimmy will be forced to collaborate with Taylor Kwan (Sung Kang) , a Korean police officer who has his own agenda, but who does not dispense with the expeditious means of his partner. He will soon discover that Jimmy is the most effective weapon to put an end to a criminal organization that has corrupted the police and the high and powerful social spheres of society. When Taylor is injured, Jimmy carries him to his daughter Lisa (Sarah Shahi) to heal him. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and scheming Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Revenge never gets old !.\n\nThriller crime containing unstopped action, betrayals galore , violent events with murders in cold blood , high body count, twists and turns. Regarding a New Orleans hitman who after watching their respective partners die, forms an unstable alliance with a Washington, D. C. detective in order to bring down their common enemy. Lots of slam-bang action, swearing, shooting and there is graphic violence as well as other convenient elements with no much sense, at times it seems too similar to Hill&apos;s previous films. Sylvester Stallone stars in the big screen adaptation of the popular graphic novel of the same title illustrated by Colin Wilson. Directed by veteran Walter Hill carries out a professional film, the stars are pretty decent, but everything is predictable . Sylvester Stallone provides a nice and effective interpretation in his usual style as an ace hired killer suddenly falling into the hands of a cop, Sung Kang , and both of whom join forces against a nasty, malicious enemy . There are enough colourful roles in the support cast delivering attractive acting, it also features performances by: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Sarah Shahi, Jason Momoa, Christian Slater, Jon Seda, Holt McCallan, Brian Van Holt, Weronika Rosati, among others.\n\nIt packs functional and atmospheric cinematography by cameraman Lloyd Ahern II, Walter Hill&apos;s regular. And thrilling musical score fitting to action by composer Steve Mazzaro. The motion picture was professionally directed by Walter Hill , though here he hasn&apos;t improved his previous thrillers , resulting in an intriguing and acceptable story but inferior than others Hill pics. Walter Hill said he wanted to have fun with the action genre, he stated the following: &quot;We&apos;re not breaking new ground. We&apos;re trying to be entertaining within a format that&apos;s familiar. There&apos;s a kind of ice skating that goes on where you must let the audience know that you&apos;re not taking yourself too seriously. But at the same time, the jokes are funny but the bullets are real. The jeopardy has to be real. When it gets outlandish, there needs to be no drift into parody - self-parody, maybe inevitable for old directors&quot;. . The veteran craftsman Hill is a good writer , producer , filmmaker who has made a lot of films of all kinds of genres , working from late 60s , early 70s to nowadays . As he has directed action movies as ¨Hard times , The driver , Southern comfort , The warriors , Extreme prejudice , 48 Hours , Another 48 hours , Last man standing , Johnny Handsome , Undisputed, The Assignment¨. Science fiction genre : ¨Supernova¨ . Western: ¨Geronimo American legend¨ , ¨Wild Bill¨ , ¨Long riders¨ . Comedy : ¨Brewster&apos;s millions¨ . Terror : ¨Tales of the Crypt¨ . Musical : ¨Crossroads¨ . Rating 6/10. Passable and decent but no notable.",

The &quot;villains&quot; are larger than life (terribly polite Rupert Everett as the monkey-abusing jewel thief, plus Faye Dunaway all but waving a wire hanger as the ultimate Evil Boss), the kids are cute without being gooey, and Jason Alexander does a good job as the hotel manager, playing it straight but enjoying the ride (the long climactic scene, with a mano-a-mano fight in the hotel kitchen, is the closest thing to a live cartoon). Hiss as mean Lord Rutledge threatens the monkey! Cheer as the fat guy falls on top of a frosting-smeared Dunaway! Laugh as the crazy red ape dresses up in lingerie and blows kisses at himself!"

      "reviewBody": "This coverage of the 1981 edition of Theater of the World festival, made by acclaimed director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, swings between a series of performatic arts and play along with a serious criticism of the state of art of theater made by French actor Antonin Artaud many years before those performances. Of the 30 groups that performed in the event, 14 are shown in this piece, and while I cannot be critical of what they do since it&apos;s all too fragmented and zero context is given about them, I can be critical of this exact material as made by Mr. Fassbinder and it breaks my heart to say it&apos;s a big disappointment (my first with him, so far).\n\nI don&apos;t think the documentary genre favored the director so well, as it&apos;s such a disjointed piece with little input from him that it becomes confusing in what is trying to do. While the many art performances/plays are presented, the voice-over during the acts keep criticising theater as becoming decadent, soulless and no longer reflecting important life issues of its era - consider that Antonin&apos;s words were written way before those acts since he&apos;s a thespian from another era. You may remember him for his role in Dreyer&apos;s &quot;The Passion of Joan D&apos;Arc&quot;.\n\nAnd for all the excitment and some breakthrough acts of a contemporary 1980&apos;s Germany and the new theater scene that came, it feels as if Fassbinder (a playwright of his own too) is being critical of a moment and a group of which he didn&apos;t belong and felt they&apos;re not being authentic with what they&apos;re doing. The juxtaposition of everything doesn&apos;t work while the images celebrate new performers and new playwrights, the words coming from someone else only reveal that this art is dying and in need of a &quot;plague&quot; to rebuilt itself - the text makes a valid and interesting comparison between a plague and the theater, and how both can be destructive forces that also help creation, allow new things and new ways of life to exist.\n\nIn terms of presentation it was a quite confusing thing to see as we aren&apos;t given the exact content and contexts of the play and performances; Mr. Fassbinder instead of making chapters presenting a little about what&apos;s shown each time they succeeded one another, he gives us a typed list of the 14 acts right in the opening, as a Kraftwerk song plays in the background. The plays and acts are all very expressive, some are really fascinating and memorable to watch (Pina Bausch was there) but just seeing the titles and way before the act makes it all too vague and lost in confusion (unless you know exactly what is shown, but even so it&apos;s just fragments). I&apos;ll only highlight the play with the naked couple and their bizarre act because the soundtrack was hilarious, with a repetitive criticism on theater (voice over) and a same song piece kept repeating over and over like a scratched vinyl.\n\nRWF used the critiques of another, but the ball is thrown back at us: is the art of theatre dying? Are there still things to be shown, staged that can cause a revolution in our lives or is there a chance for us to see anything groundbreaking on stage? Or it does need to collapse once and for all in order to be reinvented? Same questions we apply to the art of cinema, as a great majority already say that movies are dead and are only a repetition of itself. I won&apos;t say that any art form is dead, it&apos;s just going to a lenghty lethargic process that sometimes wakes up from time to time to show new things or reflect whatever the historical period we are living - not much of an interesting one but it&apos;s what we have.\n\nAt the time of this piece, RWF also made &quot;Lola&quot; and &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, two great films but I&apos;m not sure about the exact order of how those three were made. I&apos;d like to think he was comissioned to make &quot;Theater in Trance&quot; rather than developing all by himself as he usually did. It&apos;s just something to do, get busy (as he was an workaholic) and get fundings for future projects - being &quot;Querelle&quot; a possible result, his final. But if he had a final saying on evertything, then the blame was on him. Pity that I couldn&apos;t enjoy it more. 5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Confusion of Genres&quot;--the title of a previous Duran Cohen film--is a good way to start looking at this one. The two main genres being &quot;confused&quot; this time being (screwy) romantic comedy and (peripheral) spy story. The take on relationships both social and professional is consistently wacky and the laughs are many. A spy-counter-spy hunt for a USB drive computer file that has something to do with illegal uranium trading is one plot line; the other is the intermingling of the students of Eve (Evelyne Kirschenbaum), an opera singer who gives voice lessens in her Paris apartment. The two plots are joined in a single big tangle when two partnered French intelligence agents, Muriel (Marina Fois) and Philippe (Lorant Deutsch), are commanded by their haughty boss (Dominique Reymond) to join the class in order to spy on the widow of a recently murdered banker/uranium dealer, Constance Muller (Jeanne Balibar). She may know where the USB drive is.\n\nSomething of the droll Gallic ill humor perfected by the team of Agnès Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bakri has rubbed off on Duran Cohen. Most of the characters are kvetches, except maybe Constance, and except that this time they all can sing, or try to. And their kvetching is consistently amusing. This film isn&apos;t a masterpiece, but it&apos;s fun to watch.\n\nThe director says &quot;I like characters who don&apos;t take their own story seriously, they refuse to get totally involved with their destiny because they are either scared or refuse to grow up, although others always catch on to them, forcing them to shatter their cynicism.&quot; It goes without saying that Muriel and Philippe have sex, but Philippe isn&apos;t really interested, and Muriel annoys him and turns him off by constantly fretting about growing older and getting wrinkles.\n\nIt&apos;s not always clear whether these two are tracking the other singing students or just getting embroiled with them, because everybody&apos;s looking for sex, or love, or a mate. They think their fellow voice student Anna (Caroline Ducey) may be connected with the Israelis or the Russians. Rejected by Philippe, Muriel becomes interested in voice student Julien (Julien Baymgartner), a male prostitute who is having sex with Constance&apos;s sister-in-law Noemie (Nathalie Richard) and also the hairy gay &quot;bear&quot; and radiologist-terrorist Reza (Frederic Karkosian). And Reza and Noemie are in cahoots with each other. Julien is worried about getting old too--he&apos;s 29, ancient for a hustler. At a moment when everyone unloads before a class, Muriel reveals she wants to have a baby. Eve&apos;s oversensitive son Joseph (Guillaume Quatravaux), despite his lovely voice, wants to give up singing and leave his mother and her classes.\n\nAll his may be too complicated to follow, but it&apos;s held together by Duran Cohen&apos;s sense of rhythm, and by the sublimely ditsy Constance--that is, Balibar--who has no clear-cut direction in life--at the end she will drop opera singing for pop and enter a French variation on &quot;American Idol&quot;--but nonetheless is mellow about everything. It&apos;s she above all who helps us to understand Duran Cohen&apos;s idea about people not taking their story too seriously. And obviously the hunt for the computer file isn&apos;t more important than each person&apos;s search for happiness. Or a good blow job, or anal sex. (There&apos;s male frontal nudity, and some droll sex scenes.) Jeanne Balibar is ditsy, but with inner composure. It&apos;s a combination that&apos;s hard to explain, but very appealing. I&apos;d never really understood Balibar&apos;s appeal till this film; now I get it. If she was annoying in Rivette&apos;s &apos;Duchess of Langeais&apos; (though many loved her), in this you want to hug her, or at least I do. Constance is naive, and doesn&apos;t even know what a USB drive is. Or is she? Or does she? For Balibar agnostics like myself, this is a revelation; for believers, it takes her up a notch. Her naturalness and subtlety with the other actors are astonishing.\n\nPhilippe Lasry and Noemie Lvovsky collaborated with Duran Cohen on the writing, which keeps things too complicated without it really mattering. I don&apos;t know who among the various cast members is doing their own singing, but there&apos;s plenty of enjoyable music, and some beautiful voices, and even some nice piano playing. Constance not only has a large, attractive apartment in Paris, but a Steinway. I guess this shows that a French sex comedy can be funny (unlike the slick and labored &apos;Girl from Monaco&apos;, the other 2009 Rendez-Vous comedy).\n\nBoth were shown as part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center in March 2009. &apos;Le Plaisir de chanter&apos; opened in Paris theaters November 26, 2008 to some good reviews--though not all critics were convinced.",

The documentarian&apos;s work is prodigious -- we were constantly amazed by the continuous progression of time: just when we thought we&apos;d seen the latest of Sean and his family, another, more recent, slice of their lives emerged on screen. The documentarian wove the story of his own family into the film, and while at first I found the digressions slightly annoying (Sean and his family are so compelling that one wants to see more of them), at the end I decided his decision was correct, and that the study of three generations of his own family deepened the impact of the film.\n\nI highly recommend this documentary to anyone interested in sociology, social psychology (especially concerning the effects of 60&apos;s freedom-loving childraising on their children), McCarthyism, the effects of aging, and in general the history of the United States over the last 50 years. Anyone who lived in Berkeley or San Francisco in the 60s or 70s will be fascinated! I was shocked to realize that _Following Sean_ has, apparently, not been screened yet in the Untied States.

This is because if you are looking for fun movie that really does pull at the kid inside you, then this is definitely it.\n\nRobin Williams is just the right kind of goofy for my tastes, and makes an excellent Pan. Captain Hook was perfectly fit by Dustin Hoffman. I could have done without Julia Roberts as Tink. Actually, I can do without Julia Roberts all together. But Bob Hoskins made a great Smee. (I like to watch this and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, back-to-back) Anyways, I watch this movie once a year because the message of the movie, and the reason people watch it, warrants that. A movie where the message is to never lose sight of your inner child. Imagination. Belief in magical creatures. Sword fighting with pirates. All of these things that I&apos;m sure you did as a child, as I did.\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concerned, all of the people who have written bad reviews for this movie, saying things like &quot;The characters weren&apos;t believable&quot;, and &quot;Spielberg tried to answer a question that didn&apos;t need an answer&quot; have lost sight of the kid in themselves, have become pirates, and should have their hands fed to crocodiles. It&apos;s a movie. A family movie. One that needs to appeal to both children and adults, which is a difficult task, to be successful. And I believe that this movie succeeds at that very well.",

      "reviewBody": "Sarkar is a very good crime film, and its value is quite notable particularly in comparison to the majority of Hindi films made around those years, which were not as good in technical quality as this one is. The film&apos;s production values, including the cinematography, the editing, the camera work, and particularly the action, which thankfully avoids the ridiculous, exaggerated and noisy style employed in other action films, are all impressive and make it feel a cut above the usual fare. The same could go for the dialogue and nicely dark the narrative style, which is not melodramatic as could be expected from a Hindi film of that time.\n\nIndeed, all these elements make Sarkar an enjoyably slick and realistic film. Not much should be said about the story, it is pretty much a respectful, careful adaptation of The Godfather, which is done pretty well although clearly those who would be tempted to compare between the two would have a hard time appreciating this film. Mind you, these two films share just core plot elements, but the film has a script of its own. Sadly, perhaps in an attempt to not be overly pretentious, Sarkar is not fully realised. While it does deliver the goods most of the time, it is at times too contrived for its own good and sometimes loses some of its focus.\n\nThe film stars the real-life father and son Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan as the underworld don and his unassuming son to a good effect. The senior Bachchan is excellent as the authoritative, tough mafia don with a heart of gold. The junior is highly competent in a restrained performance with a nice twist played convincingly. Actually, the entire cast is very good although the show belongs to the two players. Even the minor characters are played as real people and do very well. Sarkar is an entertaining and consistently gripping film by Ram Gopal Varma, one of mainstream Hindi cinema&apos;s most interesting and experimental directors.",

      "reviewBody": "Waxwork II: Lost in Time (1992) is currently streaming for free on Tubi and serves as a fun follow-up to the &apos;80s classic. The story picks up where the first film left off, but it turns out the wax museum isn&apos;t as &quot;finished&quot; as the survivors thought. The girlfriend from the couple who made it out of the first film is framed for her parent&apos;s murder-killed by a wax appendage-and the couple must return to the museum to clear her name.\n\nWritten and directed by Anthony Hickox (Waxwork, Hellraiser III), the film stars Zach Galligan (Gremlins), Monika Schnarre (Junior), Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead), and David Carradine (Death Race 2000).\n\nThe plot takes a very different turn, blending elements that feel like a strange mix of Alien and The Princess Bride, but it remains an entertaining and fun ride. Though Hickox returns as the director, there&apos;s minimal continuity with the original film, aside from the returning cast and director. There are also some enjoyable cameos, including Bruce Campbell, David Carradine, and Drew Barrymore. Overall, this is a lighthearted, feel-good film with late &apos;80s/early &apos;90s hijinks. It&apos;s worth your time for a fun watch, though far from a masterpiece. I&apos;d give it a 5/10.",

John Woo became the Crown Colony&apos;s hottest director through his kinetic crime flicks that filtered the lyrical violence of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, and Walter Hill through an Asian sensibility and re-exported it to the States where Quentin Tarantino became a major admirer.  Woo&apos;s trademarks are the stand-off, where two or more gunmen hold each other at bay, and the ferocious gunfight in which dozens of people are killed and restaurants blown apart as the hero pirouettes and somersaults while blasting away with two automatic pistols to throbbing, synthesized Western music.  &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; is a characteristic fable of male friendship, stoicism, courage, and men living by a personal code, in which women are marginalized.  It made an overnight star of Chow Yun Fat, who appeared in most of Woo&apos;s pictures. The handsome, reserved, athletic Chow is the epitome of Hong Kong movie cool, a moral man in an amoral world, his character is much the same whatever side of the law he is on.  The movie also introduced Leslie Cheung, who was to become an iconic figure in mainland Chinese cinema.",

The captain, Fausto, who wants no pity, brooks no disagreement, and charges into every situation, nicknames the youth Ciccio (&quot;Babyfat&quot;), and spends the next few days ordering him about and generally behaving badly in public.\n\nWhere this film excels is in its originality. I saw the Al Pacino version many years ago and loved it, never realizing it was a remake. Now, one could argue that it was the better film. Maybe, maybe not. But it definitely gave Pacino one of his career performances.\n\nAnd yet, there is something to be said about the original. The actors aren&apos;t as big, and it may not be as accessible to Americans, but it has all the great things that Pacino had, and did them so much sooner.",

I was very disappointed with the choice of &quot;The Blue Snake&quot; as the ultimate and climactic &quot;number&quot; in &quot;The Company&quot;. To me, it really stood out as the least interesting and most cliched of all the dances in the film.  Those outrageous costumes!    That &quot;Ice Capades&quot; choreography!  Altman &amp; Co. really ought to have chosen a piece that would have shown the Joffrey&apos;s more adventuresome side.\n\nI went into this film knowing that it was a &quot;dance movie&quot; with minimal storyline, and I was still disappointed.    It&apos;s not a good sign when I start looking at my watch halfway through a film.    It doesn&apos;t bother me that a &quot;dance film&quot; eschews the Melodrama of &quot;The Turning Point&quot; or &quot;A Chorus Line.&quot;    But &quot;The Company&quot; also eschews Interest!   There was basically nothing to &quot;hang onto&quot; outside the dance sequences.    Only Ry (Neve Campbell&apos;s character) was given any appreciable screentime, and aside from a few quiet moments, she wasn&apos;t given very much to do.    \n\n Okay, I admit that I liked one dramatic scene a lot:  a flirtatious moment between Ry and Josh - the chef who looks like a male model - which takes place in a dive bar.  There should have been more scenes like that.\n\nI rate the film a 6 - dramatically disappointing, while the quality of the dance sequences varies from sublime to ridiculous.",

Anyway the acting was a high point as each of the principal characters is capable of delivering tears, quivering chins, furrowed brows, etc and have a good range of emotions. They also have physical skills beyond the usual pretty face as demonstrated by the dance numbers, the skating and hockey sequences, the trapeeze and other physical scenes apparently not done by stunt doubles. It did have a foreign touch to it; Oregon isn&apos;t that far from Canada and the scenery and flavor matched several obscure Canadian films. &apos;Reflecting Skin&apos; comes to mind, and a British film &apos;Paperhouse&apos; matches it in having much of the film take place in a sort of dreamland.

      "reviewBody": "This classic movie written by Robert Riskin (Capra&apos;s usual) concerns about a fired journalist named Ann Mitchell (excellent Barbara Stanwyck , though first choice for the role was Anne Sheridan). She thinks up an original idea and prints a false letter from an unemployed , a down-and-out John Doe who threatens to commit suicide . The editor (James Gleason) hires John Willoughby (Gary Cooper in the title role playing with natural sincerity , as usual) to embodiment Doe. Willoughby is usually accompanied by his skeptical friend (Walter Brennan who steals the show) . John Doe protests against corrupts politicians , against the shutting doors at hospitals for needy and complains about abundant injustice . Doe founds &apos;John Doe clubs&apos; along the cities and Democratic and Republic headquarters are worried because everybody join to John Doe . John starts a political movement but the publisher Norton (Edward Arnold) has a secret scheme. Doe eventually realizes who he&apos;s being used and takes on corruption and win , not without coming heart-rendingly close to failure.\n\nAn enjoyable Frank Capra film that displays drama , a love story and biting social critical ; however , being a bit slow in part for overlong dialogs and speeches . Capra&apos;s touches of sensibility and intelligence in presenting characters had his spectators sharing triumphs and flops . Frank Capra was an expert in manipulating their emotions such as proved in his films of the 1930s and 1940s , as he influenced the lives and beliefs of people of the nation with movies as &apos;Mr Deeds goes to town&apos; , &apos;You can&apos;t take it with you&apos; , &apos;It&apos;s wonderful life&apos; and &apos;Meet John Doe&apos; . The film packs a good score by Dimitri Tiomkin and nice cinematography by George Barnes , though available in a horrible colorized versión . The motion picture was well realized with realism and cleverness and wonderfully well acted at the same time. Rating : Better than average , the movie will appeal to cinema classics lovers",

      "reviewBody": "Solomon and Sheba is directed by King Vidor and collectively written by Anthony Veiller, Paul Dudley, George Bruce and Crane Wilbur. It stars Yul Brynner, Gina Lollobrigida, Marisa Pavan, George Sanders, David Farrar, Harry Andrews, John Crawford and Laurence Naismith. Music is by Mario Nascimbene and cinematography by Fred A. Young.\n\nA fictionalised screenplay cribs from parts of the Bible, where the story here follows the relationship between Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba, a problem because initially Sheba is in league with Israel&apos;s enemy, Egypt. All that and Solomon has to deal with his nefarious brother, Adonijah, who is a little miffed that Solomon has inherited the crown of Israel.\n\nFamously it was the production that saw the sad death of the leading man, Tyrone Power, while Vidor was so disillusioned about the whole film he quit making feature length films. It&apos;s a very mixed bag, very much showing the good and bad sides of the big historical epics that dominated Hollywood back in the day. In part it&apos;s a grandiose melodrama, in others it&apos;s cheap looking and given to campy histrionics (the orgy operatics sequences are just awful), while the screenplay jostles with itself as to being biblical blarney or potent pontifications.\n\nCostuming and colour photography smooths the eyes, but then the optical nerves are shredded by set design so poor a child making paper mache boulders could have done better. The cast are also in and out, Brynner is fine as Solomon (broody, brainy but troubled), as is the lovely Lollobrigida as Sheba (stoic, smart and sexy), but the support slots barely convince. Sanders is badly miscast as Solomon&apos;s warrior brother Adonijah (he was 53 at the time), 10 years earlier in Samson and Delilah his villain turn worked, but not here.\n\nSword fighting choreography is poor, as are the miracle effects work, but conversely the big battle that crowns the story is smart in writing and in execution, where not even the model work can dim the thrill of it all. Released in the same year as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; obviously does it no favours by comparison! But then so many other big swords and shields epics would also struggle as well. Vidor&apos;s movie is just above average in the genre pantheon, but the faults are irritable and hardly render it as a must see film for genre enthusiasts. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I couldn&apos;t avoid the inevitable pun, so I thought I&apos;d get it over with right in the beginning. As for this movie, it&apos;s pretty useless as entertainment in terms of humor, fascination and escapism. It definitely doesn&apos;t belong among the worst Hollywood comedies of late, as there is only a single fart joke and a single kicked-in-the-groin joke. That&apos;s pretty civilized for an American &quot;comedy&quot; nowadays, I am sorry to admit. So the problem here is not vulgarity, just boredom.\n\nAlthough I greatly admire the talent of both Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence (yes, you heard correctly - I thought he was excellent in Bad Boys), the combination of the two seems to lack something vital here. Upon a closer examination it is quite clear what this missing ingredient is: a good script. Instead of genuine amusement, this it-takes-a-crook-to-catch-a-thief story line becomes weary and repetitive fairly quickly. Add to this a couple of increasingly annoying supporting characters and numerous inconsistencies - it is one to avoid.\n\nI would also like to add that the only really convincing performance comes from Richard Schiff as DeVito&apos;s long-suffering lawyer who experiences a moment of personal triumph. I really loved this scene. Unfortunately, it can&apos;t save this movie, which was doomed at birth. A 2 out of 10 from me."

There are also several inferences and leaps of logic that seem like &quot;stretching it&quot; to say the least, but I suppose that&apos;s part of critical analysis. While it&apos;s extremely impressive that Greenaway has put so much thought, time and effort into interpreting a single work of art, he doesn&apos;t succeed in making his obsession contagious.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never seen this movie until now.  I&apos;ve been an Elvis fan since I first found out about the dude a year before his 1977 death, I have hundreds of hours of concert and studio recordings and concert videos, I&apos;ve even seen the robe that he wore in &quot;Kid Galahad,&quot; and yet somehow I never managed to see this 1962 movie (shot in late &apos;61).  Was it worth the wait?  Well, yes...of course.  Is it a classic movie, apart from its inherent cult-classic value as an Elvis film?  Well, no, but it&apos;s one of his better 1960s movie and I enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie came hard on the heels of another atypical film from Elvis, &quot;Follow That Dream,&quot; that was in turn preceded by the 1961 box-office giant, &quot;Blue Hawaii.&quot;  &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; continued the family-film travelogue kind of movie (set by 1960&apos;s &quot;GI Blues&quot;) that would set the style for most of Elvis&apos; &apos;60s movie output and that would eventually lead to a downward spiral in Elvis&apos; professional life and job fulfillment that lasted almost &apos;til decade&apos;s end.  Elvis as race-car driver.  Elvis as boat racer.  Elvis as whatever.  As Elvis said, after his 1969 return to the stage, it was like they made the same movie a bunch of times and just changed the backdrops. Between &quot;GI Blues&quot; and &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; came two &apos;serious&apos; films (&quot;Wild In The Country&quot; and &quot;Flaming Star,&quot; both shot in 1960) that couldn&apos;t hope to match the commercial success of those glossy musicals but that showed Elvis&apos; potential as a dramatic actor.  Both &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; and &quot;Follow That Dream&quot; were also somewhat a departure from the &quot;GI Blues&quot;/&quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; formula, though less so than the two 1960 films that Elvis did for Fox, and each were pretty sparse on songs and much more generous on storyline and characterizations.\n\n&quot;Kid Galahad&quot; was an interesting role for Elvis.  The producers threw in a few interesting songs to cater to the fans who&apos;d flock to the film and they&apos;re all pleasant and of a high standard -- my favorite&apos;s always been the song that opens the movie (&quot;King Of The Whole Wide World&quot;) though the excessive overdubbing over the film version waters down much of its magnificence.  As was true of Elvis&apos; other better films, this one profits from having a very strong supporting cast, including the likes of Gig Young, Charles Bronson, Lola Albright, and many others.  There&apos;s even Ed Asner, in his second film role -- Mr Asner played another law-enforcement representative, a policeman, in 1969&apos;s &quot;Change Of Habit&quot; (Elvis&apos; last scripted movie).  Joan Blackman, Elvis&apos; co-star in &quot;Blue Hawaii,&quot; has a less solid role than does Lola Albright but she does it just fine and is certainly a beautiful young woman.  Lola Albright is great in her role and Gig Young is lazily perfect for his -- though he seems almost as if he&apos;s happily drunk throughout...which, apparently, he was.  Chucky Bronson is good in this film even though he&apos;s supposedly embarrassed by it.  You&apos;d think that a man who inflicted all of those terrible &apos;80s violence movies on the world would find it hard to be embarrassed by anything, but there apparently was friction on the set between him and the easy-going Elvis. Regardless, the on-screen interaction between them is fine.  Elvis actually looks like he put on some weight about this time -- also evident in &quot;Follow That Dream&quot; -- but his shirtless scenes reveal that he&apos;s pretty solid and he&apos;d lost whatever extra weight he was carrying by the time he started shooting his next film a few months later.\n\nThis film was shot on location in Idyllwild, California, which is kind of a kick for me because when I lived in Palm Springs I&apos;d often ride my motorcycle up there and I&apos;ve since been there with my wife and with my parents.  It&apos;s a great little town, tucked away in the shadow of Mount San Jacinto, and -- even though I first visited it in 1987 -- I vaguely recognize some of the landmarks.  San Jacinto itself certainly looks the same now as in 1961.\n\nThe boxing scenes looked pretty convincing to me and are actually quite riveting.  People who are expecting to see &quot;Rocky&quot; might be disappointed but, like Mr Balboa, Elvis&apos; Galahad shows convincingly that he can take a brutal series of blows and keep on keeping on.  This film came about 18 months after Elvis earned his black belt (from a real hard-case...the grading lasted several hours and involved fighting up to five black-belt opponents) and Elvis had what it took to both take punishment and to learn the physical skills necessary for his role.  His well-publicized scuffles back in 1956 showed that he had a lot of heart and an effective self-defense capability, and legendary boxer and coach Mushy Callahan (brought in to train Elvis) was filled with praise for his charge.  Charles Bronson didn&apos;t agree, but I guess you can&apos;t please everybody.\n\nAs a whole, the movie&apos;s shot every nicely and it&apos;s well acted throughout, including by Elvis.  I think that he was somewhat better in &quot;Follow That Dream,&quot; but that&apos;s perhaps only because his character took full advantage of Elvis&apos; considerable comic skills.  In &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; another of Elvis&apos; acting strengths -- anger, at which he&apos;s particularly convincing -- comes to the fore during a confrontation with Gig Young.  For a moment there&apos;s a bit of a flashback -- was for me, anyway -- to the way in which he perfected that kind of scene in films like 1957&apos;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; 1958&apos;s &quot;King Creole,&quot; and &quot;Flaming Star.&quot;  This a lighter movie than any of those but it has its moments.\n\nI&apos;m glad that I finally saw this film.  It&apos;s less frenetic and more involved than Elvis&apos; typical &apos;60s movie fare and is worth a look.  The &quot;I&apos;m a grease monkey that don&apos;t slide too easily&quot; line is pretty classic, too."

Despite a Hollywood tendancy to change the novel&apos;s ending so as not to depress the cash customers (although, pray tell, if you&apos;re going to change the ending, why does no one ever see Quasimodo sailing off to Tahiti with the girl?  Rule # 1:  strong, handsome poets beat out disfigured cripples every time, even if they&apos;re heroes.  This is more true in real life than in the movies.  Take my word for this, I know from painful experience  *sigh*)\n\nCharles Laughton is exceptional and Maureen O&apos;Hara would make any man swoon and is perfect for the part of Esmerelda.  The support includes the usual suspects-Thomas Mitchell, Harry Davenport and many other familiar character actors.  Strike up the band and start the parade.  Thunderous applause.

Suddenly I couldn&apos;t stand him, and that culturally elitist attitude has persisted to the present day. Yet when asked which of the films I&apos;ve ever seen are the funniest, I have to mention this one. I don&apos;t remember much about it -- I saw it in a drive-in on a misty night in 1963 when I was 12 -- but I still recall the scene in the appliance department of the store, with the vacuum cleaner sucking up everything in sight. I don&apos;t think I have laughed that hard since -- it&apos;s amazing I survived to see the age of 13!"

      "reviewBody": "I was lucky in I was an admirer of Nikifor and in the mid 90&apos;s visited Krynica and the Nikifor Museum. I suspect the film echoes modern sentiment of his life and work, since in the town there was not the enthusiasm for his fame and the museum was somewhat lacking in content. However from the film I immediately remembered the town and its simple beauty, and spent an enjoyable week there. The film it is rather slow but does keep up a momentum; and shows how difficult the artist was to deal with by a bureaucratic society beset with vestiges of their own self importance, while having to openly acknowledge the status of a man previously held in ridicule. The acting is very fine, right down to the humanity of the two little girls, and there are significant small cameo shots such as the later dialogue in the scene in the town café which is typically Polish. Filming is also excellent. A memorable yet understated film."

      "reviewBody": "This is a movie you should check out. Aristotle said that &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; Well, going back to the start of the review, even if you think that what Naomi Klein is talking about is pure nonsense, &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; is a movie to watch, precisely even more if you don&apos;t agree with the ideas it presents.\n\nBasically the movie talks about how capitalism aliments itself on conflict and shocks, meaning that it is very good at distracting the attention from the important to some event that is terrible, but not the most terrible. For example, it talks about how the United Kingdom got into the Falklands War, and how that distracted public attention from the strikes and the civil unrest that was ongoing in the country. Does it all sound a little bit conspiratorial? It does, but it is also true that when something like a war happens, people&apos;s attention will be centered on that event, and it will become a situation of &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;others&quot;. Even if you don&apos;t believe that happens on purpose, it is true that systems, being it capitalism or other, may take advantage of those situations.\n\nBut that&apos;s for a politics or international relations class. Going back to the documentary, &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; presents its ideas in a very clear and easy to understand way, and it gives enough examples to see why they say what they say. In that respects it does a very nice job. It also does a good job in making the viewer think and analyze situations. And it is very interesting to try to see things in a different light from the &quot;official&quot; view of things.\n\nAs Aristotle said, you don&apos;t have to accept it. Or agree with it. But it doesn&apos;t hurt to think.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;How the hell do you know I&apos;m lucky to survive?&quot;\n\nLegendary screen icon Clint Eastwood returns in front of the camera since his hit &quot;Gran Torino&quot;. No matter what anyone else thinks of him, I will always admire the man. He is one of my heroes. Who else can personify the action hero perfectly, become a gifted filmmaker, improve his acting ability as he ages AND be quite the jazz musician?\n\nMr. Eastwood may be old but he still has a commanding presence on screen. Granted, he might be the only leading octogenarian in Hollywood right now, but still, I digress. He is old. That is a fact. At the age of 82, seeing him play an elderly man losing his sight while bonding with his distant daughter makes it quite sad for me to watch. However, &quot;Trouble With the Curve&quot; is a breeze to watch.\n\nIt is not a baseball movie, although baseball is the basis of the film&apos;s story. Nor is it a depressing drama (Mr. Eastwood&apos;s favorite genre of late). It is a father-daughter bonding dramedy, with some great chemistry between Mr. Eastwood and Amy Adams as his estranged daughter. Justin Timberlake also arrives to lighten up the atmosphere even more, and his presence is welcome in the film.\n\nMr. Eastwood is not in the director&apos;s chair this time. His long-time producer partner, Robert Lorenz, makes his directorial debut with this film. Apparently Lorenz directs the cast with ease although it feels too by-the-numbers. But hey, there are much worse debuts. Judging from the breezy pace and the somewhat brisk editing and lively cinematography, it&apos;s clear from the get-go that the superb &quot;Eastwood touch&quot; is not evident in the film, even though some of Mr. Eastwood&apos;s key players are still here - cinematographer Tom Stern and editor Joel Cox - though the music by Marco Beltrami (not Mr. Eastwood nor his son this time!) complements the atmosphere pleasantly.\n\nLook, this is not a great film. It&apos;s a pedestrian and predictable film, with Mr. Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, as well as an impressive supporting cast featuring John Goodman and Robert Patrick, phoning in the performances. Both Adams and Mr. Eastwood have acted much more superbly in better previous movies (&quot;Gran Torino&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, &quot;The Fighter&quot;). But it is funny, it is sad at times (Mr. Eastwood&apos;s heart-wrenching singing of &apos;You are My Sunshine&apos; is forever embedded in my head), and it is easy on the eyes, ears and mind, a relaxing pleasure to watch. It is great entertainment. From all the big- budget blockbusters out in cinemas last summer, this is a joy. You&apos;ll walk out smiling.\n\nOverall: 70%",

      "reviewBody": "Enjoyable action/adventure film stars the idol of the fifties José Suarez giving a nice acting as the upright hero . An adventure film set in the Andalusian mountains in which a courier man, nicely played by José Suarez , carrying a valuable shipment is assaulted by a group of bandits led by Luis Induni. Along the way he falls in love with a beautiful young woman , María : Isabel de Castro , who is about to marry a powerful local authority : Barta Barry . Meanwhile, he bets his horse against Barta Barry on a folkloric dancer -Teresita Abad who&apos;s usually dancing- who&apos;s accused for robbing , but he is deceived and loses him. So while celebrating a bullfight at a bustling plaza before the crowd, he takes the rejoneador&apos;s horse and escapes and being relentlessly pursued by a posse. Then, our starring joins the band of bandits and after fighting against the leader Induni he becomes the chief of the outlaws to rob , retrieve his stealen object , execute revenge and discover the true mastermind who benefits from raids .\n\nThis acceptable adventure movie is filled with thrills , intrigue , chases , go riding and breathtaking confrontations. This traditional ¨Bandido¨ movie is made in Andaluzi-Western style , in fact in some Western encyclopedias it is considered to be a ¨Spaghetti¨or ¨Paella¨ Western and in others it is deemed to be a ¨Zorro&quot; movie . Decent screenplay dealing with ambition , revenge, justice and retribution that turn out to be the main axis of the plot . Although the story has been told before , appropriate filmmaking and fine acting win out , as it results in a passable adventure flick . It is a combination of moving drama and full of villainy , betrayal , romance , heroism and redemption . Fine acting by José Suarez as a bandit who joins a dangerous band to rob and destroy enemies . At the time José was an international actor performing as first figure the Italian films as El Magistrado , El Desafio and especially Calle Mayor (1956) with Betsy Blair, maybe his most well known film, for which he would receive awards as best actor. The success of this film at the Venice festival opened him the doors to the foreign cinema. He would go on playing mostly detective stories, drama, westerns and some comedies in Spanish and European productions , such as : Cartago en llamas, Siete Hombres de Oro , Adiós, Texas , La muerte de un presidente , Operacion Silencio and many others . Director Miguel Lluch took advantage of the marvelous Andalucian exteriors and shooting a hastily assembled attractive picture . In the movie appears usual support actors of the fifties and sixties , such as : Barta Barri , Carlos Otero , Isabel de Castro and special mention for Paco Martínez Soria in one of his first roles as a sympathetic outlaw and already standing out with his innate comic skills and his own Zaragoza accent.\n\nThis is a good-natured colorful romp with glamorous cinematography in black and white by Pablo Ripoll shot in natural scenarios , that gives us an accurate ambiance in the times it is developed , though a perfect remastering being necessary because of the copy is slightly washed-out . Being financed in medium budget by Ignacio F Iquino/IFI production . The motion picture was professionally directed by craftsman Miguel Lluch. The latter was an artisan who made all kinds of genres : Adventure , Comedy , Thriller , Drama , such as : El halcón del desierto , La chica del autostop , Crimen , El precio de un asesino , Los claveles , Fra Diávolo , Las estrellas , Sitiados en la ciudad , La montaña sin ley, Taxi , Un demonio con ángel, among others . Rating : 6/10 . Acceptable , passable but dated adventure movie. Rating : 5.5/10.",

Somewhere between these two axioms fall the doomed lovers of this spellbinding offering. Beautiful Hee-Jin (Jung) is the grounds keeper for a dingy Korean fishing resort, selling snacks, bait, her tits &apos;n&apos; ass, to the tourists she ferries between flotillas of fishing huts.\n\nFugitive Hyun-Shik (Yoo-Suk) shows up one day, shivering, suicidal, utterly alone. Another lost soul, Hee-Jin&apos;s smitten because, unlike her sleazy clientèle, Hyun-Shik&apos;s different. He doesn&apos;t abuse her or make fun of her muteness. And he fashions exquisite little wire sculptures for her, as they study one another across the rain-spattered lake. He in his unreachable desolation, she in her shore-side cabin, cat-like and inscrutable. The first time he tries to kill himself, by swallowing fishing hooks, she brings him back to life  to love  the only way she knows. From suicide to sex in three minutes. And nobody is going to get in her way. Director Kim Ki-duk, responsible for surprise Art-house hit Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winterand Spring, has crafted another beautiful-horrible movie; gorgeous to look at, and often between splayed fingers. It&apos;s as minimal and soulful as a haiku. And as painful as falling in love"

      "name": "Acceptable Sci-Fi film by the great Terence Fisher dealing with an uncommon heat wave and strange events at a lonely island",
      "reviewBody": "¨Island of the burning dead¨ or ¨Night of the Big Heat¨, or ¨Island of the Burning Doomed¨ is Terence Fisher&apos;s Sci-fi movie in which bizarre creatures from outer space threaten an isolated remote community at a Northern island called Fara . It begins with the Opening credits : All characters and events in this film are fictitious and any similarity to persons either living or dead is purely coincidental . Science-fiction thriller with fantastic elements , set at an island off the coast of Great Britain , there happens strange deaths of villagers , while suffering heavy sweat . Meantime , mainland Britain shivers in deepest winter and a freezing season , as the northern island of Fara bakes in the nineties . Authorities have no more idea what is happening than the regulars at the Swan Pub . Only a stand-offish visiting scientific (Christopher Lee) who has rigged up a laboratory in the security of the White Swan hotel has suspicious and dark conjectures . As he believes the heat&apos;s caused by energy starved aliens . Meanwhile , the new secretary (Jane Merrow) to the local best-selling author (Patrick Allen) is raising the temperature in her own way . As the island is overrun by strange whirring noises allegedly caused by weird beings . These fantastic creatures assault and attack citizens by heating rays and blasts , subsequently threatening to consume the world . Then , some brave people go into action to investigate and discover the rare origin of an alien invasion and what seems to be the source of the heat . From outer space ..came a devastating death!.Mysterious Invaders From Outer Space Create Their Scorching Heat Rays That Consume the People and an Island! Searing Terror! Burning In Its Intensity!\n\nMoving picture from a science fiction novel by John Lymington , contains good interpretations , chills , thrills , and astonishing attacks by amazing creatures . Here carry the flick the following ones : Christopher Lee who suspects aliens are to blame the rare phenomenon going on , as well as Patrick Allen who married to Sarah Lawson falls for the seducer beauty Jane Merrow , in fact they were husband and wife in real life as well ; all of them , giving first-rate performances . Along with enjoyable secondaries , such as : the always charming and courteous Peter Cushing in a minor role as guest star playing the local doctor who is frazzled to death , Percy Herbert , William Lucas , Kenneth Cope , among others . All actors shot the film in cold conditions as they suffered from wearing very light dresses in a freezing season , that&apos;s why they had to be covered with glycerin to create the illusion of high temperature . The premise is the following : How can three people stop the devouring death that live and spread across the countryside and delivering mighty hot . This &quot;Island of the burning doomed&quot; 1967 concerning a brute heat wave accompanied by invading aliens bears certain resemblance to ¨Island of terror&quot; regarding scientist experiments go wrong , also directed by Terence Fisher and equally starred by Peter Cushing and others as Edward Jud , Carole Gray and Eddie Byrne.\n\nIt contains a stirring musical score by Malcolm Lockyer , adding electronic soundtrack as the fantastic beings show up . As well as colorful and glimmering cinematography by Reg Wyer . Shot on location in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire , The Swan Inn , Broughton Road , Milton Keynes Village, Milton Keynes , Dorset, England , UK and Pinewood studios , as usual . This British-made outing was competently directed by Hammer maestro Terence Fisher . Hammer mainstay Fisher made 3 films for the cheapjack Planet outfit of which this Night of the Big Heat was the last . This fine director made a lot of films for Hammer productions , usually terror genre . Outstanding his Dracula saga : ¨The horror of Dracula¨, ¨The Brides of Dracula¨, ¨Dracula prince of darkness¨ . About Frankenstein : ¨The curse of Frankenstein¨, ¨The revenge of Frankenstein¨, ¨Frankenstein created woman¨ , ¨Frankenstein must be destroyed¨, ¨Frankenstein monster from hell¨. Furthermore, other terror films as ¨The Gorgon¨, ¨The mummy¨, ¨The devil rides out¨, ¨The two faces of Dr Jekyll¨, ¨The curse of the werewolf¨. And other movies as ¨Sherlock Holmes and the deadly necklace¨, ¨Hound of The Baskervilles¨, ¨Black glove¨, ¨Robin Hood, Sword of Sherwood forest¨, ¨Island of the burning doomed¨ and ¨Island of terror¨ . Rating : 6/10 , acceptable and passable ; though neither notable , nor excellent , but decent entry in Science-Fiction genre . Interesting , thrilling scenes and suspenseful twists make for prickes up the spine.",

      "name": "Kelly&apos;s Dream Project",
      "reviewBody": "This is the result of many years of effort on the part of Gene Kelly to create an all-dance film. Since he was a major-studio rather than an indie production child, Kelly convinced his home studio, MGM, to finally take on the project.\n\nThe final results, unfortunately, are mixed.  The movie is simply average, with long stretches of off-timed and miscalculated action and uninspired choreography.  Were Kelly to have collaborated in the writing, choreographing and direction departments, rather than taking everything on himself, things might have gone better.\n\nThe project was simply too great a task for Kelly; with other imput he might have made a film with greater perspective and flair.  The story in &quot;Circus&quot; is only fair, and there&apos;s more pantomime than dancing for Kelly as Pierrot. Unfortantely, Jacques Ibert&apos;s music doesn&apos;t help either.\n\n &quot;Ring Around the Rosy&quot; suffers from disjointed continuity, with awkward bridges and motivations.  Too, the fine Tamara Toumanova as the Streetwalker provides a clash of styles when paired with Kelly as the Marine. Physically, their types don&apos;t match well, try as they will. Nor was this Andre Previn&apos;s finest compositional hour.\n\nFinally, Roger Eden&apos;s adaptation of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s score for &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; makes for the most effective music in the film.  Kelly at last gets to display his distinctive dancing manner, and does some impressive work (at age 44) in the interesting cartoon sequences. \n\n It&apos;s not Kelly at his best, though, and &quot;Inviation to the Dance&quot; remains an interesting curio, earnest on effort and short on realization.  Both dance fans in general and Kelly fans in particular will value this video in their collectiona.",

      "reviewBody": "1958&apos;s Mexican &quot;El Hombre que Logro ser Invisible&quot; (The Man Who Managed to Be Invisible) eventually made the rounds of American TV screens under the title &quot;The New Invisible Man.&quot; Sadly, there&apos;s precious little that&apos;s new, the most frequently used basic plot, that of an innocent man becoming transparent in order to prove his innocence, perfected by the very first sequel to James Whale&apos;s 1933 original, 1940&apos;s &quot;The Invisible Man Returns&quot; (Vincent Price in the title role). Done very cheaply in black and white, this version coincides with Edgar G. Ulmer&apos;s &quot;The Amazing Transparent Man&quot; (from 1959), Japanese variations (1954&apos;s &quot;Tomei Ningen&quot; and 1960&apos;s &quot;The Human Vapor&quot;), also a British half hour teleseries syndicated in the US. Price and Claude Rains possessed dynamic voices to powerfully convey their emotions (Jon Hall not so effective) but on this dubbed occasion the tones are decidedly ordinary despite the presence in the central role of Charles Hill of Arturo de Cordova, one of Mexico&apos;s biggest stars, so popular that he spent a few years in Hollywood during the 1940s playing romantic Latin types. Some footage is missing from the beginning (10 minutes in all), setting up the engagement of Charles to Beatrice (Ana Luisa Peluffo), then introducing Charles&apos; brother Luis (Augusto Benedico), perfecting an invisibility formula that so far works on panes of glass. By the five minute mark we witness the murder, the culprit escaping as Charles enters, only to be falsely accused with the revolver in his hand and successfully prosecuted on circumstantial evidence. Once Luis stumbles on the right combination to make his despairing brother disappear the injection is made in the prison infirmary, the subject rising from his bed to see himself vanish before the mirror and easily get away. The Invisible Man pairs up with his fiancée to learn the truth behind the frame up, more mayhem to follow even after he&apos;s cleared of murder, becoming a self righteous angel of death to carry out the lord&apos;s work as he goes insane. The test animals are simply shown as skeletons during their transformations, while our hero makes himself visible through cold cream like Jon Hall in 1942&apos;s &quot;Invisible Agent,&quot; so the special effects are at least better than in Ulmer&apos;s hour long opus, but the picture drags badly during the second half. There&apos;s really no characterization for Arturo de Cordova, and despite his assorted misdeeds by the climax his fiancée stubbornly and almost fatally clings to her love for him.",

This is an enjoyably exotic adventure with raffish comedy, romance and glamour. The film&apos;s enduring strength is confined to how Marlene Dietrich thrives as the flamboyant torch singer and scarlet woman. Dietrich satirises the Shanghai Lil stereotype sirens of Far East showbusiness past with aplomb and humour. The young and handsome Naval Lieutenant playing amorous to her is John Wayne, who smooches up to create some nice chemistry. Broderick Crawford, Mischa Auer, Samuel S Hinds, Reginald Denny, and Oscar Homolka all give fine supporting performances. The production standards are good. The sets are reminiscent of film director Josef von Sternberg&apos;s films. The atmosphere of a cheap, evil island cafe is captured well. The bar-room finale is preposterous but the rumbustiousness and playful excess the audience experiences from the beginning was energy that had to go somewhere, so the film going out like a thermobaric implosion seemed like a fitting fortissimo coda.",

      "reviewBody": "Comedian Stan Laurel, actor, writer and part-time director with 50 films under his belt, was hired by Hal Roach&apos;s studio in 1926 as a director and gagwriter. An accident in the kitchen that resulted in a severe burn from a hot leg of lamb sent Roach veteran actor Oliver Hardy to the hospital, giving Laurel an opportunity to appear before the camera again. He was asked to fill in for &apos;Ollie&apos; in the studio&apos;s upcoming &apos;Get &apos;Em Young,&apos; as well as the 1926&apos;s &quot;45 Minutes from Hollywood.&quot; Laurel agreed.\n\nHardy, who had appeared in over 250 films, returned to work and found himself slotted in several shorts with Laurel. Observant studio director/writer Leo McCarey saw a certain chemistry between the two actors when they appeared together. Composing a script contoured to the pair&apos;s acting style, McCarey linked the two as a couple of convicts who share a prison cell together in October 1927&apos;s &quot;The Second Hundred Years.&quot;. The pair make their getaway by stealing paint cans and brushes and impersonating themselves as painters. Stumbling upon a police officer, Laurel and Hardy paint railings, cars, shop windows, women&apos;s buttocks, anything to throw the cop off guard.\n\nHal Roach loved the interaction between the two and asked McCarey to oversee their on-screen presence. Despite directing only three Laurel and Hardy shorts in the next two years, McCarey was instrumental in their guidance by personally writing several of their screenplays and supervising others directing their films.\n\nIn &quot;The Second Hundred Years,&quot; Roach realized McCarey&apos;s instincts were correct, launching one of cinema&apos;s most successful and funniest comedic pairing.",

I read the cable synopsis and thought, &quot;Uh oh! Cliché city!&quot; But, to my surprise, this film was not clichéd and the film was like a breath of fresh air. The performances, for the most part, were true and honest. Chayenne (as Rafael, a Cuban émigré) is charming and acts well in his English-language film debut. Vanessa Williams is stunning, as always. And the music! Picante! The dance sequences are excellent and Chayenne is an excellent dancer as is Vanessa. Chayenne has a soulful demeanor and with his eyes and subtle facial inflections, he made me feel his loneliness as a stranger in a new land. Many times, I thought the film would sink into gooey sentimentality, but again, to my surprise, it rose above such obviousness. The best scene in the film is when Chayenne is caught in a lawn sprinkler system that turns on unexpectedly. With great charm and wit, Chayenne does an excellent homage to Gene Kelly, but with his own style and grace. A wonderful and funny scene. I recommend this film if you want to hear some great Latin music, see some great dancing and be captivated by Chayenne and the beautiful Vanessa Williams. By the way, Kris Kristofferson is very good as the man who gives Rafael (Chayenne) a place to live upon arriving from Cuba and who plays a key role in Rafael&apos;s adjustment to a new life in America.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Atolladero&apos; is a very impressive debut from writer/director Oscar Aibar that will appeal to fans of Alex de la Iglesia&apos;s &apos;Accion Mutante&apos; and &apos;El Dia de la bestia&apos;. All three films share a similar bizarre sense of humour and a willingness to ignore genre restrictions. I don&apos;t know what was going on in Spain in the mid 90s but I wish some of the originality and vitality of these movies could be imported right now to Hollywood, U.S.A.\n\nThe movie is set towards the end of this century where we are told the towns between the major cities have become lawless wastelands. Atolladero is one such hell hole, and is run with ruthless efficiency by the 150 year old &quot;Judge&quot; and his evil henchmen. The Judge&apos;s right hand man is Madden, a half Indian psychopath played by punk legend Iggy Pop. Local cop Lenny (Pere Ponce) is one of the few decent men in town. Tired of the corruption and perversion endemic to the area he decides to quit his job, and start a new life in L.A. To do so he must go against the Judge and his nasty cronies as no-one leaves Atolladero alive. \n\nThis movie is really fresh and interesting. It combines elements of the post-apocalyptic SF genre (&apos;Mad Max&apos;, &apos;A Boy And His Dog&apos;, &apos;The Ultimate Warrior,etc.) with classic Sergio Leone nihilism, and large lashings of Alex Cox subversion, and Garth Ennis&apos; sick humour. Highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "Serenade is far and away Lanza&apos;s most interesting movie. True, The Great Caruso is a more accessible film (and the best introduction to Lanza), but Serenade packs a far greater punch. This is melodrama to the nth degree, and fittingly it contains some of the finest dramatic singing ever recorded.\n\nLet&apos;s get the quibbles out of the way first. Injudicious editing has made some of the scenes appear silly and illogical. The speed with which Lanza becomes obsessed with Joan Fontaine seems absurd, and the ending could have been so much better. Would that the scenarists had had the courage to follow more closely the James Cain novel on which this movie is based, but then again, this was Hollywood, 1955. Had the movie been made without the censorship constraints of, say, a mere ten years later, it could have been a masterpiece. All I can say is, read the novel and you&apos;ll see what I mean!\n\nI would also criticize Anthony Mann&apos;s direction at times. Re-takes of some of Lanza&apos;s hammier moments should definitely have been made, and the film lacks (at times) the full dramatic treatment that its subject deserves. Re-takes of Lanza&apos;s Nessun Dorma and Di Quella Pira should also have been made. In both arias he sounds uncharacteristically strained, and in each case a second take would have sorted out the problem.\n\nQuibbles aside, Lanza&apos;s acting is often outstanding (the Ave Maria scene, for instance, is a revelation). Vincent Price, Lanza&apos;s acid-tongued and hilarious manager in the movie, later remarked off-screen how impressed he was with the tenor&apos;s dedicated approach to his acting. Sarita Montiel is also outstanding in her role as a fiery Mexican bullfighter&apos;s daughter, providing Lanza with his best-ever leading lady.\n\nBut what makes this film a vocal masterpiece is Lanza&apos;s singing. La Danza, Torna a Surriento, Amor Ti Vieta, O Paradiso, the Otello Monologue (Dio! Mi potevi scagliar...) and the heart-rending Lamento Di Federico are all astonishing feats of singing. By 1955 Lanza&apos;s voice had darkened into a lirico spinto tenor that often borders on the dramatic. It is rare indeed to hear a tenor with such baritonal fullness AND a ringing tenorial top. (Eat your heart out, Placido Domingo!) Lanza  For my money, the Otello Monologue is the pinnacle of Lanza&apos;s operatic legacy, and the finest recording of this aria. The scene in which it appears is also brilliantly acted by Lanza. As the critic John Cargher would later remark, Lanza&apos;s rendition of the Otello Monologue alone &quot;would assure him of immortality.&quot;\n\nAll criticism aside, Serenade remains a source of immense pleasure to me, and it is richly deserving of far wider appreciation.",

      "name": "A Film That Harbours The Essence Of Horror",
      "reviewBody": "Severely underrated on this website, Cronos is an engaging tale that captivates the viewer for the entirety of its duration. Guillermo Del Toro&apos;s first ever film is a thoughtful, heart-wrenching story which above all manages to be fresh, intriguing and unique while managing to captivate the feel of horror films in the same mould as The Shining, whereby it is a film about family first, and a horror film second.\n\nCronos is most definitely not associated with the slasher end of the horror market and nor is it anywhere near the filthy attack on the sense provided by goreography. What Cronos manages to achieve is an attack on the mind and the soul, the essence of what a horror film must succeed in doing if it wishes to leave a lasting impression. Given this I can, to an extent, see where the mediocre rating has derived from, it&apos;s not a blood fest it doesn&apos;t provide a scare a second and nor does it have gratuitous scenes of eyes being gauged out by rusty pick axes, but as every true horror fan knows is these are merely sideshow attractions to the superior horror films like The Shining, like The Fog, and Cronos if not completely at the top, is very close indeed.\n\nThere are three things which notably stand out about this film and make it undoubtedly worth watching. The most subtle is the commentary on US-Mexico relations that Guillermo Del Toro has littered throughout his film. It provides an interesting portrayal into how he, and undoubtedly many Mexicans, feel about their encounters with the US, that they are always trying to be dominated and they must stand up on their own, to strive to succeed. The most obvious is that of the highly notable Christian references and intentional name play. Our protagonist, the antique dealer, is named Jesus for simple reincarnate issues, but there a great deal of &quot;my God&quot;, &quot;my Lord&quot; and more comments of that ilk in the film, there is undoubtedly a side plot on the directors behalf of pointing out the good that still emanates from our protagonist. Jesus&apos; granddaughter and wife are named Aurora and Mercedes respectively, and by knowing the meanings of their names which are &quot;the dawn or first light&quot; and &quot;mercy&quot; provides the films finale with a sense of completion. Lastly of note is the acting on the part of Federico Lupi and Tamara Shanath, who provide the necessary gravitas even in motion if not through vocals to convey the deep emotional tie between grandfather and granddaughter which when all else is removed is the main driving force of this story, and the one that will have you coming back for more. It&apos;s innocence is soul-wrenching, yet Aurora&apos;s ability to see what is happening with unclouded eyes, provides the cornerstone for the emotional drama to take hold.\n\nOne critic in &apos;The Daily Telegraph&apos; claimed this to be as &quot;scary as hell&quot;, and to be honest he is wrong. This film isn&apos;t scary in the &apos;popping out from behind the bushes with a meat cleaver&apos; manner, this film is an attack of that which makes us, and indeed Jesus, human. It is a cerebral assault which plucks at your heart strings and confuses the soul, and for it is severely likable and very watchable while occasionally disconcerning. Cronos is human drama at its most wonderful, emotional and chilling and more importantly a wonderful debut by a director who will build in stature and promise greater things, but this is a debut with bite to it, and once it grabs hold of you, it&apos;s very difficult to get it off.",

But the killer is almost a normal guy (as much as a killer can be a &quot;normal guy&quot;!), killing with a purpose... Well, the guy is seriously crazy anyway, killing for very trivial motives, such as a man spilling his drink on him. \n\nThe bad thing in the movie is a kind of a scatological scene. It may seem trivial for some people, but for me, it wasted my enjoyment. Apart from that and 2 or 3 bloody sequences this is a very good movies.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; (Paramount, 1935) is the second in the musical series, but not up to the original 1932 classic, &quot;The Big Broadcast.&quot; This edition brings back Bing Crosby (who can be seen only singing one soothing song, &quot;I Wished on the Moon.&quot;); and George Burns and Gracie Allen as part of the plot again. George and Gracie have an invention called The Radio Eye (known today as television) that can pick up broadcasts from all over the world. (Least we forget that television was spoofed as The Radio Scope in Paramount&apos;s 1933 comedy, &quot;International House&quot;). The invention is then demonstrated to and swiped by Spud Miller (Jack Oakie sporting a mustache), the manager of the failing radio station, W.H.Y., and tries to promote it and take the credit for himself. During the course of the story, he and his partner, Smiley Goodwin (Henry Wadsworth) are kidnapped by a man-chasing countess, Ysobel DeNargila (Lyda Roberti), who has them watched by her villainous advisories (C. Henry Gordon and Akim Tamiroff) while on board her private yacht bound for Cuba. Also featured in the plot is Wendy Barrie as Sue. \n\nThe musical program includes: &quot;Miss Brown to You&quot; (danced with gusto by The Nicholas Brothers/and Bill Robinson); &quot;Why Dream?&quot; (sung by Henry Wadsworth/voice dubbed by Kenny Baker); Crosby&apos;s &quot;I Wished on the Moon,&quot; &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (Sung by Lyda Roberti); &quot;It&apos;s the Animal in Me&quot; (sung by Ethel Merman); instrumental song in brief conducted by Ina Ray Hutton and her Melodears; and &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; (conducted by Ray Noble and his orchestra). \n\nAside from brief musical interludes (with some numbers being interrupted by dialog) presented during the plot or on the Radio Eye, there is one moment of drama set in a hospital with Sir Guy Standing as the doctor, Gail Patrick as his nurse, and David Holt as the little brother who donates his blood to save his sister (Virginia Weidler); comedy skits involving Amos and Andy, another with Charlie Ruggles as a nervous husband wanting to get rest, but is constantly interrupted and annoyed by wife Mary Boland; and in between, those three house builders (Willy, West and McGinty) who never seem to get their job completed for that everything goes wrong (ala Three Stooges). Like many movies of this sort, some gags work, others fail to amuse, but it&apos;s still worth a look just the same. There is even a climatic chase scene to add some excitement. \n\nWhen once presented on American Movie Classics in 1991, host Bob Dorian pointed out a bit of trivia: the production number featuring Ethel Merman singing &quot;It&apos;s the Animal in Me&quot; supported by dancing elephants, was actually a cut number from an earlier musical, &quot;We&apos;re Not Dressing&quot; (Paramount, 1934) and inserted into this film. Good thing because Merman&apos;s &quot;Animal in Me,&quot; along with the dancing by Nicholas Brothers and Bill Robinson (in separate scenes) are some of the few highlights that help bring some life to its mediocre moments of the story. Never distributed to home video, aside from broadcast showings on some local public broadcast channel, and the aforementioned AMC, it did have a return television big broadcast many years later on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: July 23, 2015).

As time in isolation from the society passes by the clear separation between reality and fantasy fades away...\n\nThe whole movie is set in a quite dark, honoring the cinematographical style of film noir, and an oppressive small environment that intensifies the feeling of captivity and brings the viewer to a really close experience of living in rejection by a threat from your whole surroundings. Another important factor that enhances the great emphatic power of the movie are the performances of the whole cast, especially the two main actresses that enable an extraordinary intense and close contact with the emotions of the characters. If u are interested in experimental movie (I call it experimental because of it&apos;s very subjective point of view caused and carried by the situation of isolation, that the main characters live through)this movie is a must, also for everyone who is enthused for the artistic way only a movie can tell a story.",

      "reviewBody": "Far better than I remember thinking on my first viewing but that was a while ago and now I think of it one of my first in this field. Probably not a good one to encounter first because it really is such a strange one. Pretty surreal with nuns drifting down corridors, gowns splayed out behind and the dreams, imaginings and nightmares punctuated with goring killings and lusty couplings. Ekberg is fine but so is everybody and they all play weird so that this also helps to give the film an unreal feel even though it is firmly set in a convent and supposedly based upon a true case. A stand out moment is the crushing underfoot of the poor old lady diner&apos;s false teeth, as we cut from the vicious trampling to the squirming old lady, hands to her mouth. Music is pleasant enough and effective if a little derivative and if Dallesandro seems the most normal person on the screen that just goes to show something about this true one off.",

(This involves any film from any country, I&apos;m not picking on Japan)Anyway Gamera vs. Guiron is the most cheesy (well that and Zigra)of the series. Akio and Richard Burton find a UFO landed in an empty lot not far from home and the home of local police official Officer Cornjob who warns the boys not to behave badly. Anyway spacebabes on the UFO kidnap the boys to their planet to eat their brains and show them a big monster fight. Anyway to conclude early, Gamera shows up to save the day and show them the errors of their ways. Hot spacebabes with Kentucky accents should not be trusted, no matter if they give you jelly donuts. Cornjob could have told you that!!"

From Duke to King. How ironic that the man known as The Duke in his lifetime had to be the object of this tongue-in-cheek line. Some would think that The Duke was above being a king. This movie does fit the small screen (of t.v), but maybe it was appropriate for the large screen in 1945 when folks weren&apos;t so jaded in their viewings. The real gem of this movie is Joseph Schildkraut, as Boss Tito Morell. How could a shady bad guy be so lovable? We love the under dog. Is there any question that The Duke will walk away with the lady? But Tito is the one who really loves Flaxen, and always holds back from resorting to &quot;fixing&quot; The Duke as his cronies want to do. He may be the evil foil, but you can&apos;t help but love this gentleman scoundrel. Loyalty does not pay in the end for our hapless romantic. And talk about obsession: the suitors of Flaxen still hang around even when it seems she will be paralyzed for life after the Great Earthquake (did San Francisco really have electric poles in 1906?!)--they hope the old trooper will return to the stage and awe their hearts, not to mention their libidos! As Flaxen is whisked off in Duke&apos;s carriage to Montana, Tito has the best line: &quot;Compliments of the House&quot;...."

Its hard to take the actor who gave such Film performances as Spartacus, The Defiant Ones, Some Like It Hot, and Operation Petticoat (yes, only a fair movie but he was terrific in his role) in this drivel. I&apos;m no performer, but really, can the allure of the stage or screen really be so powerful as to be involved in this embarrassment? Was he in deep to a bookie or the IRS?\n\nRecommendation: watch the RiffTrax version, only.",

      "reviewBody": "This was one of the first neo- or revisionist-westerns and it really is a bit of a shame younger audiences mostly don&apos;t seem to know it: this is classic seventies gold. Arthur Penn, one of the driving forces behind the so called New-Hollywood (he also directed &apos;Bonnie and Clyde&apos;), delivered a masterpiece - with a fantastic Dustin Hoffman. \n\nIt&apos;s an epic, tragic tale - but one told with an often very funny voice. Part satire, part honest look at America&apos;s dark and untold history, the tone and narrative structure of this film were ground-breaking. And it still looks fresh: the script, the acting, the camera, the music: everything still oozes quality more than 40 years later. A timeless classic. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "A lovely, interesting film, given more meaning by being the third of the three parts that more or less make up the history of Ingmar Bergman&apos;s family; starting with the sublime Fanny and Alexander, moving on to The Best Intentions, and then ending with Sunday&apos;s Children, which starts in the 1920s, but jumps forward and back to the late 1960s occasionally, where a character named Ingmar is confronting his dying father, from whom he&apos;s long felt estranged. \n\nMost of the film focuses on the Ingmar character&apos;s childhood, in typical Bergman fashion, capturing the complexities of family life, good and bad, funny and heartbreaking. Also fascinating is that Ingmar Bergman chose his own son, Daniel, to direct this story of Ingmar Bergman&apos;s relationship with HIS father. \n\nWhile there&apos;s clearly a certain poetry to that choice, I&apos;m not sure it was the strongest possible one artistically. Unlike Billie August with &apos;The Best Intentions&apos;, Daniel Bergman sometimes seems to just be doing an imitation of his father&apos;s style, and that lack of an organic feeling to the film-making keeps this from fully soaring. \n\nBut the complexity of seeing the father/son relationship though both a child&apos;s eyes, when his father seems like a basically decent man with problems. and his adult perspective on the same behavior as cold and destructive is pretty fascinating. \n\nA complex film I look forward to seeing again.",

Not only do they accomplish the killing, they destroy the life of a boy, the victim&apos;s brother, who witnessed everything. The most unfortunate thing is that this boy is blamed by his mother for not doing something to stop things. It then moves many years in the future. The two men are to meet on a kind of talk show. Incredible tension builds as the killer (played by Liam Neeson) gives some testimony and awaits the man whose life he pretty much destroyed. The outstanding thing about this film that there are no sides. As Neeson&apos;s character said, at the time he was proud. He went to bars and was hailed as a hero. He also knows that there is no forgiveness, no sorrow that can change anything. We await their confrontation. I will not comment on the events that follow. Suffice it to say that they are extremely intense and, I thought, satisfying.",

Jon Finch stars as Jerry Cornelius, Nobel Prize winner, rock star and secret agent, who embarks on a quest to free his beloved sister from the clutches of his evil brother Frank. The world Cornelius inhabits is the Swinging Sixties writ large; recreational drug use, rampant sexual promiscuity, and lack of respect for authority are rife. Writer, set designer and director Robert Fuest had worked on the &apos;Avengers&apos; television series, and it shows. The sets are dazzling, the supporting cast good, and despite its pessimistic theme the film manages to be fun. Jenny Runacre steals the show as the bizarre &apos;Miss Brunner&apos;, a freakish mutation who absorbs the bodies of her lovers. You really need to watch this to believe it.

Also along for the ride are Tessie (Wendy Webb), his former nun love that he got pregnant, and her foul- mouthed son Ivan (Patrick Roskowick), who is O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s illegitimate son. It all makes for perfect timing for some sort of sacrifice to the Blood Star for evil Dr. Um-tzec (writer-director-composer S.P. Somtow). This film gained some notoriety back in the day thanks to a gore-filled spread in (naturally) Gorezone. And while the film looks great in stills, it has many, many problems unspooling at regular speed. Somtow certainly doesn&apos;t lack creativity, but his staging and pacing leave a lot to be desired. He will have bits like the trapped characters seeing two people squashed to death by a bus, but they will act like nothing is wrong in the next scene. And there is some REALLY bad comedy going on here. The acting (most of the talent are Somtow&apos;s writer friends) leaves a lot to be desired too and the film offers quite possibly one of the worst child performances ever captured on film by Roskowick. When on, the film is pretty fun with some great make up work by John Buechler&apos;s MMI company. Interestingly, despite have a wealth of gore, this film is still unreleased in the United States.",

But not all these projects were great...as she also starred, inexplicably, in &quot;Green Fire&quot;...a rather pedestrian film where the worst thing about it is Kelly.\n\nThe story mostly is about Rian Mitchell (Stewart Granger), a scheming treasure hunter who seems to always be on the verge of a bit find....but fails. As for Catherine (Grace Kelly), she mostly seems to be there as window dressing throughout the film...very weird window dressing. Why weird? It&apos;s set in the Colombian jungle and there the very American and white bread Kelly appears...in her designer costumes and perfectly coiffed hair. It is simply ridiculous...and never really seems believable or necessary. As for the rest of the film, some is kinda interest...kinda.\n\nOverall, not a terrible film (after all, it has some nice location shots) but a movie that SHOULD have been a lot more interesting given its budget and cast.",

Everything about it is cute and funny, with the perfect counterbalance of wit and sophistication.  Robert Young is in handsome lighthearted form, and the children are of course adorable and winsome - especially Roddy, who wails at the slightest provocation.  It has everything!  The more I watch it, the more humorous subplots emerge.  My favorite scenes are when the nosy neighbors spread rumors of Lynn and Tacey&apos;s sordid affair, and she says at the lounge as they pass by, &quot;Let&apos;s give them something to gossip about!&quot;, and proceeds to jitterbug with him.  And when Mr Belvedere exposes the hypocrisy of the townspeople: Priceless.  I&apos;m so pleased with Ms O&apos;Hara&apos;s versatility when you think about the vastly contrasting films in their genres, themes and moods that she made around the same time within the space of a few years, how they display her dynamism and acting genius with her outstandingly unique ubiquitous great theatrical stage presence that translates well to the screen which is so rare and difficult a feat to accomplish.  She appears equally at home with deep brooding roles as she does the urbane comedic together-woman.  This is definitely one of her best!"

We&apos;ve seen the &apos;underdog gets the girl&apos; story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality.\n\nJay Baruchel was another unknown quantity. His supporting turns in Knocked Up, Fanboys, Tropic Thunder and Million Dollar Baby (remember the weakling who frequented the boxing hall despite his complete lack of talent – that was Baruchel) have provided laughs galore, but being the main star is different altogether. His geeky exterior and small frame isn&apos;t exactly leading man material however Baruchel&apos;s great comic timing and willingness to make a fool of himself if required makes him a likable headliner.\n\nOn the opposite end of the gender pole is the drop-dead gorgeous Alice Eve who, like Molly, is a hard ten. It&apos;s not just her looks that makes her popular with the men though, she&apos;s genuinely cool and doesn&apos;t have a whiff of ego. Elsewhere in the cast you&apos;ll find the previously unknown T.J. Miller as Kirk&apos;s best mate Stainer – a character who resembles Napoleon Dynamite if he were on crack cocaine – who delivers a handful of memorable one-liners and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nA charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner.\n\n3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",

The use of familiar stock footage from BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS to portray the alien&apos;s arrival on Earth is particularly disappointing. However, despite these problems, PEACEMAKER is still a highly entertaining sci-fi/action hybrid that has been undeservedly overlooked and is ripe for rediscovery. It&apos;s also one of the few films in which the gorgeous and talented B movie actress Hilary Shepard was given a leading role.",

      "reviewBody": "A German zombie movie, well why not...\n\nA short summary; Michael comes to Berlin to seek his ex-girlfriend Gabi, and comes head to head with an outbreak that turns people into zombies. There, short and to the point, the movie just unfurls after that, just sit back and watch the show...\n\nActually, the movie &quot;Rammbock&quot;, was rather good. Of course, you have to look past it being in German and all. I am saying that because I, personally, don&apos;t think German is a nice sounding language. But the language didn&apos;t really prove much of a nuisance to the movie.\n\nThe story told in &quot;Rammbock&quot; was appealing and good. It was straight forward and moved on at a brisk pace right from the very beginning. And Marvin Kren, the director, actually managed to put together a fairly decent zombie movie here, and proving it can be done with limited funds as well. And the fact that the movie basically just takes place in a small apartment complex, adds some sense of claustrophobia to the movie. And it worked well.\n\nThe lead actor, Michael Fuith, playing Michael, actually was quite good in this role. I can&apos;t say that I have seen any of his work before, or that I had even heard of him before this movie. Guess it is fairly obvious that German movies is not that I watch the most of.\n\nOne thing that I didn&apos;t like about the movie, was the agile zombies that were running around. I am more of a Romero-type zombie fan, wanting zombies to be slow moving and rigid in their movements, after all something called Rigor Mortis will set in once you die, so you shouldn&apos;t be all flexible and able to run around. But for those who like movies such as &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, you will definitely like the zombies in this movie. (Both &quot;28 Days&quot; and &quot;28 Weeks&quot; later are awesome movies, by the way.) Also, the ending was a bit too sassy. You saw it coming a mile away and it was quite cheesy. But hey, in overall, the movie was compelling and thrilling. So this ending can be ignored for the greater picture.\n\nFor a non-Hollywood movie, &quot;Rammbock&quot; actually is a good notch on the zombie genre. If it definitely worth checking out for zombie fans, regardless of you liking Romero-zombies or the agile zombies. And while you are at it, check out the French zombie movie &quot;The Horde&quot; (La Horde), it is worth the time as well.",

      "name": "Best Party sequel of college guys ever good as the first one",
      "reviewBody": "Good as the first one American Pie this sequel in my opinion is the best party sequel about college guys ever. This was my favorite movie of the first two movies in high school at the time. I was in senior year before I transher to other school. This in my opinion is good as the first one. All the gangs are back and they decied to make their own party since Stifler party was busted by cops. Great comedy, sexy, friendship, intelligent and smart. It is my third favorite in the &quot;American Pie&quot; franchise.\n\nAmerican Pie 2 pick&apos;s off where the first one left off it is been one year since the guys loose their virginty and they attendet collage. Some couples are together some broke up. The first year of college is over for Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Reuniting back in East Great Falls to trade stories about sexual escapades and university life, the boys find themselves having to deal with the women (Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, and Shannon Elizabeth) they rudely left behind. Determined to make the most out of the promising summer, the guys, along with their revolting but affluent friend Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), decide to rent a beach house to help sort out their confused, combustible lives. Running into mischievous lesbians, masturbation sessions stymied by Krazy Glue, the wonders of band camp, Jim&apos;s Dad (the invaluable Eugene Levy), Stifler&apos;s Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and parties galore, the four young men learn valuable life lessons as they awkwardly navigate all the tomfoolery of their summer break.\n\nThis movie is about party on the beach house and the boys decide to make one of the best summer ever. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) are no longer together weird, I did not like that. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still deeply in love with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but asks Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the band geek to help him out, so he could get better in sex. Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) are still together but they are MILES seperated because Heather goes to study to Europe. Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still horny about Stifler&apos;s mom MILF (Jennifer Coolidge). Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still a dick and he is brother Matt (Eli Marienthal) is funny.\n\nThe film is outrages laughable I have the VHS home and I do have to Blu-ray disc which contains Unrated version of the movie diffrent from the teacrical cut I used to had. The movie has jokes like Jim glues him self, I really like Jim&apos;s dad (Eugene Levy) defending his son after a older woman attacks JIm about his sex orientation, when he had a VHS tape glue on his hand. I would stick up for my son that way too. Shannon Elizabeth is still gorgeous in this movie she is great and sexy as Nadia. Gorgeous Tara Reid is awesome in this movie. Mena Suvari is hot. Sherminator (Chfris Owen) is back in this movie and he lands up with Nadia funny. We have two lesbians in this movie who force the boys to jerk off Stifler&apos;s private part. Denise Fey and Lisa Arturo were great as Danielle and Amber as two lesbians.\n\nLove the soundtracks: Blind Spot by Transmatic, Want You Bad by The Ofspring, Blink 182 - Every Time I Look For You, Good For a Woman by Alien ant farm-smooth criminal and more songs. James B. Rogers directed well this sequel so it is one of the best comedy&apos;s of 2000&apos;s. They don&apos;t make em like this anymore. My third favorite &quot;American Pie&quot; movie.",

      "name": "A life adventure for three common-sense-lacking, dysfunctional brothers",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Beginner&apos;s Guide to Endings&quot; begins with Duke White (Harvey Keitel) rattling off odds of chance, of life, of games, and of death. He&apos;s determined to kill himself one way or another and see if his death can give his sons better odds at living a semi-functional life. He has five sons, from three different women, and we first meet them at his funeral.\n\nThe eldest is Eddie (Jason Jones) and he&apos;s nicknamed &quot;Nuts&quot; after a failed but spirited attempt at becoming a boxer; Cal (Scott Caan) is a womanizing, scatterbrained meathead. Jacob (Paulo Costanzo) is able to hold down a house and a job, but that certainly doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s happy. Years later came Juicebox (Jared Keeso) another failing boxer following in the footsteps of his big brother, and many years later came Todd (Siam Yu) whose arrival marked the departure of the mother of the first three.\n\nFollowing the funeral where Cal showed up late, Paulo tried to beat him up, and then Eddie showed him how to throw a punch, the brothers gather at a bar for the reading of the will. The will provides the plot for the film and let&apos;s just say it sends the three oldest brothers on ill- advised, death-defying stunts to reaffirm their lives. It&apos;s as funny as it is chaotic and the completely unrealistic, ridiculous antics actually go along way to complementing the clever and comedic nature of the film.\n\nAt first, the odd casting (Jason Jones as a dark, brooding boxer) can distract from the good qualities, but the three elder brothers, in particular, have fantastic comedic chemistry. The best part of the casting has J.K. Simmons as the uncle and minister who tries to dispense sane advice, but don&apos;t worry, they rarely listen to him.\n\nPrimarily shot and set in Niagara Falls, the city and the falls themselves provide a suitable backdrop for the unfolding and unraveling of the boys&apos; plans and lives. Unfortunately, the film itself has a very dull or washed-out look and feel; the shots and use of colour are lacking a bit of punch that the screenplay and actors have. Perhaps it&apos;s just an outcome of the low budget, and most fans of dark comedies should be able to easily overlook it and enjoy &quot;A Beginner&apos;s Guide to Endings&quot;.",

Chow cast his feeling of his early life in it. Chow is a clever actor, but when he was young, everybody, especially his boss thought he was just anybody else. he felt disappointed and lonely, because no one amid his talent. so in the film this feeling was expressed through the role. though it is a very good comedy which makes you laugh through out the film, you can still get some complex feeling of life. Chow showed his excellent acting talent in the film, and the other supporting roles were also very good, such as Peipei Cheng, James Wong etc. if you can speak Cantonese, you can get more interest from it, because it contained a lot of vivid and interesting oral language in Cantonese."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit it - I only went to see this movie to support the fact that a Canadian movie was playing at my local giant movie-plex - a rarity in these parts.  I didn&apos;t know all that much about it and I went in thinking that there was a good chance that I was not going to like this movie.\n\nBut I was surprised.  Although it wasn&apos;t the most techno-savvy heist movie with the coolest gadgets and up-to-the-minute technology, it had me entertained. That&apos;s not to say that there weren&apos;t gadgets and neat props used to pull of the heists - just not a plethora of things like you would see in a huge budget Hollywood movie. The parts in the movie that were supposed to be funny made me laugh and the tense parts had me going.\n\n The setup, a trio of twenty-something friends making a game out of planning the perfect crime without actually any intention of pulling them off, was at least a refreshing start to a caper movie.  They are not looking to score diamonds and make it rich - they are satisfied with knowing that they outsmarted the security companies and that they could pull off these jobs if they didn&apos;t have morals and a respect for the law (they are just desk-jockies).\n\nI thought that the acting was well-done and the roles were believable. The script was pretty good and at least there wasn&apos;t a bunch of cheesy one-liners and awkward dialogue (although I too found that they said &quot;foolproof&quot; more times than warranted).\n\nAll in all I would have no problem recommending this to anyone. As long as you don&apos;t go into the theatre expecting the smartest, savvy-est, most original heist movie ever to grace the screen, then you&apos;ll most likely enjoy it for the &apos;popcorn movie&apos; that it is.",

When the depressive Jim decides to commit suicide, the destructive sociopath William lures and pushes him to the edge to force him to kill himself.\n\nThe storyline of &quot;Chatroom&quot; is intriguing since the author uses a physical room to depict the conversations of the teens as if they were happening in the real world.\n\nUnfortunately this promising and interesting concept is the only good thing in this boring and shallow film. The execution with several subplots keeps going back and forth from Internet to the real world but they are unattractive and maybe indicated for teens. In the end, I was no longer paying attention to this annoying flick. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Chat - A Sala Negra&quot; (&quot;Chat - The Black Room&quot;)\n\nNote: On 04 July 2023, I saw this film again, aware of the plot and of the dangers of social media (I do not have any social media, only a blog). This time, I found &quot;Chatroom&quot; better and better. My conclusion is that this film deserves to be seen at least twice. My vote is seven.",

Political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos calls the film &quot;a beautiful portrait of this psychological need to conform and be &apos;normal&apos; at the social level, in general, and the political level, in particular.&quot; \n\nI loved it. I think it was very symbolic of not just fascism, but politics and humanity in general. There really is a desire to conform, and normality varies based on when and where you live. Political ideas might seem weird in one place and not another. The same with morality. Could a society exist where the removal of your friends is just a part of life? Sure. (The Mafia does it.)",

His usual unsympathetic movie persona is here: A successful man in his field despite lacking professionalism that inevitably advances on his leading ladies while running and screaming through corridors in labored plots.\n\nBlake Edwards tries to sugarcoat Moore&apos;s dubious moral compass in this farce. Moore is a caring husband/lover that desperately wants to be a family man but shamelessly cheats his love interests. This dissonance in values never goes away and kinda ruins the lighthearted tone of this comedy.\n\nI loved Ann Reinking as the innocent perfect wife. The really good acting on her part that kept this movie entertaining. Amy Irving&apos;s is not exactly a counterpoint and could be more fleshed out. Moore does a competent job being more awake in the role than in his later movies.\n\nThe plot is nothing special and there&apos;s a unfortunate shadow of Arthur (1981) in the relationship between Rob and Leo mirroring Arthur and Hobson that is underdeveloped and seems tackled into the movie. Curiously, in Lovesick(1983) Moore&apos;s character also has an older figure that his character listen to and try to sort his problems.\n\nNot a bad movie, but not good either.",

Anyone old enough to remember seeing 1979&apos;s &apos;The Motion Picture&apos; on the big screen is a unique person... most of us fell asleep. Fortunately, &apos;Wrath of Khan&apos; saved the day in 1982, with lots of action and a recycled, but disturbingly menacing villain.\n\nC&apos;mon folks... even the original series didn&apos;t get too deep and meaningful. It was the more action-oriented pilot featuring strong characters that knew how to have a laugh every now and then that got it the network green light. This is exactly what the reboot movies have been like up to now. Admittedly, there hasn&apos;t been a classic in the bunch yet, but the potential is certainly there.\n\nIn my view, the reboot films are one really scary villain away from producing a classic. With TNG it was the Borg. Doctor Who has the Daleks. Both races completely inhuman, really nasty, seemingly indestructible, and hellbent on destroying (be it assimilation or extermination) everything in their way. Boldly going where Trek has gone before, so to speak.",

The plot, the characters are revealed at a perfect tempo, keeping the audience engrossed and anticipating what&apos;s next. Any film with such sparse dialogue needs to make the rare lines worthwhile, and Saura certainly does, probably learning from Erice, the master of indispensable dialogue. Ana Torrent invites all sorts of Erice comparisons, but I see Saura taking a step beyond him here visually.\n\n&quot;Beehive&quot; was a landmark film, and unlike anything that had been made. But the camera maintained the same distance and the story was fundamentally allegorical. Saura experiments with distance, sometimes following the characters closely, sometimes giving an omniscient birds eye view of the area. Sometimes remaining a mere witness to what&apos;s happening. It&apos;s very carefully calculated to best enhance the scene and keep these extraordinary events within the realm of possibility.\n\nIf there&apos;s such a film as a director&apos;s film, this is it. Although it is certainly worthwhile for the performances as well.\n\n5 out of 5 - Essential"

About reading the bedtime story 14 Little Bears over and over again to Fimpen is really funny.\n\nSo is Carl Billquist as the little too enthusiastic principal.\n\nUnfortunately the sound quality is rather poor and I wonder if that might be the reason why it hasn&apos;t been shown very much?\n\nStill, this is a good children&apos;s film that not only children are going to find amusing."

      "reviewBody": "This film begins with an astronomer by the name of &quot;Professor Breast&quot; (Geno Vasco) and a young student of his named &quot;Billy Bigg&quot; (Kevin Long) discovering a new planet within the asteroid belt. Excited about this the professor immediately calls the military who then informs &quot;President Bubba Shrub&quot; (Richard Van Fleet). Not long afterward, a space ship is launched to find out whether there are any aliens on this new planet and if so to annihilate them. However, when the crew lands on the planet they soon discover that instead of alien monsters the inhabitants are mostly attractive females who wear bikinis. What they don&apos;t realize, however, is that their ruler, &quot;Queen Numnum&quot; (Katheryn Hecht) has an insidious plan that involves killing them and taking their spaceship in order to invade the earth for a certain resource that they desperately need. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I wasn&apos;t expecting too much from this extremely low-budget comedy and yet even then I was somewhat disappointed. To be clear, there were some things that weren&apos;t terribly bad. For example, the graphics were obviously not top-rate but they weren&apos;t really necessary in the grand scheme of things and they lent a 50&apos;s quality to the film which I found rather quaint. Likewise, having attractive bikini-clad women certainly didn&apos;t hurt either. However, that&apos;s essentially the only two areas that were noteworthy as the script, acting and overall plot were simply horrendous. That being said, I&apos;ll give credit where it&apos;s due and have rated this film accordingly.",

A visiting TV team from France is listening to the credo of Cassavetes that you can make independent, free films in America if you dare to follow your convictions and forget about the limits of your credit card. Wonderful, life enhancing, a must for every film student. What a pity that it is not a bonus on the Cassavetes box. I saw this documentary recently on &quot;arte&quot; in Germany, and I was fascinated by the truth of many of his statements. The camera is attached to the man, moving around him hand-held, and the interviewer is just triggering his word-flow. A stage for this great filmmaker and some of his collaborators, including a listening Gena Rowlands.",

At age 36 he decides to finally lose his virginity and – with the support of his friend/priest (William H. Macy) – hires a sex surrogate (Helen Hunt).\n\nJohn Hawkes (Winter&apos;s Bone, Martha Marcy May Marlene) has been gathering accolades for his performance in The Sessions – and with good reason. He not only delivers on the physical demands of such a role but he manages to encapsulate the emotions of a man with a broken body but a good heart. It&apos;s an impressive performance that should see him at least receive an Oscar nomination come next years awards. Hawkes is almost matched by Helen Hunt. She bares all in a brave role that depicts a woman struggling with her job and her emotions. These two performances are some of the best (so far) this year. William H. Macy also gives a good performance as a likable priest that O&apos;Brien is able to confide in.\n\nAs a whole, the film doesn&apos;t shy away from much. The sex &quot;therapy&quot; sessions are depicted as realistically as possible and are both funny and touching (no pun intended). Ben Lewin&apos;s direction is simple yet it manages to adequately depict O&apos;Brien&apos;s world without sensationalizing it. It&apos;s an all round simple tale that is well told. This is an adult drama that will make you laugh, cry and look more positively at your own life. There aren&apos;t many films that do that these days.",

Why can&apos;t Hollywood leave remakes alone? Are screenwriters nowadays that unoriginal? Even though I felt that the 1984 film had a lame script (and acting), I loved the score, dancing, and scenery and the movie remains one of my favorite &quot;guilty pleasures.&quot; Dean Pitchford wrote this script, which is almost a carbon copy of the original movie. Most of the same songs were used but were &quot;updated.&quot; The only big difference is that the two leads--Kenny and Julianna--can actually dance whereas Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer couldn&apos;t (or at least not much). I&apos;m still fuming at wasting all my money last night and would have walked out if I had paid only $1.50. Sorry to be so harsh in this review but I was not impressed. But I do hope that a better &quot;dancing movie&quot; comes along for Kenny and Julianna, because they are terrific dancers."

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Ultraman Mebius &amp; Ultraman Brothers",
      "reviewBody": "I grew up watching Ultraman on television, so much so that back then I can sing the theme song, in Japanese (of course not knowing exactly what it meant)! With so many variations on the Ultra heroes, it&apos;s actually quite easy for a kid to follow, with each episode having a different ugly monster wreck havoc on Earth (ok, make that Japan), and each time Ultra- whoever will transform himself, do battle through his kung-fu moves, until that red light on his chest blinks as an indication to stop monkeying around, and then he finishes the monster with his signature moves.\n\nAh, nostalgia! But what I did like about Ultraman, was indeed the intricate modelling done on the landscapes of Japan, and how they get so painfully destroyed by the monster imitating Gojira, or when our hero is on the receiving end of a smackdown to the ground. And the special effects, though so dated today, were really captivating to a kid those days. I have many fond memories of my collection of Ultraman figurines, which somehow mysteriously disappeared after cousins came visiting one afternoon many years back. Over the years, especially after television stopped airing updated episodes, Ultraman faded, but always had a special place inside my heart.\n\nThere were the new versions of late, what with Ultraman Tiga, Dyna and what have yous. I found their design to be un-Ultraman like, especially with their shades of blue. Watching some episodes didn&apos;t trigger my interest, so I did not pick up from where I left off. However, in celebration of 40 years since the creation of the very first Ultraman, a new movie (only released in disc format here) was spotted on the shelves, that of a certain Ultraman Mebius. While I thought his colour scheme was right, and the new kid on the block very nicely designed and pleasing to the eye, what caught my interest was the words &quot;Ultraman Brothers&quot;, and in the same cover, you see the heroes of old, including Ultraman, Ultraman Jack, Ultraseven, and Ultraman Ace, together with Ultraman Taro and Ultraman Zoffy. Wow! But the barebones DVD coupled with its unattractive price put me off for a bit, until I saw a preview of it being shown on the television of an electronics shop.\n\nAnd I was sold!\n\nI bought the DVD, and rarely do I pop it into the player immediately (I still have stacks of DVDs unwatched), but I did for this one. And I loved it tremendously, nevermind the kiddish plot and central theme of &quot;the power of confidence can give you courage&quot; kinda fortune cookie sayings.\n\nFor the uninitiated (as if I was an expert), Yi Lai is in the GUYS formation, one of those world wide policemen with snazzy equipment and vehicles to combat monsters that invade earth, but almost without a doubt never using such firepower given the presence of Ultraman. Yi Lai is Ultraman Mebius, and when called upon, he has this transformation device attached to his wrist to being him up to size. Mebius is quite athletic, and has a range of powers which this movie will introduce you to, coupled with a streak of green in his level of experience. After all, Mebius had selected to come to earth because he wanted to find out whatever happened to his brothers Ultraman, Jack, Ace and Seven.\n\nThe quartet had been living a life of seclusion of sorts in their human form, sacrificing their ability to transform in order to imprison a vicious monster. And you know what the best part is? The filmmakers got the ORIGINAL human actors to portray their aged counterparts, and fused some montage shots from their resp ective series of yesteryears! You just cannot get any more cooler or more authentic than that! Pure nostalgia flowing I tell you! And this lends some weight when the quartet had to counsel Yi Lai and dispense some tips and tricks to our new rookie protector of earth - we&apos;ve been there, and done that!\n\nNot to spoil the story (which isn&apos;t much anyway), the action sequences are to die for. Fans will recognize our respective heroes&apos; signature killer moves, and after 40 years, CGI has crept into the movie in the depiction of our heroes&apos; battles against the monsters, but that is not to say it&apos;s forgetting its man-in-a-rubber-suit heritage. You get the best of both worlds combined, with close-ups and more physical stunts done by stuntmen, and the more fantastical, in flight action rendered through computer graphics. It&apos;s pure eye-candy, and one which you&apos;re definite to watch on repeat!\n\nThis is a recommended must watch for all Ultraman fans out there, and I&apos;m already eyeing the original series boxset which is currently still priced beyond my reach. Tears will flow when I watch those episodes I tell you! And Mebius does seem interesting enough for me to want to follow his exploits. So if anyone out there wanna get my a gift for whatever occasion, you probably know what to get me now, don&apos;t you? :P",

      "reviewBody": "When you write a story worth telling, you must do so. This one is a superbly written piece of literature and cinematography. Set in New York, mainly, Little Senegal is a compassionate, crude and compelling story about love.\n\nMaybe many would disagree with the idea of love when most layers on this film seem to be about hatred and senselessness. But even when these very negative subjects are clearly portrayed on film, the basic force that moves it is love. A love so deep that can endure mostly anything. The love of someone who wants to know. A man in a search that he won&apos;t let go, &apos;til its very end.\n\nThis film has been called counter-Hollywood. I think it&apos;s just a French-Senegalese-German film that, -as most film-making in the world, is not counter-Hollywood, it&apos;s just pure cinema, where all the flashiness and predictable stupidity seen in most American films is simply not even considered.\n\nThis film is a triumph in showing the terrible change that actually happens every day in American society. The dark side -a very broad one, of its &quot;Dream&quot;. A life that is no dream for millions. Something most Americans wouldn&apos;t even consider a possibility in their country. Something pretty well kept by the current Administration (2008) and prosecuted as crime (illegal immigrants), when it is a reality that has made the US what is now.\n\nThis film left me thinking about many things (you can see the twin towers in winter, against the sky, from a grave) that have happened since 2001, when this film was premiered.\n\nIncosistent lives. Weird calls from politicians to their country to keep it safe. Alienating policies. Building a wall that may be the most degrading act since Berlin&apos;s Wall and the new Wall of Jerusalem.\n\nThis is not a documentary, but it is well documented. And it&apos;s only about the lives of a few people, but it represents a huge amount of &quot;others&quot; who embraced the motto (&quot;The American Dream&quot;) and fell into its fangs, unaware that it would change their lives from the inside.\n\nIt&apos;s a fact I lived many times, a fact we see every day, but a fact we don&apos;t want to look at, because it makes us feel guilty.\n\nActing is spot-on, cinematography is what cinematography should always be: a medium to convey the story to the viewer, and on this film, it&apos;s plainly brilliant. One of the most exhilarating qualities of this film is the way sound is mixed: most of the time its direct sound is so forceful that you actually &quot;feel&quot; the weather. The soundtrack is outstanding and it comes in handy many times to play a character on its own.\n\nWatch this film, you won&apos;t be disappointed. Be ready to cringe and cry.",

      "name": "Very beautiful",
      "reviewBody": "This movie is very beautiful. It&apos;s plot is essentially a fantasy by Zeffirelli, revolving around the idea of Callas starring in a film production of Bizet&apos;s Carmen, at a time when her life was drawing to it&apos;s close and her magnificent voice had been reduced to a painful echo of it&apos;s former glory. This setup is completely imaginary - Zeffirelli, of course, being intimate with Callas, having worked with her on a number of productions - and although Callas is at the focal point of the story, one can safely assume that this movie is as much about Zeffirelli himself as it is about the great diva.\n\n The film&apos;s main characters - the aging artist, the agent, the film critic - are mainly used to explore themes familiar to those living the life of artistic creation; the fading of creative powers, the meaning of integrity in art, the influence of money and publicity, love and the beauty of youth. This is Zeffireli speaking here, making use of one of the most expressive voices ever heard, to express feelings of his own.\n\nIt is is better not to approach this movie guided by expectations of absorbing revealing biographical elements. Though Ardant convincingly depicts the arrogance and overbearing personality which were often present in Callas&apos; behaviour - with a few very convincing tantrums thrown in - there is a sentimentality projected that is more of a wishful thinking than factual characterization; one can hardly imagine Callas enjoying herself in an impromptu picnic in a park, surrounding herself with nothing but carefree informality.  But the movie is very strong on most aspects; the directing is fabulous, both in it&apos;s pace and in it&apos;s settings, and the acting - Jeremy Irons in particular - is truly exceptional. And then it&apos;s the music - wonderful singing from Callas&apos; voice, coupled with scenes from a very spirited production of Carmen where Ardant gives a convincing performance in a very demanding part.\n\n For some people the movie will prove somewhat unsatisfying, the more so if one focuses exclusively on Callas at the cost of ignoring other nuances and ideas, and the sheer pleasure of listening to the music and singing. But it is definitely recommended to watch, and for opera lovers it is a must see.",

      "name": "A poorly executed commentary on cultural gaps, but an impossibly charming romance",
      "reviewBody": "Whatever anyone may say about Subhash Ghai&apos;s &apos;Pardes&apos;, I personally found it very entertaining, engaging and charming. The film may be quite stereotypical, and yes, the portrayal of the US may have been amusingly flawed, but the film&apos;s issue is in my opinion dealt with quite well within the context of a Hindi film of its sort. Besides that, the story is quite lovely and the film is according to me believable and moving due to the performances, the music and its overall feel. It essentially works as charming romance and nothing else.\n\nThe film is about a young Indian girl named Ganga who lives in a rural village in India with her extended family. Her father&apos;s best friend, Kisohrilal, who&apos;s been living in the US for over 20 years, comes to visit them. Kishorilal is immediately charmed by Ganga and wants her to marry his young son Rajiv. Ganga&apos;s father agrees to the proposal and soon comes Arjun, Kishorilal&apos;s faithful nephew, who is also a good friend of Rajiv, to organise the engagement before Rajiv, who&apos;s never been to India, comes to see his bride. Arjun and Ganga befriend each other, but the real trouble starts when Ganga is taken to LA to live with Kishorilal&apos;s huge NRI family before marriage. The social, cultural and economical gaps rise, and Ganga finds herself lonely in a world which is very distinct from hers, where no one except for Arjun seems to understand her. There also starts the realisation that Ganga and Arjun are actually in love.\n\nThe film is according to me beautifully narrated and Subhash Ghai&apos;s direction is very good. Technically the film might have been better as the cinematography was not that good. I did not see &apos;Pardes&apos; as a social film or anything of that sort, but more as a romantic drama, and in that genre it was absolutely enjoyable. I don&apos;t think Ghai tried to show NRIs in a bad light, because such differences and difficulties are to be expected in any kind of transition from one country to another, particularly when moving from a conservative and traditionalistic society like that of India to a liberal country like the USA. There were many great and touching moments in the film, my favourite being when Ganga talks to her father in India on the phone and feels very lonely and sad. The romance between Shahrukh Khan and Mahima was very well portrayed and the two had a wonderful chemistry.\n\nThose discussing Shahrukh Khan&apos;s best performances often seem to overlook his work in Pardes, but this is according to me one of the finest performances of his career. As Arjun, he is kindhearted, and atypically subdued, sensitive and extremely vulnerable. Khan plays his role with restraint, depth and sincerity he rarely employs. The film&apos;s brightest spot for me is the gorgeous Mahima Chaudhary, whose stunning, almost angelic beauty is a true heavenly creation. She is not only one of the most beautiful actresses to have graced the Indian screen (or any screen as far as I&apos;m concerned), she is also a talented actress. Her smile lightens up the screen, and she is so compelling, moving and charming as the smart, sensible and no-nonsense Ganga that there seems nothing easier than to fall in love with her. This is a marvelous performance and easily one of the most promising debuts by an actress in Hindi cinema; why she did not go on to reach any particular heights in her career is still mystifying.\n\nAmong other members of the cast, another newcomer, Aproova Agnihotri, who plays Rajiv, fails to impress here and it was not a good idea to start a career playing an unsympathetic character. Amrish Puri is outstanding as Kishorilal, and the rest of the cast provide good support. Nadeem-Shravan&apos;s soundtrack includes some very melodious tracks. I liked Kavita Krishnamurthy&apos;s rendition of &quot;I Love My India&quot;. This film also marks the breakthrough of Sonu Nigam, who became a star with the song &quot;Dil Deewana&quot;. A soulful, melancholic and very romantic song called &quot;Zara Tasveer Se Tu (Meri Mehbooba)&quot; was beautifully sung by Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu. To sum it up, Pardes is a wonderful romantic drama and that is the reason it was appreciated upon release. I recommend Pardes, for its story, music and superb star cast, particularly Khan and Mahima.",

It was however, ultimately disappointing Other than the main characters not forming well enough for the audience to actually care about them, the movie was so frustrating in so many parts. The storyline is formed around 2 dopey people who are in a relationship that is shabby. There are so many times throughout the movie that if they actually just talked about their feelings OR treated the other person with respect and showed some trust, the entire plot would have fallen apart. (but than we wouldn&apos;t have a movie) So what we end up with is a movie that has a plot, although quite shallow, based on characters that are annoying.\n\nIf it wasn&apos;t so frustrating, it could have gotten a 7, but instead it gets a 5/10, and that is being generous",

The photography by Crosby is elegant, the acting of the lead pair and the supporting cast are all pretty much dead-on.  A tight, efficient telling of a memorable tale, peopled with all sorts of interesting characters (the gas station owner/accomplice who keeps a deadly menagerie behind the garage, Cabot&apos;s mom who keeps telling Kelly what a disappointment he is because he hasn&apos;t broken into the &quot;big time&quot;, etc.). \n\n Interestingly, this film takes the gangster genre beyond film noir (finally, after 3 decades) by making his characters not only self-loathing but WORTHY of self-loathing!\n\nOne of Corman&apos;s very best films as a director.",

The second halve however really surprised and impressed me. I loved it!\n\nI really love old-horror movies with both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in it. In this movie they are better than ever together. Their acting is superb and so is the rest of the cast even though it is a bit strange that almost all of the Russians are played by Spanish people. Telly Savalas also shows up in a fun role. Savalas is probably best known for portraying Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond movie &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot; but he also played in classics like: &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), &quot;Kelly&apos;s Heroes&quot;, &quot;Capricorn One&quot; and &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. It&apos;s wonderful to see such fine acting in one movie because normally mainly it are just only Cushing and Lee who are the only good actors in a movie like this.\n\nAlso this movie is actually scary and gory and it has a really good atmosphere. It starts like some kind of monster movie like &quot;Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot; but the second halve of the movie is more like a Zombie movie like &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (which is an underrated horror classic in my opinion with a great soundtrack). A combination that worked really well for me.\n\nThe story stays simple and of course ridicules but it still is better than 90% of the other movies from the same genre and it actually goes deeper in trying to explain some of the things.\n\nIn my opinion a real horror classic!\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Years have been good on her, and on Johannes Heesters, who is already pushing 50 in this film. Probably the best production of this operetta is definitely worth a look. Rich colour photography, lavish costumes and witty location shots make this film a fast-moving feast for eyes and ears. The film was first released on DVD in Russia (these films went to distribution straight to the Soviet Union, so Russians obviously consider them rightfully their own), and is now available also in a German release.",

For Christsakes people - the movie has a unicorn (oh and a disclaimer inserted into the last scene, stating that &quot;no one knows all those nominated for the throne...&quot;).\n\nIn any case, the movie background is more or less accurate, at least as accurate as the background for, say, Braveheart. And I don&apos;t remember too many complaints about the Mel Gibson&apos;s anachronistic kilt.\n\nThat having been said, this is certainly second rate cinema, but its pretty to look at and its fairly engaging, which is an improvement for Russian entries in the &quot;block-buster&quot; category. So 1612 gets 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for story and 1 star for the unicorn. It also gets a firm handshake for keeping me entertained and for giving me hope of a slight upward trend in run-of-the-mill Russian film making. In the words of Arthur Hoggett, &quot;That&apos;ll do.&quot;",

Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then... oh but that would be telling.\n\nThis is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung (most people think this didn&apos;t happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). Its the sort of movie that they don&apos;t make any more, and rarely did when they did. Its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later. Clair moves his camera around in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing (though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since Berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through &quot;the real world&quot;). Its an amazing little movie. and its a charming movie that will just make you smile. Its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment.\n\nI&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t say more.

Anjaili gives birth (legitimate this time)to Sweetie after sleeping with Amit (her husband).\n\nSweetie falls in love with Vicky! Vicky rejects Sweetie – earning the wrath of Amit – for Amit was a failure in love himself and it hurt him to see that Sweetie would have to live-on with unrequited love – more or less like father, like daughter – also like mother – since her mother (Waheeda) too had been in love with someone else and was afraid to confess to Amit about her pre-marital sex, pregnancy and even delivery! Such a huge secret was hidden by Waheeda!! So a sad Amit reluctantly married an even sadder Waheeda (she was a mother after all who had given birth to a &apos;nanhi-pari&apos; but never could shower her love on her – sob-sniff) and they &apos;copulated&apos; lovelessly – thereby giving birth to an entity like Sweetie – whose love for Vicky went unrequited! Like Parent, Like Children – amazing huh!! \n\nMind it – a 1976 film – pre-marital sex and associated lochas are ramphant – why on earth do the oldies scream and shout at the youngsters saying that the current generation has gone to the dogs! Even they were not adhering to chastity or virginity – how come they expect their sons and daughters...kith and kin to behave all nice and decent and chaste!? Pooja&apos;s heart, mind and soul remains with Amit – body with Vijay. Only Vijay is the one who seems to not have had any locha affair – but what does he get as a reward? Pooja&apos;s body – well most Indian husbands will quite agree that it is enough – heart, mind and soul are difficult things to handle – it is better that the female handles it all alone – which maximum wives do by dwelling in their reverie – with some distant (existing or non-existing) dream lover!\n\nLife &amp; Compromise - So Pathetic Indeed!"

      "reviewBody": "Talk about a project for hire- this is one of those under-seen movies that is understandably kept nowhere in your local blockbuster, and only discovered on Netflix or Amazon by the fans of director Takashi Miike who might want to look for something even more &apos;different&apos; than his high-voltage yakuza pictures and surreal nightmares. In a sense Andromedia is still a surreal nightmare, only this time filled with so much corny vibes that you&apos;d have to be the biggest air-head 13 year old girl not to see the humor in it. I&apos;m sure Miike had to see it too, otherwise he probably wouldn&apos;t of touched it with a 20 foot pole. It&apos;s the kind of work that&apos;s too weird to be popular, ever, in America, and I wonder looking at the response here on IMDb if there&apos;s even much awareness for it in Japan. It tells a love story with images like the cherry orchard (on a beach) meant to accentuate the power of the main teen couple (Mai and Yu played by typical but dippy Hiroko Shimabukuro and Kenji Harada respectfully). Mai, by the way, is not really Mai, but Ai, her previous self&apos;s memory packed into a computer simulation form of herself after her sudden death.\n\nIt&apos;s not just Yu who wants her, but there&apos;s also some nefarious villains who want her via the technology for no really big reasons (no world domination, at least I don&apos;t think so) other than just having it cause it&apos;s there. One of these guys is very strangely played by Christopher Doyle, a DP for directors like Van Sant and Wong Kar Wai, who happens to have a haircut like a muskrat long dead and made into a wig. He has his goons chase after Yu, and his friends as well, just after that laptop with poor Mai (err, Ai), leading up to a climax that doesn&apos;t really make much sense except to have really over-the-top CGI effects. Actually, much of the film doesn&apos;t make too much sense, but if you don&apos;t get that by the thirty minute marker, just throw out the movie. I didn&apos;t know going into it that it was also, in part, meant to be a partial commercial for two pop-music groups (though the very oddly placed and uproariously funny music video in the middle of the movie marks as something of a crazy marvel in Miike&apos;s cannon).\n\nOf course, it will never mark as a must-see even for most Miike fans, and I&apos;m sure some who come across it will just keep scratching their heads once it&apos;s over. Though after seeing several other films from the massively prolific director, I&apos;m kind of glad to see that there is such a fluffy side to his savage satire, and how in-between the sickeningly cutesy love moments (like when Mai and Yu have a real &apos;connection&apos;, where a carnival lights up and the nearly wretched music cues up) there&apos;s still some bits that remind one of the heedlessly inventive and demented wild-man of Japanese cinema. The only thing funnier, sometimes unintentionally sometimes not, than seeing Yu and his boy-band friends jumping off the cliffs to relative safety, or the brain-tumored gangster Takanaka getting enveloped in the horrendous tubes of the internet center, or the *very* late 90s mix of Backstreet Boys-styled music and CGI, is that this was originally based on a book! It&apos;s poof, slight, and it almost marks a form of campy, sci-fi pop-art.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Curse Of Frankenstein&apos; is a landmark horror movie for several reasons. Firstly, though Hammer had already released &apos;The Quatermass Xperiment&apos;, a science fiction movie with some horror elements, it was the studios first real entry into the genre which it is still revered around the world for. Secondly, it was the first movie inspired by Mary Shelley&apos;s &apos;Frankenstein&apos; made in colour. And thirdly, while it wasn&apos;t the first movie to feature both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, it was their first horror movie together, and one which introduced one of THE great screen duos, who eventually made over twenty movies together. Lee doesn&apos;t have as much on screen time as one might expect, but his Monster is memorable and visually striking (after Universal threatened to sue if the image of Karloff&apos;s monster was copied). As well as Lee, the supporting cast includes good performances from Robert Urquhart and Hazel Court. Urquhart plays Paul Krempe, initially the young Baron&apos;s tutor (the Baron being briefly portrayed by Melvyn Hayes before Cushing), and later his often unwilling assistant. Court, best remembered for her roles in some of Roger Corman&apos;s Poe series, plays the Baron&apos;s cousin/fiancee. The standout performance of the movie is by Peter Cushing. I still think Karloff is the definitive Monster but Cushing is the definitive Baron Frankenstein. There were six sequels to &apos;The Curse Of Frankenstein&apos; and Cushing played Frankenstein in all but one, the second last in the series &apos;The Horror Of Frankenstein&apos;, which was actually a tongue in cheek remake of &apos;Curse..&apos; starring Ralph Bates as the Baron. The movie wasn&apos;t completely successful and thankfully Cushing returned for the final movie &apos;Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell&apos;. For me the first and last in the series tie as the best Hammer Frankenstein movies and Cushing is remarkable in them both. I highly recommend &apos;The Curse Of Frankenstein&apos;, one of Hammer&apos;s greatest horror movies. No-one can truly call themselves a horror movie fan if they haven&apos;t seen it."

As the story behind the research develops, it goes deeper into the rain-forest along the Apaporis river and finds more realistic events of the magic connections between the ancient wisdom of men and the miracle cycles of life, death and rebirth. The pictures of Doctor Schultes taken 60 years ago are the puzzle pieces that keep the attention on the storyline, making it more than a plain documentary on ethnobotany. Worth a look, will help to understand the consciousness of the Amazon inhabitants on their role in the Earth equilibrium and conservation.",

      "reviewBody": "On a level of polished film making, this is possibly one of the shoddiest big-budget films ever made, but for viewers with the right (admittedly warped) perspective, it&apos;s terrifically entertaining. Most bad movies are merely ineptly made and therefore boring. But this film reaches such a surreal level of ineptitude that the viewer can only wonder, &quot;What did I just watch? Was that a movie or was I hallucinating?&quot; The script here is so disjointed and bizarre, it gave me the impression of what Ed Wood might have done if he had tried to make a children&apos;s film and had access to real stars. The plot is indescribable, so I won&apos;t try. Some golden moments are Will Geer and Mona Washbourne as the children&apos;s grandparents singing a song about how boring it is to be dead; Robert Morley decked out as Father Time in a slightly morbid Land of Unborn children; and my favorite,  Ava Gardener in the Palace of Luxury, pointing out to the young boy all the luxuries (all grotesquely personified): the luxury of eating when not hungry, the luxury of loving one&apos;s own looks, etc. When the kid asks Ava, &quot;Which luxury are you?&quot; she leers at him and says, &quot;You&apos;ll find out about me when you get a bit older.&quot;\n\nI saw this film when it was first released. The ad campaign had made it sound like a charming children&apos;s fantasy, and the fact that it was filmed in the USSR brought out all the liberal parents and their kids. By the end of the screening, the theatre was empty except for my friends and me, rolling in the aisles with laughter. So, if you like inexplicable bad movies, the ones that make you wonder just what in the world the filmmakers thought they were doing, don&apos;t miss &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Do you know that feeling you get when you&apos;ve been lied to about a movie. A while back when In Bruges came out, the trailers pitched the movie as a wacky, Guy-Ritche-esquire, comedy with midgets and whores. Imagine the surprise of most of the movie goers when they went to see this film, and it turns out to be a very dark comedy, written about a suicidal hit man who is know facing regret and depression in the worst vacation spot ever. This feeling of surprise can sometimes make or brake how a movie is received for some people. Most of the time the audience will walk out of the film thinking that they&apos;ve been lied to just so they will have payed for a ticket and other times the audience realizes that, if the movie wasn&apos;t pitched to them as this picture that they&apos;ve seen before, they wouldn&apos;t have seen the film in the first place.\n\nThis is how I felt when I left Adventureland. Let me get this out of the way, Adventureland is NOT A COMEDY. I know the trailers pitch it as one, the director says it&apos;s one, and under the genre section of IMDb it says &apos;Comedy. But, this film, honestly, has two jokes in it, most of them supplied by Bill &quot;By God You&apos;re In Everything Aren&apos;t You?&quot; Hader. I&apos;m not saying that this film only has two jokes in it like there are a lot of jokes in here but they&apos;re not funny. I&apos;m saying that they&apos;re are only two jokes. Yes, Adventureland was pitched to us a romantic teen comedy about a horrible summer job but instead the film is a romantic drama that focuses on 21+ year old, coping with the fact that life is in fact full of sour lemons and you need to take a horrible job because it&apos;s the only thing you can do. I too was surprised that Adventureland wasn&apos;t a comedy but once you get past that, the film is actually very enjoyable and turns out to be one of the most intimate romance films on the same scale as &apos;Once.&apos;\n\nThe film centers around the double named protagonist, Brennan James. Who is a couple thousand short of the money he needs for his trip around Europe as well as the first couple months rent for when he starts going to school in NYC. His parents inform him that his dad has been demoted and he&apos;s gonna have to pay for the money himself. The only job that is still hiring is the seedy amusement park Adventureland where all of the employees do nothing but talk about how much their job sucks, smoke weed and get drunk during their shifts. Brennan-James falls in love with the smart-dangerous girl, Em. But due to his drug connections, the hot girl of the theme park starts to become attracted to him. A love triangle turns into a square, then a hexagon and soon just a big pile of mess.\n\nThe film itself could go for a very whimsical style here due to the amusement park setting but because of the directors previous works (Freaks and Geeks and Superbad) he decided to go for a super-realistic approach. I also feel like he chose to direct this drama because he wanted to expand himself as a director. The direction itself is pretty subtle, which is for the best. I was really engrossed in the script itself and I felt like any &quot;special&quot; work the director put in it might have taken me out of this twenty-something romance story.\n\nThe story is a very good one. This too goes for the extremely realistic approach. Watching this film I remembered all of the times I had experienced something like this with a girl and that&apos;s when I realized that the film had totally sucked me in. I couldn&apos;t wait to see what was going to happen to Brennan and Em and once their relationship hit a couple of big rocks I remembered all of the times I had nearly ruined my relationships by doing something stupid. (i.e. listening to my penis and not my brain)\n\nI was worried about the acting at first, it has a newbie as the lead and the twilight girl as his love interest. Not to mention Ryan Renolds playing a mentor figure, one that is a couple of cockiness points away from being the one in Waiting. However the director must have worked his magic with these three because they display some of the best performances I&apos;ve seen in a while. They emote, they repress, they do everything a real person does in a relationship to the degree where their characters are so well developed your rubbing your eyes in disbelief like some kind f college screwball comedy. Then again, realism seems to be the thing Adventureland seems to do be going for.\n\nThis film is trying to grab the attention of the forty-somethings that were twenty-somethings in 1980 by making the most realistic nostalgia trip I&apos;ve ever seen. The costumes seem like they&apos;re right out of value village, the dialog seems like you could have said it today and the acting makes the characters seem as if they&apos;re real people.\n\nIf feel that Adventureland wasn&apos;t pitched to the audience as a dramatic look at young love during the backdrop of the late 1980&apos;s because in the latter part of this decade, the only way young people are willing to look at the 1980&apos;s is through the eyes of irony. Looking at hot new styles as stupid idiotic fashion choices. Adventureland looks past all of that and makes a film that seem to be a grown up Sixteen Candles and because of this new approach to a beaten down idea, I not only applaud this movie but recommend it to people who have been looking for something new.",

Very clever and charming script manages to manipulate the myths, legends, and cliches surrounding Historys favorite mini meglomaniac and find a spark of humanity missing from most movie representations (except for Abel Gance&apos;s masterpiece...which is beautifully saluted in this movie&apos;s final snowy scene).  Ian Holm sinks into the role of the exciled emperor and the burlesque turn of the galley swabber recruited to impersonate him with equal aplomp...(to be honest I would have relished a bit more of the impersonators delicious descent into debauchery). Excellent supporting performances, beautiful score, and unique unsentimental portrait of the period (with unvarnished representations of 1820&apos;s undertaking, hygine, and nontreatment of mental illness).  A film to treasure if just for the gentle subtlety of it&apos;s central romance...including a tryst on a rooftop overlooking Paris during a thunderstorm which ranks as one of the loveliest shots in years.  A sweet smart little gem which belongs in the collection of every cinema connosuire",

      "reviewBody": "Some pretty good reviews have been turned in so far. I recommend &quot;All&apos;s Right With the World&quot; (telegonus from brighton, ma; 16 August 2002). Also, jayjerry regards it as &quot;My All-Time Favorite&quot; (jayjerry from Burbank, CA; 2 February 2007).\n\nIn &quot;Making Your Way In A New World&quot; (bkoganbing from Buffalo, New York; 6 October 2006) we get good background on Charles Laughton&apos;s personal interest in the story. In &quot;For He&apos;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot; (lugonian from Kissimmee, Florida; 18 December 2010) we are provided the film history of the story.\n\nIn &quot;What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg, anyway?&quot; (theowinthrop from United States; 20 May 2006) we get criticism of the pacing of some scenes, along with the gags that don&apos;t entirely work.\n\n&quot;Ruggles at Red Gap&quot; starts out as a (not laugh-out loud) comedy about manners. As the story moves from Paris to the Western US, it acquires great depth by way of Laughton&apos;s extraordinary reciting of Abraham Lincoln&apos;s &quot;Gettysburg Address&quot; to a saloon filled with cowboys who can&apos;t recall a word of it.\n\nAs freedom and liberation emerge as new themes, love also arrives. Laughton&apos;s Ruggles (convincing as a heterosexual) finds a widow (Zasu Pitts as Mrs. Judson) with whom a restaurant adventure is undertaken. Among the first patrons of this restaurant is his former Parisien employer (Roland Young as the Earl of Burnstead) who has found a very charming Washington socialite (Leila Hyams as Nell Kenner).\n\nAcquiring richness until the satisfying finale, &quot;Ruggles at Red Gap&quot; should be regarded as among the best films about Americana. Three scenes are standouts: Laughton&apos;s exceptional Gettysburgh recitation, Roland Young&apos;s musical flirting scene with Leila Hyams and the restaurant sequence climaxed by a rousing finish.\n\nLaughton&apos;s transformation from a dour and proper man servant to a more popular figure comes with the help of two instigators; i.e., wealthy ranchers Egbert (Charles Ruggels; yes that&apos;s confusing) and Effie Floud (Mary Boland). Egbert is a particularly corrupting influence on Ruggles by introducing him to drink and repeatedly insisting that they both share the same class.\n\nEach cast member is superb. Leo McCarey is very interesting visually. Note how in this cinematic period how few closeups there are; how often there seems to be a bit much space above characters heads and how far away a group stands from the viewer&apos;s perspective, as if seen from a stage.\n\nIn real life in Washington State (around 1908) there probably would be more than one enemy for Ruggles to contend with; for being out of place, foppish, proper, literary and theatrical. As with many of the other films from the 1930s, common people are depicted idealistically.\n\nSomehow McCarey made this beautiful, rich and rewarding commentary about liberty, finding love and gaining acceptance before he appeared as a friendly witness to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) witch hunt. This is not explained by &quot;Ruggles.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Directed by Yasujirô Ozu Written by Yasujirô Ozu Takao Yanai &amp; Tadao Ikeda Starring: Chishû Ryû, Shûji Sano, Takeshi Sakamoto, Haruhiko Tsuda &amp; Mitsuko Mito\n\n Japanese culture has always been in my interest, and watching old Japanese movies has been a thing I have done for some time now. I started of course with some of Akita Kurosawa&apos;s classic samurai-films from the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s., in which I mostly enjoyed. Some time ago I stumbled onto director Yasujirô Ozu. I only knew him for his 1954 film, &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. I did some research and found a copy of &quot;There Was a Father&quot; (Original Title &quot;Chchi Ariki&quot;), and watched it a Sunday evening. I could not make up my mind if i thought this movie was some total garbage, or if it was a pure masterpiece / it&apos;s either. But one thing is for sure, it stayed on my mind for hours. I came to the conclusion, that I actually really enjoyed it. The film centers around a father, played by Chishû Ryû, and his son, played by Haruhiko Tsuda (and Shûji Sano), and focues on their relationship in a 25-year timetable. There are a few issues with the pace of the film. I&apos;m sure many viewers will consider it boring, because most of the film is just them having a conversation about life and other subjects of matter which all end up being boring. But if you really give it the time to tell the story, it is actually kind of exiting and intriguing to watch and listen to. The film just seems more natural because of the every-day life conversations which they&apos;re having. Of course the movie dates back to the middle of WWII, in which Japan was a big part of, but this innocent picture, hides it away for a while, and just pays attention on some of the things that goes on in the familys. On a techinal level, the film is very beautiful shot. Cinematographer, Yûharu Atsuta and director, Yasujirô Ozu takes some wise decisions by having the camera just observe what&apos;s happening in the film. It fits the tone very well, and give the viewer time to think about the things the characters disguss in the film. Though, the sound in the film wasn&apos;t quiet as good as they are now-days, mostly because this is a more than 70-year old movie. However, it didn&apos;t ruin the film. It was easy to ignore.\n\nThough, I would have found the film a bit not my type of film, I really enjoyed watching it. It felt real. It felt like i was there, back in the twentieth century just making observations of the lives of a father and his son. I look very much forward to see more of Yasujirô Ozu work. I am very impressed by this man, even though it&apos;s the first film of his I&apos;ve seen.\n\nI give &quot;There was a Father&quot; 3.5 / 5 stars",

      "reviewBody": "Undeservedly neglected, &apos;Max et les ferrailleurs&apos; is one of the most intelligent, splendidly acted and carefully crafted French crime flicks of the 70&apos;s. However, cataloguing it as just another &apos;crime flick&apos; would be sacrilegious, as it has to offer much more to the patient viewer.\n\nClaude Sautet, from what I have gathered, is known for his dealing with the bourgeoisie&apos;s turmoils, often depicting complex social dramas in his films. Prior to watching &apos;Max et les ferrailleurs&apos;, I had only seen another great film he made with Michel Piccoli - Les Choses de la Vie, which is indeed quite different from &apos;Max&apos;. The subjects and genres might differ, yet Sautet ingeniously manages to create intriguing character studies (as both films have fascinating protagonists) and, while at that, to depict perplexing and powerful love stories, which help shape the protagonists&apos; moral portraits.\n\nI won&apos;t insist on the plot; suffice to say that the film does not get dull at any time and it also does not fall into a standard, clichéd policier. Max, the protagonist, could be compared to Melville&apos;s Le Samourai, insofar as both are cold, meticulous, obsessive and enigmatic. The baddies - the &apos;junkmen&apos;- are also well individualized, and here I should point out the excellent scene where policeman Rosinsky talks about each of them. Last but not least, there&apos;s also the divine Romy Schneider: between us, I wasn&apos;t able to take my eyes off her whenever she was in front of the camera.\n\nOne more aspect that amazed me about the film was the fluent and elegant camera-work, which had an immense impact on creating the film&apos;s atmosphere. Although I&apos;m not by any means technical literate, the composition of the shots struck me as carefully planned and the lightning was spot-on.\n\nIn a nutshell, &apos;Max et les ferrailleurs&apos; is more than you&apos;d be inclined to think: it&apos;s gritty and elegant at the same time, it&apos;s brutal and sensual, it&apos;s a thrilling crime movie and a complex character study, in short it is what a good film must be. Don&apos;t miss it!",

The Heartbreakers is a very entertaining coming of age story, very charmingly told with a very good screenplay and scenes you remember years after watching it. It&apos;s good to see a director crediting working class people with creativity and dignity- long before The Commitments. Most of all, the film is a very lovingly put together period piece in which every detail is just right. Normally I&apos;m not a fan of films set in this area of Germany as I don&apos;t quite like romanticising an essentially ugly part of the country but there is no false nostalgia here. It&apos;s rough, it&apos;s dirty, it&apos;s ugly- it&apos;s real.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you&apos;d like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don&apos;t seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love &quot;The Great Escape&quot; as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio&apos;s insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good &apos;ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.\n\nI could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film tells the sad story of a childhood somewhere in Germany in the early 60s. When Micha&apos;s mother leaves his irascible father, he tries to prevent their divorce by any means he can think of, but his attempts to hold the family together lead to a catastrophe. The film shows in a brilliant way how pressure and violence is passed along to an inferior person: Micha&apos;s father beats his son because he&apos;s frustrated about the poverty they have to live in and Micha vents *his* aggressions by teasing his little brother or the senile grandma of his best friend Olli.\n\nWhat I really like about the film (besides being moved to tears) is the realism and attention to detail in everything from dialogue to set-design. It&apos;s all dead-on. Even today children in Germany still tell the obscene &quot;poems&quot; which Micha learns from Olli (&quot;Rot ist die Liebe, schwarz ist das Loch ...&quot;). Another example: When they refurnish the room of Micha&apos;s granny copies of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (an infamous Nazi-newspaper) appear below the wallpaper, indicating that the Third Reich wasn&apos;t that long ago. Or: When Micha is told to bring some plums to relatives you can see that they have more exotic (and expensive) fruits in a bowl on the table, indicating the difference in the social position in a very subtle way. The script is full of these exact observations, so that you&apos;ll discover something new even the third or fourth time you see this little gem."

      "reviewBody": "Natalie Portman lives a dream and a nightmare when she gets a chance to dance Swan Lake in Darren Aronofsky&apos;s new film\n\nBlack Swan is a very bi polarized film. Portman dances as the white swan flawlessly, but her &apos;brilliant&apos; choreographer has doubts about her as the black swan. She needs to &apos;live a little&apos; and be less mannered, but the closer she gets to that point, the more the walls start to close in all around her.\n\nDarren Aronofsky, though he comes close to being heavy handed, has delivered a project which is fiery, spectacular and clever. He sells us ballet as something dark and off putting, starting from his decision to reveal what dancing does to peoples bodies. One mistake and you can crack a toe nail under your body weight, but I don&apos;t wanna oversell it. To look at Black Swan in another way, it is an operatic horror film, It has incredible style, but uses it not so much to dazzle but to confuse and intimidate. The paradox of Black swan is that it creepiness is kind of seductive, because it draws you in (much like the way vampires are supposedly romantic)\n\nBut style is only half the picture (not even). The rest is in the cast, and mostly in Natalie Portman. She is slow to get started, but she grows quickly and the result is arguably her best performance yet. I&apos;ve never loved her that much. She&apos;s always struck me as more of a girl than a woman, but I guess all she needs is to get a little blood on her hands, and you have an award worthy performance. Vincent Cassel, though he gets some questionable lines, is also at his best. I would have almost liked to see more of him, because you get the sense that his role has a bit more room to grow.\n\nBlack Swan does quite a bit, but it&apos;s not for everyone. Do not go into this expecting to be emotionally enriched. From the beginning, it is staged to be a mind-twirl, delighting in playing tricks on the audience. Some might call it cheating, but that would be the wrong way to look at Black Swan. It&apos;s quite epic, and with year coming to an end, I think it&apos;s fair to say that it is among the best of 2010.",

      "reviewBody": "High school student Todd Bowden (played by Brad Renfro) is an &quot;apt pupil&quot;, who excels at just about every subject. After becoming obsessed with Nazi Germany, he suspects a man in his city (Ian McKellen) is a former death camp guard. Todd blackmails the man and they become friends... or so it appears. But who has power over who?\n\nI really liked this film. I&apos;m always wary of King movies, because so many directors have botched them. Bryan Singer (&quot;X-Men&quot;) is not one of those directors, really capturing the crux of the story here and focusing on the Nazi elements. The imagery and symbolism wasn&apos;t overdone, yet not underplayed. I found every scene convincing (although I&apos;m not sure how seeing a photo from the 1940s in Germany would make you suspect a man in America in the 1980s).\n\nAside from Ian McKellen (who is now best known as Magneto or perhaps his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; alter ego), the cast is just phenomenal. Joshua Jackson plays best friend Joey and David Schwimmer, whom I normally can&apos;t stand, plays the sexually ambiguous guidance counselor with a bad mustache. Even Elias Koteas (Casey Jones from &quot;Teenage mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;) shows up as a homeless alcoholic, who really shines.\n\nThe tension in this picture is strong, as the bond between the two friends (or adversaries?) gets stronger. There are times where you don&apos;t know who&apos;s going to win the power struggle... and once the Israelis enter the scene, it gets even more complicated. You really don&apos;t want the Israeli police going after you (as we see in this film).\n\nAnyway, this was a winner. It was in the favorites section of Family Video, and I can understand why. We had humor, drama and a touch of horror (no real romance, though -- maybe briefly). A more well-rounded picture would be hard to find for someone who likes movies off the beaten path... this film is unique.",

On her return, a reporter Sam (Robert Young) exposes her as a former Burlesque Queen, Rosie O&apos;Grady. The film then follows the tricks that Rosie and Sam play against one another in order to get the upper hand. At the end, love is in the air.\n\nUnfortunately, the songs and dances in this film aren&apos;t any good and this lets the film down as the story doesn&apos;t have the strength to carry the film alone. The scenes with Betty Grable are good, but when she is not on screen, there are some pretty dull moments. Its not that the cast are bad, although there is a poor scene where Sam and Charles get drunk which could have been edited out, its just that the overall film isn&apos;t quite good enough. The music needed to be better in order to make this film passable or even good. Its a better story than her other offering &quot;Coney Island&quot; from the same year, but that film is better because of the music numbers that it contains.\n\nIts OK but it doesn&apos;t need to be seen again.",

Just to give you an idea, here is some sample dialogue:\n\nCondemned prisoner -- You&apos;ll burn in hell for that! Karl the Butcher Jr -- This IS hell!\n\nThis is the last of Andreas Schnaas&apos; Violent Shit trilogy.  It&apos;s better if you&apos;re survived the other two (which are actually harder to find).  But even by itself, it is quite a gore-fest.  The Violent Shit trilogy really is the closest thing to hell that I&apos;ve ever seen on film.  Despite the crude special effects, campy acting, and amateurish photography, it&apos;s an experience you will not soon forget."

Eventually 125,000 would serve overseas and nearly 1000 would die in combat, but in 1943 the big question was how to motivate blacks to fight for an America in which segregation was still very much alive.\n\nCarlton Moss was serving as an adviser to the War Department and the job was given to him to write the documentary, and eventually he ended up starring as a Minister.\n\nMoss decided to focus on the contribution of blacks in American history, particularly their role in battles as well as their achievements in science, medicine, and education. He contrasts that with the Axis views about &quot;colored people&quot; and their treatment of conquered peoples. The film switches tones and then follows the life of a new enlistee who eventually makes it to officer candidate school.\n\nThe documentary is very clever, telling the truth, but just enough of the truth to avoid some of the awful elements of life for black people in the U.S.",

She really takes a wonderful film and turns it down a few notches. She can&apos;t keep an Irish accent, switching back and forth with her American accent throughout the duration of the film. \n\nAnyway, Michael Collins is great to watch. The story is heartfelt, and the nuances between personal battles and patriotic duty are displayed in a very mature fashion - - to what extent will you go for your country? What will you lose? Who will you fight? Why will you do any of it? Who are your true friends? etc. \n\nThe music is FANTASTIC. Worth renting just for the listen. Of course Neison is great. So is Aidin Quinn (when I first saw this movie I thought Quinn was Irish given his name and his performance here). Alan Rickman is Alan Rickman - - which is great, though he doesn&apos;t pull off the Irish thing too well. However, given his character, Eamon de Valera, it isn&apos;t really a miscast, just takes time to get in.\n\nIf you can ignore how horrible Julia Roberts is and think about the heart and emotion behind this film while enjoying the awesome score you&apos;re in for a treat. A jewel in the rough. (my favorites)",

      "name": "Early &quot;pink&quot;/&quot;J-horror&quot; hybrid",
      "reviewBody": "Japanese genre cinema is known internationally for two things. The first is &quot;J-horror&quot; boom that began in 1998 with &quot;Ringu&quot; and lasted about ten years, launching the international careers of directors like Hideo Nakato (&quot;Ringu&quot;, &quot;Dark Water&quot;) and Kyoshi Kurasawa (&quot;Pulse&quot;, &quot;The Cure&quot;)and inspiring any number of bigger-budgeted, but usually inferior, Hollywood remakes about spooky, wet ghost girls. A less well-known, but actually older Japanese genre is the &quot;pinku eiga&quot; or &quot;pink&quot; films, which are arty, relatively high-class softcore sex films. Horror films and &quot;pink&quot; intersected somewhat in the 1980&apos;s with &quot;ero-grotesque&quot; films like &quot;Entrails of a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Naked Blood&quot;. More recently there&apos;s been a lot of shot-on-video stuff like &quot;Girls&apos; Swim Team vs. the Undead&quot; and &quot;Big T*t Zombies&quot; where nubile young Japanese girls alternately slay monsters and get *bleeped*. But for the most part (aside from an odd duck like &quot;The Slit-Mouthed Woman&quot;) the &quot;J-horror&quot; ghost girl movies and the sex-saturated &quot;pink&quot; films were kept separate.\n\nTahasha Zeze is actually one of the more well-regarded &quot;pink&quot; directors famous for films like &quot;The Dream of Garuda&quot;. But here he is basically making an early ghost girl film (where the girls are wet because they&apos;re ghosts, not for other reasons. . .). He wasn&apos;t just jumping on the bandwagon though--this was actually made a year BEFORE &quot;Ringu&quot;. And while it does have some obligatory &quot;pink&quot; scenes, like a girl in a school uniform getting her perky young breasts sucked and fondled, and it does feature teenage characters more than a little interested in sex (one girl is contemplating giving it up to her boyfriend, another constantly talks about sex on the late night talk show she anonymously hosts for some reason, and the third has a decidedly lesbian crush on one of the other friends), this is much more &quot;J-horror&quot; than &quot;pink&quot; (unlike the aforementioned &quot;Slit-Mouth Woman&quot;).\n\nOf course, it doesn&apos;t make much sense. The three protagonists use a Ouija board-type thing to try to contact a spirit called &quot;Kokkuri-san&quot;, who&apos;s kind of a more benevolent version of &quot;Blood Mary&quot; capable of predicting the future. But the predictions turn out to be pretty dire for all three as they seemingly awaken a vengeful female ghost, who may be a childhood friend of the main protagonist who drowned herself after they&apos;d earlier played the &quot;kokkuri&quot; game (begging the question of why she&apos;d ever do it AGAIN), or it may have something to do with the protagonist&apos;s recently deceased, sexually promiscuous mother who once saved HER from drowning. Don&apos;t expect the movie to answer anything because it doesn&apos;t show the slightest interest in doing so, but it does have a pretty effective atmosphere and some startling visual images like a girl in a long red dress floating in the ocean (later used for the cover of a book on Japanese genre films). Anybody, who insists on logical plots will no doubt hate this, but if you prefer spooky atmosphere, striking visuals and/or nubile Nipponese cuties in school uniforms, you&apos;ll probably like it alright. . ."

Too idealistic for our tastes today; yet as a showcase for Eddy &amp; MacDonald, with some fun thrown in, it is great.\n\nLike Zane Grey westerns, the characters are rather stylized and two-dimensional.  However, again like Zane Grey characters, they tend to demonstrate qualities that we wish were reality.\n\nWhat a supporting cast.\n\nWalter Pidgeon - very believable as the strong, fiercely passionate sheriff with his own strict code of ethics.\n\nBuddy Ebsen, Leo Carrillo, Monty Woolley, H.B.Warner.\n\nI have been surprised over the years how some men, that are rough and rather crude with each other, will display real protectiveness and gentleness in other areas.  Therefore, the behaviour shown by the miners toward &apos;Girl&apos;, adopted as kind of a &apos;mascot&apos; is credible and necessary for us to accept her sweetness.\n\nSuspend your cynicism, enjoy the fine music and a glimpse into a simpler time!",

      "reviewBody": "After the success that Sonia Henie&apos;s American film debut, One In a Million, had at the box office, no doubt Darryl F. Zanuck felt better about investing more money in her next film, Thin Ice. The resulting production is obvious for any viewer, the money spigots were left on for Thin Ice.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to imagine today the world wide popularity of Sonia Henie who the year before had come off her third gold medal in the Olympics before turning professional with the 20th Century Fox movie contract. The public wanted to see her skate and Zanuck gave them what they wanted. Her many routines are nicely staged and the ice dancing got an Academy Award nomination for Dance Direction. Yes, back in the age of musicals they actually had that as an Oscar category.\n\nZanuck even gave her his lot&apos;s most popular leading man in Tyrone Power. This was the first of two films Power did with Henie and while I think that Second Fiddle was a better film, this one isn&apos;t bad for what it is, a vehicle to show off Sonia Henie.\n\nSonia plays a skating instructor at an Alpine resort which is going to host a European conference. Power plays the playboy prince of a small duchy whose romantic escapades get him headlines. Henie gets herself involved with him, but she doesn&apos;t know who it is. In the meantime the two of them become tabloid fodder. I think you have a good idea where this plot is leading.\n\nStill Thin Ice is not bad as entertainment. And for comic relief we have Joan Davis conducting the all girl orchestra at the hotel and giving us some comic numbers. She&apos;s not bad at all. And Zanuck had such scene stealing character actors as Arthur Treacher, Alan Hale, Raymond Walburn, Sig Ruman, Melville Cooper, and Maurice Cass for support.\n\nNone but the best for his Olympic size investment.",

It tells the story of some of the people that have a connection with it, the people that worked there, whose parents or grandparents are buried. It also gives an account of the 20th century in Berlim with historical footage showing the main events of the city&apos;s life. And it is not just a story about Jews but also about many other people: students, visitors and even of a young family that lives in the grounds. The work behind a cemetery as this one is quite huge and it is definitely a place I would like to visit if I go to Berlin again. It&apos;s a wonderful park in the middle of the city full of history. Really worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though I have ambiguous estimations about this film on the whole, I can only say for sure that &quot;Satanico Pandemonium&quot; is a must-see nunsploitation Mexican flick for anyone who can be pleased about these kinds of movies for their evident ridiculousness. This is one of those flicks that have too many flaws and no plot whatsoever but it&apos;s still impossible not to like them, for some imprecise cause. The acting is not exactly Academy Award material and it causes unintended laughter. The special effects in which we see the concept of Satan and temptation itself represented on a laughable guy naked, is by far one of the most hysterical things about this film, along with the outrageously shabby sound effects during these strange apparitions. The whole thing just looks too tacky and the look on the guy&apos;s face is simply priceless, so how can anyone not love it?. I know some people could take it as a reason to overthrow the director&apos;s gracious effort, but I myself, found it too silly not to like it. Without offering an actual share of real horror, &quot;Satanico Pandemonium&quot; manages to get the attention, even if it is by some means erroneously advertised. There are some noble allocations of gore here and there, but the film mostly focuses on the drama and eroticism. The first half an hour happens to be ineffective in a way and that would be the only reasons why I felt compelled to turn it off throughout the first minutes and leave it incomplete. It contains no dialogs, no action and for the most part only a nice display of beautiful Mexican landscapes, which is not exactly enough to make it endurable. However, it is only a matter of persistence to realize that after the big unnecessary moments of silence and boredom, the story starts to develop some of the most astonishing states of affairs, in which we see lesbian soft-core sex between two nuns, a nun taking advantage of a teenage boy and some enjoyable bloody murders inside the convent. Without anything else to add, I can only recommend &quot;Satánico Pandemonium&quot; to anyone who is in the mood for a decent nunsploitation drama, with some utterly random sexual scenes, a couple of nice murders to attach at least a small share of horror to the story, a badly placed background story of racism and of course...lots of sexy and sinful nuns.",

Eva leaves her small town in search of fame and fortune in the theater. But poor Alice just wants to compete with the rest of the girls in her midwest Indiana small town that Booth Tarkington wrote about and land a real Prince Charming of a fellow.\n\nThe Prince shows up at a dance she goes to in the person of Fred MacMurray. She&apos;s taken with him, but she&apos;s ashamed of her family&apos;s rather humble living condition. When MacMurray does come calling they have a family dinner that turns into a real disaster.\n\nKate got one of her Oscar nominations for her role and MacMurray also gets one of his best early film parts as well. Kate&apos;s family is also nicely cast with Ann Shoemaker, Frank Albertson, and especially Fred Stone filling out the roles of mother, brother, and father. I do kind of feel sorry for Stone, he&apos;s really put upon by his family. In today&apos;s world Ann Shoemaker would have gone out and gotten a second job for another income, back then that would have been unthinkable.\n\nAlice Adams is a nice nostalgic trip by Booth Tarkington into the lives and mores of small town Indiana. This film was also George Stevens&apos;s first major film and he&apos;d work with Kate again in Woman of the Year.",

      "reviewBody": "An obsessive, neurotic, schizoid masterpiece that is so far ahead of its time that its time is still ahead. It is a Rorschach test that will reveal the level of your soul. Yes, a dark evil film but a cinematically productive one, reading from Kinski&apos;s intuition about how his forms can read for us. The film, for decades, like a mad person, has been confined to an insane asylum, and considered a danger to society. It was like an unspoken secret not to see it.\n\nI always liked it but I have been psyched out over the years from the orthodoxy insisting on its lack of merits. It has been enraging people for decades and I assumed in the restoration it would find a new life, only to find it is enraging the modern critics as well. A bad time to re-discover Kinski&apos;s Paganini (the only director other than Fellini who should have his name in the title of the movie). In our sterile climate of unprecedented conformity and rigid views of art, this reception is a mark for the film, not against it.\n\nFor all of Herzog&apos;s bad mouthing of Kinski, this film has had a grander restoration and release than his own output. Remember it was only together they made their enduring masterpieces; so badmouthing Kinski&apos;s B-movies maybe we can do the same for Herzog&apos;s nature channel documentaries or Hollywood Nicolas Cage Michael Shannon embarrassments.\n\nI am being defensive of this movie because it warrants it, and I sense he didn&apos;t want it to impede on their works together, as if that was in danger of happening.\n\nThe cinematography brings a kind of gorgeous ancient European feeling. The editing is crass, obscene, appalling of course, it is Paganini. When have we ever had an edit like this? It is utterly mad, but it works as the most frightening tone poem ever on film, akin to even the weirdest underground Japanese cinema.\n\nYou almost don&apos;t want people to get it, and to continue to live in a state of blissful oblivion. And yet through its runtime it is a nonstop poem of madness, sex, only missing drugs; (as Dali said, and it might as well have been Kinski, &quot;I do not take drugs, I am drugs&quot;.)\n\nIt is not for pretentious people. I can illustrate that I have watched Ken Russell&apos;s composer biopics recently, and while they are far from vanilla, in fact they are often quite daring, Paganini exposes them all as practically Disney fare.\n\nAnd yet, we shouldn&apos;t take this all so literally either. I have always had a question of how mad Klaus Kinski actually was. I can tell you that you cannot make hundreds of films without having a firm grasp of reality, in fact, you must to survive in that business. He showed up on time, he made the films, he went home. The behind the scenes documentary of Fitzcarraldo shows him throwing a temper tantrum, yes, but it also shows him doing scene after scene with the utmost professionalism. The behind the scenes of Cobra Verde shows no tantrum at all.\n\nSo the depiction of this man is that he was a wild animal, a mad man, that does not gel for film business professionalism or the work the two created.\n\nPoint is, it is key to see this all as an artistic point of view. Kinski was not a De Sade figure, but it was how he played it. The film expresses both his inner dragon, but more, how he wanted to be seen.\n\nWhat stands out here is that it&apos;s told without a hint of irony, like the followers of Herzog&apos;s bourgeoisie &apos;weird cinema&apos; sensationalism. This is perhaps why it provoked them so greatly, he is showing the real thing.\n\nAny bit of humor we can laugh at, such as the audience of women going crazy for him, is actually not as one would think, there for cinematic spectacle, but to express surreal excess, the contagious euphoria of being on stage. The film&apos;s goal is to capture is in this same trance.\n\nThe restoration finally brings the film to life for the first time ever. I am not sure if Vinegar Syndrome perceived its artistic virtues or did it to highlight it as a disastrous spectacle, but whatever is the reason, it&apos;s there to infuriate people for the rest of time. Kinski went farther than almost anyone, like Paganini he was not playing to the audiences, but to the fates."

      "reviewBody": "Giovanni is an engineer who leaves his fiancee in the North of Italy for promotion in Sicily but once there finds it very different from what he expected. Like &quot;Il Posto&quot; before it, Ermanno Olmi&apos;s masterpiece &quot;I Fidanzati&quot; uses mostly non-professional actors and a documentary-style approach to chronicle the everyday life of ordinary people in, for Giovanni at least, an alien environment. Sicily may as well be the surface of the moon though it does have its own rarefied atmosphere.\n\nOlmi&apos;s genius has always been for focusing his gaze on the simple things of life. There are no great dramas going on; some may even find &quot;I Fidanzati&quot; boring and yet there is more truthfulness and beauty here than most films can only dream of. I could watch Giovanni drift through his less than exciting life until the cows come home and Carlo Cabrini&apos;s &apos;non-performance&apos; as Giovanni is quietly magnificent, perfectly in keeping with Olmi&apos;s vision of the man. Not as highly thought of as &quot;Il Posto&quot; but just as fine, &quot;I Fidanzati&quot; is one of the greatest of Italian films and, sadly, one of the most underrated.",

But it is truly a very beautiful movie shot in a 1960s Paris in which only the cars have changed over the years. But the beauty also applies to the cast of actors and to their sensitive acting.\n\nLino Ventura is the fallen cop who doesn&apos;t bare a grudge and is dedicated as ever to his job, landing him into a painful fist fight with some thugs, and dealing chivalrously with his bright-eyed assistant Marlène Jobert who truly delivers as a newcomer to the job of crime fighting, aptly portraying both excitement and disillusion. The supporting cast, good and evil, deliver very well and accurately depict Paris&apos; diversity (often through gritty character depictions and photography) 40 years back.\n\nThe plot flows well, sometimes interspersed with dream sequences which are beautifully rendered. Never cheesy (like so many movies of the time), well paced and acted, truly a great cop movie which has aged very gracefully.",

Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.\n\nIt would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.\n\nThe balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.\n\nThe characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.\n\nThe movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace",

      "reviewBody": "disclaimer: obviously, if you don&apos;t have a pre-existing love for zero-budget Italian horror, this won&apos;t be your cup of tea.\n\nBut if you do! My, what a treat! I overlooked this film for years because I confused it with &quot;City of the Living Dead.&quot; I otherwise exhausted the genre&apos;s offerings. When I realized I hadn&apos;t seen this one, I was very excited, but I didn&apos;t expect much. I was in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nUgh, I&apos;m no good at paragraph format.\n\nThe Pros: 1. The title, &quot;City of the Walking Dead,&quot; is appropriate. This really is a city-wide infestation. This is not a board-up-the-windows movie. The scale is epic. So often, low budget zombie films restrict themselves to a few characters on a farm or something to save money. This one doesn&apos;t. I can&apos;t imagine how he was able to use some of the locations. (Actually, I suppose the title isn&apos;t quite appropriate, because the antagonists are neither walking nor dead. They run, and they&apos;re sort of still alive.)\n\n2. Breasts are present.\n\n3. I usually don&apos;t like zombies that deviate from Romero&apos;s mold, but Lenzi takes a risk and scores. These creatures combine the hypnotic element of Romero&apos;s zombies with the overwhelming danger of running zombies. According to an interview on the DVD, Lenzi did not want to just do another Romero rip-off, and insisted on coming up with his own sort of creature. He did it well.\n\n4. For the first 2/3 of the film, the characters are sufficiently believable for the viewer to care about them. For example, a reporter finds himself in the middle of the zombie outbreak, and desperately tries to get a hold of his wife, a doctor, who can&apos;t be reached because she&apos;s in surgery. This is a realistic, human element absent from most films in the genre.\n\nCons: \n\n1. 2/3 of the way through, it kind of falls apart. The characters who haven&apos;t died reveal themselves to be one dimensional after all.\n\n2. The special effects are really inconsistent. Sometimes killings are mimed bloodlessly. In other scenes, heads explode.\n\n3. The soldiers are pathetic.\n\nIn short, highly recommended.",

Earthlings, Forks Over Knives, and now Vegucated.\n\nEarthlings is the kind of movie that you show to the really stubborn person who really has no idea about the reality of the meat/egg/dairy industries. It has educated and inspired many people over the years to go vegetarian or vegans.\n\nForks Over Knives is mainly about the scientific discovery that animal protein is a potent carcinogen and that a plant based diet reduces your chances of getting western diseases such as cancer, diabetes, etc.\n\nVegucated covers both the above AND more! And what&apos;s best, it does it with style and comedy. If you can choose ONE film to show a friend, show this one!\n\nFor a no budget film this is really a great achievement and props to Marisa for taking her time to create this wonderful resource for vegans to educate their friends on this rather complex subject!",

Lured by tales of weight lost and health regained, they begin to uncover the hidden sides of animal agriculture that make them wonder whether solutions offered in films like Food, Inc. go far enough. Before long, they find themselves risking everything to expose an industry they supported just weeks before. But can their convictions carry them through when times get tough?  This accessible, entertaining documentary showcases the rapid and at times comedic evolution of three people who are trying their darnedest to change in a culture that seems dead set against it.",

I&apos;m sure that soldiers who went through the war found it interminable, but that&apos;s no excuse for a film about WW2 to seem interminable. Ironically it&apos;s twice the length of &quot;The Second Track&quot; and had half the impact. If you want a really good film about young German soldiers in that war see Bernhard Wicki&apos;s &quot;The Bridge.&quot;",

I have always loved inspiring movies where the cast rises above the rest after a lot hardships and achieves the unthinkable and this flick was no different. \n\nThe film starts with retired pro soccer player Kim Won-kang visiting Timor to make a quick buck. He has had several mishaps business wise and is laden with debts. Since Timor has newly found independence he thinks of opening a sports goods store and cashing on near and imminent development. He soon finds out that kids there can&apos;t afford a $60 shoe and what ensues afterwards is heart warming and inspiring. \n\nKim, though an amazingly kind person at heart has been portrayed as a shrewd businessman in the first few scenes. And seeing his character develop into what he is supposed to be was a treat. The kids too were great and played their parts to near perfection. The training sessions, the short speeches and the realization scenes made this film worth watching. The hilarious banter between various characters provided the much needed comedic relief. \n\nAll in all, this a very decent film to watch, one shouldn&apos;t expect too much and enjoy this with an open heart.",

When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deceit. The two actors gel amazingly well together, and the supports from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press. Instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery, The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted.",

      "reviewBody": "When a haunted Scottish castle is dismantled and removed to Florida THE GHOST GOES WEST, too.\n\nMade under the auspices of producer Sir Alexander Korda, acclaimed director René Clair &amp; distinguished author Robert E. Sherwood, here is a fine little film--very popular in its day--for thoughtful intellects, about things which go bump in the night. Or, rather, one thing in particular: a kilted phantom doomed to stalk his ancestral castle until his family&apos;s honour is avenged--irregardless of the actual physical location of his old stones, or whatever romantic complications may ensue.\n\nHandsome Robert Donat brings just the right amount of sophisticated humor to the dual roles of the ghost and his 20th century descendant. The lovely Jean Parker is splendid as an American rich girl very happy to take the Highlands real estate if Mr. Donat comes along with it. Playing her father, Eugene Palette exhibits both bluster &amp; bemusement as the merchant grocer determined on buying old Glourie Castle, ghost and all.\n\nMorton Selten &amp; Hay Petrie have amusing short roles as clan lairds who are fierce antagonists. The marvelous Elsa Lanchester appears far too briefly at the film&apos;s conclusion as a paranormal enthusiast.\n\nAcknowledgment should go to Vincent Korda for his atmospheric sets. And just what is the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather &amp; a kiss in the dark?",

Sutherland, Davidovitch and even Kellerman are wonderful. Sutherland must have been delighted to find this role and he made the most of it. Again, not for everyone, but an intriguing trip into a world most of us will never know, but might like to.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been 5 years (already!) since I saw my last Tarkovsky. I had come to rest with Zerkalo, because here was a man, one of few, very few in the cinema, who can permeate so deeply into the essential mystery of how things move, and he only made a handful of movies really so I must make them last, and take them in when the time feels right. My next one might be in another 5 years time, but yesterday night the time felt right for this, one I&apos;ve been heartily anticipating for years.\n\nThis is Tarkovsky entering the mind once more. He never does it in any obvious, Inception way, it&apos;s never actually the mind; but we arrive at a place, a source of the imagining, where wind blows from and rings each thing into being. In Rublev he was the artist looking to paint the face of god in a godless world that concealed it. In Solyaris he was the cosmonaut. In Zerkalo, a filmmaker who recalled a whole life, receiving visions at the doorstep. Here he&apos;s the Stalker who takes us into the Zone, obvious enough.\n\nEach one is self-referential of course about the very process of stepping into the movie. The Zone as a Tarkovsky movie - full of desolate nature and a mysterious presence that bends logic. We first have to cross the iron border where censors (his illiterate Soviet patrons) prevent entry.\n\nThis is the border guarded by the irongated mechanisms of reason that has to be crossed before we can begin our guided meditation beyond logic. One way he does this is by splitting himself into characters. One is a scientist, which is Tarkovsky&apos;s critique of a mechanistic worldview that reduces a tree to what biological facts it can explain. Another is a writer, a surrogate for Tarkovsky&apos;s intellectual self who despairs about the possibility of words to communicate sense. The Stalker himself as who Tarkovsky feels himself to be most purely, the guide who knows the whims of this landscape and wants nothing other than to bring us to the doorstep of miracle.\n\nIt&apos;s his uncanny ability, as always, to pave the way for that miracle. We never enter &quot;the room&quot;, as it were. But we are brought to the doorstep. He cultivates the space that leads up to that apperception, this is what people call elusive and dreamlike. Tarkovsky&apos;s real work is that he teaches, rewires, us how to see, effects this change in the whole of logic of space, so that we leave with Tarkovsky eyes to go back out. This is far more valuable, and insightful, than any of the imagery that blends industrial grime, fish and religious iconography (in one memorable instance, with voice-over from John&apos;s Apocalypse). It&apos;s that elements can swirl and reflect in this way.\n\nHe does several wonderful things, some of them completely breathtaking like the meditation on music that rings a chord in the listener who responds to it with what we have no other name to call but soul. He stretches space, seemingly with no effort, both in the industrial segment early and then across the Zone. He makes the geography elastic, shuffles boundaries of forward and back. It&apos;s not that this means something again, it&apos;s that the place in which you can receive _anything_ (which is perception itself) can bent thus. The result is a marvelous sense of heaving. Thunderous views of a train, or waterfalls, crash across the frame. Same thing. It&apos;s his most sculptural work so far.\n\nThe dilapidated Soviet locales provide ample opportunity for gnarly imagery, I simply shudder to think that it was actually filmed in places like we see. It&apos;s possible that we&apos;re seeing the place that killed him and several more from cast and crew.\n\nBut there&apos;s also another side that I want to draw my distance from. In Zerkalo he had reached a point of equanimity that lets go of questions and accepts what is, that for better or worse a life was lived. This is gone here and replaced with a sense of tiredness and cynicism that narrows down to the personal. Now it&apos;s not about what is let go of, it&apos;s about what is clung onto. None of it is sci-fi of course. But too much is an artist&apos;s stream-of-consciousness on what place his own art has. Too much is angsty here. What am I to make for example of Stalker being escorted to bed by his wife, now a pathetic figure who complains that no one wants what he has to show? This is a dangerous path to take because it substitutes the struggle to make sense of life, with the struggle to deliver art about doing it and complain that no one appreciates it. The latter Tarkovsky is far less interesting to me than the former. I fear he would get worse in this regard, compounded by his exile from home.\n\nI&apos;ve read about how Tarkovsy was possibly interested in Zen Buddhism and Tao while preparing for this and may have incorporated influence. There is the notion of spontaneous arising in the Zone as the Zen mind and the bit about how the soft endures while the hard breaks that comes from the Daodejing. It doesn&apos;t really venture into either, its preconceptions simply lie elsewhere. But Tarkovsky fails to make use of the Buddhist wisdom in his own predicaments. Instead of letting go, he clings to the burden of fixed views. He suffers their weight, for no reason I might add. The title of this post is a Taoist excerpt.\n\nSo there are two sides here. The journey to where perception is made fluid and mingles with its reflection and the intellectual burden of its creator. One soft, the other hard. Maybe in another 5 years I will get to see what gives way in Nostalghia."

I can appreciate that they&apos;re trying to bring it back to what the original was all about; a brilliant plot with a couple of gory scenes (the previous two have been somewhat gore-laden with little story for my liking), the problem being, unfortunately, that the plot is fairly weak. The intensity of the torture scenes is greatly increased, though, by the rest period between them. \n\nAs a horror film, this works, but don&apos;t expect Saw - and don&apos;t expect to be blown away by the ending, because it is nothing special. That said, if you&apos;re addicted to the Saw saga as so many of us are, there&apos;s no harm in going out to see it.",

These concepts have a very good case study in this British film, I want to underline &quot;British&quot; because I think it is important and it really gives a particular identity, those streets, accents, looks, school uniforms, habits, etc. are so heavy that it is definitely not a random feature. \n\nWhat I really want to stand out is the performance of Eloise Laurence as &quot;Skunk&quot;, she gives her character a tremendous freshness, she is very natural and convincing and above all, her face keep us under a beautiful spell. The rest of the cast is also excellent, and everything combines to give a quality film we can really enjoy despite of the drama.",

We all thought it would be another boring movie, but I along with many others was pleasantly surprised. Even though the movie didn&apos;t portray the actual life of William Shakespeare, it is a very interesting interpretation of what his life might have been like. Normally I am not a big fan of Gwenyth Paltrow, but she fulfilled the role of Viola De Lesseps very well. This movie, unlike many others I have been forced to watch in school, has not been a waste of time and has informed us more about the concepts and details that could not be seen just by reading the play. Overall I think I have gained a better understanding of Romeo and Juliet by watching &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I truly love those typical &apos;rural&apos; British thrillers from the late 60&apos;s and early 70&apos;s! They practically always revolve on hugely controversial topics and feature heavy macabre undertones, and yet they remain very stylish, sophisticated and classy. A couple of notorious examples include &quot;Unman, Wittering and Zigo&quot;, &quot;Deadly Strangers&quot;, &quot;Crescendo&quot;, &quot;Girly&quot;, &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; and some of Hammer&apos;s lesser promoted thrillers like &quot;Never Take Candy from Strangers&quot; and &quot;Paranoia&quot;. David Greene&apos;s &quot;I Start Counting&quot; is also an excellent addition to this list. The principal coming-of-age story is basically already an anathema, but then this plot is simultaneously interwoven with a grim tale of a serial killer on the loose in a small picturesque British village. I was already a great fan of the lovely Jenny Agutter thanks to &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; and &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot;, but after seeing this film she&apos;s truly immortal to me. Agutter gives away a stellar tour-de-force performance as the cherubic and curious 14 year old Wynne. The romantically inexperienced pubescent girl has a tremendous crush on her 32 year old foster brother and openly talks about her feelings with her school friend Corinne, who claims to have had sex with several boys already. During all her secretly observing and spying, Wynne begins to suspect, however, that her beloved brother George might be the maniac responsible for several gruesome yet unsolved murders. Where do the nail scratches on his back come from? Why are there bloodstains on the white sweater that Wynne made for him? Strangely enough, the more convinced Wynne gets regarding her brother&apos;s guilt, the more her feelings grow intense and obsessive. The young girl even convinces herself that she must rescue George, as the rest of the world won&apos;t understand him. &quot;I Start Counting&quot; is a slowly unfolding, captivating and often uncomfortable film that is made even more excellent thanks to the wondrous use of music like the title song (although some fans of the genre might not like this), beautiful images of the South-East British countryside and great work from the ensemble cast. The thriller elements surprisingly go well with the coming-of-age theme. The serial killer plot is occasionally very creepy, whereas Wynne&apos;s extreme devotion for her brother is also quite disturbing but in a completely different way. &quot;I Start Counting&quot; absolutely is a unique film; what they call a real gem of a great but sadly forgotten cinematic era. It pleases me to see that the film nevertheless has a few devoted fans here on this site.",

      "reviewBody": "Fascinating to watch during the Sydney Olympics this presumably official record begins with a brief history lesson about how the ancient Greeks began the Olympic movement, then on to the Winter Games in Switzerland where, surprisingly enough, all the events including ice-hockey and ice-dancing took place outdoors.\n\nAbout half an hour of sport in the snow then to London for the summer Olympics of 1948, much of which took place in the famous Wembley Stadium. Distances were posted on the scoreboard in both imperial and metric but times were only to the tenth of a second. (Only?!) Good coverage of cycling, equestrian, the regatta, swimming &amp; diving etc., but most emphasis was on athletics. What&apos;s new?\n\nThe pole-vault looked most graceful but the jumpers landed rather uncomfortably in a sandpit, and the women sprinters competed both on the flat and over hurdles. These events were dominated by a tall Dutch woman called Fanny Blankers-Koen who won four Olympic titles. Interestingly there was never a mention of gold or any other colour medal. Rain didn&apos;t appear to dampen the enthusiasm of the huge crowds attending many events but it did make the running track distinctly boggy-looking.\n\nThe problem with the film is the totally pedestrian presentation, moving from event to event by the numbers with a camera pointed at competitors and the usual cutaways to spectators applauding. However it is in colour though we expect to see sports film of this vintage (50+ years old) in black and white.\n\nSports fans should see this if they get a chance.\n\nN.B. The title - The Glory of Sport comes from the Olympic Oath, which we see an athlete taking.",

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",

      "reviewBody": "In the small Texas town of Aurora in the late-19th Century a tiny man (Mickey Hayes) seemingly fell out of the sky. This sets the tone for really the first legitimately-recorded UFO encounter in the U.S. (this is all supposedly based on a true story) as it seems the little man literally flew around in a small craft and was sent to this planet for some unknown reason. The children are entranced by the little fellow, the townspeople are a little frightened and the fright will ultimately lead to a sad tragedy as misunderstanding and prejudice will come into play. Hayes, unable to speak and harmless, meets old hermit Jack Elam (also somewhat an outcast in the small community) as all this transpires and they start a genuinely wonderful friendship as the two apparent opposites seem to have so much in common. &quot;The Aurora Encounter&quot; is one of those films that just seems to stick with me. The bond between Hayes (who suffered in real-life from a disease called Progeria, an illness which made him literally age about four to five times faster than everyone else) and Jack Elam is one of those cinematically magical experiences that I have a hard time explaining. Hayes, only 14 at the time of this film&apos;s release, would indeed die in the early-1990s (living to be only 20) from his horrible disease. This is the only film he ever worked on and his obvious kindness and the sympathy the audience feels for him is definitely undeniable. With all this said, &quot;The Aurora Encounter&quot; is still only an average film by the end. It succumbs to cinematic clichés and an unintentional mean-spirit that did not completely endear it with me. Elam (doing probably the best work of his long career) ultimately gets somewhat wasted because of other performers who really have no business in the movies. The direction is up and down and the screenplay is never sure what it wants to be. The movie just never really found an audience when released in 1986 and just became a very small footnote from the decade. If nothing else though, &quot;The Aurora Encounter&quot; should be watched for the scenes where Elam and Hayes are together playing checkers. As ho-hum as the movie is, the time when they are together on the screen is really something to embrace. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary&apos;s access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt&apos;s secret garden and finds her &apos;sick&apos; cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse).\n\nThe Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family&apos;s past.\n\nIn comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders.\n\nAs well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music.\n\nThe cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience.\n\nThe Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.",

He shows in fascinating details bomb deactivation and the atmosphere of Berlin lying in ruins - a striking metaphor for the devastated lifes of the characters! Chandler and Palance are believable in their roles. Psychological it impress through the description of the fatefully scratched squad, whose members are not able to get out of this suicidal job.\n\nIn short: A depressing but exciting look on World War II survivors, who battle for the reorganization of their lifes.",

      "reviewBody": "The Cowboys are lured from Mexico to Coney Island by their former manager who disappeared at the end of Leningrad Cowboys Go America. He believes he is the reincarnation of Moses, sent to lead them back to the promised land - Siberia.\n\nThe first film is a cult classic, as it should be. The second one is not nearly as good. The quirkiness seems to be scaled back, and the songs are not as good overall 9though &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; is a nice touch). Fans of the first ought to see the second, but I hardly think anyone would argue this is the better film.\n\nThe religious aspects are interesting, though never fully developed. I suppose some more parallels to Moses could have been included. The line &quot;Jesus saves, Moses invests&quot; is a good catch phrase, but what does it all mean?",

      "reviewBody": "Universal Pictures spared no expense when it came to support its new teen sensation. After her first two movies became socko hits, the studio went all out in Deanna Durbin&apos;s third film, February 1938&apos;s &quot;Mad About Music.&quot; Universal just re-signed Durbin to an adult-like salary of $1,250 per week with a $10,000 bonus for each of the films she made, an astronomical figure in those days for a girl just turning 16.\n\nDurbin is known as the actress who saved Universal from bankruptcy. Her &quot;Mad About Music&quot; was 13th in the year&apos;s box office rankings. The film gave her a boast in confidence after rejected by Walt Disney as the voice of Snow White after he felt her voice was &quot;too old&quot; for the part. The studio assigned the Durbin film A-listed Herbert Marshall, whose services were much sought after, to play her fictitious father. Contemporary columnist Edwin Schallert noted, &quot;The demand for Herbert Marshall&apos;s talents continues to spread far and wide. Even the newer and younger leading women, it is felt, need to have his proficient romanticism displayed in their pictures.&quot;\n\nUniversal spent a ton of buckaroos to construct a Swiss village on its studio lot for &quot;Mad About Music,&quot; where Durbin&apos;s character Gloria Taylor attends school in Switzerland. Her mother in the film, Gwen (played by Gail Patrick, who was in real life only 10 years older than Durbin), is a Hollywood star whose studio as well as her manager Dusty Turner (William Frawley) want to keep secret the fact she has a daughter. Gloria&apos;s father died in the war when she was a baby, but incredulously she feels the need to invent a story that her father is alive and is a big-time explorer. One of her so-called friends, Felice (Helen Parrish), doesn&apos;t believe her story, forcing Gloria to say her father&apos;s arriving on a train to visit her. She picks a man at random at the station, who happens to be Richard Todd (Marshall), a music composer. Once he discovers Gloria&apos;s predicament, he goes along with her tall tale, with hilarious results.\n\nNorman Taurog had just finished directing the first color-film version of Mark Twain&apos;s Tom Sawyer in 1938&apos;s &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.&quot; &quot;Mad About Music&quot; showcased several Durbin songs, including one backed by The Vienna Boys Choir, touring in California at the time of the production.\n\nThe Academy Awards nominated &quot;Mad About Music&quot; in five categories, including Best Art Direction for the Swiss village sets. Joseph Valentine earned a nomination for Best Cinematography, Frank Skinner and Charles Previn (Andre&apos;s cousin) for Best Music Scoring, and Marcella Burke and Frederick Kohner for Best Original Story.",

      "reviewBody": "You often hear of movies that are so bad that they&apos;re good. It&apos;s hard to point to a single movie that is like this though. What some may say is &quot;so good it&apos;s bad&quot; may come off to others as just plain bad. However, everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed: Troll 2 is so horribly, shamelessly bad, that it is good.\n\nThe writing for film is more than awkward (take the redundant &quot;Stonehenge Magic Stone&quot;), and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots. The reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it, Claudio Fragasso, is a native speaker of Italian. He wrote the script in English when English was (barely) his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible, but who can blame them? This was most likely the first (and last) film any of these actors have been in.\n\nThe costumes and special effects have that wonderful B-movie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors, I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be &quot;frozen,&quot; or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed, the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up, and had the actors give their best guess on where they&apos;re supposed to be.\n\nI think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious, especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous, but at least you never know what&apos;s going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary, and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can&apos;t help but laugh. The only question I find myself asking now is do I give it a &quot;1&quot; because it was so bad, or a &quot;10&quot; because it was so good?",

      "reviewBody": "As a child in Ireland, Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) sees his dad gunned down for his involvement with the Irish Republican Army (IRA). As an adult, McGuire has followed in his dad&apos;s footsteps. When the IRA decides it needs more firepower, they hatch a plan that involves McGuire going to the United States to pick up a shipment of Stinger missiles. Through American IRA contacts, McGuire adopts a false identity and housing is arranged with a non-involved Irish family headed by New York City cop Tom O&apos;Meara (Harrison Ford).\n\nThere is an impression that The Devil&apos;s Own is an action film. The Internet Movie Database has it listed as &quot;Action/Drama/Thriller&quot;. Although there are some action elements in the film, this is really a tragic drama, almost in a classical sense, and it&apos;s best to approach the film with only that genre in mind. The plot is fairly complex and the film tends to move slowly--much more slowly than a typical actioner or thriller.\n\nThe heart of the story is McGuire&apos;s relationship with O&apos;Meara and his family. All of the other material--the IRA stuff, the mob and terrorist stuff, the New York City cop stuff, and so on, are not the focus. Those elements are present to help establish characterization, to build the relationship and understanding between McGuire and O&apos;Meara, and to provide a justification for the developments in the film, and particularly the conclusion, which all have poignant things to say about the decisions that we make and why we make them.\n\nThe film largely succeeds if seen from this dramatic perspective. It&apos;s not quite a 10, however, as it always seems slightly distanced from the viewer. It&apos;s an 8 out of 10 for me.\n\n(This comment was originally posted on January 16, 2005 and ended with the above. The following was added much later after reading through some other user comments:) We should not forget that even though it takes elements from the real world to construct its story, The Devil&apos;s Own is NOT intended to be journalistic or a documentary. There is no claim that it is giving an accurate portrayal of political situations, and it&apos;s not intended to campaign for one side or another in a real-world political situation. This is fiction, folks, and should be judged _as fiction_. For that, you should forget about what you know of the real world, and assess the story, images and sounds you experience from your television. Does the story work as a self-contained entity? Are the performances good? Is it visually attractive/rewarding? Those are the kinds of things we should be judging. \n\nFor me, The Devil&apos;s Own succeeded as a drama about relationships, with its poignancy arrived at primarily by making two people from very different worlds, with very different outlooks, learn to see things from different perspectives. \n\nThat&apos;s great if you&apos;re very knowledgeable about Northern Ireland in the real world and if you have strong opinions about terrorism. However, your knowledge and opinions on that stuff have nothing to do with this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Of all the recent buddy-cop movies, released lately this is one of the better ones.\n\nBiggest strength of this movie is in the two main characters played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. They are such a great screen duo together and have some great team chemistry on the screen. The movie is filled with many other great comical talented actors such as; Vince Vaughn as the main villain, Snoop Dogg and Will Ferrell and some smaller roles for famous names such as; Chris Penn, Carmen Electra, Amy Smart and Juliette Lewis.\n\nBut the movie is more then just an ordinary buddy-movie, it also is a priceless parody of &apos;70&apos;s TV-shows in general. It uses some of the same camera-positions and style of editing at times, especially in the action sequences. But also the way of acting, dialog and costumes perfectly spoof all those silly &apos;70 TV-series. I&apos;m not sure if everybody catch or understood this but I really laughed out loud at some moments.\n\nThe comedy can be put in the category silly, so this movie is clearly not suitable for everyone. The humor is really over-the-top but I for one really enjoyed that. The characters are really silly but the professional comedy actors portray them extremely well and likable.\n\nA perfectly fun comedy to kill some time with.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

An unlikely group tries to fight for survival in a military base.\n\nDespite the recent influx of zombie and virus films from various countries, including France with the entertaining &apos;Le Horde,&apos; here&apos;s another French take. &apos;Mutants,&apos; refreshingly, stands in contrast to its counterparts as it takes a serious tone with the subject matter, expertly filmed by director David Morlet.\n\nThe film boasts impressive sets, cinematography, and art direction. It features cold, eerie lighting, desolate bunkers, and well-executed gore effects, all against the backdrop of a snowy wintertime setting.\n\nMany scenes are filled with tension, enhanced by a pervasive sense of claustrophobia for added horror. While the sound design for the infected may be considered excessive, the acting is top-notch, with Helene de Frougerolles (bearing a resemblance to Asia Argento) carrying the film. In Louis-Paul Desanges and David Morlet&apos;s screenplay, everything is portrayed realistically, lending a gritty edge to the narrative.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, an excessive use of shaky camera work, a characteristic often associated with zombie and virus films. Calls for help on the radio, fortified bunkers, machetes, guns, human betrayal, love, and loss-all the clichés are present but handled with realism. Combined with the naturalistic acting and a chillingly crafted score, &apos;Mutants&apos; manages to stand out in the oversaturated genre.\n\nAside from the &apos;28 Days Later&apos; rage-like infected, the film features a well-balanced, simmering survival element infused with emotion, creating a captivating atmosphere and continuous action. Although devoid of humor, it remains bloody and dramatically entertaining."

I admit I had to watch other movies of his before I was ready to crown him the title of &quot;good actor&quot; but I&apos;m ready to say Mel Gibson isn&apos;t just a good actor but a damn good one. He&apos;s intense almost to the point of crazy. His eyes get this look and you know something&apos;s about to go down. But he also has other emotions that are intense too. He takes all of them to the max. A very watchable actor and maybe one of the most watchable actors of all time which brings me to Braveheart because I just watched both. I&apos;ll put my Braveheart review on that one.",

There are a lot of things, at first, to bring a smile to your face, from the movie-in-movie spoof to the lovable stalker turns girlfriend side plot.

The Lead actor is at best wooden, with one ex-girlfriend serving as his emotional anchor. No spoilers - his new squeeze, a waitress at a fancy coffee shop/bar seems to insinuate herself into his life because of self pity? Gimme a beak... \n\nSince Bae Doon-na made Hollywood, everybody wants to capture her charm and natural naivete to sell badly written movies. Disney, back off and let Korean cinema do what it does better than Hollywood - sell movies with real heart and soul. While this movie started strong, it eventually sold out and became the poster child for what NOT to do. I&apos;ll give the director another shot, but ultimately this is a 6...",

First, we feel an alchemy between the two main protagonists, Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher, even if these two people seem diametrically opposed, at first glance. This is not a love at first sight, but we see them taming to each other, as the fox and the little prince written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1943. Then, I like this constant self-mockery about the cheesy band called Pop, the introduction and last scenes, and the manifold hilarious references of the Battle of the 80&apos;s Has-Beens. Finally, the dialogues are excellent with a permanent British humour. Oops... I&apos;ve almost forgotten: the cast is globally excellent, especially Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore."

Matthew Modine didn&apos;t go overboard, which makes him very believable in this role. You&apos;ll feel sorry for him, maybe have a little tear at the corner of your eye, but you won&apos;t be dissapointed. A story about all humans and the way we perceive each other."

The cinema was packed full of people, and some of the older members of the audience were laughing out loud almost immediately at Yves Montand&apos;s antics. I was a bit more restrained. But it didn&apos;t take long for me to find myself laughing as well. And not only me; it seemed like everyone there was in good spirits, young and old alike. Yves Montand&apos;s acting was incredible, Romy Schneider is terribly desirable, and the film just floated along. Definitely worth seeing, both if you&apos;re a Claude Sautet fan or if you want a charming movie about the interesting relationship which develops between the movie&apos;s three protagonists.",

This one has an evil Baron living on a island who has just devised a zombotron that will turn people into green zombie slaves. The Baron kidnaps a serial killers wife setting the husband on a heroic journey to get her back.\n\nThis one was pretty good. Not much of a budget but it keeps you laughing. You got everything in this film from robots to giant houseflies and even rockabilly legend Hasil Adkins playing himself. Porn legend Jamie Gillis pops up in it a couple of times. There is regular nudity and zombie nudity. Overall a good time to be had and you won&apos;t get brain strain trying to figure anything out.",

      "reviewBody": "Good, above average sci-fi / horror / thriller makes the most out of a fairly unique premise. Ever likable Cliff De Young plays divorced father Bill, whose son David (Joey Lawrence of future &apos;Blossom&apos; fame) comes to stay with Bill and his new wife Ellen (Roxanne Hart) for a while. Unfortunately, this happens while a pulse of electricity - which seems to have become some sort of sentient being - is out to terrorize and destroy home owners in the neighborhood.\n\n&quot;Pulse&quot; offers a fresh change of pace from the slasher films that often took predominance in the 1980s. It&apos;s written and directed by a man named Paul Golding, who does a pretty good job. Some viewers can take issue with the concept, or the fact that it&apos;s never sufficiently &quot;explained&quot;, while others will appreciate the ambiguity of the plot. Assisted by a top notch crew, Golding is successful at combining a number of genuine jolts with some traditional suspense. There is some gore but not enough for more squeamish viewers to truly get upset about. Spooky music by Jay Ferguson and excellent special effects by Richard O. Helmer are heavy assets.\n\nThe cast is believable and engaging. De Young is good, but his character is going to frustrate viewers for being one of those standard Stubborn Dummy characters common to film; it takes him a long time to wise up. The lovely Hart, and young Lawrence, are similarly appealing. Solid support is provided by Lawrences&apos; kid brother Matthew (as a neighborhood child) and top character actor Charles Tyner (as a creepy old man who seems to know the score). Other familiar faces in smaller roles are Robert Romanus of &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; fame (as a TV repairman), and Myron Healey (&quot;The Incredible Melting Man&quot;) as a helpful old neighbor. Look for Tim Russ (&apos;Star Trek: Voyager&apos;) in a bit as a cop.\n\nOverall, a solid shocker, that appears to offer a comment that we take our modern conveniences for granted, and that they can strike back and kick us in the ass.\n\nEight out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is like very little else out there. It&apos;s a zombie comedy that isn&apos;t a full-on splatterfest like most, doesn&apos;t offer some overly humorous social satire (there&apos;s subtle jabs at Agent Orange and Nazis), and doesn&apos;t have a high-concept premise (for a zombie movies that is). What you have is dry as hell, with punk rockers (timely for the time - Repo Man meets zombies?), Nazi morticians smoking pipes and listening to their Walkman while embalming, and Quigley nudity for its own sake, but characters are in on it and equally celebrate and scold her. It has iconic scenes and quotes though I&apos;m sure a lot of people have no idea they&apos;re actually from this.\n\nIt just works - it&apos;s funny, weird, creepy, gory, and always entertaining. A hard mix to pull off and one that happens with success very rarely. It&apos;s always said that there&apos;s a fine line between horror and comedy - the pros can straddle it like a daring high-wire act and this is one of them. If only the ending weren&apos;t so abruptly anti- climactic and there were a few more naked zombie Quigley kill scenes it&apos;d be a perfect cult classic.\n\nGotta love the very serious Suicide while naked Quigley grinds on him: &quot;No one understands me, you know that.&quot; &quot;You think this is a f***in&apos; costume? This is a way of life.&quot; &quot;Hey, what&apos;s wrong with you, man? Show some f***ing respect for the dead, will ya?&quot; All this because he was called a &quot;spooky motherf***er.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I went to see this film a bit skeptical, because Woody&apos;s last movies were not his best ones. In the last ten years, he has made funny, entertaining films; some quite interesting, as &quot;Decontructing Harry&quot; or &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, but generally unimportant. But wit &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; he has made one of his most brilliant films. As in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, he mixes two different stories -a dramatic one, and a light comedy-. The result ins quite different; this movie is not as critic as that, but is really enjoyable. He mixes a drama -serious, deep, with well-built characters, and really credible- and a delicious comedy -with really funny quotes, and moments that recover his best of the 80&apos;s-, with a lot of talent, because the two stories complete each other, the movie doesn&apos;t creak.\n\nRadha Mitchell is wonderful as the two Melindas: suggestive and content in the drama; innocent, tender and funny int he comedy. And Will Farrell, who takes the &apos;Woody Allen role&apos;, is the best choice he has done for that purpose ever- because instead of imitating Allen, he creates a new character, human, pleasant and funny. The script is great; with parallelism and second interpretations- And the movie is really entertaining. I hope it will get the attention it deserves; and I expect Woody Allen to keep this new walk in his career. (9/10).",

When I got home and watched it (using a region-free DVD player), I was very glad I&apos;d taken a chance on it.\n\nIf &quot;Human Traffic&quot;, &quot;Groove&quot;, &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; are among your favourites, give &quot;be.angeled&quot; a spin. There&apos;s glorious scenes of the Love Parade with anthems like &quot;For An Angel&quot; and &quot;der klang der familie&quot;, humour, drama, fantasy, and enough other stuff that it&apos;s a little hard to pigeonhole this movie.\n\nA lot of the dialogue is in English, and the DVD has English subtitles (although some of them appear at the wrong time). It&apos;s unfortunate that this movie doesn&apos;t seem to have been promoted outside Germany.",

      "reviewBody": "In its side-splitting takedown of racism and all-purpose ignorance, 1974&apos;s &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; is one of the boldest and most important satires ever made. As raunchy and as ludicrous as it is whip-smart, it can claim parentage of modern-day parodies from &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut (1999)&quot; to &quot;Sausage Party (2016)&quot; to music industry spoof &quot;Stadium Anthems (2018)&quot; in their uses of obscenity, intelligence, and song to expose inane social truths.\n\nIt&apos;s the Wild West. Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is a white business opportunist with moronic and hyper-sexed governor William J. LePetomane (Mel Brooks) in his back pocket. Lamarr wants to build a railroad through the outpost town of Rock Ridge. When he can&apos;t scare off the town folk, he incites chaos by saddling them with a black sheriff (Bart, played by the now-iconic Cleavon Little), who just days before was a railroad laborer sentenced to hanging. It turns out that the sly Bart is a rare sage in a frontier littered with dumb white people; he pairs with booze-soaked gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder) to rally the town against Lamarr&apos;s thugs.\n\nWearing no seatbelt, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; rebukes the absurdity of racism with its own absurdist countermeasures. While its blueprint would never make it past present-day studio tastemakers, its defrocking of ignorance has never been better primed for mass consumption. This is a watershed comedy that presides atop any short list of film&apos;s greatest satires. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking &quot;Helpful.&quot; Cheers!)",

Even allowing for the technical limitations of the period, the dramatic effect of the staged original never materialises, the essential drama and passion of the story, simple as it is, being lost in the deficiencies of this film, particularly in respect of staging,costume and sound.A very good, if not great, tenor, Richard Tauber seems unsure and out of his depth in his interpretation of the principal character. Tauber had, of course, enjoyed the benefit of his professional liaison with Lehar, and the  consumate artistry so evident in his performance of Lehar&apos;s songs, together with his affinity with things Schubertian only serve to suggest that in &apos;Pagliacci&apos; he was, in terms of interpretation, at the limit of his capabilities. Nevertheless, the film is an interesting piece of cinematic history and is, even given its limitations, quite enjoyable.As a matter of interest, although Caruso certainly helped to &apos;launch &apos;the phonograph in the early years of the 20th century, and recorded copiously, it is posterity&apos;s loss that, as far as is known, he never appeared in a sound film using electrical recording."

Regarding racism and stuff... what can I say, just look around, world is an hourglass, waiting for eachothers time. Whatever your side you are. With all that, both of these great two empires have something in common... uneducation, corruption, no respect for your equal. Road to violence. No taking side, but just look around.
