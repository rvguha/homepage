It became one of the best (and worst) beer tour I ever had.  The best is because since we're a small group, we get to check out breweries where most tour groups can't go (due to size). The worst (for me) is they are a LOT of samples which I roughly estimate to be about 25-30 drinks ( I can't remember). By the third stop, I was really buzzed and about to pass out in the middle of the day. Luckily, my friend was there to prop me up.  I highly recommend the early spots so you can actually see what you're drinking."

Instead, the intent of the tour is to introduce you to the myriad of styles of beers brewed by the many breweries in Seattle. I actually preferred this because too often the 'behind the scenes' tour is just a sanitized tourist version of what actually happens on the brewery floor. Instead I was treated to really good beer and really good discussion about what makes each beer different. This style of tour lends itself to novice and experienced beer drinkers alike because there is enough variety to satisfy everyone's expectations while still offering something different for those that want that experience. \n\nI wish I could remember my tour guide's name because he was excellent (Thursday, 14 June 1430 tour). I will most definitely take this tour again."

Extra drink tickets. Immediately after departure we were told that only the spinach dip was available and that we would be refunded for the other three apps. Refund TBD. (In reading other reviews, it appears this is common practice with this line with no refund being issued). Trying to get cocktail and soda refills was like pulling teeth! Two drinks all night. The salad was fine, the salmon was about the size of a cookie and tasted off. We didn’t finish it. The pork chop was floating in some kind of weird, watery gravy, and was beyond well done. We didn’t finish it. The dessert was some sort of gross canned peaches concoction, but because the whipped cream was warm to the touch and smelled sour we didn’t try it. One of the worst issues was how @&$!? hot it was in the cabin! Sweltering! All the windows were fogged up and ladies were using anything they could find to fan themselves. Bathrooms were dirty. Poorly understaffed with no service experience. The cruise itself was mediocre as far as sights and narration. And yes, I know that the point of the cruise isn’t the food. But for $400.00 plus tip, go have an epic dinner somewhere on the waterfront! Would NOT recommend."

        "reviewBody": "We booked the August 27, 2023 Sunday Dinner Buffet/Tour as a private event for  39 people for our August celebrants. We had the upper deck for our group. As  the coordinator for this event, I could say I'm dissatisfied about the following:\n1.  The temperature was uncomfortably \n      hot. The airconditioning system was \n      not sufficient to provide cool air on a\n      hot Summer day. It was so hot inside!\n      With this situation, the crew could\n      have been proactive to offer cold \n      water with ice!  In fact, the only drink \n      that was free was water and it felt \n      warm because of the heat. Because \n      of the heat most  of our guests \n      stayed outside where it's cooler. So \n      whatever program prepared was \n      derailed. Very disappointing!\n2.   The seating arrangement agreed \n       upon in advanced was not followed\n       causing it to be overcrowded. \n       Seating layout for 39 people was \n       supplied by our group but the \n       tables and chairs were set up for \n       50. This was so inconsistent with how \n       the representative Cameron strictly \n       emphasized that a maximum of only \n       40 people will be allowed in the \n       upper deck. Clearly, this seems to \n       demonstrate the lack of \n       coordination and communication \n       within their company. \n 3.  The crew were generally nice but \n       seemed inexperienced in customer \n       service. For example, none of the \n       crew offered more water at any \n       table; guests were thirsty.\n 4.   The tour route of the ship brought \n        us to unattractive industrial areas \n        showing old ugly ships and\n        warehouses.  \n        As the one coordinating for our \n       event, I recommended Waterways \n       because of a very positive \n       experience several years ago. The \n       tour passed the beautiful sceneries,\n       like UW stadium and even Bill Gates\n       waterfront house. This tour did not. \n\nFor the price that we paid per person plus reservation fee, we expected better service,accommodation and tour. \nThe food was great. Many loved the steak and Macaroni and Cheese. \n\nOverall, our group enjoyed the celebration as it was also their first time experience with dinner cruise buffet. Everyone was happy to meet coming from different States and foreign countries. \nHowever, I would not recommend this tour again. \n       \n\n       \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n       "

Luckily, a couple offered to exchange tables with us. (Thank you again, if you're out there).\nOrdered a Dungeness crab cake appetizer, and discovered that it was not available, even though I had been charged (No refund as of yet). \nThe bathrooms are in need of repair. \nThey ran out of desserts, so some attendees did not receive any. \n\nThe cruise itself was lovely, and I'm not typically nit-picky, but for the price, I was expecting more. I wouldn't go again."

I know fuel is high right now but there was no notice about it and if we were going to float it would have been better in Lake Washington with a much better view than the navy ship area.  There was absolutely NO response to multiple calls and emails trying to change our reservation from 6 to 4 as 2 of our party came down with COVID and could not attend.  we left 3 voicemails and 3 emails and NEVER heard back from anyone.   We were extremely disappointed, especially because we had gone on the brunch cruise in 2020 during covid and had a nice experience.  At this point we won't book another cruise with Waterways!"

Thus, it was not crowded on the cruise, which was nice.  Due to wind and slight rain on Dec. 23rd, it seemed as though we didn't cruise the whole scheduled route, but that's okay.  Just being with my husband on a dinner cruise was fabulous!"

Today, four days before our departure, we were informed by email that the ferry voyage has been canceled. Now I am scrambling to figure out how to get from Seattle to Victoria. Flights on airlines are running *three* times as much as our ferry tickets. This is a very expensive nightmare."

We took a roundtrip from Seattle to Victoria to spend a few days on Vancouver island.  We were in economy, so didn't necessarily have the best views, but were able to go outside on the top deck to watch the Puget Sound sail by.  My kids loved it too.  We booked the area of economy with the tables, and the legroom was a little tight, but we got to sit together as a family, play cards, and eat."

        "reviewBody": "I live in Seattle and wanted a car-free trip to Victoria. From home, I took a bus and walked to Pier 69 where the FRS Clipper ships depart. Very early start to the day. It's an 8am departure but they ask people to arrive at 7AM. I wasn't quite that early, maybe 7:15AM. The check-in experience was easy. It felt like airline travel - assigned seats, different classes of seats, option to check bags, long wait between requested arrival time and departure time.\n\n* On the boat, there are self-serve luggage racks in the center. Easy and free. I chose the econpan class seat so that I could have a window seat. Watching the scenery was entertaining and I had lots of space as solo traveler because no one was in the aisle seat.\n\n* Nice benefit of paying for Clipper is leaving from downtown Seattle, cushy seats, and they manage the customs process. We were given paper forms and pencils so we could fill everything out before the boat docked. Because we went through customs as a group, it was quick with only the boat travelers in the lines."

        "reviewBody": "The boarding process was CHAOS in Seattle.  This company doesn't exhibit efficient efforts in handling large numbers of passengers.  We arrived 1.5 hours before our boarding time, had our coveted VERIFICATION card in hand then waited waited and waited without any further direction or instruction.  Well there might have been some but everytime FRS made a PA announcement there was a freight train rolling across the street so you can't understand whatever it was they were saying.  There are no signs to inform you what steps you need to take, such as having your passports verified and your boarding passes scanned.  Numerous people were arriving, milling around and did not know about this check-in process until several of us told them.  There is no que lines. signs or evidence of organization.  Finally a staff person came out and wandered around checking documents and handing out verification cards, tho at no time was she identified as an FRS employee, shirt, hat or even a name tag.  This was a sold-out boat so maybe they aren't used to such crowds, but still no que lines or directions, unless it was the useless PA system competing with the railroad.  Hey FRS send out an employee when a train is coming by and test your system to see if they can hear all the way to the end of the steps.  Finally, we board and the boat staff are competent and organized with a nice flat-water ride to Victoria.  When you arrive in Victoria you are split into two groups, one with luggage and one with walk off luggage only.  Both groups still wait onboard for at least 20 minutes while they crane over the luggage carts, probably for safety, but you must wait in your seat, no standing up until you are told you can stand up.  A crew member came out and started to vacuum the carpets around the empty seats while those of us with luggage in Group 2 waited for our turn to get off the ship.  Standing up to stretch, since I had been seated for most of the 3.5 hrs of the trip, I was promptly told I had to stay in my seat.  We were finally allowed to disembark and lo and behold, what do they have in Victoria, but que lines like at the airport.  Gosh they are so much smarter in Canada, I guess.  If your boat is full plan on it being another hour of line waiting from docking to clearing Customs.   By way of comparison, the MV Coho from Port Angeles came in after the FRS docked, unloaded passengers, vehicles, loaded vehicles and passengers for its return trip and left before I was done clearing Customs.  The unloading back in Seattle also has the wait in your seat until your group number is called BUT they queue you up on the outside deck to clear Customs so it is better than the loading CHAOS.  If you are going on the Clipper just know you will add at least 2 hours or more to your trip time and plan accordingly.  Travelled July 7 to the 11th 2024."

The seats were fine, we purchased a cheese and fruit plate (which they were out of on the way back). You can bring your own food and drinks (non-alcoholic) on board to consume as well. Got there on time. Everything went great on the way back as well. Kind of wish they had a return back to Seattle in the morning, but everything was great!"
