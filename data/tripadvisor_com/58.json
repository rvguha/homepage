    "description": "Enjoy a unique evening of cabaret, comedy and a full-course dinner at the famous Teatro ZinZanni situated in the heart of wine country in  Woodinville, WA. Set in a turn-of-the-century tent, Teatro ZinZanni is a big night out unlike any other and is much more than just dinner, it's a 3-hour whirlwind of cirque, comedy and cabaret all served up with a delicious 4-course meal. Described as \"the Kit Kat club on acid,\" and \"the place where the Moulin Rouge meets Cirque du Soleil,\" Teatro ZinZanni is an experience not to be missed while visiting Seattle.",

If you arrive before the show, their boutique offers items you can wear for the show, but they aren't necessary. The ostrich boas were $38 - yikes. Some audience members did dress like they were attending a cabaret but for the most part, everyone wore nicer clothing. If you can find boas, hats, etc before the show, cheaper to wear them there than buy anything. Everything seems pricey. Also, not a venue for shorts. The A/C was a bit cool at times, but I had a light sweater and was fine. Before the show, we bought 2 glasses of Paco & Lola Albarino wine at $14 each. Plus tax and tip (not sure why this was necessary; she stood right there and poured the wine.) The total was $35.42.   Tip for the waiter $60, plus drinks so bring extra cash. I would return as the show changes every 6 weeks."

The gymnasts and acrobats were fantastic too.  We really like the intimacy of this show with dinner served all throughout.  The food was very good - I had the yellow fin tuna and my wife had the steak.  The spiegeltent just feels more comfortable than something so big as Cirque du Soleil."

Rainier, and the Puget Sound. Seattle’s “must see” is now a “must do” following the Space Needle’s multi-million dollar renovation. Glide onto The Loupe, the world’s first and only rotating glass floor, for never-before-seen views of the structure and the city.  Lean into our Skyrisers, the tilting glass walls on the open-air deck, and float over Seattle on one of the 24 angled vantage points. Sip and sample the Pacific Northwest’s best while savoring the thrilling views.",

        "reviewBody": "I didn't have this on my list of \"must do\"s while in Seattle. Ticket price depends on day and time, but it's roughly $45 to ride an elevator. \n\nThat said, it really is spectacular. The elevator opens on the main observation deck, and yes, the views are absolutely magnificent, but I was also impressed with the facility itself. It's very clean and modern and makes the whole experience majestic. Outside, there's a little bit of an overhang overhead, but most of the deck is open to the sky. The incredibly thick windows slant outward and must be a nightmare to keep clean, but somehow the staff manage it. Most people crowd to the south side of the tower, facing the heart of the city and the skyscrapers, but the whole view is incredible. \n\nDownstairs is a 21+ lounge and glass floor that rotates. However, you don't need to visit the lounge to stand on the glass floor and watch the city go by around you. \n\nFYI, there is a small bar upstairs and the lounge downstairs, but they are on different liquor licenses, so they don't allow you to buy a drink and take it downstairs. \n\nThe staff is great, everyone was so nice and friendly. And while the price seemed steep, there is no time limit except for closing time, so enjoy the view, the drinks, and the pies as long as you want (and as long as your wallet holds out). \n\nI didn't feel the need to do this, but I'm glad my friend wanted to and talked me into it. Do yourself a huge favor and go at sunset. Even with grey skys, it's pretty incredible."

We even emailed to find out the weight limit weeks ahead, and couldn’t get a straight answer.  It cost us $100 for Uber rides there and back.

I do have a troll, a Space Needle, waterfall, giant Amazon spheres and Pixar UP House just like the movie floating houses (Sleepless in Seattle) We will even show you where Boeing 1st airplane took flight. If you have never seen Jurasick Park Pterodactyls come March - July to see them, I ain’t lying. This tour is both structured & spontaneous, guaranteed to learn and laugh. \nYes, you will see the famous sights, and unique neighborhoods as well.\nThank you Viator for awarding Seattle's Best Tours as a TOP 20 Experience in the USA in 2022 - 2023\n\n",

Unfortunately, the behavior of the guys running the elevators overshadowed the experience in a bad way.  Two different elevator operators crammed people into the elevator for a very uncomfortable and dangerous ride.  He kept saying that there was plenty of room for more people just by looking at the floor and seeing all the space around our feet.  I guess he doesn't realize that people's feet take up a lot less physical space than the rest of our bodies do.  We actually had to all scream \"NO!\" when he was trying to cram 4 more people in the elevator.  He finally got the hint at that point, and even told us that he could've easily added 9 more people!  During one elevator ride, there were small children in the elevator that were crammed in with an extreme and overwhelming amount of adults to where the children were screaming and crying.  It was terrifying for them!  I understand you wanting to not have long lines waiting for the elevators, but the way these 2 elevator operators filled the elevators with people was absolutely ridiculous and they should be reprimanded!  I heard one elevator operator getting rewarded for emptying his waiting line quickly.  This is absolutely uncalled for and should not be tolerated going forward.  Management really needs to do something about it.\n"

The glass floor simply wasn't all that amazing. Yeah, it's nice you can look down at the ground, but the views looking out of the windows is better. If you are going just to see the glass floor, don't bother. One thing I really liked about the visit this time was that there was hardly anyone there. Due to covid, they are restricting the number of guests and it really makes a difference. Every other time I have visited the Space Needle it was so crowded that it didn't make for a very pleasant visit. It was also the first time I was there when it wasn't cloudy, which meant that the views were much nicer. Needless to say, the Space Needle is the must see attraction in Seattle, but if you're a local, it's not worth it to go up just to see the glass floor. They were very careful about taking precautions for covid. You had to go through an ultraviolet disinfector before getting into the elevator, no talking was allowed in the elevator at all and mask wearing was very strictly enforced at all times."

It was worth it.  The newish glass floor is an amazing addition.  The day was clear and you could see all around.\n\nNow I do feel the $30 admission is fairly steep and I wouldn't g o up again, but it is worth doing it once."

It was fun to sit back on the glass benches and lean back on the glass walls for photos. \n\nOne thing that was pretty high-tech and cool was the free photos--like many places they take your photo on a green screen when you arrive. What's different than anywhere else I've ever been is that they give you the link to the website where you can put your code number in and choose your backgrounds and download them for free--you don't have to pay a thing! It wasn't one of those traps where they take a photo and you pay $30 for it."

That's not where the view is.  Where the unobstructed view used to be, on the observation deck, there are now surrounding thick glass plates which reflect light, ruin photographs and are constantly smudged.  I lived in Seattle, went up the Needle three or four times a year, celebrated many occasions with a great meal in the restaurant and lingered over the great view from the top.  In this new and heartbreaking incarnation, it is nothing but a tourist trap.  I'm done."

When entering the Needle you get to see its history on a fun timeline and also have your group's pic taken.\n\nA downside goes to the price (could be a bit lower) and how packed it gets.\n\nI personally recommend going on a clear skies day as early as it opens.

It's remnants of a Worlds Fair and what our future was supposed to look like.  I was hiding my silly excitement, I finally got to ride to the top after waiting  my whole life! My excuse was taking my children to see the view, but it was finally checked of my bucket list.\n\nThe lines on popular weekends can be long,  although not hugely expensive but it adds up in the time+$=value for the entire family.  It isn't a whole day activity, so add other things to do. I have no idea about the restuarant, but why not, I mean IT SPINS! People were kind about moving for photos or letting people in to look, there was a genuine happy vibe.  The weather can be an issue and can change by the time you are actually up on top, so plan accordingly.  But when it's clear you can see three mountain  ranges, beautiful.  Take binoculars and a jacket.\n\nGo and don't forget to buy a Space Needle magnet; you just have to, it's part of the great cliche."

Make your way to the top of the tower for an amazing vantage point from the Observatory, including an open-air deck with 360-degree views of Seattle and beyond. Then take a moment to indulge in Prohibition-era inspired craft cocktails and shareable plates with a group of friends or your loved ones. And don't forget to make a wish in the Wishing Chair. It's the perfect selfie to post of your visit to Smith Tower. \n\nPlease note that tickets are valid daily between the hours of 10:00am-1:00pm. During our peak-season months of May - September, wait times may apply and can range from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. \n\nTickets to not guarantee immediate access. Black out dates may apply. ",

The portions are similarly quite small, though the quality of the food is high. On top of that you will pay entrance fee that is comparable to the cost of food or a drink.  \n\nFor Seattle guests this is a wonderful experience and pricing should be acceptable. The view and atmosphere is so much better than Columbia Tower or the Space Needle.\n\nFor repeat visitors it is something I do not recommend, even with membership.

    "description": "The Skagit brings the wonder of nature and a wild flowing river to the fingertips of our guests. This river is extraordinarily special and has a mystical feeling to it due to the rich archaeology and historical past.  This 9 mile trip through one of North Americas most gorgeous rivers awaits you! The Skagit is a mild river in comparison, but it's also very powerful; it's a great way to introduce someone to the sport, or to get started for the summer with some great whitewater that can be enjoyed by the entire family. If you or someone you love wants to get into rafting, this is the place to start.",

Triad did great at communicating, offering flexible options and being proactive in a tough situation.  I really appreciated that!  All the guides for the tour were trained well and professional.  They knew their area ecology and rafting.  Thank you!"

Our group included four 40-60 year olds, a 23 year old and an 8 year old, and this river was a great fit for us. Our guide Alastair was superb--relating well to everyone on board, getting us paddling well together, safety-minded while maintaining a playful and fun tone and giving us insights on history and naturalist aspects of the river. It was a great experience."

Were from Texas, stayed in Seattle and drove 2 hours to get to the Triad tours and it was SOOOO WORTH the money and drive! We will def do it the next time we visit Seattle. We loved Alastair!! He made our rafting fun and exciting! Sean also took the best photos!!!"

Floating the Skagit was a super fun time.\n\nWe had originally booked a trip on the Sauk river, the ‘Intermediate’ next step up compared to the ‘Introductory’ Skagit. However, the water level of the Sauk got too low to raft safely, so we had to rebook. Luke made rebooking super easy.\n\nThe Skagit is definitely a beginner level river. Probably best for families with kids, elder folks, or people nervous about their  first whitewater raft trip. Our group of active, mid-20 year olds could have easily handled quite a bit more. There were a few rapids, we got splashed a few times, but overall I do wish the float had been more thrilling. Most of the time was a relaxing float down the river. But, oh well, I look forward to floating the Sauk next year earlier in the season, and we still had a great time.\n\nAlastair, and all the guides at Triad, were the reason we still had a great time. Alastair was fun, funny, knowledgeable, and safe. Our group chatted and laughed the whole trip and Alastair led us through the rapids perfectly. 10/10 guide. Get in his boat if you can :)"

Get the full experience of a Kraken game live at Climate Pledge Arena, by wearing the team's colours and grabbing your favourite drink (and maybe some hot wings) at a nearby sports bar while locals crowd around the big screens for some pre-game punditry, before making your way to the ice in time for the electrifying team entrances, national anthems and of course, the puck drop in the world's most-watched ice hockey competition.",

Parking was a brisk 10 minute walk away.  Many fans are walking with you, so feel safe enough walking from parking garage during night game. The seats can be tight for legs, but view is excellent as steeply rising grandstands.  And Kraken were exciting end of last season!"

    "description": "Is chocolate a food or a technology? Why does it hold such a special place in cultures around the world? Most importantly: How do YOU like your chocolate?\n\nIncluded in your ticket price are 12 individual tastings. We will visit 8 of Downtown Seattle's most beloved bakeries, restaurants, cafés, and chocolatiers. \n\nThe tour starts at Dahlia Bakery where you delight in the days fresh bake. We continue through cafés where you experience the \"World Tour of drinking chocolates,\" along with small treats and samples of chocolate.\n\nWe spend a portion of the tour in an Italian grocer where you sample a selection of some of the best chocolate bars in the world (and from right here in Seattle). \n\nThe tour ends at a chocolatier's shop known for its elite quality and unique incorporation of flavors, including fruit, honey and booze.\n\nYou'll leave this tour filled to the brim with chocolatey goodness, but also with a deeper understanding of what chocolate is, what it means, and where it's taking us.",

I was a little worried that the trip would not be as fun since they town no longer offers the lighting ceremony and the sleigh rides was not offered but boy was I wrong!   Customized Tours provided great service getting us to/from Leavenworth.  They had light snacks for us to enjoy during the ride. When we arrived we got to go to their new partnered attraction at the Reindeer Farm; feed the reindeers, take pictures with the special guests appearance that took place that day (Frozen characters).  We then ventured into the town of Leavenworth where there was TONS of snow.  We sled (provided by Customized Tours), walked around the town, shopped and enjoyed tasty food at Andrea Kellers.   My children had so much fun and slept all the way back.   I would highly recommend this excursion not only for their great service but because it took all the stress off of my family having to drive in the snow, find parking and pay for parking etc."

I found the captain, although strict to her duties, rude. Unpolite and short-tempered, if I had to sum it up. I was hoping for a bit more professionalism when people pay this much for a cruise. Perhaps she was just having a bad day? This did, unfortunately, ruin our experience and I had to salvage our anniversary later via a tour of the Space Needle. I would not recommend Salty Fox for yacht rental if you plan on capturing timeless memories."

    "description": "You surely don’t have to have dietary restrictions to enjoy this tour. We delight in accommodating everyone. \n\nOn this tour you will visit 10 restaurants and shops within the Market historical district and delight in custom tastings from these locations. We choose restaurants to showcase the best-of-the-best in Seattle and to highlight hidden gems you might not find on your own.\n\nAlong the way you will learn about the iconic Pike Place Market. We will introduce you to some of the people that give the Market its authentic feel, along with those rethinking our relationship with food for a brighter, healthier future.\n\nYou will learn about the city of Seattle and its home in the Pacific Northwest. We will discuss Washington State as an understated agricultural juggernaut and how that feeds into Seattle’s reputation as a world capital for artisanal food and drink. \n\nOur philosophy is that each person’s diet should not close doors, but open them. This tour is for you. Come and join us!",

Every spot was amazing, and the relationships the shop workers had with the tour company was lovely to see. We were provided with interesting information about the market and each stop along the way in a pleasant, easily digestible way, not overwhelming at all! The food was marvelous, and it was in perfectly sized portions.\n\nI can’t recommend the company or the vegan food tour enough!"

You definitely get nibbles of so many great plant-based goods sweet and savory, but it's not so much that you feel like you over-ate. If you're in Seattle for a while, I highly recommend doing this early in your trip. That way, you have TONS of great foods to go back to Pike Place for again later in your trip!"
