So far, it?s one of my favorite pieces of clothing. It?s a bit pricy for a simple t-shirt but you only need one. It?s easy to wash and dry but with the anti-bacterial treatment it never smells so you won?t need to do much more than rinse it every once in a while.",

Unlike other Canada Goose coats I have tried on that are literally unwearable because of their weight, this one does not weigh a ton yet is super warm for those of us who are always cold.  It has snaps! for those times you don&apos;t want to zip it up fully.  Down lining extends all the way through the length of this coat. It has wrist cuffs to block cold. It runs large in the hips but who cares?! shoulders are perfect. The hood is also lined with down and fits perfectly. The logo is the only negative thing about this coat, and as it is sewn on it is easy to remove. If you are always cold, you need this coat!",

A base-layer by itself or mid-weight layer over lighter base layer options make it my go to for many seasonal pursuits. Breathable and super comfy. The hood is the perfect liner under a ski helmet on cold outings when the Coefficient is worn under a shell or puffy. By itself, it&apos;s a great active layer with the hood for shade or a little warmth on a chilly morning while making coffee at the campsite. Highly recommend!

I have not used it for this purpose yet but have found myself using it every morning on my mountain bike rides and it’s amazing! It keeps me warm and is really breathable at the same time. I’ve never had a garment to both things so well at the same time! My only gripe is that the material snags pretty easily so you need to be careful, I already put a small hole in mine.",

Really good as a next-to-skin base layer, or a medium layer. Fit is a little strange though: I am a M about 75-85% of the time, but this M was very tight in the mid-section (arms and waist length were perfect). Ordered the L and its much better, but the armpit area is a little loose. Might need to adjust the cut in future years. (5. 9, 160ibs). Overall, I recommend this top.",

The grid design makes it the perfect insulating layer, but its thin breathable design makes it perfect for a day of skinning. Simultaneously the front torso works as a windbreaker keeping your core toasty, while the breathable back prevents overheating when carrying a pack. The fit is loose enough to allow a base layer beneath, but tight enough to work as it&apos;s own base layer, and the hood is well designed to fit comfortably beneath a helmet. When you get to the top, just throw over a shell and your are ready to go. This hoodie is a must have for any A/T skier.",

I would highly recommend getting the above two jackets instead of this one. Your bank account will complain in the short term but you will benefit from the versatility of the aforementioned jackets instead of this one mediocre and overpriced jacket. Returning it.

Later, I tried size L, but it was so large that I couldn&apos;t even reach the pockets—they were located below my thighs! Compared to another jacket from the same brand, the L size of this one is significantly larger.\n\nI recommend buying two sizes to try and choosing the one that fits best. Unfortunately, since I purchased from overseas, I didn’t have this option, which was really disappointing.\n\nThanks!",

It&apos;s warmer than I thought.  \nI regret I didn&apos;t believe the detail &quot;Item runs large, so we recommend sizing down for best fit.&quot; \nIf you read this, PLEASE SIZE DOWN.  Even it&apos;s too big for me, I still love this coat.  I&apos;m able to fit a Patagonia light down jacket underneath.  \nI got a XS for my 10 year old girl, it&apos;s too big for her too, but she loves it.  XS is a tight fit for me. \nSo, size S would be perfect.  \nThe only down side is unlike the other Retro X jackets, this coat&apos;s 2 side pockets don&apos;t have zippers.  So, be careful when you put things in side pockets.  The chest pocket is big and very useful.  Thank you Patagonia and Backcountry.",

I have washed it once and it came out great, maybe even a little softer. No shrinkage. The only thing I would change/add would be zippered pockets.

My previous saddles cause extreme discomfort/pain and numbing which results in me having to stop and get off my bike every 15 minutes or so. This saddle brings a whole new pain into the mix: pinching! I was constantly shifting and trying to find that sweet spot on the saddle but it just never happened. It also caused a lot of chafing even with chamois cream.  \n\nThe saddle seems to be well-made and the sit-bone area was comfortable, it&apos;s just not the right saddle for me.",

        "comment": [
          "the chafing i noticed immediately though i was wearing jean shorts for the test run.   i right away wondered why bike manufacturers choose fabric for saddle covers that cause friction given there is quite a bit of sliding about, especially when on trails.      got the men&apos;s on my CX bike since it came free with a preowned frame i&apos;m building.   the broken pelvis (7 months ago) pain was almost non existent though and i forgot all about the saddle by mile 3.   .   that is what i LOVED and has me online search for  a shorter womens version.   but i can&apos;t do cut outs.  i think that would exacerbate pain if you hit it wrong."

I thought the overalls would be a button type and not a velcro type (the velcro is infinitely adjustable) but lose their adhesiveness in the long run... so there&apos;s that. as for the actual pants... they&apos;re great.. no complaints. for 5,10 and above.. even a large might feel a wee bit small if your running pads underneath. overall great pants..",

It seems thin. I am so disappointed. I will say that, at times, I have felt like women&apos;s styles seem to have less loft than the similar men&apos;s styles.

I’ve had other stretch down jackets from Mountain Hardwear but this is the first one that I’ve been truly thrilled with. I got the “outer dark” color, which is like a vibrant navy blue. The hood is terrific. The pockets are capacious. The proportions are just right. The stretch down fabric is so comfortable and ideal for movement. I’m traveling this winter between cold and warm-ish zones and this will be the perfect coat to travel with, that is highly warm but also packable. This is the coat I’ve been striving to find!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought the stretch down hoody and loved it so much I decided to to try the parka. I live in Alaska and you need a lot of jacket options if you get outside much. This one makes me want to get rid of all the others. It’s the most comfortable down parka I have ever worn. The sizing is generous and easily accommodated a sweater or multiple layers while still giving you the air pocket needed for warmth. You could size down but at 5 feet tall and 120lbs I find it the perfect roomy jacket that goes over everything. The hood cinches down tight for added protection in wind and the stretch makes this feel like you are not wearing anything at all. It really moves with you to stop that tightly bundled feeling but still giving all the warmth.",

This piece fits comfortably with room to spare for base layers. The flexibility and comfort of the Stretchdown material is remarkable. Everything about this coat, from the zippered pockets to secure my items while I play outside, to the slightly elasticized wrists and bottom hem, neck coverage, enclosed hoodie, and length to help stay warm, has me singing its praises. \r\nI love to practice yoga outside, and I&apos;ve stayed super warm during my cold early morning sessions, enjoying full range of motion in this parka. It&apos;s also been a great casual parka for everyday use, as I like to stay warm and snuggly even when its not super cold outside. My only suggestion would be to include an elastic cinch on the hood and bottom of the coat to help enclose body heat in colder temps and wind.",

        "reviewBody": "Solid, heavy steel rack.  Easy to use, easy to install and remove.  I Like that nothing touches the bike frames.  Road bikes with higher air pressure are a little harder to secure, softer tires hold better.  I use rubber Voile straps on the wheels/wheel trays on highway trips, just for extra hold. On a long road trip, got into some snow and ice,  as mentioned in another review, the pistons iced up and wouldn’t operate.  Luckily, with some repacking I was able to get my bikes into the vehicle and the stuck-open arms cleared the sides of my 4Runner so I could flip the rack upright.  This rack chips easily from rocks etc, and the bare spots rust if you don’t put some touch up paint on, which Kuat doesn’t sell.  Kuat told me to touch it up with black paint, but the rack isn’t black.",

        "reviewBody": "Everything I ever wanted out of a bike rack. Installation was easier than expected, did it in under an hour into a two inch trailer hitch, and removal is easy as heck other than it being heavy for some, wasn&apos;t a problem for me. The fastest most secure bike rack, takes seconds to load and unload everything from 29&quot; 2.3 MTBs to 700x32 road bikes to 650b touring bikes and holds them steady on Interstate and gravel roads. Looks great, ingeniously designed, folds up to get out of the way and looks good. Signal lights work fantastic. And specifically on a Subaru Forester Wilderness edition, license plate is clear, rear camera is plenty visible, and it doesn&apos;t interfere with blindspot detection. We&apos;ll see how long the kashima piston arms last, but for now, as a former bike shop employee who has installed hundreds of racks of customers cars, this is the best rear rack I&apos;ve ever come across. Some of the worries about wiring seems to have been revised with the model we received, no more magnetic interfaces. Modular arm designs means in future you should be able to replace troubled sections if needed.",

It will be okay to the trailhead but you open and take your bike off and then it won’t ratchet or lock down again so no way to get your bike home safely. Wiring failed as well in under a year. Each issue they’ll send replacement parts but expect you to fully rebuild the rack. For the money it’s not worth it! If you live in TX and never get things dirty, muddy, icy etc it’s probably great. Very disappointed in this product for the money.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had a bunch of racks. Recently 1-Up, Kuat NV, Thule T2 Pro XTR. I got rid of the 1-Up because it didn&apos;t really hold the front wheel very firmly, which resulted in the wheel wobbling back and forth rapidly in the wind, which is ultimately why I got rid of mine and switched to the hook style. Unfortunately, no matter what I did I couldn&apos;t get the hook of the Kuat or the Thule to not rub on the fork. This was particularly troublesome for a matte finish I have on one bike, which ended up getting polished, even with a rag in-between. \n\nSo I decided to give this one a shot hoping it would have the convenience of the 1-Up rack, but with higher quality.  It really fits the bill. \n\nThe wheel chocks it has are really substantial (not the little dinky bit that&apos;s on other racks) and holds the wheels really firmly.\n\nMy trail bike, even on the Thule T2 XTR, would wobble quite a bit just because of how big the bike is. The Piston Pro holds it completely solidly.\n\nThe pistons are cool, but probably pretty unnecessary. Maybe they&apos;ll come out with a non-piston version down the road.\n\nI also like that the arms will open all the way to the ground. It really makes it easy to get bikes in and out, especially ones with a long wheel base.\n\nI think the lights are also a big asset, especially the brake lights, in helping avoid getting rear ended.\n\nDespite all the features and capabilities, the rack is actually pretty compact when folded up.\n\nThis rack really ticks all the boxes.",

I wish 20 years ago someone would have told me that you are supposed to pack smaller bags within your larger bag so that your stuff is not only organized logically, but doesn&apos;t explode into a congealed disaster of clothing and gear after moving the bag once.\r\n\r\nThe top portion is indeed translucent, but definitely not that super tacktile type plastic that will rip if you look at it wrong. The dimples take care of any snag points; great design.\r\n\r\nSometimes it takes seeing someone else do it correctly for you to facepalm and then totally change your methods. Try packing things by use case. For example, the largest cube holds my outdoor/woods/wilderness clothing very well. Get the full set so you have a true understanding of what it can be used for, and THEN order more individual bags as needed. Don&apos;t do what I have done sometimes and guess first, complain, then do it right the second time lol.",

I ordered this jacket in XXL because all the reviews I&apos;ve seen said it fits very small. It was at least 3 inches short in body length even in XXL, with the sleeves being 3-4 inches too long, and it was tight in the shoulders and chest. Definitely one of the worst sized jackets I&apos;ve ever seen. The proportions are totally wrong, and much different than any other brand I&apos;ve tried on.",

When adjusted to your needs the weight stays pretty evenly distributed throughout the back. Doesn&apos;t put too much pressure on the waist area. The harness mesh was really comfortable on the curves of the body. My only downside to it was that it was not built for a girl with a football player stance in the shoulders, and it felt tight. Great bag, and I can see why this line of packs is popular.",

        "reviewBody": "Stumpjumper Expert. Swapped out the stock wheels and tires for the Royal Carbon wheel set and Specialized S-Works Fast Track tires. Bike is now over 2 pounds lighter - all rotating mass. My average speed on my typical route went from 11.3 mph to 12.8 mph, and my top speed (on the flats) increased from 18.0 to 22.4. I saved the stock beefy wheels and tires for future trail rides. Most of what I ride is &quot;flow&quot; and doesn&apos;t need the stock heavy casing wheels. My background is road bike riding, so those heavy downhill oriented wheels and tires just feel overkill. Your mileage may vary, as they say.\n\nAnyway, the bike now feels much more lively. I picture it more of a XC/Flow/Trail Bike than anything else. If your full suspension trail bike feels portly - I&apos;d recommend this wheel set. I honestly can feel the difference.",

Smith doesn&apos;t have replacement parts, other brands do. Smith won&apos;t warranty scratches, other companies will. Only thing good about sunglasses were the chromepop (or whatever its called). These things scratched so easily, I was very surprised. I wanted to baby them - even though I got them for MTB/gravel biking - but they scratched right away. The arms and nose piece felt cheap and looked cheap because it was hard to clean around them. There is also no adjustability in the nose piece. Glasses would touch my eyelashes because the fit was weird. Google what sunglasses the Tour de France riders wear, no one wears Smith.... I will be switching to a new brand and will not be coming back to Smith. Sad because I am an Oregonian.",

Next time I purchase shades with polarization. \n\nThe ventilation is lacking. When riding the shades remain clear, but as soon as I stop, they begin to fog up almost immediately. I&apos;m able to remedy this by wearing them a little further off my nose, but not ideal.",

Normally wear an XS or size 0, 32D bra.  I ordered one size up and it’s tight around the upper body.  You can feel the tightness in the upper arm when wearing a sweater. It’s beautiful but the fit is not great. Pricey to be uncomfortable.",

I have a small waist which is 29 and wide on the bottom and I got a large after reading reviews that they do run small. I pur hated it in the store so when I tried on the large it was perfect as I wanted to still have room. I took it for a test run today with the matching beanie and it was super warm. It will be 22 degrees in NYC tomorrow God willing so I will be prepared wearing my floor length Calina coat. This coat is for the grown ups that love to look chic and not bulky.",

In Northface I generally wear a medium so I was nervous that the Mackage large would be too big. I&apos;m really glad I went with a large, though, because the shoulders and upper body section are a bit narrow. The belt adds a really nice, feminine cinch at the waistline.

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I haven&apos;t ever loved beanies because they lack a brim for the sun, brimmed beanies never feel great, and just a hat is cold. A beanie over a hat has been my best solution until I found this! Its adjustability makes it perfect for cold days. I also love the break in the brim so you can store it in a pocket or pack w/o worries. Excited to have this in my collection for years to come!",

One of the features I particularly appreciate is the face cover, which effectively prevents my face from reflecting light during hunting trips.

I didn&apos;t do the most intense ride, but from my first ride, they felt great and didn&apos;t feel any numbness in hands, which I felt before with my stock grips. Also, getting a color that matches the bike looks great!",

I&apos;ve been running GA3 (small wings) for about 3 years and decided to get something larger as the GA3 have felt small at times.  I read review about their good vibration dampening so I decided to try these over the ESI Extra Chunky.  I should have gone with the ESI.  These grips are noticeably larger than the GA3, but the rubber feels the same thickness.  My hand that normally goes a little numb on a ride was completely numb.  I tried different grip positions, but couldn&apos;t find a comfortable one to use with these.  It felt like a large, hard plastic grip with a thin rubber overcoat.  Just not what I expected from Ergon.   The GA3 are good grips.  If you want something thicker, go with the ESI.",

I have a Voile strap and pedals that match in color so I wanted new handlebar grips to match as well, and the picture on here (and on the Ergon website) definitely shows a lighter blue (one might call it cyan). It is definitely NOT a light blue at all. It is very much a navy blue. Good thing these grips are so nice. So I&apos;ll keep them.",

Length is perfect (5&apos;10&quot; 160# in a M), and the L would be much too long.  But the cut is a little strange. The legs, waist and butt all seem just right, but the bib section is pretty snug right above the waist, then almost baggy at the top.  I&apos;m pretty lean--not exactly 6-pack abs--but on the skinny side.  It would be nice to have had a little more space.  There are velcro adjusters to pull it tighter around the middle, but tightening it up wasn&apos;t the goal.  If you have any kind of a gut or even a minor muffin top, they may not be comfortable.  A real beer gut and you won&apos;t be able to get them on.  Once I was skiing in them, it was comfortable and didn&apos;t feel tight or binding.  But most bibs I&apos;ve used allow a little room for lunch, or even layering up on a cold day.  So 3 stars--credit for pockets, vents, insulation, and penalty for being too snug in the middle of the bib.",

Why companies keep making fitted ski gear for women is beyond me.  I prefer a looser, more relaxed fit in ski pants and these bibs do the job. \n\nI?m 5?7?? and weigh 143 lbs, and the small fit great. They were a tad long but I was able to cinch them up with the suspenders just fine. \n\nThey?re comfortable and appear high quality. The insulation is on the cool side but I like that they?re not just a shell. Can?t wait to wear them cat skiing in two weeks!",

We turned it upside down so the water resistant part / black bottom was a throw over poncho blanket.  We managed to keep pretty dry.  Pretty rugged, the blanket is kind of a plastic-y material/weave.  The buckles have been fine so far. Roll up feature is nice.",

As soon as I went to fold it up I noticed the seams around the edges and straps were coming looses. Upon looking it over I then go to roll up the blanket and as I use the straps and buttons to roll it up the button busted. Needless to say it&apos;s seen a front yard once and is already threadbare and broken. If you have money to throw away then buy this but otherwise save it for something that will last",

        "reviewBody": "So yeah, I really feel like I need to tell someone about these because they are awesome.  I guess I?ll start of by saying that I absolutely hate trainers.  Turbo?s are too stiff, and rollers require too much paying attention or you do an epic crash.  The Nero Rollers are the first trainer I?ve ever used that I actually like.\n\nFrom the beginning, the unboxing was simple.  They come fully assembled and only need folded out and adjusted for your bikes wheel base.  It is the same as any other roller in this respect.  The front axle goes over or just behind the front roller.  Once this is done, you can actually ride if you want to.\n\nFor the interactive (smart) part, it?s super simple.  Plug the supplied cord into the rollers and pair them up to the program of your choice.  I used zwift via my iPhone.  It is worth mentioning that the power output accuracy on this trainer isn?t supposed to be great.  I honestly never tried it because the trainer automatically searched for and linked with my Assioma power meter pedals, and used them as a default for setting itself.  The trainer worked quite well with zwift.  There was a slight delay between the screen and the felt resistance on the trainer, but not much.  Since I don?t watch the screen that closely, it?s not going to bother me a bit.\n\nI guess for the part that really sold me on these...  The ride quality is great!  These aren?t you daddy?s rollers.  Unlike every set of rollers that I?ve been on, these don?t try to trow you off just because you reach for your water bottle.  You can even ride out of the saddle!  Don?t get me wrong, you can still crash, but it?s noting like a typical set of rollers.  The bike simply feels like a bike on these, and with the interactive programs available, these are as close to riding outdoors as I?ve ever found.",

This time I wanted a more protective shoe for walking in rivers as a rafting guide. This shoe deliverd. Comfy and just high enough in the back to stay on the foot and protect the sensitive part. But, to me it feels the sole is different from the 2 others model. It feels that it&apos;s slipping more.  The ohers thing is like the others shoes, they don&apos;t last. not even half a season before i can see it start to brake aways. I like the warranty service but  sorry Astral it&apos;s not in my value to buy a new pair of shoe each season.",

        "reviewBody": "Like every pair of Astral shoes I&apos;ve owned, these are made well with great materials. The soles are nice and sticky and this plus the ability to lace them up higher than other water shoes gives me a lot of confidence moving on wet rocks. The high-top with low-cut back is a great combination that makes a lot of sense on the water/in a boat. These are comfortable, and look great too. The biggest thing I needed to get used to was the volume - these are kinda &quot;tight&quot; at first. It makes a lot of sense because you don&apos;t want a loose, sloppy shoe where you foot rolls around inside when you&apos;re trying to squeeze them into a boat, or scramble around the river. It&apos;s not uncomfortable, but worth trying on for fit before you buy; this might feel different than other Astral&apos;s you&apos;ve tried in the past. All in all, GREAT shoes and would recommend for a variety of uses.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these used online about a year and a half ago to wear for work (I&apos;m a fish biologist and work in  water a fair amount).  I got these to wear for field work that I am getting in and out of boats a lot and needed a water shoe that wouldn&apos;t come off easily when I step in mud and wouldn&apos;t let in small rocks so I wouldn&apos;t have to constantly be taking off and emptying my shoes.  I tried the Webbers for this at first but they&apos;re not so great at toe protection.  Dropping the anchor on my toe once was all I needed to look for something close-toed.  The Rassler works well in the foot protection department and has good grip on slippery rocks.  I do need to really tie them pretty tight to keep small rocks out so I do have to take them off and empty them at least once (even if I think they&apos;re tied tight enough, once they get wet they loosen up) which I don&apos;t love but that&apos;s what gravel guards are for I guess. I also love the look of these shoes (I didn&apos;t know I could love the look of a shoe so much until I discovered Astral) and the wide toe box is also great.  The little bit of extra ankle support is also helpful without too much restriction.\nAside from that my only negative is that I wish there was more cushioning.  I have foot issues and I stand most of the day wearing these.  I didn&apos;t think water shoe insoles existed but I did find a pair that add a little cushion and don&apos;t just turn into a wet sponge to make wearing them a little more bearable (I also bought these about 2 sizes too big so the insoles fit and actually make the shoe fit, too).",

I’ve had now 4 pair of these same shoes and with each new pair, about 2 or 3 weeks into wearing them they fall apart. The sole of the shoe comes apart from the shoe itself. Besides that I love the show but it would be nice to not have to pay for a new pair every month because the glue is so cheap",

They were also reliably waterproof, even in thes PNW winters when everything is soaking wet. \r\n\r\nThe cons: the tread/sole simply did not hold up. Within 6 months (of moderate use) I had holes in the soles and then, well, they&apos;re certainly a lot less waterproof. \r\n\r\nI loved the look and comfort, but need something that can actually withstand a proper hike.",

If you wear regular pants in a size 32 but you want to be able to layer more and less body hugging I would go a size up. I just wear a thin thermal layer underneath and they’ve been warm enough for mid season skiing in Alaska.",

        "reviewBody": "These pants are smartly designed and constructed, high quality, and fit great. (I&apos;m 5&apos;10&quot;, 165 pounds, and the size 32s were tailored but comfortable.) Unfortunately, the description doesn&apos;t accurately represent them so I have to send them back.\n\nWhile ordering, I noted that despite the product description that says these are exclusively a shell, several customer reviews mentioned a built-in, insulating liner. I need these pants for skinning and backcountry, so I only need a shell—built-in insulation would be too much for high-output. As such, I contacted Backcountry Customer Service, and the representative assured me these were a shell only, no insulation. When I pressed to be sure, the agent said that the reviews were probably for a different pant and that the reviewers who said they had insulation were wrong. So I ordered them.\n\nOn receipt, I&apos;m disappointed to find that these pants do in fact have a light insulating interior layer. They would be great for resort skiing. But unless you are an extremely cold person or plan to ski with nothing under these pants, they are likely going to be too heavy for any aerobic use.\n\nAgain, they are awesome looking pants. But don&apos;t be misled: they are NOT just a shell; they definitely have a light insulating layer inside.",

Their only shortcoming is that they are on the warm side for a shell pant, because the inside liner (they are 2 layer, not 3 layer) is quite warm. That said, they have excellent outside leg vents, and I run hot, so this will be a non-issue for most folks (and for me, except in the spring).\r\n\r\nI have worn these in cold and windy and warm and sunny conditions and they have performed admirably. They are very comfortable, fit really well (size S, I am 5’6” and 145lbs) and look great.",

Not only are they extremely comfortable, flexible and light, my temperature has been maintained perfectly. The pockets themselves on the front are small and cannot hold much, and I have opted instead to use my jacket pockets instead for comfort reasons.\n\nOverall, extremely satisfied and can&apos;t wait to try them touring.",

        "reviewBody": "My first pair of Mammut bottoms and the one thing I wish I had done was read more reviews on the item&apos;s actual product page. I&apos;m 6&apos;2, 185 but athletically built. So while I&apos;m not popping out like Arnold or CBum, the pants are snug around the hips. \nWhen I initially put them on, my immediate thought was that I&apos;m jacked(not in the good way) coz they felt tight coming up, and this was with no base/mid layer underneath. I still had a butt-pad to fit in. The front of it was pushing down on my jewels already.\n\nA few weeks in, I have been riding in these with a butt pad on and there has honestly been 0 discomfort. They have some stretch to them which has certainly helped. I dont use the pockets at all. And so far, I haven&apos;t had to use a base layer. They have insulation which has served well. They&apos;ve also held their own in a couple PNW downpours and he waterproofing is solid.\n\nMy rating of 9/10 was only because of how slim they run. I picked a size 34 since I am a 32 and figured 36 might be too loose. Even with the 34, I use the waist adjustment all the way and have tonnes of room everywhere but the hips.\n\nAll that said, if you are looking at these, pay a little extra attention to the measurements before you buy it, but buy it.",

I’d be happy to pay 20-30% if items were made in the U.S. I usually revert back to my old MountainSmith from the early 90’s that was made stateside and zippers work great after 30 years.

        "reviewBody": "Thoughtful well designed pack and day pack system. Great for long weekend travels via ground and air. Multipurpose capable luggage pack with the removable day pack design. The straps through straps is annoying efficient enough. Hopefully they are durable long term but imagine to be weak point with the amount of use they will see long term. I was able to get into enough storage compartments and zips without taking things apart while in an airport for access to all travel items. A larger item such as a laptop would require multiple straps and zips to be undone/redone. Very doable in a tight space albeit inefficiency in general.  The pack looks indistinguishable from other mainstream luggage which attracts less attention. The padded carry handles allowed me to not need to deploy harness/shoulder straps on multiple occasions while fully loaded on a few occasions and while walking 1-2 miles through airports. \n\nThe day pack is great for light quick carry. It lacks a waist strap for anything more than basic activity uses. I also with the outer fabric was more water resistant or fully waterproof. That&apos;s never issue until it is.",

The day pack was great for stashing a few extra layers and keeping my essentials accessible. Love the ability to carry the entire unit as one backpack, convert the main bag to a carry-on and hide all the straps, as well as front carry the day pack. I used all three configurations on my trip.

        "reviewBody": "This completely changed air travel for me. I fly weekly for business and check two huge rolling Pelican cases and this thing is a game changer for my personal stuff!! I no longer have to rig up a way in and out of the airport for my carryon roller bag because it has assumed its new permanent residence in a closet. I don&apos;t have to take up space in one of the Pelican cases anymore with the 55L pack that I carried the stuff in the cases to demo&apos;s with as I do so with the main main pack of the Fairpoint and my computer and stuff is sitll in the daypack. The Fairpoint 55 made air travel easier than I imagined possible. The way the flap on the back of the main pack zips the straps up for overhead bin storage makes tight spaces in the overhead bin possible and easy. The handles on the side and top are extremely comfortable for carrying by hand when the straps are stowed. The way the day pack nests in the back of the main pack makes TSA easy if you have precheck you just put one bag on the belt and don&apos;t take anything out it&apos;s just easy. I thought the pictures of the day pack hanging off the front straps looking like a reserve parachute were a little goofy and who would carry it like that but let me tell you when I had a few minutes to make a connecting flight I did it as I was waiting to get off the first plane and it was comfortable and easy darting through airport congestion to make my flight. It&apos;s an Osprey pack so it&apos;s just flat out comfortable on your back with the multiple adjustment points it fits like a glove. Osprey knocked it out of the park with this one!!!!!

        "reviewBody": "The G12 Evo looks like a great crampon, but unfortunately it&apos;s not compatible with the La Sportiva Olympus Mons Cube boot. At all. There is no compatibility chart to prevent making this mistake.\n\nMy boot is a US 12-1/2 (EU 46-1/2). I got the Cramp-O-Matic version of the G12 Evo hoping to use it on both the Oly Mons and my AT ski boots. The Grivel spec sheet shows that it should work. It doesn&apos;t.\n\nThe G12 Eco wouldn&apos;t fit the Oly Mons for 4 reasons: \n\n1) The center bar is too short: at full extension it was still 1/4&quot; or more too short for the sole. The spec sheet says it fits up to size EU 47, but nonetheless it didn&apos;t.\n\n2) The toe bail is too narrow: the loops on the bail dig into the front of the boot so the front of the bail doesn&apos;t fit snugly on the toe lug. The bail floated about 3/16&quot;+ off the lug because of this. Pulling it tight still didn&apos;t snug it, and the way it was digging in, it looked like it was going to damage the boot.\n\n3) The crampon heel is too narrow: the two vertical rear lugs are narrower than the boot sole, so even if everything else worked, you&apos;d be standing on the lugs, likely causing boot  damage, and the crampon would never sit flush with the boot sole.\n\n4) The rear bail is far too short for the sole thickness: at the maximum length, the cam locking mechanism couldn&apos;t possibly work, so even if the heel lugs mentioned above weren&apos;t an issue, you couldn&apos;t attach the crampon to the boot.\n\nSo... 4 strikes, you&apos;re out. Nothing fit. I don&apos;t think it would work with a smaller boot size due to the boot&apos;s width and sole thickness. \n\nReally wish there was a compatibility chart for crampons. Any chance of that Backcountry?",

The weight of the shirt is light but not &quot;too light&quot;. I don&apos;t like shirts that are like almost a silky material. Breathes great, just did my first 5k trail run in it and loved it.

        "reviewBody": "I really like the general design of the &quot;no touch&quot; trays like Saris uses for this product. I have had a couple different brands and like them all. The Saris is a very solid offering with long tray to accommodate larger bikes. I have even seen a tandem on this rack although I don’t think its recommended. \r\n\r\nThe long tray, while offering space for long wheel base bikes with large tires also created a small challenge in accommodating smaller bikes.  The support cross bars have to be moved down a bit and the wheel block found in the tray is stationary. I think this is just a change from what I am accustomed to as it works perfectly well, but it seems unnecessary and fixes the bike position by blocking the front wheel. If the wheel block were not there or adjustable, it would allow moving bikes forward and aft to keep bars and saddles from touching.\r\n\r\nI am still completely on board for this product, it is super solid in the hitch with very little movement and the bikes are securely held. The add-on works great, solid and easy to install. The system is a bit heavy but that’s what you get for solid at a good price. The versatility is also pretty interesting. The additional engineering to make a modular system is a bonus. Built in locks are a super handy feature often overlooked! Lastly, “Made Here” is a good thing these days.\r\n\r\nUsage: I work in the Bike industry and often carry 5 bikes inside my T&amp;C and now can move/add three to the hitch. I am driving to events and supporting races and rides with SAG, media and also support racers as well. This is now my go-to rack.",

It feels incredibly sturdy, it fits a ton of stuff, and I love the little external pocket for your quick-grab items like your phone, wallet, earbuds, etc. The little external pocket actually has a zipper on the outside, of course, but it also has an internal zipper as well! So you can get to your small items quickly and conveniently either way. The fabric is also a fantastic choice for this type of bag. It’s not too precious for long-term, heavy-duty use, and it even seems somewhat water repellant. I generally trust Thule products and I would definitely buy this again!",

The ventilation is on par with my POC Octal TdF Edition (260g) but since the Octal forehead pad is disintegrating and I couldn’t find replacements, I got this helmet to replace it.  I always add reflectivity stickers to my helmets for conspicuity during low-ambient-light riding (morning/evening commutes/training).  Longevity is yet to be seen for this great piece of kit.",

So much so it feels like I am not wearing anything which is amazing (and the point!). \n\nSecond, the fit. I love it. The chin straps are adjustable but I can see if you have long ears it may be annoying where the straps hit, however for me it is PERFECT. \n\nand Third, very very ventilated. The hot summers have nothing on this helmet, so great to have the safety and protection of POC while not compromising airflow. Recommend!",

Super light and compact too.  I prefer this to the Petzl Fly.  \n\nThat said - the sizing is off.  I&apos;m a 32&quot; waist and based on Mammut&apos;s sizing chart I should be a comfortable medium.   In reality I barley squeeze into the medium&apos;s hip belt.  I have thick legs and the legs are fine though.  \n\nOverall, I&apos;d highly recommend this harness, with the caviot that folks should try it on in-store.  Hopeful that Mammut can address the sizing issue, but likely plan to size up on this harness.  \n\nWould be 5 stars, but for the sizing issue.",

        "reviewBody": "These are lightweight, ski bib shell pants. They are quite slim fitting, so consider your size when you purchase. They are one of the few pants on the market which have small and tall sizes. I am 193cm and 84kg, and the 32long (48long Europe) fits me well. The pants are regular fit, which looks great for skiing, and provides great flexiblity to move. \nThe bib is a close-fitting warmer (but not waterproof layer). As it is tight fitting, I can get a base and thin-mid layer under it. But if you run very cold, you would not be able to get a thicker heavy-mid layer under unless you sized up. \nThe Mammut Dry Technology has a very high waterproof rating, and is worth considering over other waterproofing technologies such as goretex.\nThere are two thigh pockets and a chest pocket for a beacon. I cannot fit my phone in the chest pocket (Google Pixel), but would usually store it in my jacket. Consider whether this is important to you. \nThe kick plates around the hem, are not the thickest material I have seen, but are easily able to cope with the edges of your skis. The denier of the fabric is lower than others out there. This helps to achieve a lower weight, but does not have te same &quot;bomb-proof&quot; feeling of 70D / 80D. \nIf you are looking for modern-styled, do it all shell bib-pants that come in a range of sizes, it is hard to find anything better at this price point.",

A zipper on the pant cuff would be great to get them to fit over various boots. They fit well with hiking shoes/boots, cross-country ski boots, and skimo race boots. Personally, I found the fit kind of snug. I am 5&apos; 6&quot; and 120 lbs, and usually wear a 4. I bought these in size 4 but would prefer a 6. I can see these being really good for winter hiking/climbing with a layer underneath. By themselves they are definitely not warm, but they are meant more for hiking I think.  Edit: after a wet fatbike ride the fabric in bum area has worn to a lighter shade of blue. I only got 4-6 uses out of these pants.",

A zipper on the pant cuff would be great to get them to fit over various boots. They fit well with hiking shoes/boots, cross-country ski boots, and skimo race boots. Personally, I found the fit kind of snug. I am 5&apos; 6&quot; and 120 lbs, and usually wear a 4. I bought these in size 4 but would prefer a 6. I can see these being really good for winter hiking/climbing with a layer underneath. By themselves they are definitely not warm, but they are meant more for hiking I think.",

After wearing out camping/hiking over three days, they held their fit...they didn&apos;t get too loose like some hiking pants do. The color is rad.  I like them so much I just bought a second pair in black.  Depending upon how you like your pants to fit, I ordered a size 44 which had a bit more room than the size 42.  The 42 fits more snug of course.  I typically buy 44 if I might do a thin base layer underneath.  42 is great if not planning on ever wearing anything underneath. Ps. I&apos;m not a petite and can&apos;t thank Mammut enough for making awesome, quality, stylish outdoor wear for people that are a variety of shapes and sizes.  You are my go to brand!",

I&apos;m able to use my thumb on my iPhone but not the fingers -- just enough to press &quot;record&quot;  on Strava.  Update:  I have used them 20+ times and they are holding up fine (I hand wash and air dry them).  Also I just cut the velcro strap off because the glove is not going to come off on it&apos;s own so you don&apos;t need it.  Upgrading to 4 stars.",

Although the picture makes them look burly and heavy, they are comfortable and breath well. They allow a solid handlebar feel.   I went up one size from the guide, the glove comes off just a little easier but still fit snugly.  My hand measures just below the cut-off between the large and XL.  So, technically, they are true to size. One disappointment is that the gloves fingers won&apos;t work on an iPhone X but that&apos;s not really why you buy a glove like this.  Again, buy this glove for the protection, comfort and grip feel.     A note about the velcro, honestly, I dont see why you even need a closure on this glove,  they are cut in a way that the closure doesn&apos;t add anything.",

        "reviewBody": "Got this in a size up, to layer over warmer clothes for winter travel to cold/wet climates. It is waterproof and that&apos;s a big plus in driving rain and wind. I don&apos;t love the army green color but the alternates were not available in the size I wanted.\r\n\r\n I took off a star for these issues. First, the hood (while adjustable with the back pull) is not great in wind. It is a bit oversized to fit over a heavy hat (or helmet) and wants to blow off. With just my Merino beanie, it leaves a lot of fabric behind my head. Second, the cargo pockets work but I wish there were waist level pockets. Hard to get a phone or wallet out of the pockets as designed. Third (minor) the hem adjustment would ideally work on both sides. It can be pulled tighter but bunches up more on the right side.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a great jacket especially at the sale price. The pit zips are perfect. The velcro cuffs have a wide adjustment range. The 2-way zipper is useful. And rain tested - no leaks.",

Not only are my feet dry but most importantly, they are nice and warm. \nAfter reading the reviews, I decided to buy one size up from my usual 8. They were way too big. Returned them for a size 8.5. Perfect fit. So, be cautious on the sizing. For some, sizing up a full size worked great. However, that wasn&apos;t the case for me. \nThese boots are warm, comfortable, and stylish.

I bought two sizes because I listened to the sizing advice and went up a size - those were MASSIVE and I felt like a duck and they buckle out and give you undeniable cankles the size of swollen golf balls on both sides of your ankles. I bought my normal size and  they fit fine with heavy socks. With cankles. Normal golf ball size cankles. No thank you. They generally weren?t that comfortable either - a lot of weird extra space in the foot and I have high insteps so that?s rarely a problem. The treading didn?t seem that great either. I went with the Helly Hansen Garibaldi VIs instead and they are soooo much better for me - so warm, comfortable, did great on trails, I love them.",

Several reviews, however, mention that the sizing runs SMALL. This is TRUE! And I say this as someone who struggles to find a women&apos;s size 5 shoe that isn&apos;t too big for me (I wish there was a size 4.75, because 4.5 is too small!). I am a grown adult woman, but my feet are baby feet, tiny and narrow. I took a gamble and ordered the size 6 based on the reviews (and the fact that it&apos;s the smallest size available anywhere!) and they fit PERFECTLY with thick wool socks. In fact, my big toes are about 1/2 - 3/4 inch from hitting the front walls. For comparison, my size 5 Adidas sneakers are almost the same size as these. They feel great after a test drive walking around my neighborhood. I am yet to test drive them in the snow, but I&apos;ll say that my feet were running HOT walking 20 minutes in Southern California 55 degree winter temps. Looking forward to putting them to the real test in snowy New England in a few weeks! I feel confident they&apos;ll be great!",

And I am not walking long distances because I live next to my work, I just have to cross the street and change places within my work a couple of times. I think if I would have used it on longer walks it would not have lasted more than 1,5 years. The backpack is quite expensive and for that this should not happen. A weak point like this should be dealt with and customers should get a replacement then. I love the look but on long walks with a full backpack it will be uncomfortable.",

        "reviewBody": "I do love this bag for its look, but not its functionality. I have two big gripes with it however, and neither are the seam problem that others report. Firstly the water &apos;resistance only lasted about 6 months, it could have been less as I first got the bag in May and by the early Autumn it could not withstand a 10 minute walk from the bus in the rain. I purchased the wax to re-waterproof it, but each time I have used it this leaves unsightly streaks over the bag and doesn&apos;t even seem to protect the bag from even light showers. I know the bag is stated as water resistant but I don&apos;t see how it can be called as much, It&apos;s frustrating as I&apos;ve had to purchase a bag rain cover to protect my laptop and sketchbooks. The second problem is the very tight water bottle pockets, with redundant poppers on them. At first they look to be the right size but when the bag is full it is near impossible to get a relatively slim 500ml water bottle in the sides. It becomes impossible because of the metal poppers on each side preventing the bottle to be able to be squeezed in. I had to remove these in the end because it was just too frustrating. Even if the pockets had a panel of elastic it would avoid this problem",

As others have said, the area where the base meets the back wears through and the fabric thins to the point of ripping. I&apos;m going to try and patch mine to keep it going, but it will be retired from daily use. If Fjallraven were to reinforce this area with harder wearing fabric it would last a lifetime. I love everything else about it! (also Fjallraven, if you&apos;re reading this please also add a bit more padding to the base of the laptop sleeve, the protection is fine but not excellent)",

        "reviewBody": "Bought the black version of this rucksack in 2019. Ended up still using my old rucksack as I found it too small for my everyday commute. This means I used it maybe once every two weeks on average, if at all. A few days ago I noticed that the seam that connects the bottom with the back has completely teared, which makes the rucksack unusable as the bottom is now wide open. I was never carrying heavy items in it. This simply can&apos;t happen after three years of less than average use considering the price. Rain water also easily collects on the top of the rucksack, sinking into the top pocket, as the top automatically shapes itself like a dent. Not great when hiking. The only time this doesn&apos;t happen is when the rucksack is overpacked to the very top, but then it&apos;s uncomfortable to wear due to the badly distributed weight. It&apos;s a very good looking rucksack, but I can really not recommend it unfortunately.",

It fits a good amount of stuff and the material is durable so I feel confident taking it to crags for outdoor climbing without harming the material if it bumps into anything. I also used it for traveling recently and it was great for under my seat on the plane. 10/10 would recommend!",

        "reviewBody": "Forget how beautiful and visable the color is against fresh white snow! This tent can handle 2.5 ft of heavy wet snow loading, as I discovered LAST winter in the Catskill Mountains, NY. Now I have 100% complete confidence that it can handle 40-50 mph winds, that is wind, NOT gusts, as well. For myself solo, the 3P with vestibule is my Kingdom. Sharing the tent with friend was acceptable. Not too cramped and we were able to melt snow, cook, eat, lay down, sit up, lounge, stretch, sleep, hang out, change clothing and not bump heads. Plenty of space. The vestibule, I feel is mandatory in bad weather.. Definitely with 2 people in there and if you plan on being mostly tent bound. The entry doors/bay windows are fantastic for views and ventilation, let a!one entering and exiting. My only 2 grips are small, tight toggles and latches for the doors! Very hard to do in freezing weather, bare handed.. With gloves even harder, but this is something I can probably modify myself, or not, because its not that bad, just could be better. The 2nd gripe is the storm flap on the vestibule door can snag easy if you not careful. And in bad weather sometimes you may want to close it up quickly... So be careful. But that&apos;s the vestibule and this is review of tent.. So disregard. I wish I could post pictures of it in action. I also love the blue on the inside!! Its cheery and inspiring even on the dark gloomy days..stimulate the mind a bit!! This tent is almost the unicorn! Search it on you tube!",

        "reviewBody": "Finally got to test the Hilight 3P tent with Vestibule in the Catskill Mountains, NY with some snow! Forcast called for 1-2 feet of snow fall.. Mother Nature had other plans for us those 2 days. Upon arrival there was already about a foot and half snow on the ground. When the storm hit, we got approximately another 2 - 3 feet of heavy wet snow.. and counting!! The Hilight held its own and without a glitch. I was safe and dry and comfortable inside while the storm dumped massive amounts of snow through the night. After this trip, I can safely say the Hilight 3p tent with Vestibule can handle heavy wet snow loads without question. For 1 person, this tent is a palace to live in while riding out a storm. You can easily get 2 people in there if needed and 3 would be squeezing, but in emergency situation, it can be done. I prefer the 3P over the 2P for numerous reasons, 1 obviously the extra room for extended time in there, and 2, both massive side door entries!! Just WOW! You can get silly views, plenty of venting, and escape door if snow burries your Vestibule.. just so many benefits over the 2p for minimal weight penalty.",

        "reviewBody": "I have used it for two years now. I use it when paddling and often camp on rocky islets. When it&apos;s up it&apos;s ok but the pinching, I find awkward att best. No setup on Youtube shows you the full set up. The poles constantly shift or snags the inside during set up. The welcro tabs is to smal and fiddly for handling with cold hands. I have had the poles missing the grommets and punching a couple of holes in the floor. It&apos;s a little easier when ground pegs can be used. I would like a instructional video on the set up, not using pegs. Se the MSR Advance Pro for a dirt simple set up in comparison.\n\nOn the plus side of things: I like the idea of the self supporting tent. I like the two doors on the sides, it makes living more comfy. The single wall construction works ok when there is no vestibule and ground condensation is kept on the outside. I wouldn&apos;t use this tent in a week long trip in a wet place or on an expidition. For weekend trips in nice weather there are others that are lighter, simpler to pinch and cheaper.",

This isn’t overly difficult and will likely make the tent last a lot longer, but it does pose a slight challenge to get it right. Kind of a bummer that the vestibule isn’t included.

Downsized a half size and they stretched perfectly. For sure not technical shoes but the heel stays tight on my narrow heel on hooks and the toes fit just right. Hope to get another couple months at least out of these but will definitely buy again.",

I have a few pairs of La Sportiva TC Pros and Miuras that I haven&apos;t touched since getting my first pair of Raves. They feel really secure for moccasins and I rarely feel like my heel is loose or liable to slip out - even with heel hooking. They&apos;re so comfortable I often just leave them on for my whole session, but I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m sacrificing performance for comfort at all... amazing! My street shoe is a 9 and I wear an 8.5 for this shoe.",

I’ve done a small amount of crack climbing in them, works just fine (not perfect, a better option is definitely a lower profile, laced, shoe, like the Yosemite). They’re satisfactory for overhanging features, accept aggressive heal hooks! I only ever feel slippage when aggressively heel hooking, like a brutal mantle. Perfectly fine on slabs and for smearing. Fine edges are manageable down to about 1cm. Extremely comfortable. I’ve got a medium, normal, arch in my feet. I’m usually a size 9.5US men’s, but I’ve got these in 8.5US men’s for a bit more response (I typically recommend sizing down just a bit). 99% of the time I climb I’m wearing socks and have had no issues with the sizing. They’ve stretched a little but I can still wear them for hours at a time. They’re quite durable too! Indoor use is fantastic, outdoor use is great as well. I’ve recommended these to multiple friends and they absolutely love them. This shoe will always be in my bag and I hope that this quality and standard remains! Thanks Evolv!",

I&apos;ve worn these on several long outdoor sport multipitch routes and although I do need to take them off occasionally for belays, so did my friend with his [very famous double priced shoe]. I really like the heel tension although that&apos;s the part making me want to get my feet a rest. I&apos;ve only done a few jams but they did fine. I do kind of wish I got 1/2 size up to wear more comfy with socks. I wouldn&apos;t say these stretched a lot but they noticeably became more comfy by the end of the first multipitch day.

The rubber has lasted me a long time and the fabric has held up even after many crack sessions. Your feet will turn yellow the first couple times.

        "reviewBody": "This has become my favorite all-round trail tire for dry, moderately loose and rocky trail conditons here in the Midwest (OK, AR, CO, NM). I&apos;m a 50+ yr old trail rider who loves technical old-school hand-cut singletrack. I had previously run Vittorias for a few years (Mazzas and Motas most recently) that worked pretty well, but I was really impressed with the 2.4 Dissector. \nMy &apos;21 Tallboy came stock with a 2.4 Dissector up front and a 2.4 Recon in the rear. The Dissector is a great &quot;middle-ground&quot; trail tire that offers excellent grip for its moderate weight and low rolling resistance. Perfect for most of the conditions/trails I ride. The Recon was decent in the rear initially, but not grippy enough for loose, steep, climbs. I replaced it with the 2.4 Dissector (a much gripper tire), and really didn&apos;t notice any additional rolling resistance. Now my Tallboy has a 2.6 Dissector up front and a 2.4 in the rear. The 2.6 is probably overkill for most of the riding I do in OK, but it saved my bacon multiple times when riding deep sand here locally and on faster, more enduro-y terrain in AR and CO. Not much of a weight or rolling resistance penalty for running that much beef up front. Highly recommended!",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been riding Maxxis for several years, and I have a lot of experience with the Minion DHR and Minion DHR II.  I felt like the DHR II was sucking the life out of my ride, and I didn&apos;t like the weight of the Minions.  But I didn&apos;t want to sacrifice downhill traction - especially up front.  Then I discovered the Dissector.  What a pleasant surprise!!  The Dissector is about 8 ounces lighter than a Minion; that&apos;s about 1 lb lighter for two tires.  Everything about the Dissector seems better without sacrificing traction in cornering.  The first difference I noticed was how fast they roll compared to Minions.  Combine that with a weight savings and I&apos;m hooked.  \nTroy Brosnan designed the Dissector after the Minion DHF, but with a faster rolling center.  It was originally sold as a rear downhill tire, but Troy Brosnan won a world cup running it on front and rear.  So do I.  People gonna do what they gonna do, but remember that I said to try out the Dissector.",

They feel true to size, a little snug but it sounds like they will relax a little from the other reviews, and I definitely prefer snug to loose.  They&apos;re not leaving a mark or anything, and the sleeve lets the breeze in.  Easy on/off, nice hard pad with a lot of forearm protection.  I was glad I went with this heavier pad vs. the leaner alternatives from TLD, although I haven&apos;t fallen in them yet - I just can&apos;t see much downside in the extra heft - I barely feel them climbing.  The top of the sleeve hides under a longish short sleeve shirt so there is no visible gap.",

Looks great, fits perfect, lots of adjustments, and stays cool even on hot days. \n\nI think it fits true to size but, it may trend slightly small.

The octo fit system is overkill for me but the helmet does fit really well and is extremely comfortable. The octo  fit system does seem to require adjustments on the fly which I?m hoping is just me getting used to it. Purchased this and a Bell z20 MIPS and the Kask is much more comfortable and feels very solid. \n\nUpdate. First attempt at washing the removable padding and it?s falling apart before being hand washed. Not happy.",

I returned it as the color I wanted was not available in medium.\nUpdate:\nI now have the jerseys in medium and the fit is spot on! I liked it so much that I bought the Black, Grey, Green Light Red and Sphere Blue\n(Jewel tone to the fabric) and now the Nordic Blue became available, so I purchased that one as well. Interesting fabric (melange)- It has a beautiful wool like outer appearance with a honeycomb texture inside. I pair them with Smartwool socks for the matching texture. I like the robust feel of the fabric, the 4th zippered rear pocket and the zipper garages at the neck and waist. Feature packed. What more can you ask for?!",
