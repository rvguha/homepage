This movie is boring, despite the good efforts of asking the spectators who had killing the little girl and the writer.  It&apos;s too long, too low key.  But the biggest problem of the movie is Valeria Bruni Tedeschi.  I never saw such a weak actress. She don&apos;t have any credibility in the role of the police inspector. She&apos;s inexpressive and had an horrible voice. She can&apos;t articulate and most of the time, we don&apos;t understand or hear what&apos;s she&apos;s saying!  Sandrine Bonnaire seems to be anywhere except in her role, but Jacques Gamblin is good.  Too bad for Chabrol&apos;s fans!",

However, this is a very poignant film, filled with chilling flashbacks to the Holocaust. I would never take a child to see this film.\n\nThe child protagonist&apos;s struggle to define himself as a Jew in Norway is challenging, charming, and heart-rending all at once. His nightmares are powerful and genuinely terrifyingly.\n\nCertainly most Norwegians come across as unsympathetic evangelizers in this film. Was this what Jewish refugees really met when they came to post-war Noray, I wonder? It is interesting to hear the child&apos;s language gradually become Norwegian.\n\nThe family&apos;s hidden secret is telegraphed from the very beginning of the film. So when it&apos;s revealed, my reaction was &quot;so what?&quot; The interactions between Mendel and his older brother were incredibly powerful, the real stuff of sibling rivalry, rage, betrayal, and powerful love.",

This one is about a pre-Pearl Harbor Shanghai, where Japanese, Chinese, Nazi, American intelligence services clash, and it&apos;s common people who make history. John Cusack is a great choice for the main role, and he delivers his part impeccably. Being a secret agent, he is deeply sensitive and sensible man, who wants to reveal some mysteries and he is right in the whirlwind of a war craze. Other actors include Chow Yun Fat, Gong Li, among others, and they all do great jobs. Japanese soldiers fight the Chinese partisans, Americans try to find out what they think will help... and all this is a dizzying background to a deep touching story of love, hate, cowardice, friendship, bravery and valor. This movie is highly recommended",

Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname &quot;The Bear Jew&quot; for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.\n\nChristoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",

      "reviewBody": "Only shame drives me to write this comment because I otherwise don&apos;t feel to be expert enough to completely grasp the whole impact this film had. There is little pride in being the first person to write about this great film in IMDb. No one ever wrote anything about Hans Hass here. I still can&apos;t believe it! &quot;Adventures in the Red Sea&quot; is of course an old film and since it is in black and white too, many people don&apos;t think much about it. We are so used to perfect close-ups of any underwater creature, even from the deep sea, in glorious color. So who gives a damn about a black and white documentary with unknown people done around 1950 about the underwater world of the Red Sea? Well, I do! And for many reasons too. Because this very film marked the beginning of professional underwater photography and studies before Jacques-Yves Cousteau became a household name. The creator of the film made many inventions to be able to make it. His name is Hans Hass.\n\nThe son of a Viennese lawyer, he was drawn to the sea early on in his life. He shot the very first scenes with sharks and people in the same frame and therefore became quite famous in Germany. He was especially drawn to sharks and to this day tries to change their bad image.\n\nBefore the war he and two friends went on a trip to Venezuela to explore the underwater wildlife. When he got back the war had already broken out, but with his photos and a short film about his diving experiences with sharks he became a hero in Nazi-Germany. Since he had a certain health condition which made it impossible for him to march for long periods he was not drafted and but free to study and explore. During WWII he even managed to get funding from the NS Government to make an expedition in the Aegean Sea.\n\nAfter the war he wanted to make bigger expeditions and he dreamed of diving with his camera in the Red Sea, which was notorious for its amount of sharks, but also famous for its variety of any creatures. He tried to get money for an expedition by selling the idea of making a feature length film about the whole trip. Since this was never done before the conservative Austrian film companies were reluctant to invest. When he got the green light to do it he had to fulfill one important wish of the distributor. There had to be a girl in the picture! Hass was not very eager to hire a girl for the film but he had no choice. Secretly he thought he would do a few scenes with someone in safe water and keep the real action reserved for him and his pals. But at that time, unknown to him, he already had someone waiting to fill in this role just standing behind him.\n\nA few months before, he had an ad in the newspapers for a secretary. Many girls applied because Hans Hass was a teenage idol with very good looks. His adventures reported and illustrated in a book he wrote had been a hit with boys and girls alike.\n\nLotte Bayerl was one of them and when she read the ad she immediately dreamed of swimming with Hass and the others in the open sea. This was her main reason to apply for the job. When she got it she started to take diving lessons in a public bath without telling Hass.\n\nWhile Hass balked at the outrageous idea of taking &quot;a girl&quot; with him on such a dangerous adventure, the head of distribution looked at Hass&apos; secretary and said: &quot;Why don&apos;t you take her with you?&quot; What Hass did not know was, the she was made of the same kind of wood as he was and she not only got on the boat but made also sure that the film became such a big success. She was quite a beauty and as daredevil as all the others and Hass tried in vain to restrict her to do only harmless scenes. She wanted to prove the she also could swim with sharks, and she did! Afterwards she wrote a very entertaining and touching book on her experiences that became a bestseller. I have read this book while a teenager myself several times.\n\nNeedless to say that Hans Hass soon fell in love with her and the married after the film came out. They became a very famous couple working together ever since. Hass turned 90 this year and Lotte is still by his side.\n\nThe film, looking at it today, has his flaws. I don&apos;t want to deny this. The forced upon storyline is sometimes very crude, no wonder, none of them was a professional filmmaker or an actor or actress. The dialog and the narration too tell how innocent they all were, practically in every respect.\n\nBut on the other hand many scenes are spectacular, even today! You could see how daredevil they all have been, and after so many years you still want to cry out to them and warn them when they just jump into the water when a giant shark appears. Their words and looks and little acting have such a charm and radiate their excitement, so you easily forgive them all the shortcomings.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a real surprise as on a rainy day in the only Chinese cinema left in Sydney, to think i only went into Market city for some yum cha and got a whole lot more than i bargained for.\n\nA fantastic roller-coaster ride of a film, OK so the long slow ride up to the top end of it can be daunting for those with ADD or a high blood sugar level but its sure worth it once you get there. Intense satisfying action shot from every possible angle yet still filled with a spontaneous verite energy unmatched by any Hollywood film i have seen..ever.\n\nIts innovative style while a bit light on plot or dialogue (OK so i am stuck with subtitles which obviously lose something in the translation) overcomes any accusations of pretentiousness that could be leveled at a lot of similar films. The raw energy of the film leaks into every scene however still and explodes onto the screen when the action finally ramps up. Considering the violent nature of the film a lot of the actual killing is suggested rather than replayed in Technicolor from umpteen angles, but we still experience every kick and punch as if it were flying our way.\n\nOK admittedly the story is about as engrossing as 300 or a lot of other HK cop films, IE runs at a primal level deeper than mere plot twists or any complicated subtext. No, its all about the man versus what he sees as injustice and occasionally about a friendship. Mostly though its about the battle for whats right even if thats not quite clear sometimes, by the end you know who the good guys are and as manipulated as you might feel you are rooting for them all the way.\n\nOK I&apos;m running out of superlatives and metaphors now..just go out and watch it if you like a good old school popcorn bash and can handle some underplayed buddy semantics.",

The other thing was I was also into cross country running. i didn&apos;t like doing it but it got me out of the school, I was good at it and the teacher enjoyed my successes. So a bit of a personal one but nothing can take away from the performance Courtney gives and it is clear that there is a seething revolutionary waiting to get out. The scenes on their trip to Skegness when we actually see the wondrous sand dunes and beach of Camber Sands are great and the young love well presented. Probably Richardson&apos;s finest film.",

      "reviewBody": "OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE is probably not well recalled by most people today, but the film is only twenty two years old, and certainly captured a spirit that is rarely seen in American films. For all the so call liberalism of the American cinema, certain aspects of ethnicity are quietly buried. Anti - Semitism was attacked in GENTLEMAN&apos;S AGREEMENT, but the anti-Semitism under scrutiny was a social form (you can&apos;t join certain clubs, you can&apos;t get certain jobs, you can&apos;t register in certain four - star hotels) which is annoying but somewhat bearable compared to European or Middle Eastern versions. Except for one notorious incident (the Leo Frank trial, and lynching) in Georgia in 1915, it is rare that the degree of anti-Semitism in this country has gotten so hot as to make Jews literally fear for their lives. In the case of the Frank affair, the Anti-Defimation League of B&apos;Nai Brith was created. But that was the real highpoint of rabid anti-Semitism going so far.\n\nOne of the misguided ways that Hollywood has acted to reduce the tension is to ignore or make fun of it or concentrate on other side issues. So if we see Jewish lives at home, it is done in a funny manner. For example: in MY FAVORITE YEAR Alan Swann the famous movie star is invited to a Jewish home for dinner, and he is well treated, but the family act like a bunch of clumsy oafs in their reactions to the polished (if drunken) Swann. Most of the time Jews don&apos;t act so stupidly, but not in Hollywood comedies.\n\nOVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE tried to mingle the comic with the dramatic in a study of religious bigotry and financial muscle. Alby Sherman (Elliot Gould) is a coffee shop owner in Brooklyn who has been saving his money and planning to buy a fancy eatery on the east side of Manhattan. To do this he is dependent on the good will of his Uncle Benjamin (Sid Caesar), who has made a good living in the clothing trade. Benjamin is very fond of Alby, looking at him as the son he always wanted (Benjamin has a wife and son, but the son is a smirking non-entity, and certainly not one to have a wife and children). However, Benjamin is very conscious of being Jewish, and he wants Alby to marry a Jewish girl. Alby is currently shacked up with Elizabeth (Margaux Hemingway), who is a &quot;shiksa&quot; (a non-Jewish woman). Ben is not happy about this, and basically lets Alby know that if he wishes to get financial assistance from his uncle he has to drop Elizabeth.\n\nTo his credit Alby does not do so - he tries to find alternatives to going to Ben (even toying with a loan shark). Ben, in the meantime, presumes to meddle further by confronting Elizabeth and asking if she really wants to hurt Alby or sacrifice their love to enable him to succeed. Ben, of course, does not see his meddling in a bad light. He even has a replacement for Elizabeth in mind - Alby&apos;s distant cousin Cheryl (Carol Kane), a schoolteacher who lives with her elderly father, and appears to be demure and quiet.\n\nThe film follows the twists and turns of our hero and his family and Elizabeth. We see a world that Jews are fully aware of, where members of families know each other&apos;s business whether they should or not, and where diplomatic maneuvering is as vital on a small scale as the same maneuvers would be between nation states.\n\nThe film had many funny moments. One I cherish is meek little Cheryl finally cutting loose with the wrong person. Another is when Alby is desperate enough to make a late night phone call from Time Square, turn down the silent request of a derelict for some change, and get a commentary on his generosity he never expected.\n\nBut to me the most interesting part is watching Sid Caesar&apos;s performance. Usually playing comic roles, such as in THE BUSY BODY or in Mel Brooks&apos; SILENT MOVIE, Caesar has always showed how to exaggerate successfully for a laugh. Only he would introduce a drunken woman to a dummy as his friend Matthias Kreplach, the millionaire, in THE BUSY BODY. But here, despite some mild comic touches (his dealing with the Japanese businessmen) most of his performance is serious. In fact, OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE was Caesar&apos;s best straight performance in a motion picture. The scene when he finally collapses and explains why he relied on Alby towards the end of the film was a small marvel, as he literally collapses in tears admitting to decades of personal disappointments.\n\nAside from that the performance of Margaux Hemingway haunts me a little. Made less than a decade after her first film (LIPSTICK) she should have been having a first rate career. In many ways OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE represented the highpoint of her career, as most of the other titles were far more obscure. She seemed to have the world open to her in 1984, and few could tell that it would be over so badly in twelve years.\n\nFor her, the glimpse into Jewish life and real problems, and for Sid Caesar&apos;s best dramatic work, I give OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE a &quot;10&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "After a strange series of attacks, a small-town doctor and his staff find that a military cover-up involving a deadly virus transmitted through venomous snake bites released by a terrorist attack and disturbed by seismic activity forcing them to come together to stop them.\n\nThis here was a decent if decidedly unimpressive offering. Among the few positives here is the fact that there are quite a few scenes with the snakes here that really plays up the advantage of using the real animals. The fact that the scenes involving them are quite fun, from the first scenes of them biting on the civilians and the outbreak that causes the different quick-shot attacks that are carried out in the houses around town which are quite nicely handled in instigating their need for the quarantine. There&apos;s a great deal of these scenes that work throughout here due to the others carrying out the need for the real-sized snakes which has the nice lead-in to the different action scenes in the finale where there are all sorts of big fun to be had with the military ambush tactics and the big ambushes trying to get their plan under control. However, this is all that really works here since this one doesn&apos;t really have a whole lot to really enjoy and has a ton of flaws. Among the biggest ones is the fact that there&apos;s just not a whole lot the film can do with the rating featured here as it really neuters the possibilities for action within here. There&apos;s not a whole lot of vicious or graphic kills throughout here and the most blood shown is in a series of test-tube vials so it really leaves a lot of chances of to the sidelines which makes it feel rather weak. There&apos;s also the films&apos; incredibly weak and obvious low-budget tone here which comes off quite apparent in the final half but is still a big deal throughout here, giving this one the kind of weak-toned and out of control with how it carries out these elements. Along with a distinct lack of action and confined sets, the film&apos;s biggest action scenes here are all stock footage scenes taken from other movies that includes several car chases taken to escape from the authorities and to later escape from the confined area and it containing action scenes and explosions taken from other films that really seems obvious with the change in audio and video quality during these scenes that highlights the pilfering. The film&apos;s last flaw is the fact that the actions could&apos;ve been avoided had the nonsensical cover-up never occurred as everything that happens from the outbreak of the virus to the town quarantine and the snakes getting loose is due to their cover-up of the tests and the snakes being there. These here really hold this down.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence, Language and scenes involving strong suggested child violence.",

It is the best of right on low key performances of all time: if somebody told him that leprosy had just overtaken the island he might have batted one eyelash. Yet no matter how low the key it is never off key. And yes, yes, it has a lot of other things going for it, but nothing like his performance. Somehow the director got the right guy for the job, so much so, that it is impossible to conjure anybody in all Hollywood that could have done so well. Moreover, the movie moves about him so tightly, and he takes the load so effortlessly, it is almost not surprising that nobody has noticed just how good he is here. In fact were there even a smidgen of fireworks from him, this would just be another movie. Time is gonna treat this film very well, when ninety percent of most films are forgotten, this will continue to rise in the ranks of the remembered."

      "reviewBody": "Under mysterious circumstances a strange guy (well played by Trintignant) escapes from some underground asylum. He finds refuge with a couple of fringe people of 68 who seemed to have retired to a tranquil life somwhere in the south of France. The strange visitor revives old dreams and memories and represents new opportunities to make something more out of life. The couple, superbly played by Philippe Noiret and Marlène Jobert, have each their own reasons to be interested and intrigued by the visitor. After a series of sometimes menacing, sometimes hylarious events, always impregnated with a subdued tension, the movie ends somewhere in the emptiness of some isolated beach.\n\nThis is a very good movie. The images and the playing show a lot but also leave a lot to be guessed by the watcher. It makes a point (about Big Brother who is watching you) and is mysterious enough to remain full of tension.",

      "reviewBody": "London to Brighton (2006)\n\nA harrowing story, a real descent into a little sliver of the streetwalking underworld of London and the perils of little rich girls who run away from home. I don&apos;t mean to make light of any of it--the movie pulls no punches, and adds some that go beyond the usual violence, too--but this is one of those recent stories where a terrible situation is imagined, and then filmed with awful realism. The two tracks, the plot with its significance, and the raw, visceral reaction to seeing anything so horrible, are both played out to the max. And acting is really first rate. The bad guys are really sneeringly awful, and the two key females, a full grown but struggling prostitute and a young girl who gets swept up in it all, are so believable it&apos;s scary. And impressive.\n\nAnd none of this is enough for a great movie. It makes for an intense experience, and there&apos;s no rule that says a movie has to be enjoyable (this is totally not enjoyable in the usual sense). But there is little here that reveals or probes, there is little of what you might call art, or nuance, or originality. It&apos;s not exactly a formula, yet, this kind of abuse in your living room, but I think it will be. There are several I&apos;ve seen recently, the one that comes to mind is Julia. In both movies, young children are victims and it&apos;s difficult to really watch without detaching and looking around the living room and reminding yourself this is fiction, these are actors, don&apos;t worry.\n\nTerrible things happen in the world, of course, and worse things. But I&apos;m not sure we need to see them. It&apos;s like becoming an emergency room doctor because you are fascinated with suffering and blood. Movies should be like doctors, then (to stretch the metaphor) and have some purpose to them beyond wallowing. \n\nAnd beyond representation. I think accurate representation is the simple motive behind the filming. The director (in this case with a short resume--I&apos;ve never heard of him) makes it vivid, fast, and very real. In that sense he succeeded. But this realism could have been a means to a greater effect, a higher intention, something that takes the viewer somewhere. Anywhere.",

      "reviewBody": "This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, which is also one of my all time favorite movies.\n\nUnlike &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the &quot;Romeo and Juilet&quot; theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.\n\nThis is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances.\n\nTechnically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits.\n\nMy wife and I don&apos;t always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection.",

Before I saw it, I was one of the many movie going clones who decided not to see it in the theater because it hadn&apos;t been getting the rave reviews that the trailer suggested it should.\n\nSo, my roommate works at a video store. One night, he brings home &quot;What Dreams May Come.&quot; For lack of NOTHING better to do, I pop it in one night when I&apos;m home alone. 113 minutes later I was floored. This was a fantastic movie. At first, I was a bit skeptical. Very little character development creation, and death comes just as the introduction to life begins. Then......it all hits. The absolute best computer animation I&apos;ve ever seen. A plot line that has no obvious holes. A story that has never been addressed on the big screen. A subject that is explored in a way that is both believable and desirable. An incredible movie that leaves you happy, sad, curious, and most of all, drained of energy and exhilarated at the same time. I can&apos;t explain the feeling that this movie gave me, and I bet you can&apos;t explain the after-life any better than &quot;What Dreams May Come,&quot; unless your 3 letter name begins with &quot;G&quot; and ends with &quot;D.&quot; If you have a mind that will allow you to be entertained by something other than a beefy guy blowing things up with an Uzi, see this movie. 10 out of 10 JimmyT-2",

It is a brave, innovative movie with great acting, intelligent, witty plot set in a contemporary setting and fabulous stylish photography. It features controversial themes of today (juvenile crime, alienation, corruption) and realistic, multi-dimensional characters that evolve and grow as the film progresses. Moreover, despite its multiple thread storyline, the plot has an Aristotelian nearly perfect structure that so many contemporary films lack. It is puzzling that it took so long for this film to be released (and it is a very limited release), and even more puzzling that it has been welcomed with such animosity by the professional film critics. It just shows that one cannot trust them when choosing which film to go and see.",

      "reviewBody": "In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can&apos;t praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.\n\nTyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she&apos;s murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.\n\nPower&apos;s solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor&apos;s advice.\n\nThe original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. \n\nMarlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She&apos;s a war bride over from Germany and she&apos;s got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon legal system&apos;s goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.",

Handyman contains a lot of jokes from different sections. Nevertheless it is a very entertaining movie. Unlike most comedies, there isn&apos;t a sequence where you get bored. Very, very recommendable. Marco Rima himself is fun, if you only look at him. for swiss people, and for those who understand the different swiss dialects, it is very nice, that there are a lot of different dialects within this movie. also the special guest DJ Bobo has, very unlikely for him, a funny part in it. Very entertaining, and also very true, the movie shows, that the Germans are a lot different to us swiss people. No offense meant.",

      "reviewBody": "It was not a case of &apos;The Fourth Angel&apos; being doomed from the start. It had a lot of interest points. Although it was hardly a new idea, the story sounded interesting and did really like the sound of the moral issues. The trailer did make me want to see it, and even more so when seeing that John Irvin (who directed a personal favourite the television adaptation of &apos;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&apos;) was director, had one of my favourites Jeremy Irons in the atypical lead role and had an interesting cast. Also do like action/revenge thrillers when done well.\n\n&apos;The Fourth Angel&apos; could have been much better though. It is far from a bad film, it does have its good moments and good points and it does admirably with a difficult subject and moral issues which considering the timing as well is worthy of some credit. When it first started, to me it was actually a good film. Have however seen much better films that cover similar ground and at the end of the day &apos;The Fourth Angel&apos; was rather uneven and somewhat strange as well.\n\nAs said, &apos;The Fourth Angel&apos; did start off very well. There was tension and suspense in the opening and the outcome and aftermath of it are quite poignant. There are some interesting and thoughtfully put across, without being too ham-fisted, moral issues as well and some of the diaogue is thoughtful in the early parts of the film. It looks relatively slick and stylish with great use of locations, and as well as the opening there are some good individual scenes like between Irons and Forrest Whittaker.\n\nCast against type, being more closely associated with upper-class gentlemen with a dark or conflicted side (and one of the best at that), villains and complex real life characters often played with understated intensity, Irons surprisingly excels in the lead role. He is very moving in the early stages and when the character hardens he brings more intensity while not being hammy and never looking out of his depth. Whittaker doesn&apos;t have the best written of characters, a pretty stock role, but somehow Whittaker makes the most of the character and gives him much more thought and tension than one expects. He has some great chemistry with Irons. Jason Priestly, also against type, does smarmy quite well and Charlotte Rampling and Lois Maxwell make for interesting casting.\n\nHowever, once it gets into more action thriller territory &apos;The Fourth Angel&apos; becomes more routine and sometimes confused. The latter stages of the film stretch credibility to breaking point badly and it all becomes very far-fetched. Jack&apos;s grief is completely understandable, as is his want for justice, but can find that when characters go vigilante in films generally that their actions become on the extreme side and that&apos;s the case here. That&apos;s just my thoughts though. The music is a bit too intrusive and doesn&apos;t sound like it belongs in an action/revenge thriller from the early 2000s, more like from 10-15 years earlier.\n\nFelt that the tension dissipates once the film gets increasingly implausible, and the very underdeveloped and non-threatening villains (the characters generally are sketchy, with the sole exception of Jack) and the standard and at times thrill-free action decreases it further. Apart from the climactic moments with Irons and Whittaker, the momentum dips, the direction loses subtlety and the dialogue loses its thoughtfulness and becomes unfocused. Actually felt like two different films.\n\nOverall, watchable but strange and inconsistent. 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Gerhard Richter is an old man who doesn&apos;t like to be interviewed, who doesn&apos;t like to be filmed and who doesn&apos;t like to talk about his paintings. He&apos;s also a very famous German artist and though he obviously couldn&apos;t care less about this film, some clever marketing executive said, hell, we do it anyway, cause he is so damn famous, once this film is out, the middle class intellectuals will flock into the cinema in order to feel sophisticated in the virtual presence of a true artist. Sadly enough, judging by the crowd it attracted when I went so see it, it worked pretty well. My main gripe with this film is that Corinna Belz, who I take to be some TV journalist, has no concept for this full length documentary. Apparently she was under the illusion that it&apos;s enough to just stumble into the studio of such a genius, turn on the camera and then the magic will unfold. Well, sadly enough, it doesn&apos;t. In fact nothing happens and Corinna&apos;s inane off camera questions (How long did it take you?) don&apos;t help either. But then she is not bold enough to concentrate on the one thing that does in fact happen, namely, Gerhard Richter in the process of painting; no, spoiled by television aesthetics the edit never lingers too long on the act itself but feels compelled to jet to New York and London for a more cosmopolitan flair. But whenever I was on the brink of nodding off I was jolted back to attention by archive footage from the sixties where an eloquent and rather angry Richter is talking about his approach towards art. That would have been the proper time to make a documentary like this. Back then when he was still able to express himself coherently, when he was on the peak of his artistic powers, when he wasn&apos;t the weary and rather tired superstar he is now. Another venerable approach would have been to actually tell us something about his art, his significance in todays art world, but no one here has the guts to do so. He created so many great paintings, but this film doesn&apos;t do him any justice. He apparently wants to be left alone in his studio so that he can concentrate on his art. Whatever happened to decorum in the film industry. Just because he is old, doesn&apos;t mean his wishes should be ignored, especially when the resulting film is as nondescript as this."

A famous conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir, and finally find fulfillment in his music. Drawing on Sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small Swedish village, this film develops each of its characters well. superbly directed, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes, and smiles to all. Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States.\n\nIf you can, see it!",

Groucho plays Dr. Hugo Hackenbush, a veterinarian posing as a human doctor to bilk wealthy hypochondriac Margaret Dumont. Their scenes together are priceless, as they always were. Maureen O&apos;Sullivan is perfection in everything and here she brings out a kinder, gentler side of the Marx Bros. Leonard Ceeley is great as Dumbrille&apos;s co-conspirator who runs afoul of the Marxes and lives to regret it. Esther Muir is a riot as a blonde floozy who gets more than she bargained for while trying to seduce Groucho. A terrific Marx Bros. film with many memorable lines and scenes, including &apos;Tutsi Frutsi Ice Cream.&apos; It&apos;s a little long but never dull. The musical numbers were never my favorite parts of the Marx films unless they were comedy songs that were part of the story, as in Animal Crackers or Duck Soup. Here, though, there is a great number called &quot;All God&apos;s Chillun Got Rhythm.&quot; I&apos;m sure it will be controversial to sensitive types today but it&apos;s a lively, upbeat number that always puts a smile on my face. It&apos;s one of the best musical numbers from any of the Marx films and just one of the many reasons I recommend you see this one.",

It&apos;s not much longer than a single episode of any number of television series, and it looks like it was made for about $5. It&apos;s entertaining in that kitschy retro way that films of this genre from this time period always are, but I found myself trying hard and failing to see what was so good about it that it warrants inclusion in a list of culturally significant films.\n\nThe most interesting thing about it to me was that it features the brother of George Sanders in a supporting role.\n\nGrade: C",

      "reviewBody": "In 1920s, a wealthy Texan cattle rancher (Rock Hudson) travels to East Coast in order to buy a prize horse. There he meets a woman (Elizabeth Taylor), the daughter of his soon-to-be business partner, who he ends up marrying after a quick romance. The movie follows their lives down in Texas as the seasons change and the old ways begin to give ground to the new century.\n\nGiant is an epic. It covers years and years of time and deals with all the prominent themes and problems of those decades. Things like oil business, racial issues, societal status, responsibility of the rich to the poor, and so many others, make an appearance and are addressed in turn. Taylor&apos;s character is the voice of the new age, while Hudson&apos;s is the voice of the old and their interactions are the driving voice of the film.\n\nAnd it works. It is a very interesting film to follow if you know anything about that particular span of history. The film is over three hours long, and can thus cover a lot of ground and give each subject its due time. Though that can be a problem as well. It is a very slow film, with deliberate, calm pacing. Nothing much really happens most of the time, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that things happen very slowly. Personally I found the film to be perhaps a bit too slow and deliberate, but if old epics are your thing, you&apos;ll definitely get what you&apos;re looking for.\n\nGiant is to be applauded for its vision. It set out to tell a family saga in its full glory and in that regard it definitely delivers. From modern point of view it can a bit tedious, but I cannot in good faith condemn it for that.",

He&apos;s taken hostage but the cops think that he&apos;s the hostage taker.\n\nJCVD shows some acting chop or he&apos;s tapping into his inner self. It&apos;s so fascinating that he is such a mess. It&apos;s also a mess that isn&apos;t unrealistic. There is a bit of action but that&apos;s not the heart of this movie. It is to watch JCVD break down his public image and then break down his character. The movie could use an A-list actor to be the bad guy as his foil. Nevertheless this is one of the greatest performance from JCVD ever.",

      "reviewBody": "I rather feel the original &quot;review&quot; on the database misses the point of this dark film. The notion that the community is best served by a rigid, inflexible determination to enforce the letter of the law under all circumstances is indeed the view espoused by the film&apos;s main character (played with consummate skill by Burt Lancaster) but the message of the film is surely to point out the limitations of such a view.\n\nTowards the end of the film the Marshall is offered another vision - of a life that contain more than the vendetta, the manhunt, and the inevitable killing that follows. Instead he is tempted by the possibility of a life that offers love, humanity and peace. Unable to change his spots, however, he deliberately throws all that away in a final, senseless act of violence when he shoots in the back a frightened and basically harmless man who is trying to run away - a senseless, brutal and completely unnecessary act of judicial murder. It bears a great resemblance in fact to Harry&apos;s similar cold-blooded and pointless execution of his terrorist fugitive at the end of &quot;Harry&apos;s Game&quot; and similarly to that, its effect is to arouse disgust at the perpetrator and to alienate our sympathies from what we had previously felt was the &quot;right&quot; side, and to question whether it had really been so &quot;right&quot; all along. The purpose, one feels, of this final killing was not because there was any need for it, but simply to demonstrate the Marshall&apos;s defiance of his critics and his determination to continue in the path he had previously followed. \n\nTo my mind the film is an intelligent critique of the whole notion of the missionary self-righteousness of this attitude that can arise among self-appointed guardians of the public good, whose original high standards and pure motives are eroded by the violence and the basic inhumanity of the methods they use until they become - as Burt Lancaster actually states in specific terms during the film - just people who are good at killing other people. Siilar themes were explored earlier in &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) and &quot;Hang &apos;em High&quot; (1968) and later in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992) but the message was best expressed to my mind by Peter Shaffer n his play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; where the young, idealistic but inexperienced squire, Martin, tells his master the conquistador Pizzarro how he feels that a &quot;noble reason&quot; can make the violence of war &quot;glorious&quot;. Pizzarro replies: &quot;Give me one reason that stays noble once you start hacking off limbs in its name&quot;."

Neither Cukor or Hepburn have quite mastered the screen technique. But the talent and charm were there and it&apos;s no wonder Kate had the lengthy career she did.\n\nThough he enters the film when it&apos;s nearly a third over, when John Barrymore comes in, he dominates the proceedings. He&apos;s a shell shocked World War I veteran returning home after years in an asylum. By that time his wife Billie Burke is in love with another man, Paul Cavanaugh, and is ready to serve Barrymore with divorce papers, hence the title.\n\nBarrymore seems cured, but it doesn&apos;t take much to set his fragile psyche out of kilter. What are both Burke and Hepburn to do as it comes out that insanity is prevalent in Barrymore&apos;s family tree?\n\nThough the story is very dated, the power of the performances will keep you interested. Quite a lot is packed into a classic film that has an unusually short running time.",

Von Sternberg shows us that the real triumph of his cinema is not one of the reality it affords, but one of style, of which Dishonored has enough to spare.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching this movie is like watching a car crash in reverse. It begins as a blurred, direction-less, and confused mass of visions and concludes with the climax and falling action occurring in a ten minute span. It&apos;s an hour and fifteen minutes of sex and drugs, until the director remembers that it&apos;s a horror movie and kills almost everyone in a ten minute span. To give a basic plot summary, a group of young women driving through the desert are stalked by a killer &quot;ghost,&quot; who is really just a really tall guy in a poncho. The most frustrating thing about this movie is that you don&apos;t care for the characters, in any way at all. They aren&apos;t likable enough to make you want them to pull through, but aren&apos;t annoying enough to pray for a painful death. All except one particularly foul-mouthed girl, who is thankfully given minimal screen time and an extra bloody death, but I digress. Three of our four heroines seem to have double parked outside the studio, as they indulge in sex, drugs, and advanced stupidity as if they want to die as quickly as possible. Our fourth leading lady is plagued by constant violent visions and confusing flashbacks, including a memorable(for all the wrong reasons) flashback which takes the style of a Charlie Chaplin film, but without any humor or quality. Our evil ghost, channeling the spirit of Michael Myers, walks around in pure silence, the only problem being he is TOO slow and it takes an hour for him to get any serious killing in. Since our villain is traveling with all the speed of molasses in January, the director fills in time with enough bong hits to make Cheech and Chong envious. By the time El Charro actually begins his work, it&apos;s a good bet that you&apos;ll either be asleep or, in my case, toughing it out because you don&apos;t like leaving things unfinished. Either way, you won&apos;t see much.",

The Genetic Opera was a flawed but interesting experiment and his Mother&apos;s Day remake was actually pretty much excellent IMHO. But alasbad movie is bad. Bousman&apos;s directing skils aren&apos;t even the real problem here (the film is shot decently and is at times pretty atmospheric), but near everything else is... There is hardly enough story here to warrant a half hour Twilight Zone segment, let alone a feature film. For an hour, the same things happen over and over again, even going so far that 2 characters have the exact same conversation no less than 3 times. Acting is hammy at best, especially from the lead actor, who&apos;s film-noir detective like voice-over nearly takes the film into the realm of parody. The music is constanty omnious, even when nothing remotely creepy is happening. The finale is actually pretty OK and I actually liked the ending, but the makers damn near give us the resolution of the movie in a powerpoint presentation with the director shouting &quot;See? See what we did there???&quot; I actually had quite some fun watching this, giggling at how bad this all was. And I admit I jumped a few times. Just make sure you don&apos;t go out of your way to see this. It is a deeply silly film."

More comic than horrific, much of the focus is on sexual comedy with a lot of the film taking place in a brothel. Plenty of nudity, very popular in the early 1970&apos;s, horror specialists Hammer themselves were doing this. Pity Hammer didn&apos;t do a straight horror version of this, likewise the Carry On team could have undoubtably made a much funnier movie. Lucky Derren Nesbitt as Burke shares a topless threesome romp with beauties Francoise Pascal and Yutte Strensgaard, and at least his accent sounds Irish. Glynn Edwards was great as Cockney barman Dave in ITV&apos;s &quot;Minder&quot; but is sadly quite poor as Hare, he is among several characters who have very unconvincing accents. It has a few good moments but overall I found this movie rather dull, the 2010 version is far better.",

The characters are so good, and are given all the time and space to develop starting with MariaGrazia. I really can&apos;t think of a movie that&apos;s made with more love and dedication. La Giara is a rare but welcome break and watch how Franchi and Ingrassia interact, watch the beauty of baby Bata&apos;s eyes in Mal di Luna. Just find out all those details and you won&apos;t be disappointed. Having seen Italy after watching KAOS was a feast of recognition, it&apos;s really like that, the villages where time stands still, the people, go and see it and you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

The boys no longer watch wrestling, said they are catching new jokes in it this time around.\n\nThe acting is over the top, and bigger than life but so is wrestling!

Since this person has never seen the hitman in question Eddie decides to go undercover and check it out in detail. Unfortunately, things don&apos;t go as planned and after his partner &quot;Joe Collins&quot; (Gary Basaraba) and Paul Deveneux are ruthlessly murdered, Eddie decides to go to New Orleans and find the man responsible. Of course, what he doesn&apos;t fully understand is that New Orleans is very different than Chicago and the person he is after is much more dangerous than anybody he has ever encountered. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exciting crime-drama which suffered from several highly improbable scenes. But that&apos;s Hollywood for you. Regardless, I thought that both Kim Basinger (as &quot;Michel Duval&quot;) and Richard Gere put on excellent performances and I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",

      "reviewBody": "I actually enjoyed &quot;The Being&quot; for the most part. Obviously it&apos;s awful but isn&apos;t that the point? The basic plot is a small town in Idaho is victimized by a big, blubbering, wet and greasy, reddish-pink blob with one eye. He kills people at random and a determined detective is going to get to the bottom of it. Martin Landau plays a &apos;scientist&apos; who is heading up a toxic waste dump research project who tries at first to stand in the detective&apos;s way, but then conceded that &apos;yes in fact, there is a problem in Pottsville...&apos; Along the way we meet some awful actors and actresses and we are treated to many cheeseball performances and some lame killings. We get a nice view of the monster in the end and it actually is a little creepy. One thing we can say about this flick is that it is never really boring, no; it moves along pretty quickly with a decent amount of action.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;ve seen worse, but I&apos;ve definitely seen better within the genre. The genre of whence I speak being 80&apos;s drive-in trash, I mean what do you want?\n\n5 out of 10, kids.",

      "reviewBody": "I used to like the &quot;jackass&quot; series because the cast included cool people who were doing crazy cool stuff ... all were taking part and sharing the humiliation and pain. They really liked it and enjoyed doing it. I liked watching it ... This movie which tries to ride on the same semi success waves it a totally different thing. The previously young jackass member, BAM, got a bit older and is trying to become JonnyK by building a team and leading a so called exploration mission. The problems start with the BAM character which appears as a really bad person and an nasty human being. There is NO DNA connection to Stivo or the &quot;party boy&quot;. Not sure what went wrong but during the entire movie he&apos;s just molesting and humiliating his gang while actually doing nothing else. This is not fun to watch. After few min&apos; you feel so empathic to those people who really hate this BAM and will do whatever is necessary to get their pay check  the level of abuse is really something new. In addition, there is nothing really interesting there to watch  no story, no crazy things, no cool stuff, nothing !!! Just two abuse stories, one at Finland and one at the states. Bottom line, this is really a sad movie to watch. I truly hope the so called gang made some money out of it, but as it seems, I&apos;m positive that BAM made sure this won&apos;t happen and &quot;sold&quot; them the future upside of becoming famous  with a tattoo to prove it",

The directing, lighting, sound, music, editing, casting, costuming, locations, visual effects, stunts and camera-work were all awful. The writing is especially awful. The TSA must have been awful to let the bad guys on the plane with so many guns. Holding phony airplane steering wheels, shaking them around while pretending to control the plane and clipping the tops of buildings and radio towers while flying at 27,000 feet is awful. The beginning is awful. The climax is awful. And without spoiling the ending, believe me, it&apos;s awful.

      "reviewBody": "The Victim is one of the best Thai horror movies that deserves more attention, recognition and respect. Released by cult label Tartan Asian Extreme, this great movie comes along with several highly intriguing featurettes offering unusual looks behind the scenes. This film deserves to be discovered in depth and to be explored over and over again.\n\nIt convinces with quite a few twists in its meandering plot that should keep viewers intrigued until the very last scene. The locations such as abandoned hospitals, cheap hotel rooms and filthy back alley operating rooms have also been chosen with care and add an ominous atmosphere to the movie. The characters are intriguing as well and the actors and especially actresses really shine in this film. The lead character is a curious but naive young actress with a heart of gold, the movie&apos;s most important victim is an enigmatic beauty pageant with a strong sense of justice and the film&apos;s nemesis is a malignant, obsessive and twisted character whose dreadful traits are gradually unfolded. Further highlights include decent light and sound effects supported by a moody score. The film also involves an interesting marketing strategy as several looks behind the scenes report that the movie crew actually recorded real ghosts while shooting the movie. That idea might sound humorous to Western cineasts but many people in Thailand actually do believe in supernatural events and might therefore think that this film is indeed haunted. This topic certainly offers some food for thought and intriguing discussions.\n\nThe movie itself revolves around young actress Ting who struggles to make ends meet. As she is describing her difficult decision to a family member, she is coincidentally discovered by a police officer who decides to hire her to impersonate different crime victims. It&apos;s actually common in Thailand to re-enact crimes and bring criminals back to the locations of their misdeeds. Ting excels at her new job and even becomes a minor celebrity. Things however take a more sinister turn when she decides to simulate the murder of former Miss Thailand Meen. While police officers believe that she was murdered by her estranged husband whom she wanted to divorce, Ting starts to feel, hear and see supernatural things and believes that the victim is trying to contact her to tell her that the husband is innocent. Ting starts to investigate the murder herself without fully realizing that she is exposing herself to significant dangers. This mysterious case is about to drastically change the lives of Ting and everyone around her.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Victim is a movie that convinces with a twisted plot, features some decent to strong acting performances and oozes with atmosphere. Anyone interested in Asian horror movies and Thai culture should give this underrated movie a fair try. Grab a copy of the Tartan Asia Extreme release and make sure to check out the quirky behind the scenes featurettes as well.",

      "reviewBody": "The Leonard Maltin movie guide describes this World War 2 movie as being &quot;sluggish&quot;. To some degree I would have to agree. Despite the movie taking place on the ocean battlefield, there often seems to be some sort of spark missing, with an almost casual feeling taking place instead. While I&apos;m not looking for Michael Bay speed and edits, more adrenaline should have been injected. The leisurely pace is not the only thing dated. While some of the Oscar-nominated special effects *are* good, there are a few special effects shots that may provoke giggles from modern day audiences. And the ending wraps things up a little suddenly, and may be unsatisfying to some viewers.\n\nFortunately, there is more good than negative stuff. Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine give solid and believable performances. (And there is fun seeing L.Q. Jones and Dean Jones among the supporting players.) And while the movie may be leisurely at times, it doesn&apos;t get to the point of being boring. If you are looking for a submarine warfare movie, you could do worse."

After all, the premise sounded way too predictable to not include an ironic twist that would make the movie at least half enjoyable. To my disappointment, it merely followed through with its paint-by-the-numbers storyline.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for any kind of message, how shallow it might be, look somewhere else. Not even a contrived &quot;women can be powerful&quot; message can be found here since too many circumstantial things happen before and during the final game (I have to be a little vague because I don&apos;t want to spoil anything for those inclined to see this movie).\n\nIt was obvious how the movie tried to go for the typical Hollywood drama without being cheesy and having the feel of being German, i.e. a pretense sense of realism. The skills of the soccer players were held to such a low level that it almost looked ridiculous. I&apos;m a better soccer player than those guys who are supposed to having played soccer for years. However, the film failed even more miserably when the supposed suspense scenes kicked in. Like a train wreck, it was hard to keep your eyes off it since they serve as a text book example for bad filmmaking.\n\nIf you are young, female, and into soccer, you might enjoy this film. If any of these traits don&apos;t apply to you, by all means, stay away.",

      "reviewBody": "One of Dino Risi&apos;s favorite &quot;babies&quot;, &quot;Il Giovedi&quot; is a film that has long been considered inferior in its author&apos;s filmography by most critics. At the time of its release, they viewed it as a letdown, particularly in comparison with &quot;Il sorpasso&quot;. Much less caustic than this recent masterpiece, too soft for the worshipers of Dino-the-slayer- of-the-mediocre&quot;, played by an actor (Walter Chiari) who was no Gassman (but could Gassman really be in ALL of the Italian comedies of the time?), this movie was, in their eyes, a roadway departure to forget. But the perception of the film is in the process of changing. &quot;Il giovedi&quot;, a small gem, now clear of its alleged flaws, is quite rightly being reappraised, more soundly at any rate than four decades ago. Today&apos;s audiences and critics do the right thing by judging it for what it is (the reconquest of his son by a divorced father) rather than for what it is not (a rehash of &quot;Il sorpasso&quot; with a second-hand Gassman lookalike). Which does not mean that &quot;Il Giovedi&quot; is not related to &apos;Il sorpasso&quot; in any way. After all, Dino Risi is an auteur and it should come as no surprise that there are constants in his oeuvre. In &quot;Il giovedi&quot; you will of course meet a voluble macho showoff in company with a younger, more sensible creature (which will be the case again in the excellent &quot;Profumo di donna&quot;); there will be unity of time (the Feast of Assumption in &quot;Il sorpasso&quot;; one Thursday during the school year in &quot;Il Giovedi&quot;) and of place (most of the action unfurls in a sports car in Rome and its region in both films). But &quot;Il giovedi&quot; has its singularities, the main one being that here Mr. Big Mouth, instead of being beyond redemption and paying a high price for his sins like in &quot;Il sorpasso&quot;, is made to experience an epiphany. Which is precisely the main cause for dissatisfaction of those who regard Risi as the &quot;arch monster buster&quot;. Sorry guys but Dino also has a heart (a terrible defect indeed!). Moreover when he displays emotion, he has the knack for doing it with a welcome restraint. Of course a film signed Risi just cannot be a tearjerker, &quot;Il giovedi&quot; is even most of the time cruel to its main character. Nevertheless, unlike in &quot;Il sorpasso&quot;, the characters (a thoughtless father and his son, too mature for his age) evolve and eventually grow close to each other. The surprise is that those diametrically opposed characters gradually discover that their personalities are complementary: the bad boy side in Dino (the character bearing the same name as the director...) appeals to Robertino, who risks missing out on his childhood while his own wisdom may help (who knows?) this good-for-nothing more inclined to lie and to boast than to face up to reality. And even if Robertino&apos;s influence does not basically change his father in the future, this particular Thursday will have been an enchanted break in both their imperfect lives. No, &quot;Il giovedi&quot; is not a cheap &quot;Sorpasso&quot;, it is a different film that plays its own tune. No, Walter Chiari is not the poor man&apos;s Gassman, he is perfect in the role of the father. No, Dino Risi has not become cheesy: you can see this fine mix of cruelty and tenderness on trust. It is worth an hour and a half of your time.",

It&apos;s meant to make the young ones laugh and the adults cringe In embarrassment! I find It rather sad that so many adults have so many bad things to say about a film so obviously not Intended for them! Why would a story about super-toddlers be aimed at a target audience above 13 anyway? This movie Is a laugh and a bit of imagination fun for the little-ones and It does It&apos;s job - the sets and effects are poor because they don&apos;t need to be any better and after all the whole thing Is pretty tongue-In-cheek! Super-hero kids take on the bad guys - what more can pre-teens ask for? The kids liked It and that&apos;s what counts!"

This was a minor trend in the mid/late 1960s TV world, preceding made for cable stuff. (A technology of the future.) It may have been regional, but, I recall several movies of the ilk. Probably, theatrical films that were deemed not worthy of standard distribution. Sold to TV as part of standard film &apos;packages&apos;. Other titles include Dimension 5 with Jeffrey Hunter, and, a few that I can&apos;t recall. Anyway, this is not a review, complaint, or thanks. Just some info."

      "reviewBody": "Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn&apos;t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that  things like that shouldn&apos;t be ignored. I&apos;m reminded of the episode of Michael Moore&apos;s brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it&apos;s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.\n\nJim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that&apos;s seeking to bake the world&apos;s biggest cookie. He&apos;s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.\n\nMorgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman&apos;s massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. There are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in America) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer&apos;s religion. I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. But despite the fact that I don&apos;t believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.\n\nJim Carrey&apos;s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he&apos;s come. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura (both of which I loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it&apos;s amazing how far he&apos;s come. He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.\n\nJennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting Office Space) as Bruce&apos;s girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce&apos;s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn&apos;t really fit with the importance of the film&apos;s meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura&apos;s friend Spike make a cameo appearance. As Stephen King very well knows, it&apos;s always nice to see familiar characters. It&apos;s almost like seeing family again.\n\n Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.\n\n The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where Bruce&apos;s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery&apos;s cooking. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God (who reveals that he&apos;s the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.\n\n Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it&apos;s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Don&apos;t miss this one.",

For those who managed to watch it till the end, it will be definitely disturbing. Photography is amazing. Some disgusting scenes that could have been cut, some great ones that will make you remember your own past.I enjoyed specially Eva&apos;s &quot;Blade Runner style&quot; narration, with all those thoughts about love and the meaning of life. Maybe that&apos;s what the movie is all about, love is the only thing that makes sense in our lives. Anyway, at the end I realized that a movie who brings us such controversial feelings, is a far from being pathetic.",

This is the seventh Thai movie I have ever seen, and by far the best of them all.\n\nI heard a lot about the movie at the time and just had to check it out. I&apos;m not going to spoil the story, although I must say that it is quite smart, with the exception of a few scenes. The ending is somewhat of a puzzle and the road to solving it was very enjoyable indeed. I think everyone who likes movies like &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Ju-on&quot; should check this one out, actually, if you like horror movies that should be enough to check this one out.\n\nI heard that it has a DVD-release and I encourage everyone who likes horror to check it out! I also must warn people. Before I saw it I heard a lot about how amazingly scary and horrifying it is. It wasn&apos;t the most scary thing I ever saw, i must say. But it&apos;s still a good movie.\n\nMy grade is 8 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "I must admit, when I sat down to watch this film, I didn&apos;t expect much; I had seen a few trailers, maybe a TV-spot or two, but that&apos;s it. The only thing I knew about it was that it was a crime-comedy, and that Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton portrayed the leads. I didn&apos;t think it would be so funny and thoroughly entertaining. The idea is somewhat original, though slightly derivative of movies like Bonnie and Clyde. The plot is very good; it details the various bank-robberies of two very different partners in crime. The pace is very good too, though I found parts of the last half hour of film somewhat dragging. The acting is great; Bruce Willis is great as the aggressive and determined robber, Billy Bob Thornton does a great job as the hypochondriac and very nervous robber, and Cate Blanchett gives a great performance as the slightly neurotic hostage who eventually falls in love with both robbers. The characters are well-written and credible. The comedy, crime and drama was well-integrated, and well-done. I didn&apos;t care too much for the romance angle, though, but, for what it&apos;s worth, it&apos;s not a bad one, and definitely not the worst I&apos;ve seen. The actors have great on-screen chemistry, and they are well-casted. I liked the way the story was told; it left you thinking that you were merely following the events leading up to the end, but then, during the last few minutes, there is an excellent twist, which took me entirely by surprise, and made a great ending for a great film. Considering that the film is a PG-13 rated, two-hour long comedy which deals with crime, and has some drama integrated in it, it&apos;s really good. It&apos;s very funny, entertaining, and original. The humor is well-done, rarely falls flat, and mostly works great in the film. I liked that they mostly dodged stereotypes and cliches, instead of wallowing in them, like many other comedies nowadays do. I recommend it to fans of comedies, crime related films and dramas. To a lesser extent, it&apos;s also recommendable to fans of romance. Most general movie fans should also enjoy this, at least to some extent. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no real point in discussing the movie, if that&apos;s what it is. Just because you see moving images when you press play doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a film. There&apos;s money here, you can tell, which makes it even worse. So many daring, imaginative filmmakers out there would love to have had this budget. But no, Boll is given yet another project to insult moviegoers. When Boll makes personal appearances he does get crowds, people just love to have their photo taken with him and get his autograph. I&apos;m personally offended by this practice in that it only encourages him. Truly bad movie making should not be praised or encouraged. There are bad films out there that are fun, we appreciate the effort, especially if the filmmaker was sincere but fell short. But this is just another example of a man&apos;s insistence on his talent, confident in his abilities, arrogant in the face of audience reaction, time after time. I see in the trivia he blames the script. OK. This mess should come with a manual and some sort of medication. Boll is making Zombie Massacre due out in 2010. May God Have Mercy On Our Souls\n\nIf you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it&apos;s in the bargain bin at the video store. If there&apos;s any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you.",

All deliver corny jokes and slapstick, staples of Scandinavian erotic comedy, with elan. Though done with a sensitivity rarely seen in later porn through today, some of the hardcore sex scenes seem rather deadly serious and out of place in the midst of the other typically ridiculous shenanigans. Not much terribly original or worth following, except a couple of &quot;follow the bouncing c___s&quot; ballet sequences in which the men perform naked from the waist down, but for boots, stockings and garters, with women in crotchless pantaloons, and a glory hole scene ,devised by the evil Count to create a situation of mistaken identity to suit his purposes, as the participants are unable to put a face to the corresponding genitalia.\n\nCute enough.",

      "reviewBody": "La Buena Estrella is possibly one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. It tells the tale of Rafael (Antonio Resines), a lonely butcher whose life changes when he saves Marina (Maribel Verdu) from a brutal attack, and falls in love with her. Rafael learns that Marina is a prostitute and is pregnant to her pimp, Daniel (Jordi Molla) who was the guy attacking her. Rafael marries Marina and, with their daughter, attempt to live life as a normal, loving family. Tragically, however, their dreams are shattered when Daniel comes out of prison and comes in search of help.....\n\nI went into this film not really knowing a thing about it, other than that it had been notorious for press screenings during which even the normally hard-hearted film critics had been seen coming out crying. I thought I would be immune to this. I was wrong. I was fine for about the first 3 minutes of the film, spent the rest of the film with a lump in my throat and the occasional runaway tear, and then sobbed uncontrollably for the last 10-15 minutes. At this point, I turned round to see if any of the 100-150 in the hall were staring at me, only to see that they were as bad. When I left the cinema, I asked the usher if audiences always reacted like that. &quot;Every time&quot; came the reply. I went on to see it 7 times at the cinema.\n\nI can&apos;t really explain why it is so sad without giving anything away, but the film is superb. Antonio Resines, a renowned comic actor in Spain, gives a marvellously subtle performance as a profoundly decent human being who just wants to make everyone happy and suffers the consequences, Maribel Verdu succeeds in making you care for her character, even though what she does would probably make her the villain in any other film, whereas Jordi Molla (who lost out on the Goya (Spain&apos;s Oscar) to Resines) gives possibly the most complex performance I have ever seen. The way he veers from terrifying you, making you love him and breaking your heart is breathtaking. Also, the music of Eva Gancedo (very reminiscent of that from Cinema Paradiso) is fragile and poignant, complementing the film perfectly. The film is marvellously directed by Ricardo Franco, who went on to win the Goya that year but tragically died shortly after. If you have a heart and you want its strings to be tugged, it is IMPERATIVE that you see this film.",

Dario Argento&apos;s daughter posing as the female lead doesn&apos;t have any other qualification for her role than an Italian accent and a nice body -- no screen presence, no femme fatale charisma, no &quot;edge&quot; -- and the budget has obviously been someone&apos;s lunch money for a week, but those things alone would not have done too much damage. However, there are some bigger issues with this film.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie there&apos;s way too much singing in the bars, and it&apos;s all bad. I&apos;ve been to karaoke bars where the performers have been significantly more talented. All of them. No kidding. And near the end the movie falls apart, mainly thanks to way too many flashbacks -- they are not of just one or two key scenes, but of umpteen, in a peculiar &quot;here&apos;s the movie again in case you missed it&quot; fashion. They are annoying as such, and as a result you probably lose your focus and, consequently, your grasp of the plot. What you end up having instead of a real movie is a 90 minutes long artsy collection of insubstantial sleazy moving pictures with nudity.\n\nIn short, the first half of the movie does not get your hopes up too high, yet the latter half is disappointing. Kind of an achievement, I suppose. For better or worse, Walken&apos;s cool charisma and Argento&apos;s numerous nude scenes may still keep you awake through the whole thing. 4/10",

Apart from an amazing performance of Jakub Gierszał and Agata Kulesza, you can admire excellent special effects together with well-written dialogs. Even though the idea of animation which is presented in the film may put somebody off, it should be pointed out that it actually fits perfectly well into the picture. &apos;Sala samobójców&apos; shows the rules which are brought to life in modern world and leaves it to the audience to decide whether we should apply them in our own lives.

Also very surprising how it can be so outrageously kind to Columbus since this film was produced at a time when politically correct forces were raking the guy into infamy. I hate to sound like a broken record, but the music was beautiful. Maybe too much so. A inconspicuously second-rate score might have been more appropriate."

I think after that you&apos;d agree that the Mantis wasn&apos;t so bad."

      "name": "Smooth, elegant, dreamy masterpiece by Feuillade. Great remastering.",
      "reviewBody": "After Fantomas, Les Vampires and Judex, Feuillade gave us another masterpiece of poetry, mystery and suspense. Always fascinatingly ridiculous from a logical point of view, but with an unparalleled mastery when it comes to narrating its complicated plots, maximizing tension and fun. Marvelously restored by Gaumont, we can enjoy a jewel of cinema that has remained hidden for 100 years.\n\nTih Minh is of extraordinary smoothness and elegance: in the framing, in the rhythm, in the editing. All the elements of the staging are complemented with absolute security, in a new classicism that is not at odds with the usual suggestive and evocative character of Feuillade&apos;s images.\n\nThe budget is clearly higher than Vampires, here there are complex exterior scenes, luxurious sets and numerous and varied locations. The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting very careful. I don&apos;t know what it is about these French silent films that capture the light with a poetry and a naturalness that would not be seen in later cinema.\n\nThis sophistication is in keeping with the much more serious and traditional theme of Tih Minh, but it detracts from the serial&apos;s groundbreaking and explosive character that Vampires had. Here we move in a safer environment.\n\nAnd we are already very far from the fascinating minimalist style of Fantomás. In 5 years the technique had developed and standardized a lot. That essentiality of Fantomas is lost, and it is gained in baroque lavishness.\n\nThe atmosphere of Fantomas (at least in the first three episodes) was unrepeatable, and that feeling of real threat in each shot is missed, that totally irreverent fascination with evil. Tih Minh is far from the absolute masterpiece that Fantomas was.\n\nBut it is unfair to compare them given the very diverse genre of the two works. Fantomas wasn&apos;t a serial, and it didn&apos;t follow the same rules.\n\nA marked melodramatic element has crept into Tih Minh, now it&apos;s very much about the love story between Tih Minh and Jacques d&apos;Athys with a certain dose of goofiness. A popular comic element has also appeared, complementing the main plot, perfectly integrated and generating very interesting symmetry effects. The problem is that in Tih Minh, as in Vampires, it often fails because of its very lack of humor: Georges Biscot as servant Placido is almost as insufferable as Marcel Lévesque in Vampires. His winks at the camera, stupid grimaces and coarse mimicry, makes him resentful from the first chapter.\n\nEven so, the games of masters and servants, as if taken from a seventeenth-century comedy, give rise to interesting structural functions and amusing symmetries. That comedy classicism of the old regime is even noticeable in the appearance of Sir Frances Grey, an English diplomat, expected since we see that the protagonist&apos;s sister does not have a partner.\n\nIt is true that despite his stupid humiliating comicality, Placido shows cunning and resources far superior to those of his often unimaginative master.\n\nAs for logic, Fantomas had an internal logic, rules which were dreamy, unrealistic, often crazy, but generally followed. Vampires was already an exuberant &quot;anything goes here&quot; that kept our credibility in suspense, without us caring much about it. Tih Minh is again a show that seems to say...if it&apos;s more fun without logic...why do we need logic.\n\nFantomas was a master of crime. Vampires had a strong will for evil and a good network of contacts, but were often clumsy in their decisions and methods. In Tih Minh the wicked are really quite incapable. They seem to be careful not to cause irreversible harm, and their few actual assassination attempts, which take place fairly late in chapters, are elaborate and complicated enough to be sure they will go wrong.\n\nFantomas and Vampires terrorized an entire society, and the police were unable to stop them. Here, surprisingly, the authorities are missing, and everything is reduced to a kind of chess game between good guys and bad guys from two luxurious villas on the blue coast.\n\nBut it&apos;s all hilarious nonsense. We see it with the eyes of a child, amazed by so much beauty, so many unforgettable scenes, enjoying the weaving and unweaving of impossible plots full of abductions, hypnosis, potions, letters with invisible ink, robberies and of course trunks.",

      "reviewBody": "This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it&apos;s also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.\n\nThe movie&apos;s timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you&apos;re not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.\n\nAt one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is on fine form here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. The relationship formed between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley&apos;s characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of &apos;Madness&apos;). \n\nDespite all of this, it&apos;s a rather slow movie. Coupled with the fact it&apos;s just shy of two hours, it&apos;s quite a slog to get to the conclusion.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But it really does drone on for too much at times. Still, a worthwhile watch. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The word most frequently used to describe this film is &quot;charming&quot;. It is a clever analogy of love in various stages of incarnation from &apos;first innocent love&apos; to &apos;new romance&apos; to &apos;desire to settle down&apos; and also &apos;the established couple&apos; kind of love. This is mixed up with some lessons on truth and trust. Nicely acted, cozy settings, no bumps or dry spots. Entertaining. \n\nThe biographies on the actors here on IMDb are all fascinating, especially the sad one about Bobby Driscoll. It talks of a movie contract being canceled likely because of his severe acne. It also tells of his lonely death as a result of years of hard drug abuse. One can only speculate on whether the drug abuse was related to emotional suffering caused by acne.\n\nThis film was made during some transition years for most of the cast. You may recognize academy award nominee, Kurt Kasznar, from his later TV role in the popular Science Fiction series, &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;.",

There are very few Film Noirs with a female lead, &amp; this is one of them. Sheriden does a terrific job as the wife of a man on the run from the police &amp; the mob. Is Ann faithful or faithless? Where&apos;s her husband? Does she care? These are some of the questions raised in the film. Lots of shadows, much of it filmed at night, but there are some sunny scenes. Look for #2 Son as one of the Chinese dancers. The dialog was so tart that it reminded me of `The Big Sleep,&apos; &amp; that&apos;s saying a lot. One big difference between that film &amp; this, is that this film is a lot more easy to comprehend. I actually knew who they were talking about when they referred to `Susie&apos; or `Ferris,&apos; maybe because the number of characters in this movie were few, &amp; their roles were very well defined. Exciting, suspenseful, good sense of humor, very well acted &amp; directed. Too bad it&apos;s hard to find on video &amp; it&apos;s never shown on TV. I rate it 9/10."

      "reviewBody": "Fresh from their exertions in Fritz Lang&apos;s superheated The Big Heat, Glenn Ford and Gloria Grahame (joined by Broderick Crawford) reunite for the director&apos;s recension of Zola&apos;s La Bete Humaine.  This time, the heat is not so explosive, but this film&apos;s dense, acrid smokes smoulders away to the point of choking claustrophobia.  Like Hitchcock&apos;s Strangers on a Train, the film opens with us criss-crossing a maze of railroad tracks, and the locomotives, cars and switching yards are never far away in this tale of abuse, frustration, adultery and homicides (plural) somewhere out in the prairie heartland. Grahame, when bad, is always good, but she&apos;s never been badder or better than here, as the young wife of the violently jealous Broderick Crawford.  Glenn Ford, just mustered out of Korea, gets his brakeman&apos;s job back and chugs right into the middle of this marital discord. Lang tightens the screws slowly and expertly for the full 90 minutes of this midwestern nightmare (the final words of which, unspoken, are: &quot;Trenton makes, the world takes,&quot; read backwards on a railway trestle).  This is a canonical work of film noir, left -- like too many others -- in unviewed obscurity.  It&apos;s every bit the equal of The Big Heat or Scarlet Street.",

      "reviewBody": "Gillian Armstrong&apos;s &apos;Death Defying Acts&apos; is somewhat of a letdown. It tells the fictional story of a poor but beautiful psychic-wannabe and Houdini through her daughter&apos;s point of view. One must be warned that this film is fictional and thus, Pearce&apos;s Houdini does not bear much resemblance to the real one. This one lacks the enigma that made the real Houdini so fascinating. Nor does &apos;Death Defying Acts&apos; stay true to the historical facts. The focus is much more on the psychic aspects (which wasn&apos;t that well explored either). The romance between Houdini and Mary is a little repetitive as it moves back and forth between trust and mistrust and then it becomes confusing. There was something lacking. On the plus side, Timothy Spall, Saoirse Ronan and Catherine Zeta-Jones perform well. The sensual Zeta-Jones does part of a scintillating dance as well. Guy Pearce performs good sometimes but he looks confused in many other scenes. The visuals and cinematography are stunning. The background score is whimsical and pleasing. Overall, it is an average movie that could have been better. One ought not to watch &apos;Death Defying Acts&apos; as a true account but rather try to enjoy it as a work of fiction."

Granted, it&apos;s not the best in the series (hands down to 1 and 2, I&apos;m not sure which is better)and the story focuses mainly around Juni (my least favorite character). The plot for this movie is the toymaker has a new game called Game Over (hence the title), and the main puropes is for him to take over children&apos;s minds. He kidnaps Carmen, and it&apos;s basically up to Juni to save her. Arnold and his friends so could have been left out, or, portrayed by people that can act. The story starts out strong, the action is always there, and other than the fact that the movie is focused on Juni and him alone, that&apos;s probably the only glich that this movie has. Don&apos;t let the 3-d thing get to you, it&apos;s not that hard. However, if one is going to see it, they had better come with an open mind about movie making and special effects."

On the other hand, what comes along as &quot;funny&quot; is often rather serious in reality and so in my opinion, the movie wants or tries to be &quot;lighter&quot; than it actually is. The jokes can be foreseen (clever is something else!) and are sometimes a little forced, plus there is a lot of cliché, so the genre of &quot;kitsch&quot; is perfectly fulfilled. It reminded me a little of the movie &quot;Amelie&quot; which I disliked for similar reasons. There is better french humour, charme and &quot;feel-good-movies&quot; than this.

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie not long after its release in August,1990. It was a rather important and memorable part of my young life:I was getting ready to move off to college(among other things)and was needing a little distraction. Since I fancied myself as a Steve MArtin fanatic(still kinda do),I felt like I HAD to see this. While I would&apos;ve never--not then,probably not now,either--thought this to be anything of great work,it&apos;s still a blissfully wonderful comedy.\n\nYou might be able to take Vincent &quot;Vinnie&quot; Antonelli(Steve Martin,full-tilt commitment to the role)out of organized crime and the big city,but you cannot take the organized crime or big city out of Vinnie,as he frequently goes astray of the law in his witness relocation in a quiet desert community outside of San Diego. The fed assigned him Barney Coopersmith(Rick Moranis,mensch)seems to be woefully unable to keep a leash on his charge,but it&apos;s alright because while Vinnie may not sit still in protective custody,he&apos;s got a big heart for those around him keeping him out of prison. Naturally,while Vinnie may not be always above board about his actions,he&apos;s still pretty good on his word and intentions.\n\nEasy,breezy comedy directed by the late Herbert Ross and penned by Nora Ephron(who seems to be a much better screenwriter than director),it&apos;s a film that is as light as air on a subject not normally broached in this manner(even Analyze This! and its sequel,Analyze That! still had a somewhat heavy air in them,albeit still largely tongue-in-cheek). Credit the deft and intentional script and the intensely likable interplay between Martin and Moranis(not to mention the potential love relationship/tension brought on by Joan Cusack as a divorced mom and zealous local DA)for this fact. \n\nI saw this again recently having bought this on a &quot;Two-fer&quot; disc that was paired with The Man With Two Brains. While I bought the disc primarily to watch THAT film,this add-on was not only a good re-watch(or even,come to think about it,re-re-watch)but brought back a long,pleasant memory or two of film-going.",

      "reviewBody": "Helvetica screened this week at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX where it was very well-received. In a million years it would never have occurred to me to do a documentary on a type font. The film makers somehow came up with the idea of doing a cultural history of the Helvetica font which has become the almost universal default modern font over the past 50 years. Fonts are almost like the air we breathe. They play a very subtle and almost unnoticed and usually uncommented upon role in our daily lives. The social and psychological ways in which Helvetic informs all our lives are quite fascinating. \n\nHelvetica is a humorous film that combines a series of interview clips with a variety of often rather quirky graphic font designers with shot of various street signs and corporate logos. The film provides a great deal of insight into the role of the Helvetica font in shaping Western culture. Helvetica is both entertaining and informative in that it provides great insight into a ubiquitous aspect of modernity about which most of us are completely oblivious. I hope that many people get the opportunity to see this unusual and insightful film, because it opens a fascinating window for better understanding our society. Since versions of Helvetica are also the default font on most computers, many of us type in Helvetica constantly without even realizing it. \n\nAs I walked home from the film, I couldn&apos;t help noticing that many of the street signs in Austin appeared to be in Helvetica.",

I watched the deleted scenes section of the DVD -- it comes with commentary, a feature I have never seen for deleted scenes before. In this section, he talks about how he took out all the &quot;Hungarian road film&quot; aspects, all the romantic scenes, all the buddies-clowning-around improv his actors added. He wanted this to be a dark film, and he has succeeded, but it is also, as he intended, a film about heroes, about the ordinary guy as a hero in a hierarchical world. As such, it is an excellent portrayal of modern-day Hungary, and many other places as well. This is also a very beautiful film -- the photography is stunning. The plot is minimal, so don&apos;t look for much action. But there is lots of fine acting, and some outstanding studies of characters alienated from the modern world.",

      "reviewBody": "In Bigas Lunas&apos; final part of his &apos;Iberian passion trilogy&apos;, The Tit &amp; the Moon is both a refreshingly open foray into the fantasies of the female flesh by a young boy, Tete (Biel Duan) but also one with more of a message.\n\nIn his mind, breast milk means love, as his mother&apos;s maternal affections turn totally to his baby brother. When she breast-feeds him and he nuzzles up and is content and happy - and Tete is not, Tete soon decides that what he needs from Life is a breast all to himself.\n\nOn a silvery, moonlit beach, one night, he prays for such and soon a French couple, a cabaret double act, move in locally and his fascinations and fantasies turn to her. She&apos;s (Mathilda May) a knowing and sexy sort of circus dancer - dark and seductive.\n\nWhilst the film deals openly and slightly naughtily about sex, desire and womanly seduction, it never feels dirty or squalid, though you wouldn&apos;t make it the no. 1 choice to show to your Granny. The humour is earthy and natural, whilst as with the best of European cinema, there&apos;s that hint of fantasy and a heightened, fiery emotion.\n\nThe Tit &amp;... is gentler and less charged than the other two of Luna&apos;s trilogy - arguably Jamon Jamon is better, Goldenballs a bit of a bad mistake and this, with its narration by the young boy, it&apos;s more akin to Cinema Paradiso. It also has a certain charm about it and in some ways, The Tit &amp;... could be my favourite of Lunas&apos; trilogy.",

      "name": "Action-packed but entirely cheap Italian war B-movie",
      "reviewBody": "Italian genre directors found their budgets ever falling throughout the 1980s as the country&apos;s film-making industry went into a decline. Sadly, this meant that for fans of the prolific Italian exploitation films churned out since the late &apos;50s, the quality of the films was always declining and productions started getting few and far between. Indeed in the late &apos;80s and early &apos;90s, barely any movies got released outside of their native country and those that did – for example, KARATE WARRIOR – were hardly worth it in the first place. DAYS OF HELL is a dirt cheap war movie (a genre that briefly flourished in Italy in the wake of America&apos;s Rambo and his friends) that marks a sorry way to end thirty years of solid entertainment and spectacle. Cult director Tonino Ricci – the subject of much criticism throughout the years, but who could usually be relied upon to deliver entertaining B-movie produce – re-teamed some of his cheapest and hardest-working &quot;stars&quot; from the likes of RUSH: THE ASSASSIN and its sequel RAGE and the end result is a curiously uninvolving slice of vintage escapism.\n\nThe action rages constantly as DAYS OF HELL begins to tell its story. A hospital tent in a field is attacked by a shot of a helicopter (this shot is repeated ad infinitum throughout the movie due to budget constraints). Apparently a scientist and his daughter are kidnapped, although the action is so confusingly portrayed that you&apos;re never quite sure of what is going on. The scene shifts to a really crappy set, supposedly in Miami, where the heads of state (a bunch of old, tired-looking guys) recruit a crack team to go into Afghanistan and rescue the two kidnapped hostages. That&apos;s the whole plot set-up. The rest of the film is just one great big long action scene.\n\nThe action comes thick and fast and never lets up. Dozens of enemy jeeps and trucks are blown up and attacked by our heroes. Attacks by angry rebels lead to lots of cliff-top shoot-outs and gun battles through the terrain. The attack on the enemy base is violent and full of death and there are bandana-wearing traitors, a kid who throws grenades at people, and some really cheap special effects work. Sadly none of this is as exciting as it sounds. For a start the budget constraints mean that there isn&apos;t even any room for squib hits. Guys just fall over bloodlessly when shot. Mini trampolines are used at every opportunity to show enemy soldiers flying through the air. Case in point: two radio operators in a room. A grenade is thrown in, blowing one out of one window. Another grenade is thrown in, blowing the other out of the opposite window. There are lots of stunt men used in this film but Ricci is unable to make the action very moving or even exciting, despite the effort put into it. Sure, a good storyline always helps, but I don&apos;t mind watching mindless action if it is done well. Sadly Ricci has neither a good story or any good action, the result is a not very good movie.\n\nBeefcake hero Conrad Nichols (THOR THE CONQUEROR) takes the lead as the muscular commando fighter. Sadly his acting ranges between wooden (any dialogue scene) and overacting (his open-mouthed battle sequences) with no balance in between. He&apos;s more hopeless here than in any other film I&apos;ve watched him in. Thankfully there are a couple of good character actors in support who nearly make the film worthwhile (I say nearly as, unfortunately, their characters are bland they are unable to make much of them). Howard Ross (THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE) is a battle-hardened mercenary with dyed black hair and Werner Pochath (BLOODLUST) plays his usual stereotyped character, a nervous and edgy team member who loses it more often than not.\n\nWatch out for the scenes where characters discuss chemical weapons coming out of Iraq to attack the West. A strangely prophetic line of dialogue in a movie which is in all other respects a waste of time, effort and (little) money. When the setting amounts to a piece of wasteland and a field somewhere in Italy you know you&apos;re in for a bad time. When that same field is used as a dozen different locations you just know that the film is in trouble. Sadly, DAYS OF HELL cannot escape such constraints, making it a film that only really dedicated genre fans might get a kick out of.",

What made this movie interesting for me were all the odd characters the dealer was forced to deal with. That first scene when he runs into the guy in the tooth outfit was damn funny and just set the stage for a wandering and depressing story. I love that kind of stuff. But the main reason I&apos;m writing this is to ask if anyone knows what song was playing during the credits. I would love to know..."

His The Wild Bunch and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia are among my favorite films. His last film, The Osterman Weekend, is something of a mixed bag. On the positive side, it has several good action set pieces that are very reminiscent of the other films I&apos;ve mentioned. Scenes of bullets and arrows flying through the air and a particularly brutal fight scene with a bat filmed in slow-motion remind me of Peckinpah&apos;s glory days. Unfortunately, there&apos;s a plot in there that gets in the way of the fun. I&apos;ve seen The Osterman Weekend twice now and I&apos;m as confused about some of the events in the movie as I was the first time I saw it. I don&apos;t know if it was just Peckinpah being stubborn, but it feels unnecessarily confusing. There are plot points that go nowhere, plot holes big enough to drive the proverbial truck through, and plot twists that don&apos;t work. After a good set-up, the movie simply loses its way. A script that didn&apos;t try so hard to be clever and secretive and some judicious editing might have made The Osterman Weekend a winner.",

Essentially a very primitive early music video of mainly historical interest. Ellington&apos;s recordings from that era abound, so that the film&apos;s main value lies in its serving as a visual document.\n\n The sound is abysmal, the plot corny, and the dancing nothing to dance about. Many of the images are so murky and dim as to be unintelligible. The entire film consists essentially of 3 tableau set pieces, ornamented with some rough camera tricks, too arty by far. The central plot, the dancer&apos;s death, is unconvincing and shrilly melodramatic.\n\n Of note is the derogatory racial stereotyping of the two characters who begin the film by showing up to repossess the Duke&apos;s piano. They are ridiculed for their illiteracy and for how easily they are dissuaded from their duties with a bribe of a bottle of hooch."

It describes an observation relating to plant pollen that he first postulated in 1827.\n\nIn this story, the &quot;particle&quot; is Charlotte, a physician, and the &quot;medium&quot; is the hospital where she works. Charlotte circulates among the patients and selects them at random to engage in sexual encounters at a secret flat that she&apos;s rented. In contrast to her husband, an engineer who is handsome and masculine, her pick-ups are often physically repulsive and weak.\n\nOthers have criticized this film as dull or boring, but I found it engaging in the tradition of films by Yasujiro Ozu, Ingmar Bergman, Alain Resnais, and Agnes Varda. The visuals, especially of the illicit flat, are exquisitely composed and reminiscent of the artist Edward Hopper&apos;s interiors.\n\nExcept for one startling outburst, the film is a quiet psychological study to be savored slowly. The action is often limited to the actor&apos;s expressions and if you&apos;re looking for a fast-paced plot punctuated by lurid sex, then move on.",

      "reviewBody": "I admit I&apos;m a devotee of documentaries. &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; delivers on both substance and emotion. \n\nIt tells the stories of individuals who become negatively affected by so called tort reform laws. It begins with giving the viewer a very detailed study of the famous McDonalds hot coffee lawsuit. We see that McDonalds at that time had over 700 cases of folks being burned by the 180-190 degree coffee served at McDonalds. We see the horrific burns suffered by the woman in the famous case and we understand why this lawsuit was important.\n\nWe see the case of a family dealing with a brain damaged son where the Nebraska law capped their damages so much that they had to go on Medicaid to care for their son. The doctor involved had several previous malpractice cases brought on her. Who ended up paying? The tax payers of Nebraska through Medicaid.\n\nAnd the most heinous case of the woman raped, beaten, and locked in a cargo box by Halliburton&apos;s KBR division in Iraq. Because her contract mandated arbitration, she was not allowed to sue Halliburton in court.\n\nThe film also shows us just how much $$$ is spent by corporate and US Chamber lobbyists to stack state courts with pro-business/tort reform judges. And yes, Karl Rove is a key player in focusing attention on the need for tort reform.\n\nIn one case, Texas, under then Gov George Bush, passes sweeping caps on tort damages claiming that this is significantly reduce health care costs....turns out health care costs continued to skyrocket especially since any savings from these caps were NOT mandated to be used in lowering any costs to providers or insurers. \n\nBottom line....it&apos;s easy to manipulate the masses when big money interests want to control the message. &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; does a very good job of showing how we are told that juries can&apos;t be trusted to hand out punishment to those business interests who wrong and hurt the little guy...and $$$ then buys our politicians or courts to enact tort reform to benefit those in power.\n\nWatch Hot Coffee and learn."

      "reviewBody": "I caught this the other night on a random movie app I downloaded. Being a fan of wrestling, naturally, I had to check this one out. First off, I knew the premise for a movie like this would be ridiculous But I was hoping for funny, at best. I wasn&apos;t wrong. Quickly summarized, it makes Mexico seem unlawful and egocentric. Actually.... Thats not that far from the truth. We still love Mexico though. A chemically and structurally engineered wrestler turns supernaturally powerful as he destroys his opponents to win Mexico a gold medal in the Olympics. Normally this would be a cool sci fi plot, but this is a horror movie. B horror at that. The title alone should establish that. His psyche and his prowess quickly turns him into a killer and is then retired to obscurity where he disappears along with everyone who lived in the town of Sangre de Dios. Again, it really does sound like a cool X Files episode but it&apos;s grindhouse fodder. Enter the stoner group of friends that decide to travel across the nation to film a crappy porno with its director also pulling the main actor job. The dialogue is not expected to win any awards And neither are the actors. They legitimately seem to be having fun with their roles. I actually liked that and gave the movie points for this. It has some funny lines, most notably by Adam Huss who delivers quite a hilarious performance, even as he is.....well you&apos;ll see. The rest were OK and I have to give it up to the filmmakers for giving the hero role to the unusual character. Also gave the movie points for it. Rey Misterio Sr makes the appearance as the baddie here. He shouldn&apos;t be of importance to you unless you&apos;re a hardcore lucha fan. He was actually menacing and gave a few good scares in the film. My last few points are given here. The plot unravels a not that interesting turn of events and the payoff is incredibly misleading as well as weak. The ending may have you believe that the baddie is released out into the world to start a new life or resume his spree. Not really something you want to do unless you plan to make a sequel and considering it is 2016, this movie came out 10 years ago. No sequel seems to be in the works but then again it shouldn&apos;t be. 2006 was a big year for gorefests such as Hatchet, Hostel and Saw. This would be the TV version of those. For what it is and what it offers, it is not that bad. (2003&apos;s S.I.C.K is still KING of the crappy B movie horror wait... D movie horror) If you wanna watch some horror movie at 2am and be amused like I was, watch this but be ready to have some good humor about it because if you don&apos;t.... It&apos;s gonna hurt to watch. Literally.",

      "reviewBody": "Maggie, a film student at University, continuously wakes up with one bad dream after another involving some bearded wacko, which she records about on a tape, so to come up with some sort of screenplay. Her film teacher and fellow peers have organised a all-night film festival at an old theatre, which will be featuring old b-horror movies with the use of interactive gimmicks in the hope of raising enough money to support the film department, after the university cut their funds. While setting everything up, they stumble across an old film known as &quot;The Possessor&quot; and learn from their teacher about its macabre past. This startles Maggie, as the images in the film are the same ones in her dreams. When the fun starts, Maggie is sure that the supposedly dead star/director Lanyard Gates of that film is wandering the theatre.\n\nBad dreams might appear early on, but Mark Herrier / Alan Ormsby&apos;s contributions are a far more pleasant experience in this fashionably inspired parody of gimmicky (think of William Castle) 50&apos;s b-grade horror films interwoven into a silly slasher formula of a film-within-a-film. Since it knows what it is, it plays itself accordingly to the budget and material.\n\nThe enthusiastic concept is freshly staged with plenty of neatly devised novelties, vividly fruitful backdrop and a preposterously far-fetched screenplay streaming with admirable imagination, fruitiness and ingenious twists. However most of the oddball fun is derived from the stylishly correct mocking of the &quot;horrorthon&quot; b-films; &quot;Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Amazing Electrified Man&quot; and &quot;The Stench&quot; and their cinema gimmicks (like the 3-D flying mosquito in &quot;Project-O-Vision&quot;, &quot;Shock-O-Scope.&quot; in the audience seats and releasing bad odours in &quot;Aroma-rama&quot; for the proper experience), which is being screened to the boisterous audience with their smart remarks and in-spirit costumes. Ormsby was the mastermind behind this enjoyably down-pat features with their natural fondness to the era, which I believe outdid the slasher element of the picture.\n\nNow that side of the fragmented story starts off strong, compelling and eerie, but it crashes towards the back-end with contrived, illogical and overblown developments working there way in. But hey that&apos;s part of the parcel and makes this festivity wildly fun. It&apos;s kind of like a melding together of &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with severely likable 80&apos;s camp. There are only few deaths, but they&apos;re done with enough macabre creativity to cover-up the lack of blood and the spongy script delivers on the wit and overall weirdness. Although some on going gags turn out to be less funny.\n\nHerrier&apos;s panache direction is on cue for most part with snappy pacing, atmospheric lighting and the right sense of mood when drilling those moments of tension with the lurking quirkiness. He makes great use of the flamboyant scenery and vintage theatre settings. Expressive make-up / special effects are strikingly crafted to achieve the right effect and the killer looks menacing with there ingenious hobby involving faces. Ronnie Taylor&apos;s understated, polished cinematography works the floor well and Paul J. Zaza&apos;s tingly spooky music score suit&apos;s the film&apos;s light-hearted air. Also the bouncy soundtrack has that reggae/pop touch to it.\n\nLargely shaping up is a likable cast with agreeable performances. The always sweet Jill Schoelen is typically fine in a valiantly airy turn as Maggie and Derek Rydall measures up as the heroine who can&apos;t take a break Mark. But it&apos;s the support roles where the most interest arises with the likes of Tom Villard&apos;s superb performance as an obsessively nutty film student, Tony Roberts&apos; amusing turn as the film teacher, Dee Wallace Stone plays it sincerely as Maggie&apos;s mother and Ray Walston&apos;s avidly effortless cameo as the gimmick man.\n\nThis winsome little low-budget item is a rather solid cheesy comedy/horror/parody effort even with so many uneven distractions inbound. Don&apos;t wait around, get your tickets now if this sounds like your kind of entertainment",

Comandante is not an exception in that aim, and it may approach the viewers to some topics that big media corporations and the military-industrial complex have been boycotting through the years in order to avoid the public to ask their government about some big questions. Stone&apos;s filmography evidences his own interest in the last half of the recent century –the half he was born in and the events, after WW2, that bring the United States to become what we know today–, and the plots that –in his own words– diminished individual freedom and democratic values in &quot;the land of the free and the home of the brave!&quot; Position for which he has often been criticized &quot;for promoting conspiracy theories and alleged historical inaccuracies.&quot; This documentary is an important effort, now that Fidel Castro –one of the 10 most influential politicians of the last century– is probably close to the end of his life. Some analysts have said that the 20th Century will have officially ended after Castro&apos;s death.",

      "reviewBody": "It is interesting to judge what place &apos;O vara de neuitat&apos; (An Unforgettable Summer) plays in the too short cinematography of Lucian Pintilie and to speculate about why he had chosen to make this film in 1994, his second only after the fall of the Communism which had practically silenced for two decades the creative voice of a director who debuted in the 60s and could have become in a different constellation one of the most important creators of the European cinema. While most of his films after 1990 deal either with the Communist era or its repercussions in the process the Romanian call &apos;transition&apos; this film as well as &apos;Tertium non datur&apos; made in 2005 (his last by now) connect with the more remote past of Romania, the first half of the 20th century. Both deal with the actions of the Romanian army beyond the borders of today&apos;s Romania, both happen in remote places, and place the moral dilemma of the Romanian officers in the center of the action.\n\nThere is one more element in the making of this film that is worth mentioning. The film is inspired by a story written in the 50s by a Romanian writer who was then belonging to the Socialist Realism style (but later became a political opponent and a refugee). So here we have Pintilie, the most famous dissident film-maker of Romania picking up a story written in the Communist era - maybe in a demonstrative manner that tells in a most authoritative voice that bridges with the past should not be completely blown-up.\n\n&apos;The Unforgettable Summer&apos; is a anti-war drama on the road open by Kubrick&apos;s &apos;Paths of Glory&apos;. Yet it has also another classical source in the Romanian cinema - Liviu Ciulei&apos;s &apos;Padurea Spanzuratilor&apos;, the first Romanian movie to have won a major prize at the Cannes film festival. Pintilie&apos;s film, with the moral dilemma of the officer hero, making eventually the right decision with the major risk for his career and even life has a lot of similarity in theme and form.\n\nThe cinematographic approach is simple and direct. The film is beautifully filmed, with attention to the detail, and a fluent story telling. Music also playes a role in the narrative structure, the whole action happens between the opening French Can-Can music and the closing &apos;Eine Kleine Nachtmusik&apos; and in the meantime nothing too nice happens. The horror of the violent actions that happen or are suggested to happen on screen is balanced by the innocent view of the child whose story telling leads the action. Here the innocence is also under pressure as in many other films by Pintilie, so is the destiny of principal heroine superbly acted by Kristin Scott Thomas, who together with her partner on screen Claudiu Bleont give life to the couple of heroes. Her actions cannot cut off sufferings or fix evil, they can only postpone by a second the sentences of history. Is it too much, is it too little? The open question is left to the viewer to answer.",

      "reviewBody": "Other than my lifelong love of Christmas, my main reasons for wanting to see &apos;The Christmas Candle&apos; were that the messages appealed to me, they are nice messages and still important and relevant in this day and age, and because of the cast, which is a talented one. Lesley Manville especially and Samantha Barks is an immensely talented performer in acting and singing. Despite liking Susan Boyle&apos;s voice and liking what she stands for, there were doubts as to her acting ability.\n\nWhile not exactly loving &apos;The Christmas Candle&apos;, so much is done right here and do agree (if not as vehemently, and in a way as disrespectfully, as with others) that it does not deserve some of the over-the-top criticism it has garnered. Can understand some of the flaws (as they are there), but then there have been some that can easily pass as straight out weird and nit-picky. Is it perfect? No, not to me. But a big part of me really couldn&apos;t help appreciate the film and what it had to say and its good intentions are present throughout. As said, its good things are a lot and the best of those good things are done extremely well indeed.\n\nShall start with the drawbacks. There are parts that are a bit contrived and others that are too sentimental, with the conclusion being one of the prime examples of the latter (too sappy for my taste). Would have liked some of the messaging delivered with more subtlety in the script at times.\n\nAlthough Boyle does sing angelically, her acting inexperience does show. Compared to the more seasoned actors, she seemed a little stiff but does still do her best.\n\nHowever, &apos;The Christmas Candle&apos; is incredibly well made. The scenery is exquisite and the time and place is remarkably authentically evoked in the production and costume designs. The photography enhances all this beautifully and atmospherically. The quaintness and charm of the setting translates very well here while not making too picture perfect. Also a beauty is the music score, it brings a lump to the throat and often haunting without being too syrupy or over-emphasising the mood.\n\nDespite the script not being perfect, it is well-meaning and doesn&apos;t sound like it doesn&apos;t have any substance to it. It flows quite well too and doesn&apos;t come over as stilted. Again the story has imperfections, but it didn&apos;t come over as dull to me, it was coherently structured and it was moving. The messaging didn&apos;t come over as vague and, while subtlety would have been more welcome perhaps, it is hardly out of date and important in society today in a way if one is not too cynical. The characters engage and one admires and relates to their trials and tribulations and how they go about them. Barks and Hans Mattheson are charming and sincere leads and Manville, Sylvester McCoy and John Hannah are distinguished support, McCoy&apos;s more understated than usual performance stands out.\n\nConcluding, very worthwhile and, while with its drawbacks, deserving of more credit. 7/10",

      "description": " Deep in the heart of the English countryside lies the enchanting village of Gladbury. Legend has it every 25 years an angel visits the village candlemaker and touches a single candle. Whoever lights this candle receives a miracle on Christmas Eve. But in 1890, at the dawn of the electric age, this centuries old legend may come to an end. When David Richmond (Hans Matheson), a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David&apos;s quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow (Samantha Barks). Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle. But when the candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen.",

      "name": "the (superior) model for The Ten Commandments and Curtis&apos; own later Noah&apos;s Ark",
      "reviewBody": "This film shows in form some influence of the United States, apparently at the instance of producer Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky who had visited the US and developed an enthusiasm for the films of Griffith. Kertész, himself, one suspects was more interested in the films of Cecil B. DeMille. In any case, what he does is take the idea of parallel stories from Intolerance, although there is also a clear influence of the equally an influence of the equally but differently complex use of multiple locales from Pastrone&apos;s Cabiria, which allows Kertész to introduce scenes of revolution, war and retribution that do not form any part of the biblical story. These &quot;Syrian&quot; scenes are important because they most closely reflect the 1919 experience in Kertész&apos; native Hungary, where a Romanian army (backed by the West) had invaded to suppress the revolution.\n\nHe then combines this with the alluring idea of a &quot;fantasy&quot; dream-scenario featuring the same actors as in the &quot;real-life&quot; frame-story (a gimmick that DeMille did not originate but which he used particularly effectively in Male and Female in 1918). Interestingly the idea as adapted by Kertész (parallel stories) was then itself borrowed back by DeMille and Jeannie MacPherson for The Ten Commandments (1923) - originally intended as a kind of sketch film with each episode devoted to a commandment - but without the doubling that Kertész had borrowed from them and it was then reused (parallel stories and doubling) by Kertész himself (now Curtiz) shortly after his arrival in the US for Noah&apos;s Ark (1928).\n\nIn fairness Thanhouser had done something rather similar in their interesting and much under-rated version of A Man Without a Country in 1917 where a modern story is parallelled with the original Edward Everett Hale story.\n\nStylistically, on the other hand, as other reviewers have rightly pointed out, with its symbolism, its chiaroscuro and magnificent art nouveau décors, it is much closer to the stylised expressionistic vision to be found in other contemporary German films. This makes it a great deal more powerful as a film (if less grandiose) than either DeMille&apos;s The Ten Commandments or Curtiz&apos; own later Noah&apos;s Ark.\n\nAs satire (both social and political), it is again closer to German models and has far more bite than the later films. Kertész had himself only recently arrived in Austria as a refugee from &apos;the White Terror&quot; that had followed the defeat of the Communist Revolution there in 1919. Although it is not a certain indication of his own political views (he was more than a shade opportunistic by nature), he had made one short film before leaving Hungary (Jön az öcsém) which was quite explicit propaganda on behalf of the Communist regime. Here the association of the cities of the plain with the excesses of capitalism (as they appeared to many in the twenties) has the air of being genuinely felt.\n\nThe sense of a crisis of capitalism was at the heart of both Communist and Fascist movements in Europe. It is a mistake to judge this film entirely by the standards of DeMille and assume that the effect intended is purely one of titillation. The &quot;existential hell&quot; noted by another reviewer is no &quot;mistake&quot;. The situation seen from Europe was a more serious one and he darker tone of many films reflected this."

And he was really good in it - the shoes were too big to fill I reckon.\n\nStill it&apos;s not just the new actors fault - the script itself is quite weak. A shame but it still has some merits.

      "name": "A sharp satire that runs a little too long and takes a bizarre left-turn that will alienate many",
      "reviewBody": "A paean to the proletariat. A pro-union battle cry. An ideological evisceration of late capitalism. A deconstruction of corporate greed and the concomitant commercialisation of self-worth necessary to succeed. A critique of identity politics. An allegory of institutional racism in big business. A lampooning of Silicon Valley bro culture. Sorry to Bother You, the debut feature of writer/director Boots Riley, is all this, and more. Very much in the key of absurdist fiction such as Dino Buzzati&apos;s Il deserto dei Tartari (1940) and Ralph Ellison&apos;s Invisible Man (1952), as well as race-conscious satirical cinema such as Putney Swope (1969) and Watermelon Man (1970), the film draws more direct inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&apos;s Faust (c.1806-1831), Repo Man (1984), and the work of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and, bizarrely, Ken Loach.\n\nA black comedy/Juvenalian satire/science fiction/horror/magic realist/allegorical character study, it&apos;s impossible to classify. Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate milieu, and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labour conditions and race, the film examines labour relations, wage issues, worker solidarity, unionism, mass media, and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships, relationships, and personal integrity. Although it&apos;s a beat or two too long, and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers, the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive, highly confrontational, and extremely funny.\n\nSet in Oakland, California in an &quot;alternate present&quot;, the company WorryFree offers food and lodging in exchange for a lifetime labour contract with no wages, a practice which the Supreme Court has deemed legal and not equivalent to slavery. Standing against WorryFree is the radical group &quot;Left Eye&quot;, who organise protests and vandalise WorryFree&apos;s billboards. Meanwhile, Cash Green (LaKeith Stanfield) is a telemarketer working for RegalView, who, upon the advice of a veteran co-worker (Danny Glover), discovers his &quot;white voice&quot; and rises to the top of the company&apos;s food chain. Gradually, however, he learns that RegalView is selling slave labour to WorryFree. Torn between exposing WorryFree and his substantial earnings, Cash&apos;s dilemma is exacerbated when WorryFree CEO, Steve Lift (a spectacular Armie Hammer) offers him a $1 million a year contract. However, Cash then makes a discovery that changes everything, not just for himself, but potentially for all of humanity.\n\nAt its heart, Sorry to Bother is an anti-corporate, proletarian rally cry, something with which Riley has been engaged for decades as lead vocalist for The Coup and Sweet Sweeper Social Club. However, unlike the recent satire Assassination Nation (2018), Sorry to Bother You is not especially interested in politics per se, certainly not in the explicit sense of films such as Strike (1925), Medium Cool (1969), or Bulworth (1998).\n\nThis is not to say that the film ignores politics completely, rather it approaches the subject obliquely. For example, the country&apos;s most popular TV show, I Got the S--t Kicked Out of Me, involves people being violently assaulted by family and friends and then dunked in a vat of faeces, with Riley providing little to no contextualisation (think It&apos;s Not My Problem! from RoboCop (1987), where Bixby Snyder&apos;s (S.D. Nemeth) catchphrase, &quot;I&apos;d buy that for a dollar&quot;, is used as a one-size-fits-all response to every situation). This mindless consumption of meaningless and morally questionable content indicates the passivity of the masses, their critical faculties either dormant or absent entirely (an inverse verfremdungseffekt, if you will). Clips of the show feature prominently throughout the film, allowing Riley to depict a milieu where popular entertainment has reached an unimaginable low. Another example of a pseudo-political aspect of the film are the ubiquitous billboards and TV commercials advertising WorryFree, suggesting the corruption or co-opting of mass media.\n\nRiley&apos;s focus is very much on economic issues, with a lot of the humour derived from pecuniary-based situations. One of the easiest ways to parse the film is to approach it as a parable about selling out, equal parts polemic and acknowledgement that it&apos;s next to impossible not to sell out in some way. Indeed, the last act of the film explicitly deals with the literal dehumanisation of the workforce (and I do mean &quot;literal&quot;). RegalView and WorryFree exist in an economic system built upon impoverishing the many for the benefit of the few, with Riley attempting to expose the importance of a poverty line for the continued functioning of late capitalism. Within such a system, he suggests, it is exceptionally difficult for African Americans to succeed unless they are willing to code-switch. In this sense, although the concept of &quot;white voice&quot; does have a practical function within the narrative, its most salient characteristic is as an object of allegorical satire, a hyperbolic caricature of what African Americans need to do to survive in the Caucasian bro-culture corporate ranks of Silicon Valley; they must literally relinquish part of the self and pretend to be something Other.\n\nAesthetically, the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry, and, to a lesser extent, Terry Gilliam. An especially interesting aesthetic device, as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest, is how white voice is handled - rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice, Riley instead has the white actors&apos; voices overdubbed; when Cash&apos;s friend Salvador (Jermaine Fowler) first hears Cash&apos;s white voice, he literally tells him &quot;you sound overdubbed&quot;. However, the lip syncing is, presumably intentionally, far from perfect, with the voice not quite aligning with the actors&apos; mouth movements. This throws the scenes &quot;off&quot; ever so slightly, creating an extra layer of surreality, and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is, drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success. The fact that our culture places such value on &quot;correct&quot; intonation is, in and of itself, absurd, like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has, and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor, Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity.\n\nThe film&apos;s other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully) into the living room of the people he calls, desk and all. Obviously, this draws attention to the level of intrusion with which most people greet telemarketers, but, at least in the early stages, it also highlights Cash&apos;s own discomfit at being the intruder, seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex. This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand, conveying Cash&apos;s internal process, without having him verbalise it at any point.\n\nAlso impressive is the acting. While the standout performances are definitely Hammer and Omari Hardwick (playing Mr. _______, Cash&apos;s superior at WorryFree), Stanfield certainly holds his own, with his body-language providing a clinic of wordless performing. Early on in the film, he&apos;s hunched over and put-upon, his every movement seemingly uncomfortable, as if ill at ease in his own skin. Later on, however, after his promotion at RegalView, his physicality acquires a more easy nature, he carries himself more confidently, as if high-powered telemarketing has helped him to find himself, something which is, in the context of the whole, doubly ironic. And no matter how surreal things get (and trust me, they get very, very surreal), the cast keep everything grounded, as if what they&apos;re experiencing at any given moment is the most natural thing in the world.\n\nOf course, it isn&apos;t all perfect. The wildly unexpected plot twist at the end of the second act will be too much for some people (there were multiple walk-outs at the screening I attended). The film is also just a beat or two too long, and the bottom does fall out to an extent before it reaches its madcap dénouement. There&apos;s also a mid-credit scene that serves as a kind of epilogue that I&apos;m led to believe was a re-shoot when test audiences found the initial ending too abrupt. For me, however, it doesn&apos;t entirely work, and I would have much preferred the original, somewhat darker, ending. Also, with so much satire and humour floating about, almost by definition, not every joke lands, However, the flip side to this is that when Riley&apos;s humour does hit the target, it&apos;s sublime - Mr. _______ literally beep-denied a name, for example, or Cash&apos;s two-word rap being gleefully cheered by Lift&apos;s assembled yuppies.\n\nSorry to Bother You is as timely and relevant as it is funny and irreverent, as progressive as it is radical, and as inventive as it is confident. Exploring the intersection between race and economics from a wholly satirical point-of-view, the film both condemns and sympathises with those who choose to sell-out in some way so as to climb the ladder of success. Now in his late-40s, Riley is a veteran political protestor, a Chomsky-literate agitator, who is here positing that the most significant divide in the US isn&apos;t between white and black, it&apos;s between those with money and those without. Suggesting that the desire to cross this divide can lead to a herd mentality, the film argues that the labour force must never forget their collective strength, and must never turn on one another, as in such a situation, management will use workers like horses.",

Without taking away from the great directing Theodore Bafaloukos did, this movie almost makes itself! Show me a movie with realer characters and I&apos;ll argue you with you day and night, seen?

      "reviewBody": "Ever since the epic film version of the first two books of writer Väinö Linna&apos;s North Star trilogy was released in 1968, filmgoing audiences had been waiting for a conclusion for the saga of the Koskela family. While Akseli and Elina, the movie adaptation of the final book in the series, is not as long and massive as the first film, it is a very worthy ending for director Edvin Laine&apos;s huge project of bringing the legendary books to life on the silver screen.\n\nThe story picks up right where the first film ended. Civil War veteran Akseli Koskela (Aarno Sulkanen) has been pardoned and released from the prison camp, and he immediately returns to his family in Pentinkulma. His wife Elina (Ulla Eklund) and parents Jussi and Alma (Risto Taulo and Anja Pohjola) welcome him warmly, but the traumatic war still casts a shadow over the community; Red anger is still bubbling under the surface of many working class locals and Akseli is haunted by war memories. After having won the Civil War, the Whites have developed an even stronger sense of patriotism and anti-Socialism, which is personified in the characters of the new school teacher Rautajärvi (Ilkka Keltanen) and Pastor Salpakari&apos;s wife Ellen (Rose-Marie Precht). The Pastor himself (Matti Ranin) still prefers to stay calm and not get too closely involved in worldly conflicts. The tension between the classes escalates in assaults by the Lapua Movement, but when international politics lead the country into the second World War, old grudges are moved aside when supporters of both causes start receiving sad news about their sons on the front.\n\nJust like the previous film saw the change of generation from Jussi to his son, in the sequel Akseli prepares for leaving his estate to his three sons, but the War puts his plans on ice. The ultimate fate of the eldest son Vilho Koskela (Ismo Vehkakoski) is more closely examined in The Unknown Soldier, but here we get to learn more about his life before the war. Still, even with the three sons of the family being away from home, the kin of Akseli and Elina is not coming to an end as their daughter Kaarina (Sini Sinervirta) is getting married – life goes on in the midst of tragedies too.\n\nDespite the epic proportions of the story, at points Akseli and Elina is lighter in tone, there are even outright comedic scenes that were less pronounced in the first film. On the other hand, the grand battle scenes of the Winter War and Continuation War are no less impressive than the Civil War combats we saw earlier. The assets of the first film are present in the sequel as well: the colourful cinematography still looks wonderful, the performances by the lead actors are all natural and the beautiful music sounds even better this time around, especially the eponymous waltz by Heikki Aaltoila that has understandably become one of Finland&apos;s most popular wedding waltzes in real life too.\n\nHowever, there are some minor details that are not quite masterly handled. For example, the make-up used to make the actors look older is not completely convincing, as the wrinkles and marks of hard life cannot be imitated with gray hair dyes. Still, the actors do generally a good job at portraying the older, more tired versions of their characters; using different actors for different ages could have been much more awkward. The only exception would be Sini Sinervirta&apos;s acting as Kaarina, which I feel is not on par with the charismatic big names in the other roles.\n\nAt the end of the day, Akseli and Elina is warmly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the first film, Here Beneath the North Star. The ending of the family saga is powerful and leaves the audience feeling both hopeful and melancholic. If the original film offered a look into the Civil War from a Red point of view, the sequel examines the effects of the World War on the home front more than on the actual battlefields. Still, in the core of everything there is always family – a message still relevant in modern times when the past wars are beginning to fade from people&apos;s memories.",

      "reviewBody": "Peter Timm is specialist for the German reunion. Go, Trabi Go` shows, how a Saxon family conquers the western paradise. Now, the circle of life close. The hero of his latest piece is an failed victim from 1990.\n\nIn both movies, Timm hand out good-timed jokes and sideswipes to the society at the beginning, for example the culture clash of Bavarian and Saxon or the exciting life of an travelling salesman. A fast start, but then ? Boredom and a lot of misfires. The portrayal of the east-German habitants should be near by reality and satirical at the same moment. This mixture is underdone and heavily digestible. It weaves, as if someone want to amuse about losers from East-Germany, and this was surely not the intention of Timm.\n\nThe story of Lohbeck, who get a chance and use it (simple moral: everyone should have the possibility to fulfill his dreams) is mostly predictable, phlegmatic and, not interesting. But: main actor Götz Schubert impress. He plays Lohbeck so slowly, nostalgic AND convincing, that you think, he is this character. Probably the first goal of all Actors.\n\nThe underlaid music and the singing comedian Bastian Pastewka create a little bit variation,  but that&apos;s all. Script and idea of the movie are the deciding drawbacks. Because, if it follows his satirical attempts or some British models, it could have been a good one. `Billy Elliot`, `Trainspotting`, `The Full Monty&apos;` or &quot;Brassed off` have shown, how you combine social critic, individual destinies and humor on a entertaining and intelligent way.",

      "reviewBody": "In between his time with Paramount and MGM, William Powell did a two year stint at Warner Brothers where I don&apos;t think Jack and his brothers ever quite knew what to do with him. His films there, vary in quality, but the best of them is this doomed romance with Kay Francis, One Way Passage. The title itself tells how poignant this film will be.\n\nPowell is a fugitive who is tracked down and brought aboard ship in handcuffs by San Francisco Detective Warren Hymer. Powell escaped while being transported to San Quentin to be hung for murder. At the same time good time party girl Kay Francis is traveling home essentially to die. Unsaid at the time because the audience knew what the effects of bootleg liquor were on some people from the Roaring Twenties. Her organs are generally failing and she&apos;s coming home to die.\n\nThese two people are as poignant a pair of lovers as has ever been brought to the screen. Neither knows about the other and the aura of heartbreak just permeates One Way Passage. It&apos;s a cosmic joke played on them, both finding in each other a reason to live and both knowing it can&apos;t be.\n\nWarren Hymer plays it a great deal straighter than he normally does. He&apos;s not the brightest cop in the world, but he&apos;s a far from the dim witted hooligans he usually is cast. Aline McMahon and Frank McHugh are a pair of confidence workers who both team up to help the doomed Powell and Francis. McHugh repeated his own role in the remake of One Way Passage from 1940, Till We Meet Again.\n\nThe most cynical heart will melt in seeing One Way Passage.",

She definitely has that certain something that drives the boys wild &amp; the girls too. A cute, very cute movie."

      "reviewBody": "A family film .. yes but certainly one that can be watched and watched again without the need for a licensing child. Jeff Daniels is superb as an eccentric father who takes on board his daughter after his estranged wife&apos;s death in a car accident. A strong supporting cast (including geese) are driven to support Amy&apos;s desire to assist a bunch of orphaned geese to maintain a wild existence. This involves teaching the geese to fly and leading them South by air. This journey for both the daughter coping with grief after the loss of her mother, the father in discovering his daughter once more and the geese in finding a new home for the Winter adds up to .. well tears and more tears.\n\nBefore you write this film off as &quot;fantasy&quot; take the time to watch the BBC&apos;s Life of Birds final part. There you meet a remarkable farmer from the US who is using a microlite to aid a few of the last remaining Whooping Cranes to re-establish migratory patterns.\n\nIn the UK the site of skeins of wild geese migrating in Winter form their Summer homes in Iceland and the Arctic circle is one of the last great wildlife dramas left on this small island. The views in Fly away Home of Amy&apos;s geese as they move in to join the hundreds of wild geese powering South capture this majesty. This story of a group of people who care about and assist this natural pattern may help reinforce some of the awe that we should all feel when confronted with these epic and annual journeys.",

This is an oblique reference to the Neutron Bomb, the development of which was fostered by the Reagan administration. The Neutron Bomb is a tactical weapon primarily intended to kill soldiers who are protected by armor. This was naturally a MAJOR thorn in the eye of the Soviets, and therefore this movie was made. The original Jules Verne&apos;s book provided a fitting story the Czechoslovakian media censors of the time found useful.\n\nThe original book by Jules Verne tells a similar story from a different angle. It is set at the turn of the 19th century in the U.S. state of Oregon and tells a story of two fictional cities: one French and one German. The German city (Steel City or Stahlstadt) is one big factory producing the best steel and military machinery, and is rumored to be developing a secret weapon. On the other hand, the neighboring French city is depicted as the poster child of peacefulness. Clearly, this is Verne&apos;s take on the German unification under Bismarck following France&apos;s defeat in 1871, and the consequent German military buildup leading to World War I.\n\nI saw this movie in the 1980s and remember that it had great sets and good acting.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the greatest of the early talkies Applause was also the debut feature of Rouben Mamoulian, whose later successes include the celebrated Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde (1931) starring Frederic March, one of Garbo&apos;s finest vehicles Queen Christina (1933), as well as the groundbreaking Technicolor production Becky Sharp (1935). Lured into cinema after great success in theatre, like Welles later on Mamoulian found out how to make films in a crash course partly of his own devising: by absorbing the process at studios in New York, resolutely watching the work of others until he &quot;learned what not to do.&quot; Hired ostensibly as a stage expert on dialogue to help make the most of the new sound medium, Mamoulian, again like the future Welles, quickly proved himself an all-round innovator, looking at production with fresh eyes with an ability to reinvent aspects of cinema as he found them. &quot;All I could think of was the marvellous things one could do with the camera and the exciting new potentials of sound recording,&quot; he said.\n\nApplause was the result - a film which still astonishes us today, let alone those who saw it for the first time 80 years ago when sound had made considerable attack on the creative freedom previously taken for granted by silent films. \n\nMamoulian&apos;s choice of subject matter for his first feature initially seemed to promise little that was striking: a somewhat hoary old novel about a fading burlesque queen sacrificing herself for her daughter, which promised much melodramatic moralising. But the fledgling director was to prove not so much interested in the story as in the way he could find of telling it, invigorating the material.\n\nMamoulian&apos;s practical experience of film-making was gained largely by sitting on the sidelines at Paramount&apos;s New York studios. His theoretical inspiration may one suspects, but cannot prove, have been inspired elsewhere: notably the expressive use of fluid cinematography shown in Murnau&apos;s great American opus Sunrise, made and released to huge industry interest just a few short years before. Indeed, Mamoulian was later to use the great German&apos;s director of photography when he later came to make Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde. In Applause we find moments of expressionism mingled with lyricism with which the German would find himself at home. Like Murnau, Mamoulian too set out to tell his story primarily through the movement of his camera, adding to this some striking location work. The earlier director was not constrained by the mechanics of soundtrack; where Mamoulian took a step forward was in the way he insisted that few of the limitations of the new format since then were necessary, a fact shown by the fact many of his experiments in Applause have become common film language.\n\nThis approach becomes apparent right from the opening scene, where the thought is more more in terms of travel than of sound: first a few shots of a closed shop front, then a track along a newspaper-blown street. A small dog is rescued from the litter by a girl, before a brass band introduces her and us to the arrival of the burlesque queen, Kitty Darling (Helen Morgan), and her progress in an open carriage. The film cuts to inside her theatre, tracks steadily past musicians in the pit, pans back and forth over the dancing bodies on stage before finally resting on the tired faces of the chorus girls. Mamoulian&apos;s concern with the &quot;delight of movement&quot; as he put it, is everywhere. Such concerns brought technical considerations for the sound men that were at first considered impossible. One later scene in particular brought on a significant crisis, where Kitty sings a burlesque song to her daughter by way of lullaby as the child simultaneously whispers her prayers (this in a long single take). The primitive microphone picked up one and not the other, so the director suggested using two mics, and mixing it together later. From such guileless innovations are revolutions made; after some strenuous initial doubts, the studio heads gave Mamoulian carte blanche to continue the film just as he sought fit.\n\nApplause is one of those movies where virtually every scene demands attention for the interested viewer, either by virtue of Mamoulian&apos;s skill or, in the case of Helen Morgan, through an especially moving performance. The director had filled his cast with those who were as new to the medium of film as he was. Some, like Fuller Mellish, playing the city slicker, as well as Jack Cameron (Kitty&apos;s predacious beau) overplay slightly in that 1930s wiseacre fashion distracting to modern taste - one of the film&apos;s few weaknesses - but Morgan&apos;s pathetic dignity more than compensates for this and edges the melodrama onward into tragedy. Even the doomed, blossoming romance between Kitty&apos;s daughter April (Joan Peters) and her sailor, although somewhat hackneyed in expression, becomes acceptable in the hands of such a sensitive director who to their scenes together, as critic Tom Milne noted, &quot;brings a simple lyricism which is neither faux nor naïf&quot;. A particularly fine moment is provided by the lovers&apos; subway platform farewell shot, again in long take. The two have been forced apart by ironic circumstance but he does not know why. April&apos;s lover has little say in his despondency but, almost absent-mindedly, buys and pushes a cheap packet of gum from a machine into her hand as a leaving present. Another director would have made this pathetic action trite; Mamoulian makes it say everything there is to say about a closing relationship between two people, where something so slight can be so precious.\n\nIt would have been too easy to produce a first work that showed off for its own account. But Applause remains so compulsive because it succeeds both as an empathetic story of people and as a technical tour-de-force, without one overbalancing the other. It is also exhilarating as it shows how imagination and creative determination liberated film even at this early stage, from self-imposed limitations.",

      "reviewBody": "And I&apos;ll tell you why. It&apos;s not because of the dubbing (it&apos;s a foreign film and once you accept that, you can look past it). It&apos;s not because of the budget (it was 1956). It&apos;s because the film was horribly miscast &amp; had a horrible script. If their intention was to be faithful, then they left out a lot of crucial parts and really messed up Esmeralda&apos;s character. For a tragic story, this movie is way too colorful. The ironic thing is that some of the previous and subsequent film versions, that sugar coated this story, look darker. Anthony Quinn; a good actor, so what happened? Why does Quasimodo look nothing like how he is described in the book? He played Quasimodo like a mutant ape man, who&apos;s hardly deformed, and not even hunched over, nor does he have a hump. Well he does have a hump (if one could call it that). But the fact of the matter is, he still looks like Anthony Quinn. Chaney, Laughton, Hopkins, &amp; Patinkin were all unrecognizable. There was also no big dramatic reveal of him in Quasimodo costume. Gina Lollibrigida; I thought Esmeralda was supposed to be a 16 year old virgin French girl, that was kidnapped, and raised by gypsies? In this film, she looks like a 36 year old tavern wench. She over acts, and some of the dancing sequences are embarrassingly bad. They&apos;re long, her singing voice is almost of a baritone quality, she sings too low and out of her range, and, for a short moment, she stops dancing, laughs at the crowd, and then goes back to dancing. What the f*** was that? Another sequence that really irritated me (and wasn&apos;t even in the book) was when she first spots Quasimodo (not afraid of his features mind you, but later in the bell tower she is?) points out to the crowd and says, &quot;Look! Look at his ugly face?&quot; In order to crown him king of fools. Alain Cuny; Now, Victor Hugo had a knack for writing really great villains. In the novel Frollo was such a beautifully written, multi-facet character. Alain Cuny ALWAYS has the same expressionless look on his face, and not once do we ever get the scene where Frollo pours his heart out to Esmeralda in the dungeon, that scene (which is in the book) defines Frollo&apos;s character and makes the viewer able to understand and sympathize with him. But again, Cuny ALWAYS has the same stone look on his face. Even Vampira in &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; had at least one different expression. No, not Cuny. All he does is just mope around. Derek Jacobi nailed it when he played Frollo, Richard Harris almost got it, and with Sir Cedrick Hardwick, you could tell that occasionally he would be troubled by his conscious, it was in his eyes and in his delivery. This Frollo is more like a grouchy kid in a playground who doesn&apos;t want to talk to any of the other kids. And what&apos;s worse, they changed his character to an Alchemist and nothing more. And even then, what is an Alchemist doing inside Notre-Dame? If he&apos;s not serving the church in anyway, why is he there? When the character is changed to a judge, at least it is a suitable and cautious change. When it&apos;s priest, it&apos;s faithful. But what is he in this version? And why does Frollo spread his arms out, and &quot;let&quot; Quasimodo through him over the cathedral? The actor playing Gringoire contributes a lot of embarrassing moments by injecting a lot of unneeded, and inappropriate, slapstick humor and over acting. The actor playing Clopin; doesn&apos;t display any kind of leadership skills. He&apos;s such a scrawny looking thing that one wonders, how did he become a leader of cutthroats. I always imagined Clopin to be a little more tough and intimidating looking. It&apos;s as if they cast Paul from the &quot;Wonder Years&quot; to play the king of thieves. The actor playing Phoebus was too sympathetic and not so much a &quot;player&quot; or &quot;womanizer&quot; as he was in the novel, or the 1939 &amp; 82 versions. Now for the direction: The big scenes, such as the flogging, the trial, the rescue from the gallows, and the storming of the cathedral, were all executed very poorly. The more action oriented scenes were very slow paced and did not have any sort of dramatic music resulting in some very non-rousing sequences. In every film version, including the silent one, you either want to cry or feel very sorry for Quasimodo when he is flogged. This is the only version where I could not express any kind of emotion. And I&apos;ve seen them all, even the bad ones. Not once do you ever feel sorry for Quasimodo in this film. The only scene that even comes close is when he hits his head on &quot;Big Marie&quot; after he&apos;s scared Esmeralda (who wasn&apos;t scared of him earlier in the film). Why didn&apos;t they use dialog from the book like so many other versions? The ending is the only thing in this film&apos;s defense. But... Even the ending was poorly executed. If you ever read the book, you either want to burst into tears or just kill yourself. Here, for some strange reason, you don&apos;t feel anything, and Esmeralda&apos;s death happens a little too quick and you become unaffected by her demise. And even then, they changed the way how she died and eliminated a very important character, as well as eliminating any mention of Esmeralda&apos;s real background. Should you avoid this at all costs? To me, this film did not &quot;feel&quot; like &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (aka &quot;Notre-Dame De Paris&quot;). But it should be viewed at least once, to see how bad it is."

      "reviewBody": "Nami&apos;s is creating a video game with the images from her dreams. While visiting her estrange father&apos;s abandoned house that was inherited to her along with her workmate/ex-boyfriend Kohei, she discovers the dreams that she has seem to match that of the house and some hidden secrets too. It&apos;s basically a mystery/horror film about a creepy house and its dark secrets.\n\nThis was one really SLOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW film, with nothing really exciting happening at all actually to be honest nothing much did happen. Though you might say it was slowly building up the psychological terror that was about to come- but towards the end it turns into somewhat of a bloodbath of graphic images that doesn&apos;t really gel. All it was about was two teenagers wondering around a dark creepy house and Nami discovering secrets about her family it&apos;s too bad because it came across as very atmospheric- but it was really tedious sitting through this drag-fest. \n\nThe film looked great- but that&apos;s it, I had trouble trying not to fall asleep, as there was nothing engaging and mysterious about the story and characters. The plot doesn&apos;t make much sense at all, it was truly incoherent and all over the place as one scene slowly dragged onto the next without any real urgency, then you get a twist that you see coming- but then it would twist back on itself and your left scratching your head fancy that? But this final twist lacks logic, as it&apos;s not fully explained and therefore is ridiculously laughable.\n\nWhat I can&apos;t knock is the sinister and chilling atmosphere, with a misty house that is truly atmospheric and unnerving, especially the paintings on the walls, the menacing shadows, dim lighting and dark corners. The colours stood out as well and become somewhat of an impact, very bleak and depressing colourings of greys, browns and black, created a real emptiness. The flashy camera-work (something you would associate with Sam Rami) is quite out there and very arty at first- but it was over-used to a point that it became real choppy and distracting, because at times you couldn&apos;t tell what was actually happening. \n\nThe performances were the same as the plot, really flat and uninspiring. That&apos;s because they&apos;re given nothing to work with and they don&apos;t do anything of any interest. Therefore who cares!!! \n\nWhen the outlandishly grim conclusion happens and we start learning where the film is actually going, you couldn&apos;t really give a toss, as you were bored to death waiting for an hour for something good to happen. Instead for that hour we get look at dark rooms and more rooms, in many different stylish ways- but then something actually happens and it picks up in the last 15mins, though people might have given up already and I wished I did. To make matters worse the film ends with a very absurd and unsatisfying conclusion *Shaking head*.\n\nLike some fellow users have typed, the film does play out like a video game. Though I admit I&apos;m no video game fanatic- but the problem is it&apos;s like your watching somebody else playing the game, which isn&apos;t that fun... I rather be playing it!\n\nJust expect to see the usual harrowing images, a creepy house with spooky noises and things lurking. Oh don&apos;t forget an evil looking girl with long black hair in a white dress. I bet you didn&apos;t see that coming. \n\nLooks visually good, but this yawner lacks punch as nothing much happens!\n\n1/5",

Will you be able to find out the answer if you watch Gemini? Maybe not!\n\nIt&apos;s stylish and atmospheric enough in any event, and it helps that it doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome as well.\n\nOne part of Gemini I really loved though was the music. It was done by someone named Chu Ishikawa, who I looked up and it seems he collaborated with Shin&apos;ya Tsukamoto numerous times as composer, but sadly passed away when he was still quite young in 2017 (RIP).",

      "reviewBody": "This is a great movie with alot of violence.  Throughout the movie there are long stretches of Danila making explosives, sawing off a shot gun, and fashioning weapons, with Nau music playing.  The rest of the movie consists mainly of him using these weapons at his job as a hitman.  Make no mistake, there is depth to this film.  It is more than an excuse to show violence.\n\nDanila is an interesting character.  At the ame time he blows away people regularly with no remorse and little thought.  Its his job, may as well do it well.\n\n I watched this as part of a film series at college in the original Russian, and the group of Russians sitting behind me laughed at many points.  The laughter confused me a bit, but the second time I saw it was pretty funny, and not in the usual one liner sense of action movies.  I especially liked the part where Danila asks if he can copy the directorÕs Nau CD.\n\nI highly recommend this film for people who either like random violence or can tolerate it for the sake of an interesting plot.  The film has a distinctive feel to it."

There are some great killing scenes throughout the movie which make this a worth while watch. Not many people have heard of this, but still give it a go because it is much better then some of the other horror movies out there.",

The scenes on the space station (an elaborate wheel design) feature outstanding, beautiful star fields in radiant, cobalt blue. The ensuing trip to Mars contains the usual meteor episode, however it is carried off with a good degree of panache for a film of its time.\n\nSure, the &quot;spiritual&apos; story line is delivered heavy handedly; but once again the visuals (many taken from famous Chesley Bonestell paintings) fill you with awe as the ship lands on Mars and the crew struggles for survival.\n\n&quot;Conquest Of Space&quot; should be enjoyed for its imagination(given its production time frame), its top-of-the-line, saturated Technicolor vistas; and also the interesting, enjoyable film score. The DVD version, just announced for October, 2004 release from Paramount, will undoubtedly be a visual feast for those that value the George Pal films of the 1950&apos;s!",

As you must have guessed by now I&apos;m referring to The Blue Lagoon (1949) which has kept me bewitched and bewildered through the years (almost 50) and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in cassette or DVD or whatever. I&apos;ve spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it. What a waste indeed!

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen many comedies with Luis De Funes and have been his fan as long as I can remember. His participation in a movie promises good time, plenty of physical comedy, funny mess of grandiose proportions and up roaring laughs. He was &quot;The man with the forty faces per minute&quot;, the little volcano or small but powerful dynamo machine whose energy could supply electricity to a town of the average size , whose hilarious hyperactivity, perfect for a comic ever-changing face, and the ego of gigantic size in such miniature frame always produced a highly comic effect. All his trademarks are in full display in the updated version of the tragedy by Victor Hugo Ruy Blas, La folie des grandeurs (1971) or Delusions of Grandeur. Ruy Blas has been adapted to the screen several times including 1948 film with Jean Mairet and 2002 version with Gerard Depardieu. Oury&apos;s film formally follows the Hugo&apos;s story but with De Funes in the cast, you would not expect it to be a serious political drama, and you will be absolutely right. The film takes place in 17th century Spain and centers around a practical joke played on the queen of Spain by Don Salluste de Bazan, the rich, greedy and backstabbing tax collector for revenge. Don Salluste disguises his servant Blaze (Ives Montand) as a nobleman and takes him to the king&apos;s court. Attractive, funny, and suave, Blaze saves the king from the bomb, becomes popular, is appointed a tax collector instead of Salluste, and conquers the queen&apos;s heart. Don Salluste returns to take his revenge by notifying the king with the anonymous letter about queen&apos;s infidelity. The final act that brings together Salluste, Blaze, Salluste&apos;s nephew Don Cesar de Bazan whom his loving uncle sold as a slave to the Sahara barbarians, the furious jealous king, the queen who is in love with Blaze and her Cerberus like dueña, old virgin Donna Juana (very funny Alice Sapritch) who is also passionately in love with Blaze is non-stopping laugh that left me in stitches. La folie des grandeurs, directed by Gérard Oury, adapted by Oury&apos;s daughter Danièle Thomson, and starring Louis de Funès (Don Salluste) and Yves Montand (Blaze) is based on the serious drama but it is so deliciously silly, dizzyingly fast, absurd, and hilarious that you would laugh even when you know how silly it is. Ives Montand replaced Bourvil who was initially meant to play Blaze, and who had a great chemistry with De Funes on the screen nicely balancing latter&apos;s super activity and aggressiveness with his gentle naiveté and kindness. But as Bourvil died in 1970, Yves Montand ultimately got the role and proved to be quite good in a comedy even though the viewers were used to see him playing the cool and cynic characters in the thrillers and dramas.\n\nAs always with De Funes, he practically owns the movie. While watching &quot; La folie des grandeurs&quot; for the first time last night I could not help laughing hard and loud even knowing how silly and over the top the movie was but laughing even more because of it. This morning, I began laughing again just recalling De Funes&apos; face and him losing his voice and making some impossible quacking and squeaking noises when caught by surprise in the most hilarious scene of the film. &quot;La folie des grandeurs hold the record as the most successful French film of 1971, the fact that does not surprise me at all.",

Also, I didn&apos;t find out until several years later that this film was based on a work by the master of science fiction, Jules Verne.  This is an okay film for lovers of B movies.

His most annoying fan, Mitzi Underhuper, who claims to be the daughter of an American beer brewer, bribes Carlo&apos;s manager and stalk along to Sicily, planning to grab him for herself and take him back to the states. Meanwhile Tante Theresa (Brigitte Mira) is spreading the word that a notorious Texas gunman is on his way to settle the ongoing blood feuds. So when Carlo arrives, he is greeted by a couple of attempts on his life. Not to worry, the shotguns in this movie make a lot of noise, but there is very little smoke and certainly no bullets. \n\nSoon the prettiest pink petticoat in town who goes by the name of Antonella (Gerlinde Locker) is falling for Carlo and he starts singing love songs into her hair that may or may not explain the title of this film. On the other side of the feud, comedy duo Wolfgang Neuss and Wolfgang Muller do a Danny Kaye inspired number of their own and set up a trap for the &apos;famous gunslinger&apos;. But clever Carlo joins forces with Die Zwei Wolfgangs and promises that if they let him marry Antonella, the couple will take Tante Theresa away with them.\n\nOur big star proves to have rather a limited repertoire as he sings each of his songs twice. To add a little variation, the music editors have some fun speeding up either the music or the pictures (but never both at the same time). I suppose this was quite amusing back in &apos;58. When everything is just about resolved, Mitzi and the drunken manager (remember them?) try to stop the wedding. For a moment it looks like Antonella is about to meet the same fate as Appolonia from that other Sicily bound gangster epic, but then we remember Carlo has not reprised the song &apos;Antonella&apos; yet.\n\n4 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "If there was ever an inmate who was destined to escape from Alcatraz, it was Frank Lee Morris. In the movie entitled &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; starring actor Clint Eastwood, Morris was accurately portrayed as the keen and brilliant mastermind of one of the most famous prison escapes in history. The escape plan took nearly seven months to design, and it would necessitate the fabrication of clever decoys and water survival gear.\n\nF L Morris had spent a lifetime navigating the prison system before his arrival on Alcatraz. From his infant years until his teens Morris was shuffled from one foster home to another, and he was convicted of his first crime at the youthful age of only thirteen. By the time he reached his later teens, Morris&apos; criminal record would include a multitude of crimes ranging from narcotics possession to armed robbery, and he had become a professional inhabitant of the correctional system. He spent his formative years in a boys&apos; training school, and then graduated.\n\nMorris was credited by prison officials as possessing superior intelligence, and he earned his ticket to Alcatraz by building an impressive resume of escapes.\n\nFrank&apos;s accomplices in the &quot;Great Escape&quot; were equally well acquainted with the dark world of organized crime. Brothers John and Clarence Anglin were also serving sentences at Alcatraz for bank robbery, having been convicted along with their brother Alfred. All three had been incarcerated at the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta when they first became acquainted with Morris, and John and Clarence were eventually sent to Alcatraz following a sequence of attempted escapes.\n\ni wud love to explain in detail but then....\n\nAfter months of long preparation the inmates had completed fashioning all of the gear they needed for their escape, This what Clint had really shown his acting by the Direction of Siegel! I love the entire detail structure of the movie and wud be on my favo&apos;s...i have almost watched it more than 15times!!and Will do too...",

      "reviewBody": "For sure one of the better entries in the long and qualitatively irregular series of Edgar Wallace krimi-adaptations, and this for two specific reasons. Number one: &quot;The Strange Countess&quot; does everything - and I do mean everything - to uphold the mystery. The plot isn&apos;t exceptionally great or convoluted, but since very few exploitations or clues are given until late in the final act, it remains a compelling movie to follow. Number two: being one of the older krimis, &quot;The Strange Countess&quot; also doesn&apos;t feature those daft attempts at inserting unnecessary slapstick comedy. Eddi Arent stars and, although his character is still the most annoying, he&apos;s not undermining the suspense or ruining the atmosphere for a change.\n\nMiss Margaret Reedle, a nice 20-year-old girl without any enemies, suddenly becomes the target of several cowardly murder attempts and menacing phone calls in one day. Her stalker&apos;s identity isn&apos;t kept secret. It&apos;s good old Klaus Kinski, but why does he want to kill Margaret because he has never seen or spoken to her before? And, clearly, someone knows her life is in danger because Margaret suddenly has a private bodyguard (krimi-veteran Joachim Fuchsberger) following her around and preventing her from getting killed. When Margaret goes to work for the eccentric Countess Moron (what&apos;s in a name...) and live in her castle, the mystery only increases.\n\nI will not reveal any further details of the plot. Again, not because the denouement or the twists are so amazing, but merely because the entire cast and crew work so hard to reveal so little, and I don&apos;t want to ruin that. The only need-to-know information is that &quot;The Strange Countess&quot; is a good mystery/thriller krimi, with a handful of unexpected suspense moments (the balcony sequence in particular) and a more than adequate cast (including Lil Dagover, who&apos;s been around since the silent German expressionist era, and starred in the ultimate horror masterpiece &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;).",

It could be that it was just dumb luck and timing that Jonze caught them when he did, but I still consider it one of the greatest documentaries ever made.",

I was expecting a typical wedding drama, only instead of a hetero-wedding, this would be a gay-wedding. But this movie is much more.\n\nThe lives of five mothers and a father whose gay sons are getting married in a mass wedding ceremony, are interconnected and interwoven in totally hilarious, believable and fantastic situations. Like it&apos;s name suggests, the true heroines of the day are the mothers &quot;Reinas - the Queens of the ceremony&quot;. The women, so totally different from each other, had one bond that would knowingly or unknowingly connect them in so many ways. The dog moving from one person to another, gave the impression of that connection.\n\nThe direction was amazing, and the back and forth of the timelines gave it a unique feel. What happened that lead to the other happening that lead to the &quot;now&quot;... it was classic.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was that one unresolved issue, which constituted the final scene. But, I thought it was better to keep the issue unresolved than to acknowledge the destroyed relationships.\n\nIt is a truly great film.",

      "reviewBody": "It is not all that bad, at least it tries its to be an enjoyable family movie flick. But as usual, Disney movies now are getting haters around the world due to its popular teens and live-action animals-talking movies. So now, when they see a live-action Disney movie whether it has teenagers singing or animals yapping away, they would be put off immediately. Whatever it is, G-force is fun with 3-D. Kids would like the cute animals coming near them.\n\nThe story: G-Force has a simple story which is also not creative. But that it is not what kids want, they would want to see action blazing through their ways. As this being a Jerry Bruckheimer production, you can expect at least a car chase and some explosion but only more mild. Trevor Rabin did a good work in creating epic music. Though a kid movie, expect some rude humour but also at the same time, some lessons to teach your kids.\n\nOverall: Definitely not as bad as what haters say. In the end, it is just meant to be an enjoyable fun romp. You don&apos;t like animals talking, this is not for you. A good movie for the holiday. Just leave your brain at home if you want to enjoy this.",

There is much more nudity than is seen in PG movies today, yet it is still fitting as a family film. It is done in the sense of cultural norm and the body not being something shameful. I think it actually opens the door for discussion of the body in the family setting for those that are comfortable with the discussion. But if nudity offends you then this is definitely not a good family film choice for you.",

Bad People with Foreign Accents plan to do Bad Things to Good People with Domestic Accents. Seagal is the only man standing between blah and blah and blah de blah blah. OK, we know. We know. Let&apos;s just enjoy the ride.\n\nThe problem is that the &quot;plot&quot; of this movie jumps around so much that it&apos;s impossible to keep track of who is doing what to who and why. Really, I couldn&apos;t keep track of Good People and the Bad People, or when they switches sides or why, or which side Black Tech Guy is on from minute to minute.\n\nOn the plus sides, Seagal does his own &quot;fight&quot; scenes, but they&apos;re just sad now. His leathery skin clearly makes him invulnerable to conventional weapons, and while he does his usual twist/lock work, he&apos;s also forced to do some strikes that are simply pathetic. The guy can barely punch past his own belly these days.\n\nThe highlights are the supporting cast. Jacqueline Lord is surprisingly competent, and looks like she should have been in a lot more productions than her resume suggests. She clearly missed out on her big break a decade or so ago, but does well as mature totty.\n\nMatt... uh, sorry, Luke Goss owns the few scenes that he&apos;s in, but there&apos;s just not enough of them to save this movie, and they&apos;re irrelevant anyway since Seagal is playing his usual immortal Myrmidon Let&apos;s give Goss the last word though: &quot;This is unbelievable,&quot; he opines, and there&apos;s not much to disabuse that notion here.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Man from Earth&quot; is one of my favorite movies. It is a masterful story, and David Lee Smith&apos;s portrayal of a man who was ultimately looking for a debate with other scholars held me fast. It is, however, a standalone film that has no need for a sequel.\n\nCut to &quot;The Man from Earth: Holocene&quot;, which can be forgiven for the no-budget presentation (heck, the first movie looked worse), and even though the actors typically have dialog that isn&apos;t insultingly bad, their lack of physical investment in WHAT they are saying truly IS bad. It can be frustrating to watch actors talking, while their arms are wrapped around their torso awkwardly, or they stand around with their arms at their sides, with body language that negates what is being SAID.\n\nWorst of all, this movie takes one of the more uninteresting aspects of John Oldman&apos;s debates about his past, and decides to dedicate an entire movie to that single concept of who he was, or what he did during a small sliver of time. Near the halfway point of this movie, it goes from &quot;I don&apos;t get why this movie is being made, but fine, whatever&quot; to &quot;Oh hell naw! No you DIDN&apos;T!&quot;\n\nJohn ends up being forced to debate with one of his students, in a predicament that John shouldn&apos;t have been put into in the first place. This half hour is dreadful. It makes those who might be in the student&apos;s favor look like idiots. Whether or not I believe with either party&apos;s opinion, I think the third act should only have been considered during a rough draft discussion, then laughed off and tossed aside. never to be written into a screenplay.   The &quot;debate&quot; and discussion that proceeds for most of the rest of the movie manages to delve deeper into a downward spiral of insipid immaturity, and every character makes the WRONG decision when it&apos;s time to act.  My initial impression about a sequel to &quot;The Man from Earth&quot; could not have been more right: Just Let It Be. Don&apos;t Touch It.  Instead, this sequel was made, and ended up puking on the unique storytelling mastery of the first movie. Skip it. Watch the first one again. \n* As a bonus, there&apos;s a mid-credit scene that hints at a sequel. One that is guaranteed to dive deeper into that hole in which rabbits probably poop into.\n",

He always makes them special, unique.\n\nI mean let&apos;s take this example: who would think to make a movie about a killer which shoots his victims through his TV screen.\n\nI really enjoyed every second of this movie, I absolutely love it. You are always surrounded by suspense and ask yourself &quot;oh shoot what will happen next???&quot; However I can&apos;t understand and process the ending of this movie. It happened so quick and shocking that I really can&apos;t understand why it ended like this. Sure, it was meant to end somehow but all this was a bit too much.\n\nAnyways, I won&apos;t spoil the fun. Really recommend watching it! You will enjoy it!!",

      "reviewBody": "Although this is far from being one of his best, any film by Roberto Gavaldón is of interest because of his mastery of the medium.\n\nThis concerns a luscious young woman named Victoria who is saved from drowning by a priest who then proceeds to rape her whilst she is semi-conscious. She is thoroughly embittered by this and sides with the government during the Cristero War which seeks to crush the supremacy of the Catholic church. She has meanwhile enriched herself as a courtesan but falls for a doctor named Lamadrid who just happens to be a priest in disguise.........\n\nVictoria is played by Maria Félix in what is a demanding role. Her new-found love for the priest conflicts with her long-held hatred for the priesthood and causes her a great deal of soul-searching. She is obliged to go through the emotional gears and one would have to say that the sight of Dona Maria in full throttle is truly spectacular.\n\nThe fundamental weakness of the film lies in the character of Lamadrid and it is quite frankly inconceivable that such a full-bloodied woman would get herself in a state over someone so unbearably dull and self-righteous. Arturo de Córdova is a fine actor but this must surely be one of his crummiest parts.\n\nGood support from Victor Junco and the always dependable Andrea Palma and excellent camerawork from Augustin Solares.\n\nEleven years had elapsed since the pairing of Félix and de Córdova in &apos;Kneeling Goddess&apos; for the same director. There was alas precious little &apos;chemistry&apos; between them in that and in this it is non-existent.",

This is a cheap movie with cheap &quot;effects&quot; that are eye-rolling at best, laughable at worst -- the &quot;ghosts&quot; are guys dressed in skeleton costumes, a la Karate Kid (Plus, I&apos;m getting sick of digital blood in horror movies.). The dialog is a ridiculous heaping of clichéd yelling (&quot;We&apos;re not gonna get anywhere yelling at each other like this!&quot; and that sort of crap). The actors are no better -- just a bunch of overacting, and Furlong is not immune. He&apos;s seen better days. His hunched over, paunchy stoner body, and baggy eyes make him look increasingly like Peter Lorre. The only entertaining part of this film is watching Cernia Vincent running around in a cut-off t-shirt sans bra and with thong-cut jeans. Too bad the director is so incompetent; the cuts are jerky and disjointed, and he even has Vincent do some sort of Matrix-like fall-back maneuver to dodge a projectile, all with a straight face. The director tries to throw in some cheap &quot;boo!&quot; scares, but nothing -- nothing -- in this movie is remotely frightening, except for the fact that it was even made.",

      "reviewBody": "The Naked Witch (1961) \n\n1/2 (out of 4) \n\nThis 59 minute movie starts off as a documentary on witchcraft and it&apos;s slightly interesting for what it is. Then, around the ten minute mark we switch gears to an actual &quot;movie&quot; about a student who is doing research on witchcraft and comes across the grave of a witch. The witch returns and is sometimes naked. However, she&apos;s not naked enough to earn the title THE NAKED WITCH, which was obviously just a way to get creeps like me to watch the film.\n\nThis was co-directed by Claude Alexander and Larry Buchanan but it seems the majority of the &quot;student&quot; footage was from Buchanan. I&apos;m really not sure why his name isn&apos;t brought up more when people discuss some of the worst directors of all time because he has certainly made some major stinkers and this here is one of the worst. Even though this turkey clocks in at less than a hour it&apos;s still rather hard to sit through and it&apos;s just about as boring as watching paint dry. The incredibly dry narration will have your eyes drying out to the point where you&apos;ll want to take a nap.\n\nApparently this originally played on television in B&amp;W but the print I saw was in color. Also, while there&apos;s a limited amount of nudity, some of it appears to have been blacked out with a marker of some sort. Yes, it looks that cheap and bad. I&apos;ve read this happened by the distributor but I don&apos;t know the whole story. Either way, THE NAKED WITCH is pretty pointless and only for those who enjoy really bad movies."

      "name": "Vigilant Falcon against bandits or Magnificent Goyko Mitic: part four",
      "reviewBody": "Western. Continuation of the previous picture of the East German film studio DEFA &quot;Trail of the Falcon&quot;, in turn based on real events. The fourth of the twelve, which I intended to see, and if the previous one I clearly remembered from childhood, then this one did not look, well, or I forgot that I once watched. Be that as it may, but right now I was able to appreciate this picture, and here is my brief opinion - Sharp Falcon against bandits. I say right away that there are no downsides here, there are small clarifications, which I will talk about in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this western with the magnificent Goyko Mitic. So, here they are: 1. The story told - the picture continues the story about the leader of the Dakota tribe, the Sharp Falcon, who, after four years of a difficult war with the pale-faced, leads the surviving Indians to a meeting with another tribe, but the bandits attack them and kill the wife of the Sharp Falcon, and now he comes out on the path of revenge on the pale-faced bandits. But not everything is so simple, because a high-ranking and cunning businessman comes to the town, well known to the audience about the previous film, who intends to restore &quot;his&quot; order in the city, and this is opposed by a few honest residents. Here you have prejudices, and dislike for the Indians, the cunning of the pale-faced, although not all of them are shown in black colors, well, where is it without chases, fights and shootings, deadly confrontation of sworn enemies. The script is replete with twists and turns, and can even surprise the inexperienced viewer. I will tell you about the final separately. In general, I liked the story, it doesn&apos;t feel like a masterpiece, but I cannot call it average either. 2. Nature - the picture was filmed in Yugoslavia, where the majority of Westerns by DEFA studio, where nature is very similar to North American. Mountains, prairies, rivers, waterfalls, typical towns of the Wild West - everything is here and you can look at it for a long time and have fun. 3. Music - all of it is taken from the previous picture, well, maybe they added a couple of new melodies, but I definitely recognize the title theme. It seems to reflect not only the mood of this picture, but also the entire series of these westerns. Anxiety, courage, blood, loss, battles - it&apos;s all there. 4. Entourage - it only gets better with each next part. Here, the immersion in the era is felt even more, the Indians are dressed as Indians, pale-faced as pale-faced, soldiers as soldiers. We did not forget about the cultural characteristics of the Indians and slightly touched on the way of life. Well, and the atmosphere that has not gone anywhere! 5. Fights, chases, shootouts - everything is there and everything works great. You get pleasure from these scenes, and you worry about the characters. 6. Finale - the picture ends in a completely different way. Sadness and despair - with these words I can appreciate the finale of this western. Monstrous injustice, the scrapping of a person before the system and the power of money. I was hoping for a completely different ending, in the style of previous pictures, but alas, we have what we have. Sad and sad, although not without a certain meaning, and the evil was defeated, although not quite the one that deserved it. A little about the main characters: 1. Vigilant Falcon performed by Goyko Mitich - the leader of the Dakota tribe, who set out on the path of revenge for his murdered wife. Even in such a state of mind, he behaves reasonably and calculates his actions. He acts boldly and effectively with offenders, and Goiko Mitic himself performs all the tricks, which adds to his hero a certain charisma and respect for the work of the actor himself. Bravo Goiko! Bravo! 2. John Emerson, performed by Fred Ludwig - a former gold digger from the previous picture, who became the sheriff of a small town, where another villain has raided in order to crank up &quot;one little business&quot;, for which he hires the most notorious villains. He stands for law and order, together with faithful companions, of which there are not very many. Shows himself as a brave man and worthy to wear the title of &quot;sheriff&quot;. Fred played this hero very convincingly, I don&apos;t want to find fault, although there is something for it. 3. James Béchamp performed by Rolf Hoppe - a former member of the Poisonous Snake gang, who survived the collision with the Sharp Falcon. He nailed to the new leader in order to continue to commit banditry and lawlessness. Rolf, in the previous one, in this picture, perfectly played the role of this villain, for which I can only praise! Helmut Schreiber returned as Sam Blake and Barbara Brylska as Katherine Emerson. Well, of course, to date, shootouts, fights and chases are not able to bring that storm of delight, as in the year of release, but we will make a discount on the time of release. Did you agree? So we agreed! Well, in the next film by Goiko Mitic, he will again have to face the cunning of the pale-faced and try to get to the bottom of the truth. It will be in The Fatal Error. As a result, we have a good western with a great Gojko Mitic, with a good script, great music and surroundings, with an unexpected ending and great acting!",

      "reviewBody": "In this German ghost story, a mischievous little girl swaps places with a ghost, and enjoys stirring up trouble in ghostly form.  But when she wants to switch back, the snotty and ungrateful ghost won&apos;t cooperate.  Mayhem ensues, but the cheesy animated effects are so primitive that it&apos;s hard to get caught up in the action sequences.  There&apos;s not really much of a story outside of the effects gimmick, and there&apos;s certainly no clever dialogue or gags.  The little girl who plays the lead is fairly adorable, but the ghost is more irritating than scary or funny.  Only a European audience could get any pleasure out of the outlandishly goofy theme song.",

Of course there are not very fine nuances in his mimic but he fits the role perfect. \n\nA surprise for me was that he has not the leading role. There are two boys who never made a lot of other movies. They dominate the screen and did an impressive job - Domenico Santoro and Andrea Balestri!",

To minimize it is to denounce an act of love. For those who have panned this movie I ask ...Outside of the United States harming people around the world who is doing something to heal the planet? Compassion is a rare but necessary trait these days and Patch Adams is the doctor prescribing one form of treatment. I am grateful for his actions.\n\nThe music and the joyous expressions on the faces of the children reduced me to tears!!!",

      "reviewBody": "It opens with a helicopter view of the Central region of Hong Kong 1974. I love shots like that! On a dock a fight starts and two guys are taken prisoner. Cut to a bunch of old white guys in suits in a conference room discuss the plot. Cut again to another guy getting married. Instead, he is ordered to Bangkok. The tour of Bangkok is by taxi, boat, and then on foot.\n\nAt about the 24 minute mark Lo Lieh enters to spar. The part where he fights Robert Malcolm tried to be funny and could have been really funny but I didn&apos;t think it was funny at all. Comedy can be subjective so I try to avoid too much focus on that in my reviews. Plus, Chinese &quot;nonsense movies&quot; are an acquired taste. Personally, I didn&apos;t laugh at all watching the movie.\n\nI just learned there was an entire series of &quot;Three Supermen&quot; movies that began in 1970. I looked them up and I will not be watching any of them. Not my &quot;cuppa tea&quot;.\n\nMy copy is a digital file that plays on a HDTV as wide screen with English dialog. The video is excellent quality particularly when compared to the VHS multigeneration copies that are all that is left of many 1970s movies.\n\nGuns were around during the time of the movie so magic bullet proof super hero costumes were invented so they could fight and not be shot dead. The fights never surpassed the basic choreography seen in a typical 1960s Hollywood western.\n\nI rate it below average and do not recommend to anyone for any reason.",

      "reviewBody": "Because of a misunderstanding, an unmarried veterinarian ends up taking care of a child. Yep, pretty standard. Maybe that&apos;s why they opted for a few subplots(one of them drastically different in tone from everything else in this, that could(and should) be excised with no negative impact), leading to the clumsily assembled, extremely uneven, disharmonic mess we have here. Somehow, this does resolve most of them(ironically leaving the main story the most unsatisfying and open), in spite of dedicating an absurd amount of time to jokes and gags that have nothing to do with anything, and are seldom even funny(the best material is in the last thirty minutes). They are far too silly and goofy(and did they need to ram the fact that Passer drives an old car down our throats like that?), and those flashbacks(I kid you not, I have a hard time believing this many useless ones were committed to one single collection of celluloid) are just torturous. While the humor does have cleverness and wordplay, little of it is of even average quality. Many things in this have no consequence. There are freakin&apos; circus acts in this. It&apos;s really unfortunate that there is so much bad to this, that the whole is so unfocused, because aspects are great. Honestly, I&apos;d say the majority of them are. The handling and the combination is the culprit. Dirch overplays at times, albeit no one watching this for that will be happy with the amount. He is spot-on, however. The entire cast is, really. Strøbye, Stegger, Hertz, Sprogøe, and I could go on. Gringer is charming and likable. The kid that this supposedly revolves around is Winnie, and she definitely is cute, natural and largely convincing. She consistently uses the word &quot;step (dad)&quot; to refer to the man in charge of her and mispronounces words, and this comes off as fairly genuine. There is some realism to the writing, and observations, and this truly resonates. In a welcome change from the Hollywood tradition of resignedly telling audiences that their offspring are gonna whine until they give in and continue spoiling them, this encourages the use of ones imagination, instead. There are a couple of songs, and they&apos;re hit and miss. There is disturbing content in this. I recommend this to fans of Danish farces from this period. If you can stand this at its worst, you&apos;ll receive the bounty of it at its best. 6/10",

If we recall back to early 2003 when the administration was laying out its reasons for invading Iraq, the one most marketed to the American public was the idea that Saddam Hussein was in the process of creating chemical or nuclear weapons, which he would then give to terrorists who could then use them to attack American cities. Of course, soon after the war began it was discovered that these weapons either never existed or no longer existed, and to this day no one in the CIA or federal government has been able to explain how the intelligence community could have gotten it so wrong.\n\n&quot;Fair Game&quot; places itself right in the middle of these controversial events between 2002 and 2004, and is told through the eyes of CIA Agent Valerie Plame (played very convincingly by Naomi Watts) and her husband, United Nations Ambassador Joe Wilson (played fiercely by the always great Sean Penn). The film&apos;s story follows how Plame goes from patriotic CIA agent diligently doing her job overseas to suddenly having her identity made public after her husband uncovered false information about a nuclear development sale between Iraq and Niger. This false information about a uranium sale between these two countries is important because it was implied as factual when Bush was listing information about Iraq during his State of The Union Speech in early 2003.\n\nAs the film starts, Plame and Wilson appear to be a very loving couple with a very strong marriage - they even have 2 small children who live with them in the D.C. area. Plame is busy traveling covertly to countries in The Middle East to shake her fist at people whom might have ties to terrorists, while Wilson is back at home, often finding himself in heated arguments with friends at the dinner table whom hold a different opinions from his own. Both Plame and Wilson appear to be relatively non-political civilians working peacefully and dutifully for the federal government - until the Bush administration decides that the country should invade Iraq. After Wilson criticizes the administration&apos;s faulty information publicly, Plame is then fired from her job, and much of the rest of the film focuses on how the couple&apos;s marriage is stressed because of what is transpiring all over the media. People harass them often when they go out, as Wilson makes rounds on the media circuit to try to restore his name. The film has a little bit of a soap-operish feel to it during the 2nd half in that it is mostly focused on the couple&apos;s relationship, but the acting performances by Watts and Penn are just so sharp that they make up for some of the film&apos;s small flaws when it comes to storytelling. There is also a small subplot involving a family in Iraq connected with Plame&apos;s counter-proliferation efforts that should have been either developed more or left out entirely, as that is the weakest part of the film - but fortunately those scenes are relatively few in the entire film.\n\nAside from the acting, another of the film&apos;s strengths is how it never gets too preachy towards the Bush administration, but rather focuses on the facts of what unfairly happened to Plame and Wilson from their own points of view. In fact, no actor plays Bush or Cheney in the film - we only see a few clips of the real Bush and Cheneys giving speeches on TV screens for a matter of seconds. Scooter Libby (portrayed a bit villainously by David Andrews) is seen in a few short scenes as a swindler who tries to convince CIA employees into manipulating the intelligence the way he sees it, but his characterization is very subtle, rather than as an in your face bad guy. Doug Liman&apos;s direction is also fairly fast-paced to make sure the film never gets too bogged down in pointless scenes. Even though it is very talky and dialogue-driven, the narrative keeps moving forward at a crisp pace - at least if audience members are adults without ADD (and I think it&apos;s pretty fair to say that this movie isn&apos;t marketed for the Transformers or Twilight crowd...) The film generally works very well both as an entertaining drama, spy thriller, and an educational lesson. Moreover, it&apos;s an intelligent reminder to the public of how people in positions in power in government will often stop at nothing to achieve their desired goals, even if that means illegally abusing their power through misinformation, manipulation, and character assassination. As citizens we should constantly be questioning our leaders and their motives, as well as keeping them honest and holding them accountable whenever they they violate our trust.\n\nOn a final note, I have to say that I find it very refreshing to see a film like this that has a woman in a very intelligent leading role, rather than how Hollywood films usually stereotype females in formulaic romantic comedies. It seems like women in major roles usually have their sappy characters obsessing about trying to find a man and buying shoes, with some slapstick and comedy at the dinner table with their parents thrown in as well (a.k.a. chick flicks). It&apos;s either that or the female characters get almost zero screen time, where they are relegated to simply being the cute girlfriend sidekick. It&apos;s nice to see movies like this allow womens&apos; dramatic acting talents to shine and allow us to see them as complex, real characters.",

Just a few short months before its release, I became addicted to the sport of roller derby. I saw the first bout of season three; we were there to watch a friend play. Little did I know this thing called derby would totally consume me. Rumor had it that there was a movie coming out about the very same roller derby league that stole my heart. I did some research and found the &quot;BOTFT&quot; website. I watched the trailer daily...sometimes several times per day.\n\nMy addiction was fed when I finally got to see the film; I was totally glued to the screen from the first minute to the last. The details on how the league began and the roller girls involved were fascinating. They captured so many touching, comical, intimate, and honorable details of this incredible organization.\n\nWhen it was over, I wanted to watch it again...immediately. I long for a copy of my own on DVD. I just might have to buy two, so I have a back up for when I wear the first one out.",

This movie gives a very imaginative way the body works to fight infection, as if the body was a city of people just like in the real world.  You may need to have some sort of knowledge about the body to get some of the puns and jokes, maybe not very young kids will get it, but they will like the animation...this movie is even good for adults.

This is sad...\n\nI recommend some other movies of that period - i would say that these are all really quality movies from the 60&apos;s, and 70&apos;s: - Karpathy Zoltan - Egy Magyar nabob - Egri Csillagok - Szegeny gazdagok - Liliomfi",

In the scene with Viv looking at the remote figure of the mom with two daughters as they leave to go shopping -- even (or especially) this mom who says big breasts are out of date, and who has provided her daughter with a nose job -- there is clear yearning for and respect for a mother.  And in the responsibilities Viv is given and which she takes pretty courageously i&apos;d say, she is a little mother to her family.  Cousin Rita Abramovitz, on the other hand, is a female disaster, and Marisa Tomei&apos;s performance is spot on.  Again, not comic.  Human feeling and weakness showing through veneer of sexual energy.  Our culture provides for sex first.  Sex sells.  There&apos;s a temporary sense of power, but this is not what people are.  And Tomei gets that across.  She disentigrates into illness.   Elliott the pot dealer is drawn with accuracy and tenderness, recalling people i knew back then and illuminating them for me.  The scene that was key for me in this motion picture is the father at his restaurant(with hair on his head in a lovely flashback)dealing with his cook.  The meat. Could move the setting from Beverly Hills to the LaBrea tarpits . . . watching living creatures thrash and sink in the black goo of materialism.",

It uses established formula and uses every cliche possible in the book, but somehow manage to feel original and cliche free. The movie is silly and most of the action is over the top and implausible. Besides the charismatic leading duo the implausibility of the cartoonish action is the main charm of the movie. &apos;Miami Supercops&apos; is not the best, or even funniest from Terence Hill/Bud Spencer, but it will offer amusing hour and a half of entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Occasionally, an international moniker is attributed to different films within the same genre which, when it involves some of the same credentials, can prove quite confusing: for instance, I had already watched and reviewed a peplum by this title – alternately named MARY MAGDALENE (1958), and with which it shares leading man Jorge Mistral (for what it is worth, a Luis Bunuel alumnus)! Besides, the nominal star in the film under review i.e. Gianna Maria Canale would also appear in THE MIGHTY CRUSADERS (also 1958)among whose international titles is THE CROSS AND THE SWORD, and which – coincidentally – had as co-star Bunuel regular Francisco Rabal!\n\nWhile the mythological/fantasy peplums were largely juvenile and often silly, the historical/religious ones were generally solemn and downright dull; this one obviously falls in the latter category, whose plot is yet again a variation on the oft-filmed &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; – as Roman Mistral shuns noblewoman Canale for Carthaginian Christian(!) Marisa Allasio. The former&apos;s spite towards the latter is quite drastic, though – since she has her ritualistically whipped by her Mrs. Danvers-like maid and, later still, blinded, Samson-style, by a roving iron placed before her eyes! The rest of the narrative deals, as expected, with dreary political intrigue and hokey sermonizing – which leaves little space for proper sword-and-sandal actionyet Canale&apos;s inevitably violent demise is nicely devised, as she falls off a speeding chariot to be trampled by the horses of the riders giving chase! Unfortunately, the ropey quality of the copy I watched – recorded off Italian TV – left much to be desired and occasionally interfered with my viewing pleasure!\n\nTo complement my recent mini-marathon of Riccardo Freda epics, I may be able to include a few more of the numerous ones made by his partner Canale – for the record, I have access to eight other unwatched flicks in this vein where she is featured! With respect to Mistral, among his other costumed fare is the obscure but intriguing French Arabian Nights tale SHEHERAZADE (1963; in which none other than Jean-Luc Godard himself was roped in to appear, since his then-muse Anna Karina was the leading lady!). As for director Brignone, it should be noted that this was his penultimate work, made at age 69: tellingly, apart from his swan-song SIGN OF THE GLADIATOR (1959), the only other effort of his that I am familiar with dates from the Silent era – namely MACISTE IN HELL (1925)!; even so, looking at his extensive filmography on IMDb, I noticed not only a trio of other movies I managed to record off Italian TV but also a handful related to historical figures often touched upon by the cinema – such as Cleopatra, Socrates, Lorenzino de&apos; Medici, Edmund Kean, Beatrice Cenci, Agi Murad, etc.!",

As part 4 this is a 50&apos;s film made in the 70&apos;s, but luckily the script at least has a decent story and due to Wolfgang Schleif&apos;s good routine direction the film is well-paced and  amusing. If there had only been a better supporting cast, one thing the first 3 parts had no trouble with. As part 4 the film is carried by Heidi Brühl and the nice twin sisters Westhausen, but to bring life to the story they are on their own. Who can tell the difference between Horst Janson and one of the horses? \n\nSo, not bad, but what luck there have not been other sequels. (6/10)",

It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn&apos;t craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical touristic Tornatore-like picturing, no over acting, no director autoreferentialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone&apos;s songs, whose music, I reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his &apos;Respiro&apos; another definitive beautiful film. &apos;Nuovomondo&apos; is not to be missed, it is that kind of &apos;medicine film&apos; helpful to enjoy movie-making, movie watching, helpful to enjoy and understand life.

      "reviewBody": "Get the ingredients for a little made b-film and throw Bram Stocker in as inspiration for the story. A demonic force is summoned to take the soul of a young boy who could become a saint and if done it could open a doorway to hell. However this entity can only travel through shadows and needs to collect souls to complete this task. But on its trail is Father Vassey, who&apos;s heading to this sleepy rural town to find the boy first. The occult horror &quot;Shadow Builder&quot; is an adaptation of a Stocker story and the screenplay only seems to muddled it up with half-baked theories, as it leans towards its cheesy special effects, nasty shocks and poignant performances led by Michael Rooker&apos;s grizzled renegade priest who gets around with pistols than say a bible and Tony Todd as some loony giggling Jamaican hermit that kids are afraid of. Actually &quot;Shadow Builder&quot; isn&apos;t all that bad, but in parts it&apos;s fairly amusing and surprisingly dark in its atmospherics. The opening scenes are actually quite fun. Over-the-top and silly, but fun especially seeing Rooker at work in his choice of repenting sinners. The demonic entity has some striking facial details, but basically it&apos;s black CGI smoke and like most villainous horror characters has something cleverly smart to say. With this last point, I thought it would have been better suited if it said nothing at all. The direction is rather stylised for its low- budget, but the plot doesn&apos;t meander much and it has enough thrills in its formulaic patterns of good vs. evil or light vs. darkness. A young Kevin Zegers stars as the kid caught in the middle of it all.\n\n&quot;Are you truly repentant?&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "An earlier review here, one of the few positive reviews of this movie on this site, had one thing wrong, saying that those who read the book would appreciate the movie, and vice-versa. In fact, the opposite seems to be true. Having not read the book, I first saw this movie unjaded, and so was able to appreciate it as the sad and tragic story that it is.\n\nThe sudden death of a loving husband and father (it appears he may be a little too loving toward the oldest daughter, but the movie doesn&apos;t expand on that) leaves the family in despair, so the mother takes the children and herself to her filthy-rich parents&apos; mansion, hoping to inherit the estate from her dying father. Just one little thing: she was long-ago disinherited because she entered into a forbidden marriage, and her father will not grant her an inheritance if he knows the marriage resulted in children, so she and her mother, &quot;The &quot;Grandmother&quot;, keep the children hidden in an attic as they await the old man&apos;s death, and she tries to win back his approval. The Grandmother is like a cruel warden, treating the children, a teenage boy and girl, and two young twins, boy and girl, like convicted criminals, only worse. The waiting goes on and on, during which the mother is consumed by greed, and emerges as the real villain.\n\nSome readers of the book are indignant that the story was cleaned up for the movie, but that was necessary to make it more watchable to a wider audience. It is still a great and haunting story, reminiscent of the black and white horror flicks of the 1960&apos;s (&quot;Whatever Happened To Baby Jane&quot;, &quot;Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;, etc.). Audiences of the 1980&apos;s were not so jaded as today&apos;s, and were not ready for incest, especially among sympathetic characters.\n\nMaybe the acting was not first-rate, and some elements, like the climactic ending, a bit campy, but the compelling storyline easily compensates for it, so long as you don&apos;t dwell on the few shortcomings, and can&apos;t see the forest for the trees.\n\nAnd the movie has one thing the book hasn&apos;t: a memorably haunting, chilling musical score, a perfect compliment to an equally haunting, chilling story.",

      "reviewBody": "Guitar Wolf, Bass Wolf &amp; Drum Wolf are the triumvirate of rock &apos;n roll cool. They face the greatest foe of rock &apos;n roll : Squares. Square are best epitomized by the Captain, who dresses in an all white, skin tight outfit at the beginning (also has a nice mop-top). Apparently he enjoys wearing short shorts (BAD THOUGHT ... unclean... unclean). He and those that he represents don&apos;t care about rock &apos;n roll, they only care about money and power.\n\nOne might think this is a typical rock &apos;n roll movie, but it isn&apos;t. After our initial showdown between the squares and the Wolf Trio, the movie takes an unexpected twist. This movie then turns into a survival horror movie. It seems that aliens are involved and they are bringing back the dead. So we end up with the Captain versus the Wolf Trio, in the backdrop of a zombie plague/alien invasion. The supporting cast consists of yakuza henchmen, bungling thieves (one of which is a Japanese Steve Buscemi impersonator and another who is a Japanese Margaret Cho impersonator), a female arms dealer, our hero who&apos;s trying to be like Guitar Wolf (Ace), Ace&apos;s &quot;female&quot; love interest (Tobio) and layer upon layer of various gray zombies.\n\nThis movie is a lot of fun and a twist on the zombie movie genre. The music is great. It has a rock n&apos; roll in-your-face feel. I think Guitar Wolf provided the entire soundtrack. Some of the great scenes where the music is blasting and zombies are dropping left and right, you just want to scream and kick down some doors. A funny innovation in this movie is the pee cam (like Miike&apos;s turd cam). The finale is quite over the top. Remember watch this movie, kick ass and chew bubble gum. If you need to drink milk, put some cocaine in it first.\n\nRIP Billy.\n\n-Celluloid Rehab",

Still, despite being remarkably better than its fellow contemporary melt-movies (&quot;Street Trash&quot; immediately comes to mind), this remains forgettable 90&apos;s horror with an insuperable lack of coherence and professionalism. I&apos;m aware that it was all meant to be absurd and over-the-top gooey, but a little bit of continuity wouldn&apos;t have hurt anybody, would it? The goodhearted residents of Pebbles Road all receive free samples of a new vitamin product from the eminent Dr. Phillips&apos; health farm, immediately after a bizarre lethal car accident took place in their peaceful street. Each and every one of them soon undergoes drastic physical changes, as it seems like this vitamin drink actually is an experimental drug. A Pregnant woman loses her placenta, a male resident has visions of a severely mutilated girl and two teenagers that seem to have escaped the &quot;test&quot; end up at an inbred &amp; cannibalistic family that is also related to Phillips&apos; health farm. It takes a duo not-so-bright cops quite some time they realize the clinic might be involved. The splatter images in &quot;Body Melt&quot; are indeed extreme but not at all constant and the gore-free sequences in between are actually quite dull. As strange as it may sound, the screenplay is much more effective as a social satire instead of a repulsive horror flick. Philip Brophy cleverly spoofs a lot of hugely irritating 90&apos;s trends, such as brainless fitness-freaks, fraudulent health-gurus and typical joy-joy TV soap-operas that portray life in the suburbs way too rosy.",

      "reviewBody": "Review: I&apos;m usually a fan of Ed Harris&apos;s work, but I found this movie quite weak and the storyline pretty boring. It seemed like it was made for TV and you don&apos;t really get to see why Ed Harris is so feared in jail. You also don&apos;t get to see what happened to the corrupt cop after all of his evil doings and the ending was corny. I now know why I hadn&apos;t heard anything about the film before it came came because it&apos;s one of those low budget films that will be forgotten, even though there were some decent actors in it. The only watchable factor is that you want to see what happens to the main character whose trying to go straight, but apart from that, I didn&apos;t find it that interesting. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: At the age of 64, Ed Harris is still churning out movies with great performances. From Pain &amp; Gain to a brief role in Gravity, he still makes some decent movies but a lot of them go straight to DVD. He has a unique, cool way of acting which is great to watch but he has made some bad choices of late. I was surprised to see Sharon Glees, who used to play Cagney in Cagney &amp; Lacey, but she only had a small role without much lines. I think that everyone thought that she would have been a bigger star than she was. As for this movie, it started off well and the storyline looked promising, but it went downhill after the main character came out of prison. \n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/crime movies about a guy who comes out of prison and tries to go straight, now that he has to look after his 5 year old boy, but he keeps on getting pulled in the wrong direction. 3/10",

It clearly wants to be an Alfred Hitchcock copycat film that&apos;s too obvious for any success in either genre.\n\nThose with a yen for bizarre and nasty characters or gross situations will find this somehow agreeable but it flounders in typical, modern BFI style and ends up sinking itself in tastelessness.\n\nBest attributes come via the good looking cinematography by Welsh born Richard Greatrex and an OK cast. Otherwise it&apos;s another cold and soulless modern wannabe failed &apos;classic&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "What a weird fairy tale: director Neil Jordan (Interview with the Vampire) seems to have had the intention of taking a Freudian approach to the story of &apos;Little Red Riding Hood&apos;. The result is an almost surreal collection of stories about rather testosterone driven werewolves, who all have a little more on their minds than &apos;just&apos; to kill. If you like old school practical effects and transformations, this film has &apos;em by the truck load (although they do seem a little dated by now). Not everything works in this strange tale; the mix of sexual symbolism, poetic beauty and gory horror moments seems a bit forced at times - but when it does work it&apos;s utterly fascinating. For fans of the weird and lovers of the pre-CGI era, this is a rare treat. 7 out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "After the enormous success of his critical movie, &apos;Saroja&apos;, Somarathne Dissanayake has tried to draw the Sri Lankan moviegoers&apos; attention to a movie with more &apos;natural and artistic&apos; values than any other movie in the last decades of Sri Lankan cinema. The breathtaking story embedded in this movie is unfolded in a sylvan environment; this movie has been filmed at location of &apos;Meemurai&apos;, a forested area which equips the filmmakers with all the necessities to bring the storyline to life. The movie opens with Sediris, a hunter in the jungle teaching his son the tricks of his trade. Jackson Anthony, the perfect actor for the role, has given more life and strength to the character than the filmmakers could have expected. Though the language he uses is somewhat harsh to the minds of children who were the targeted audience, the dialogues have been written suitably. Then suddenly, a Buddhist monk accompanied by a novice come to live in the jungle. What Sediris did for a living is hindered by the monk who tries to stop him. The uninterrupted flow of the movie perseveres with the differences in the attitudes of the two; the monk and the huntsman. In the mean time, the two boys; the novice and the son of the hunter become friends. The freshness and splendor of childhood has been brightly exhibited in this movie. The unforgettable musical experience added to the movie by Rohana Weerasinghe has highlighted the theme of the film. The movie ends with the unification of the two sides; the hunter who hoists his own petard by losing his leg, gives his son to the Buddhist order. This movie captures a beautiful theme nourished by the Buddhist teachings. An emotional tug of war is put forth by this colourful production. This movie stands out as one of the highest grossing movies in the history of Sri Lankan cinema. It has left its signature in the minds of the audience.",

There is no movie even remotely comparable to this, but if movies were cars I would say that this would be a collision between the Matrix,Rosemary&apos;s baby, Clerks and in a way maybe Run Lola run. It is one of those headturner movies that proves once more that European filmmakers are brilliant at making films and having said that, I personally LUVED this movie."

      "reviewBody": "The town where Frozen River takes place is Massena, New York, a few miles from the Canadian border in the middle of a Mohawk reservation, and in the winter it&apos;s every bit as cold and grey as the film depicts. This is one of those films that depicts a slice of life that most of us aren&apos;t privy too and it seems to know its subject inside and out.\n\nFrozen River is independent film-making at its best, both vital and timely. Writer/Director Courtney Hunt shows how otherwise law abiding people can be driven to do some shady things when there are no other options. While there may still be a great divide between Natives and non-Natives, the film depicts how economic hardship has no boundaries and in fact unites us. As Lila and Ray make those dangerous trips across the border with state troopers lurking all around them, Hunt pays considerable attention to the small details of human smuggling, and the result is a constant state of dread as if anything can go awry at any time. Leo is absolutely brilliant as Ray, and Upham (raised in Seattle) is a pure revelation as Lila. Frozen River shines a light on a dark corner of our nation, one that is an unfortunate result of a useless immigration policy and a failing economy.",

Sadly, this film must be filed in Column B.\n\nThe main problem is with Elliott Gould&apos;s character. Badly written and performed, he is simply not believable as an object of attraction for the always wonderful Bibi Andersson. His childish behaviour is jarring and not provided with any convincing underlying rationale. Instead, he is simply irritating and increasingly repellent.\n\nMax Von Sydow is his always reliable self as Andersson&apos;s cuckolded husband, but his role isn&apos;t big enough to salvage a sinking ship.\n\nBergman in English simply doesn&apos;t seem to work (see also The Serpent&apos;s Egg) and makes one fleetingly wonder whether his Swedish films are similarly stilted in their original language. But then one remembers the brilliance of Scenes from a Marriage, Autumn Sonata and all the rest, and reaches the conclusion that this clunker is the exception that proves the rule.",

This film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantsies, interracial rape. The main character in this film is a George Michaelesque dope, who doesn&apos;t understand primal human urges like drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the Reading Center for protection they must meet with him. At the meeting he is surrounded by countless Chicano gangsters, but he keeps a cool head. In slow motion, he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that shatters upon contact. Then, still in slow motion, points at the leader of the gang and says, &quot;Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!&quot; The gang members comply. Cool, right? The beauty of this film shows through in these simple solutions to social problems like prostitution and gang violence.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, written and Directed by black, female, Bronx native Darnell Martin captures a turbulent time in the life of a Puerto Rican couple in the Bronx, NY. What could best be described as a Latino version of &apos;Do The Right Thing,&apos; the film tackles many issues such as masculinity, homosexuality, religion, race and capitalism. All wrapped up in the single half Puerto-Rican half Jamaican Lizette, issues of race abound at every corner with a mother-in-law who insists on her family coming from a pure Castillian lineage. The most thoroughly addressed topic is that of masculinity and what decrees a true man. Whether it be the misogynist and somewhat abusive father figure of Chino, or the homosexual &apos;Alexis,&apos; who essentially rejects his masculinity in order to escape the trappings that Chino represents. This is a film that requires some thought and definitely some effort to go beyond the superficialities of Bronx vernacular and gay humor. This film addresses major issues found in the Latino community, from the perspective of a non-Latino. This is a very good film and if race movies interest you -such as Spike Lee Joints- this should not be missed.",

I searched for it unsuccessfully for about five years; I had great expectations, and - oh, boy! - they were NOT disappointed at all! Already the first twenty minutes deliver more than many other thrillers during their entire running time. The plot is very twisted, and there are so many red herrings that literally every character becomes a suspect during this film. There are fine performances of Mimsy Farmer, Barry Primus and especially Ray Lovelock of &apos;The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue&apos;-fame. This really is a brilliant movie and a real MUST SEE for the fan of stylish European cinema. Not to be missed!",

      "reviewBody": "The Reformer and the Redhead is a poor man&apos;s version of a combination of State of the Union and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington on a more local level. Dick Powell is an ambitious attorney who was raised in an orphanage and now aspires to be mayor of his small California town. On the campaign trail he meets June Allyson, redheaded daughter of Cecil Kellaway who was fired from his job as zookeeper.\n\nThrough them he learns some interesting facts about the creation of the zoo and after some research he uses his knowledge to blackjack the local boss, Ray Collins, to support his candidacy. Of course when that comes to the attention of June Allyson it throws a great big shadow on their relationship.\n\nMy guess is that Mr. and Mrs. Powell got this one because Tracy and Hepburn turned it down. As well they should have because I don&apos;t think that even their presence could have made it a classic. Politics has and always will be the art of compromise. Powell has certain goals in mind for his community and he can achieve them with Collins&apos; support. In the real world, Powell&apos;s silence should have satisfied all concerned. It&apos;s like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in that just why was it so important for James Stewart to have his national boys camp at that location where it was interfering with some pet graft scheme of Edward Arnold. It&apos;s the weakness of that film and it&apos;s an even more glaring weakness in this film.\n\nIn a way The Reformer and the Redhead is also a looking glass version of an aspect of All the King&apos;s Men. In that one an upright judge who is now the Attorney General of that state through some diligent research by John Ireland is blackmailed by Broderick Crawford and kills himself. Just what is the role of blackmail in our political system.\n\nThe more serious questions The Reformer and the Redhead raises are smothered over with some comedy concerning June and Cecil&apos;s bizarre collection of ailing zoo animals, including a lion named Herman they keep as a house cat. I can&apos;t really blame Powell for that, I have a neighbor who has kept an alligator for one for years. I&apos;ve seen Albert the Alligator from a very discreet distance.\n\nThe Reformer and the Redhead is good, not great, but entertaining enough in the comedy department. But it leaves more questions unanswered when dealing with the more serious aspects of the film.",

      "name": "a very unusual European film",
      "reviewBody": "When most people today hear the title &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, they probably think right away of the 2004 film starring Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning. Unbeknownst to many of them is that film is in fact a remake of a gritty, disturbing, and above all, unusual European film of the same title. The 1987 version of &quot;Man on Fire&quot; is probably a film that I would have to consider schlock. From the looks of it, it&apos;s budget was fairly decent for it has good acting, good effects, and good sound design. But the reason why it falls under the category of schlock is because of its very unusual and sometimes, inferior styles. This is a film that will meet viewers halfway. Some people will enjoy it just for what it is. And the other half will simply despise it.\n\nFor me, &quot;Man on Fire&quot; was in deed unusual and strange and definitely not the most creative film ever made. But while that is true in my personal opinion, there is another factor that I cannot deny. And that is the factor that while the film was a bit shoddy, it was highly entertaining and in a way, a bit more complex and more compelling than the 2004 remake. It has some gorgeous scenery, absolutely wonderful acting, a fairly decent screenplay, and other things that I simply find attractive in a motion picture. Scott Glenn was absolutely flawless as Creasy and he pulled off the character as being mysterious, cold, and unusual. He wasn&apos;t quite the tough guy as Denzel Washington was in the remake. To be honest, I wanted him to be tougher, but it kind of worked out. Jade Malle, an actress who unfortunately did not do much acting after this debut, was fairly good as Sam. Yes, she wasn&apos;t the best child actress in the world and not a patch when compared to Dakota Fanning, but I found her to a fairly decent addition to the cast. And Joe Pesci, while definitely one of the unusual aspects of the film, pulled off a fairly good performance as well.\n\nAction sequences in &quot;Man on Fire&quot; were fairly decent. Many of them were flawed, but they were, for the most part, thrilling. There was one part that I personally felt did not work out. When one of the bad guys gets shot in the stomach, he just kind of stands there until he finally starts to slowly fall over. The camera doesn&apos;t change angles or anything like that to create a more distressful feeling. But other than that, the gunfights and action sequences were intense, gritty, and bloody. And the gore here is used at a controlled level. And what I will always remember about this film was that unlike the 2004 version, there was a scene here that just made me jump.\n\nSo what doesn&apos;t work in &quot;Man on Fire&quot;? Basically, it&apos;s just a few aspects of the film&apos;s style. Some parts of the film I think could have used a few more takes. The scene where Creasy finds the first of the kidnappers probably could have been done differently, for I found it to be too disturbing and uncomfortable. And like I said, there are some wonderfully talented actors and actresses in this film. Jade Malle&apos;s parents were portrayed wonderfully, unfortunately, their characters are what I would call stick figures. Just in the background, so that you know they&apos;re there. The ending for the film is a mysterious one of the highest order. For a while, it doesn&apos;t make any sense. And I think the explanation of the ending just depends on an individual viewer&apos;s point of view. Maybe that&apos;s what the director intended.\n\nThe original 1987 &quot;Man on Fire&quot; is not the kind of film for everybody. Some aspects of it are inferior to the 2004 remake, but other aspects exceed well above it. Personally, I might prefer this version for its colorful acting, its not-so-gangster style, Scott Glenn&apos;s wonderful performance, the great music score, and just the great thrills of a 1980s European thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Morgan Sullivan is a businessman who, rather than work for his father-in-law, takes a strange job working as a corporate spy for a company called Digicore. His assignments are simple and boring; attend a conference and use a covert device to transmit the speeches back to HQ. At one conference he meets a mysterious woman called Rita and flirts with her. On his flights and during his sleep he is bothered by vivid dreams and voices in his head; he thinks nothing of it but then his next meeting with Rita reveals something much more sinister than the basic assignments he thought he was getting and he soon finds himself in deep.\n\nI had never heard of this film at all before watching it, nor did I even know anything about it whatsoever and I only ended up watching it because I had FilmFour free one weekend and this was one of the few films that they showed that was worth seeing. I&apos;m glad I came to it with nothing because I found myself engaged from the start and the twisty plot was great fun even if the final five minutes could never have hoped to have delivered above and beyond what had come before. There are those that complain about the ending being &quot;terrible&quot; are perhaps being too harsh although I will acknowledge that it is a bit too tidy for its own good. The plot requires a lot of suspension of belief (and I mean a lot) but once you get into it it moves along really well and does keep you watching to see where it goes. It is helped by the way that it starts out in a &quot;normal&quot; world that many of us will relate to  boring business presentations and conferences that you wonder why you bothered. If you can keep up with it from here on then it is enjoyable even if logic and sense.\n\nVisually the film really works even if the budget constraints are clear here and there. Director Natali injects a lot of style and imagination into it and also delivers a real sense of urgency and paranoia that helps the material work. The cast are a mixed bunch, although in this sort of film the characters tend not to be that well developed in all parts. Northam takes the lead role and does it well, making his character a drag little everyman but also convincingly changing him gradually across the film. Lucy Liu is not as good; she is a bit flat but fortunately she has limited screen time and was only what I&apos;d call really bad one time. The support cast are all OK, delivering the required mix of the ordinary and the sinister to good effect even if they are all pretty straightforward.\n\nOverall this is a nice little thriller in the style of things like Usual Suspects, Memento and the like. You do need to suspend belief and, if you can, it is enjoyably twisty and slick and is pretty exciting. Of course if you dislike the genre (the sort that has to keep moving for fear of getting caught by its own lack of logic) then you&apos;ll hate it but everyone else should at least get a fun 90 minutes from it."

      "reviewBody": "Currently, with a 5.1/10 rating, this is a very underrated film. I don&apos;t understand why Jaden Smith is getting so much hate, whether it is because he was &quot;pushed in&quot; to the movie business or if it&apos;s because he&apos;s playing a black person who moves to China, where in the original, the main character is white. I can tell that a large amount of people that voted haven&apos;t even seen this before. This film contains beautiful cinematography, great fighting scenes, and fun music for the audience to listen to.\n\nLet&apos;s forget that the main character is black, and is moving to China, for a second. Do you think this movie would still have gotten 5.1/10? I truly recommend this film to everyone. Children and even adults will like this movie. Before you go to the movie, don&apos;t base it on the IMDb rating, because most likely, you&apos;ll go into the film thinking it&apos;s bad, then going with the crowd. First, check the IMDb message boards, or check a website with real critics like Rotten Tomatoes, or AOL movies.\n\nThis is one of the my favourite films (though not the best) of 2010, and should not be missed by anybody. So should you ask the question &quot;See it, or flee it?&quot; I will, and as will many others respond with a &quot;see it&quot;. 7/10.",

Okay this movie is very low budget and at times cliché but the subliminal message of the whole storyline is intriguing. Not many people will see this but there are many references to past dictatorships and sociological theories. If you can try and watch the movie without acknowledging its low budgetness then perhaps you can witness some fine acting, particularly from Alan MacGillivray, who plays the eventual hero of the film, Boomer. I am surprised from his sheer excellence in his performance as Boomer, that his career did not extend to bigger and better things. This film is a hidden gem. Highly recommended."

However, the rules on adultery and trials, well ... if you want to be upset, be upset at the gospels.\n\nThe gospels portrayed the trial as a crooked rush job. Likewise, the stoning for adultery (and in the past, rural areas did not always strictly follow the dictates of the law) was referenced in a favorite scene in the Bible as well. The Bible had no &quot;backstory&quot; underlining that really the stoning in practice was a last result and rarely done practice. We were meant to see it as barbaric, the crowd driven more by passion than reason (before Jesus came around to guilt them). \n\nIn fact, some gospels had various scenes that put Jewish practice in bad light. At times unfairly. For instance, the money-changing in the temple -- you needed that to allow people from all over to have the right sort of coin to give their offering. It surely had some bad flavor, but it was not just about a &quot;band of thieves.&quot; Lashing out like Jesus did kinda suggests why some thought the guy a tad bit dangerous especially in an age of rebels and revolts. \n\nIf one wants a &quot;historical&quot; reflection of what &quot;actually&quot; happened, which honestly would be not a bad way to go, they wouldn&apos;t be as reliant on scripture and all. The conceit of this movie also would not really be possible, to be totally honest about it.",

This film&apos;s only purpose seems to be made for just that, it&apos;s an educational video. In the USA you have those ads &quot;Meth, not even once&quot;? This has the same message written all over it. No harm done, but don&apos;t call it a movie...\n\nSome of the reviewers on this site and several others have said that the message is the most important thing about this flick, but I&apos;ll let you in on a secret: it&apos;s not. The acting was horribly unconvincing, the characters where flat, shallow stereotypes, and as far as the rape scene: go watch &quot;Irreversible&quot; and then come back and tell me that was the worst, stomach hurting, godaweful scene you ever saw in a movie. Plus, that movie *will* enrich your life, whereas this one really doesn&apos;t.\n\nIn short, if you haven&apos;t seen it: don&apos;t watch it.",

And the robocop program was brought in, after the E.D. 209 (An all robot killing machine) proto-type failed so disastrously.\n\nAlex Murphy, now Robocop is effectively dead, but he still has a memory, and sets out on a quest to avenge his own Death, by finding the scumbags responsible.\n\nWith some quite horrific violence (E.D. 209 and Murphy scenes mainly) and some brilliant action, Robocop is character that you will warm to, as he fights crime on a personal level.\n\nSolid entertainment 8/10",

Having said that, what you&apos;ll get if you watch this is a thoroughly thought provoking movie with a superb screenplay, sharp and well on spot, up to date in every sense. If you like your brain working, this one is for you.\n\nIt is staggering to see a mini-mini-mini independent film to be so incredibly good. Well, it&apos;s all about ideas, talented people pulling in the same direction.\n\nLet&apos;s not forget about the actors, who are great, basically all of them, especially Tatum Matthews with a very bright future if she choose to. The camerawork, editing and music are all basic, however they all make this picture work superbly.\n\nIt is a very good film. Well worth the watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Why are some people reviewing Zone Troppers as if the makers had intended to make a serious sci-fi film? This movie was intended as a satire of both alien invasion flicks and cliched World War II movies. While not all the jokes worked, I found the movie throughly enjoyable, and so did several friends who watched it with me at a later date. Band&apos;s Empire Pictures did indeed make some real clunkers. But this is no clunker. This movie reunites most of the cast of the earlier Charles Band production &quot;Trancers.&quot; That movie was also a satire, though Band&apos;s direction was so flat it was hard to tell. Danny Bilson, who directed Zone Troopers, seems to understand the spirit of fun much better. Some of the movie&apos;s best bits have been mentioned by other posters, but I would add the beginning sequence when the young Lieutenant rashly runs over the hill thinking reinforcements have arrived, and is machine gunned by the Germans. &quot;Damn green kid,&quot; Thomerson (as the tough as nails NCO) mutters, in perfect deadpan echo of hundreds of B war movies of the late forties and early fifties. And did anyone catch the &quot;Buy War Bonds&quot; tag at the end of the credits? How about the fact that the first shot morphs from the cover of a comic book Mittens (Art Lefleur) is reading? That should have served as a hint of the filmmakers&apos; intentions. This movie is a hoot, and was intended that way. I have never seen Bilson&apos;s follow up, the Wrong Guys--equally low rated by most posters. But based on Zone Troopers, I sensed he might have the talent to go a long way. However, it appears he was only able to find a career in TV.",

And the cast... wow. Winona Ryder, Maya Angelou, Claire Danes and the debut of Jared Leto? That has to make it worth something.\n\nAnd actually, it was the cast that really made this enjoyable for me. I cared very little about the plot, and definitely did not care about the romances. Finn could be with her boyfriend, a foreign guy or whoever. I don&apos;t care who she picks. But the casting was excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a Japanese geisha? The answer is yes, with stunning beauty  and regrettable flaws.\n\nTruth be told, this movie was not as bad as its trailer led me to expect it to be. It had a story to tell (although it crumbles in the end),images to show, and material to present. There were ample displays of exquisite beauty -- the trailing tails of silk kimonos, the subtle allure of hand gestures, and the captivating scene of kabuki dance theater ... \n\nOn the other hand, the American director was not able to pull the Japanese out of Chinese actresses. (This movie was so crowded by famous Chinese idols that I found myself inadvertently searching for Joan Chen among the cast.) To be fair, all three main actors (Gong Li in particular) show strong performances that made me sympathetic to Rob Marshall&apos;s choices. However, they remain utterly Chinese throughout this movie. The look and accent are not the only problems. They lacked the kind of extreme femininity and excessive felicity of the delicately mechanical gesture and movements of traditional Japanese ladies you see in custom dramas of Japanese production. (Michelle Yeoh seems to be the only one trying a little bit of those, but it did not quite work for some reason.)\n\nSo, let me re-address the question: Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a geisha? The answer, I guess, really depends on what you are looking for. If you would like a little bit of delight from an aesthetically pleasing picture with a dubious authenticity and realism, this movie delivers it. I would not say Rob Marshall failed completely. Memoirs of a Geisha is not the first, nor the last, movie that subjects another culture to the crude lens of American exoticism. It definitely is not the worst one.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie more than the author of the highlighted review. I found the separations of family (real or surrogate) which take place several times in the movie very emotionally powerful. \n\nI assume the director&apos;s family did move to Los Angeles - in any event it does provide the greatest disparity with the rural Hungary for the young girl. As an Easterner, I kept wondering if they had moved to the New England countryside - or to any older rural area or city in much of the rest of the country - whether the differences for the young girl would have seemed so stark. \n\nI disagree with the highlighted review that suburban America of the 1950s was shown as cold - to the contrary the film shows neighbors welcoming the new family (even if, as I think quite realistic, they don&apos;t pay too much attention to the country they&apos;re from), friends gathering for barbeques, strangers returning little lost girls to their homes, children from different countries easily making friends. I thought America was shown as a pretty warm friendly place.\n\nOne problem I did have was that instead of finding the adolescent girl &quot;typical&quot; or acting as a result of her past, I thought she was a horrid brat - sullen, routinely refusing to speak when spoken to, flagrantly disobedient in leaving through windows too stay out through the night, drinking through the night with older boys, etc. \n\nI didn&apos;t sense that this WAS due to the long ago difficulty of adjustment, but was instead this girl&apos;s spoiled nature, her willfulness, her lack of obedience. (Nor do I think of it as a consequence of living in America). I was therefore completely sympathetic with Kinski&apos;s despair - only by Goldwyn&apos;s slowness to anger over her wretched behavior. I kept wondering why the family wasn&apos;t physically disciplining the child and treating the adolescent&apos;s &quot;I hate you&quot; statements&quot; with the contempt they deserved.\n\nI also disliked the withholding of information about the particular motivation for Kinski to leave Hungary for later dramatic effect. Even if the event is true, it was something that could have happened anywhere in the world - and therefore not particularly a reason to leave one country rather than another. Moreover, there was suficient reason for the family to wish to leave Hungary in any event.\n\nNastassia Kinski and Tony Goldwyn were wonderful - as was everyone - particularly the surrogate mother, the grandmother and the child at the heart of the movie. \n\nThis is a moving film - I do wish it had received more attention. It&apos;s well worth your time and rental fee."

      "reviewBody": "When I think of a documentary, two types come to mind. First would be the objective type. Or rather, one that provides information directly to the audience, in an entertaining and educational manner.\n\nA good example of this would be the well received &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, which many agree is quite informative and entertaining. It presents the audience with a concept, and then proceeds to tell a story that communicates a message clearly and concisely. In other words, with a documentary like &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, even for those who may have not liked it, there probably weren&apos;t many saying to themselves &quot;I&apos;m not sure I understand...?&quot; The second type is the genre that &quot;Young Yakuza&quot; falls in for me - the subjective type. Rather than presenting an idea directly to the audience, this type almost strictly relies on footage. Often without any narration or film crew interaction, characters are simply followed with a camera, and a story is told. In the end, leaving any conclusions or messages in the film up to the audience.\n\nMore often than not, subjective-type documentaries tend to suck. Although they may show the viewer a topic in a first-person light, they fail to actually be entertaining. And in the end, the term &quot;meh...&quot; comes to mind. And that&apos;s why I liked Young Yakuza so much - because it communicates as much information as a film like &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, in an entertaining way, without even telling you anything directly.In fact the film is so well shot, that at times, you forget you&apos;re watching a documentary at all.\n\nThere is no film crew interaction or narration in the film. Not only that, but don&apos;t be fooled by the &quot;a young, aimless man joins the Yakuza&quot; plot synopsis above. The director did an amazing job at setting up this film, and it simply could have been called &quot;Yakuza&quot;.\n\nExposing the audience to a view of modern Japanese culture, as well as a glimpse into the mysterious underworld of the Yakuza, this film is so much more than just a bunch of experts being interviewed about a criminal collective. In a way, you almost gain a respect for the infamous organization, as you follow one particular clan&apos;s trials &amp; tribulations to survive in a modern Japanese society.\n\nIn closing, I&apos;ll just say that you can think of this film like this: We&apos;ve all seen the Godfather, Casino, etc. And although the mafia does still exist, they certainly haven&apos;t done any specials on A&amp;E lately... If you&apos;ve ever wondered - &quot;What is it actually like?&quot; From an Eastern perspective, that&apos;s what this film is about.\n\nImagine that one of the &quot;mob bosses&quot; (for lack of a better term, lol) of today, allowed a film crew to follow them around and get a glimpse into the everyday workings of the organization. Well, that&apos;s what you will see here. It may not be as flashy as Hollywood depicts, but it&apos;s real. And thanks to the excellent production &amp; direction of this film, extremely entertaining. Highly recommended!",

I&apos;m amazed at how many people let their politics color their views of these movies. I also think people over think things rather than just allowing themselves to be entertained. I for one am glad they didn&apos;t tell us much of anything about the sniper. While apparently unfathomable in the 70&apos;s it seems pretty plausible today. I was not present when this happened but a gunman came into my church and killed 6 or 7 people before killing himself. The authorities came to learn a lot of useless details about the shooter but little or nothing to explain his motives or would give any type of solace to the grieving survivors. It was just random, senseless violence, like the shooter in this movie. I&apos;d liked to have had some more sympathetic victims and I couldn&apos;t get over how ill prepared the police where, but otherwise I liked this movie."

      "reviewBody": "After gaving us some of the greatest epic movies in the last 50 years,it was clear that filmmakers needed to take them to the next level. \n\nBut how can you make a new movie,for the audience to like,without recycling old material? \n\nAnswer:You improve what old filmmakers couldn&apos;t:Graphics. \n\nBen Hur,Braveheart,Gladiator,Spartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made today,no matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to reality,is bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven. \n\n300 doesn&apos;t apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow. \n\nJust like in the Lord of the Rings,much CGI was used here. \n\nThe result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye. \n\nAll the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparable,if not better,to the LOTR,go see for yourselves.\n\nI could write something about the plot or the actors&apos;s outstanding performances(especially Gerard Butler&apos;s..you see,being Greek-Italian,I wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyes,the fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek king),but I won&apos;t ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.\n\nBut always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this movie,must be prepared not for a historic movie,but for a stylish battle movie. \n\nThis movie,together with the LOTR,is the entrance to the 21st century&apos;s new epic movies. \n\nKudos to Zack Snyder,who came from nowhere and has,already from Dawn of the Dead,proved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.\n\nSo,you read my Comment?\n\nAren&apos;t you curious? \n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nRun to the nearest cinema,see this piece of art and when you are finished don&apos;t forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.\n\nC&apos;mon people!Hail for 300,the Evolution of Epic Battles!",

Definitely McDormand&apos;s best work outside of &quot;Fargo&quot;; her versatility and talent continue to amaze and impress. The producers&apos; choice of music is perfect and truly reflects the mood and tone of the film--it makes me want to go out and buy the soundtrack. :) Also, &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; shows how frail and tenuous life&apos;s relationships can be. By straying from the &quot;norms&quot; of his serious, medical student world, Bale understands his mother&apos;s complexities and foibles and thus establishes the bond with her that he has possibly sought all his life. Well done!! *** 1/2",

He&apos;s like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.\n\nActors are not bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she&apos;s always good, and here she&apos;s nothing more than such. She makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. In conclusion, nothing great at all. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.\n\nThis film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Maybe it&apos;s a delayed film? Well, even then it still would be below standard. The script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.\n\nDon&apos;t recommend, unless you&apos;re a big fan one of the starring actors.",

      "reviewBody": "(**1/2 out of *****)\n\nThis is the only movie in the slasher-slashes-girls-in-their-nighties series -- which includes the &quot;Slumber Party Massacre&quot; movies and Jim Wynorski&apos;s &quot;Hard to Die&quot; (he also directed the sequel to this one) -- that stands on its own.  It has nothing to do with the others, and, storywise, it&apos;s better.  Angela O&apos;Neill plays a traumatized college girl who has sleeping and waking nightmares about a madman who murdered his family, except for one sister (guess who it is), twelve years ago in the house that is now O&apos;Neill&apos;s sorority house. When she and three of her sorority sisters are left alone for the weekend, her dreams come true when the same nutcase escapes from the mental hospital and comes back home to finish the job.  I&apos;m not gonna lie to you -- this is far from great -- but, it is surprisingly suspenseful in parts, the characters are fairly likable, and, unlike most of these other movies, the script does a believably good job of keeping the girls trapped in the house. There is a silly dress-up montage (including the obligatory topless scenes), the obligatory false-scare climax (including a totally unnecessary final murder that ticked me off), and lots of scenes of knives going into stomachs and backs.  Otherwise, the T&amp;A is not as rampant as in the other nightie slashers, but the story is (slightly) more rewarding.\n\nHIGHLIGHT:  One sorority chic and her boyfriend are fooling around in a tent in the backyard when the killer ruins all their fun by slashing up the tent and stabbing the girl right between the -- well, not the eyes -- and her boyfriend ditches her and runs, screaming and buck-naked, back into the house."

      "reviewBody": "Wow! The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances.  Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti&apos;s debut film, i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film. The only other one of his i&apos;ve seen (at time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling visually than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful films i&apos;ve ever seen, but its story was not as involving as Ossessione. If you click on &quot;miscellaneous&quot; on this page&apos;s links, there are stills from the movie on those websites. They won&apos;t really do justice to the experience of the movie: such graceful camera movements, such beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such terrific characters, such a great story development, the first movie adapted from James M Cain&apos;s &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice.&quot;\n\nI can&apos;t believe this was made in 43, eight years before Brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The actors in this may not have used the method technique, ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves (i don&apos;t know anything about it) - but they&apos;re some of the best, most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema. Also, eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes, i&apos;m being superlative, but Ossessione was just that terrific.\n\nThe reason Ossessione didn&apos;t cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini, and re-cut in America. American audiences didn&apos;t see its full glory till 59, eight years AFTER Streetcar.\n\nI won&apos;t say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies i&apos;ve ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! Like another reviewer, i&apos;m going to buy it as soon as i can find it!",

      "reviewBody": "It was the same with Casshern and it will be the same with Goemon. At this moment, the film hasn&apos;t gotten as much exposure in the West but needless to say, when it does, the film community will be awash with disappointment and confusion. Why? I think it has a lot to do with the role of CGI in film today. Being largely the domain of larger Hollywood studios, the technology has been used as a means of replacing reality, emulating it to the point of near transparency. Jurrassic Park was one the first films to show that such a goal was even possible and effects have progressed so much further since then.\n\nIt therefore are that a Hollywood films attempt to use CGI for enhancing reality or making an entirely new reality of their own. Sin City was made outside of the studio system and perhaps that is why it was made at all. 300 was a valiant attempt as well at using CGI to create the actual fantastical. On the other side of the coin, Lord of the Rings, though amazing for its depiction of monsters and creatures of the imagination, ultimately had the purpose of bring THEM into OUR world.\n\nGOEMON, like Casshern, is an attempt to bring us into another world, similar to our own but in so many ways, different. The effects and design serve the purpose of creating an unreality of enhanced surreality, mimicking the pages of comic books and the frames of animation. Visually, it was never intended to fool the eye or make the fantastical &apos;real&apos;. Like its predecessor, it had loftier, more artistic goals. The question is, did the film reach them? In many ways it did, but in many, it fell short. In the running time of story, there is certainly no lack of sumptuous composition and stunning colour. The action is hyperactive and generally defies the rules of the real world, though they make total sense in the scheme of Goemon&apos;s. The sheer audacity of the large scale battles, especially in the last quarter, makes the viewer simultaneously bewildered and amazed. You have never seen this before outside of the imagination and the boundless universe of pen and paper. No Hollywood film would dare do it.\n\nAnd that is the film&apos;s dual strength and weakness. What it does is alien to a majority of film fans bred on Hollywood&apos;s particular brand. They have been fed so much in the way of safe challenges and formulaic product, that their first instinct is to rebel against any films cutting against the grain. The beauty of GOEMON is that it isn&apos;t a Hollywood picture and therefore doesn&apos;t need to apply itself to pleasing a conservative demographic who are otherwise unable to accept what the film ultimately creates.\n\nThat is not to say that it doesn&apos;t follow clichés and formulas of its own origin, but the presentation is fresh and eccentric enough to counter them. The whole is entirely a product of Japan. It reflects the culture&apos;s own eclectic, modern tastes while also preserving a filtered rendition of the old. It both revises and reinforces its subject matter, forming it into something that is Japan and at the same time, is not. It doesn&apos;t matter that most of the story never really happened. The vitality of the film is its lust for a life of its own and, its characters, while largely archetypal, serve the mythic aspects the story perfectly, because that is what myths are made of.\n\nGOEMON is a film that shouldn&apos;t be weighed against standards set outside its context. It is a film trying to shed the limitations forced upon it by a conservative industry and consuming public. It is a myth, a comic book, a video game, an animation, and an epic drama; it is a lush and inspirational &apos;other world&apos; and doesn&apos;t need to be constrained by our own. Films should not need to succumb to our ingrained demand for adherence to our reality. Go into the film with this in mind, and your imagination will be enriched by it. Be unable to let those strictures go, and I think that sadly, you will miss out.",

Purple Noon is an autopsy of a near-perfect crime, and a compelling look at the man who commits it. One of Purple Noon&apos;s most obvious assets is Delon&apos;s acting. Tom is fascinating because Delon makes him so. This isn&apos;t a run-of-the-mill villain; he&apos;s a complex character with a well thought-out reason for everything he does. In addition to Delon&apos;s fine performance, Purple Noon is characterized by expert camerawork and crisp direction. Clement understands how to sustain tension without drawing it out too far. The film is exactly the right length, as are each of the individual scenes. There&apos;s nothing so engrossing as watching a truly intelligent thriller, and that makes this film a rare treat. If you enjoy atmospheric high intelligence content and aren&apos;t put off by subtitles, then you can&apos;t spend a better hour and a half than watching this movie."

But look at the date.  1984.  So when John Hughes was messing about with teen - movies and the USA thought Tootsie was one of the greatest films of all time, Oz had greater concerns.  Almost creating its own genre - the pre-apocalyptic movie - this film deftly shows what would actually happen in case of such an emergency.  Nothing much.  People would still go on dates.  They&apos;d probably hang out.  Some sex might go on. Then everyone might die.  What&apos;s so lovely about this film, is that they are real people.  You can&apos;t really tell them apart.  They don&apos;t have stereotypes.  In fact only the navy officer really stands out.  We like them because they are like us.  If I was in that situation, I&apos;d probably go a bit stir crazy.  If you happen to see this film around, do go see - if nothing else you get to see what the Sydney Opera House looks like at night when everyone&apos;s gone home . . ."

She was struck by the genuineness of Lucia Brawley&apos;s performance; in my wife&apos;s words, &quot;she was three-dimensional.&quot; I agree. Though portions of the plot take dips into darker human emotion and character, Lora&apos;s smile and the subtle crescendo of love keep the movie out of the melancholic. Unlike a previous commenter, I had no trouble with Lucia&apos;s lack of Hungarian dialogue nor did it seem like the language issue effected the cast. In fact, there seemed to be real chemistry amongst the cast which made for a overall cohesion storyline and energy. As viewers we have very little insight into the whys of filmaking perhaps we should be more concerned with the end product. If the dubbing was distracting to some I suspect that the subtitles were to others. Too often we get caught up in searching for imperfection and identifying things we disagree with, i.e. a movie&apos;s use of liberal imagery, subtitling or dubbing. Too bad...because you missed a great movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;X-Men&quot; is a rare treat-- a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark.\n\nAlong with Tim Burton&apos;s &quot;Batman&quot;, this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies.  It&apos;s a genre that&apos;s usually synonymous with silly, campy, cartoonish crap, but Bryan Singer delivers a long-awaited exception to the rule.  &quot;X-Men&quot; is smart, stylish, and very cool... one of the better sci fi/fantasy films of the last decade.\n\nOf course, it helps to have good source material.\n\nThe X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as &quot;Superman&quot; where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a well-crafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutants--struggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain, Magneto, isn&apos;t an evil lunatic-- he&apos;s a sympathetic character, a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier&apos;s Martin Luther King. The iconic character, Wolverine, is a beer-swilling anti-hero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.\n\nRather than making just another flashy explosion-per-minute-special-effects-extravaganza, Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result, the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, is fantastic--a bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  (Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.)\n\nHard-core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming them--she would not realistically act like a confident, sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.\n\nIn the end, &quot;X-Men&quot; is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble, the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous take-over-the-world scheme, and names like &quot;Magneto&quot; are spoken with a straight face.  Don&apos;t read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don&apos;t underestimate &quot;X-Men&quot; either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic.",

      "reviewBody": "Initially it was my intention to dedicate my month-long Oscar marathon to catching up solely with winners but the sudden passing of Austrian actor/writer/director Maximilian Schell on its very first day soon dispelled those plans! Schell, already an acting Oscar winner at the start of the 1960s, went behind the camera towards the end of that same decade and his directorial debut – FIRST LOVE (1970) which, sadly, is unavailable for viewing at this juncture – immediately earned him a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nomination; the film under review is his sophomore effort and it was equally recognized by the Academy and, even though it lost out to François Truffaut&apos;s delightful film-making classic DAY FOR NIGHT (1973) on this occasion, it emerged victorious at the Golden Globes.\n\nBringing former Nazi officials to justice has been an ongoing worldwide quest ever since the 1947 Nuremberg trials; it is perhaps not coincidental that Maximilian Schell not only won his sole acting Oscar for a fictional, star-studded reenactment of that infamous event but that he tackled the subject again when he became a director. Curiously enough, while he does appear as an actor in THE PEDESTRIAN, his is only a star cameo as the dead son of a German industrialist targeted by his surviving Greek subjects 30 years after the retaliatory massacre of their village populace. However, Schell did appear as hunted ex-Nazis in such Hollywood indictments as THE ODESSA FILE (1974) and THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH (1975; which garnered him another Best Actor nod and a viewing of which will follow presently) before essaying yet another proud Nazi officer in Sam Peckinpah&apos;s CROSS OF IRON (1977).\n\nThe central character of THE PEDESTRIAN – so called because his reckless steering costs him his driving license and the life of his son (Schell) – is played by Gustav Rudolf Sellner and, although it is the first time I have heard of him or seen his work (in fact, this was his screen debut in that capacity as he is also a director of TV movies), his sensitive portrayal is a quietly impressive one that was recognized at that year&apos;s German Film Awards; typically, he is shown leading a double life even on a personal level by keeping a much-younger mistress! Amusingly, at one point, Sellner&apos;s younger, rebellious, hippie son is also shown catching a TV screening of the classic Bolivian film BLOOD OF THE CONDOR (1969). Schell&apos;s treatment of the somber material (including potentially disturbing footage of road accident victims which the felonious drivers are forced to watch as part of their &apos;rehabilitation&apos; process!) is predictably heavy-going if occasionally brilliant, relying on several flashbacks to the all- important WWII and car crash episodes. Even so, the unexpected highlight of the film turns out to be a couple of sequences set in an old people&apos;s home where Sellner&apos;s wife reminisces with her elderly friends that are (unaccountably but delightfully) played by such acting veterans as Peggy Ashcroft, Elizabeth Bergner, Lil Dagover and Françoise Rosay! ...",

He books himself in at an hotel and orders in a prostitute. He is set to kill her and then himself but then loses his nerve and flees. Two years later he runs into her again.\n\nHad potential. The story arc was quite poetic, initially, and looked set to go somewhere profound. However, the story was never entirely engaging and there are sub-plots and scenes that go nowhere and slow down the pace of the movie.\n\nMoreover, the poetic development didn&apos;t really convert into a profound ending. Ending is more Pretty Woman than Shakespeare - quite conventional. (And yes, I know Pretty Woman was released after this movie, but Pretty Woman was pretty derivative itself).\n\nUltimately quite weak, and disappointing.",

Once the Pearl Harbor attack gets underway, it becomes an engrossing and poignant depiction of men-in-war facing insurmountable odds; the downbeat ending was quite fresh at the time and seems to have led to a spate of similarly pessimistic WWII movies like BATAAN (1943), SAHARA (1943), THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (1945), etc.",

There&apos;s nothing new in his cinema and this is perhaps the only problem, that everything is well known yet; this is the first time that happens and today i think i have enjoyed very much the film but maybe it&apos;s time to spin around again and cut across another new ground.

I was worried that I would have to see 27 weddings in the film, but fortunately I did not. Normally, in a romantic comedy it does not require much acting, but Katherine Heigl manages to put in good acting to portray her jealousy towards her sister. Katherine Heigl is sweet and adorable, and she has a quality that makes the viewers connect to her.\n\nThough the romance subplot is predictable, it story is saved by the rivalry and jealousy between sisters. This subplot is told in a tabloid way, which is fun and entertaining. The ending, which features a lot of dresses, is sweet and symbolically complete. &quot;27 Dresses&quot; provides adequate brain off entertainment for the family."

      "reviewBody": "P. P. Rider is even better than his first two films which I felt were already masterfully executed. The pace is brisker. The shots tighter and more ballet like, cycling across multiple crammed compositions in almost every single scene, with several sequences you must see to believe. Yet it&apos;s always hitting storytelling or emotional beats.\n\nI love the sheer irreverence here, and how he crosses humanism with formalism, while letting it function through performance as a theater. Every interest he has on screen reads for us. You almost don&apos;t want to imagine cinema any other way. That is the mark of a director who reinvents the language.\n\nThe film is such a romp. I loved the fireworks out the window in the samurai sword bit, and how the director does not even try to keep the projection fixed. This kind of creative anarchy shows a total lack of pretentiousness. The boy band number--really by that point it is just an exercise of how far he and the performers can take a scene. Because unbroken scenes become feats. Those funny police men. And then this idea of this monster of a bully completely humiliated across its entire running time is a kind of hilarious revenge for us.\n\nI have been on a French New Wave kick before these and this is like Truffaut times five. This just takes all that energy, playfulness and style way farther, and how impossible it does this through the very opposite style of the fantastical, through a gritty realism.\n\nIf there is a criticism it is that the Kurosawa-like mania of the piece may take away from the peaks of his earlier slowburns, and the soul of them. I came away from his first two films far more moved. But gradually I see an artist in Somai who is a master, restlessly trying to upstage himself and constantly coming up big.",

Manicheic rule is not best solution. but , more that, it is a lesson about Georgia existence. crumbs from Cold War, drops of friendship and heroism, cruelty in pure form, pieces of fake moments are ingredients of movie but not its essence. the American style to present fight of David against Goliath is only cloth for a profound story about hidden monsters. in fact, a cry of a lost world for who history is just bad wolf out of rules."

Some people may find scenes excruciatingly long, but I&apos;ve enjoyed every moment of it and the journey the director wants to convey in this movie. You must know that you need this arduous shots to feel the emotions of the characters in the movie. The sex scenes are tastefully done, not vulgar, and the gratuitous frontal nudity is significant (in one scene, main actor examines his body/self on the mirror). I&apos;ve always admired Latin cinema movie-making as mostly they always get the right texture and lighting for their 35 mm. movie. In totality, it&apos;s one of the best films I&apos;ve seen during L.A. OUTFEST 2006 (next to movies: &quot;A Love to Hide,&quot; &quot;Boy Culture&quot; and &quot;The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros&quot;). -- Oliver Carnay",

I and many others like me repeatedly viewed this film throughout childhood and still love it just as much now as then. Nowadays, a new viewer who is past puberty will regard it with a more skeptical eye, comparing it to things it shouldn&apos;t be compared to. Some newcomers might get it right away, but I don&apos;t think they get the same thrill out of it as they might have as a child in the eighties. That&apos;s why this film needs to be shared with children (especially boys), who hopefully won&apos;t be too jaded by flashy nineties schlock to be impressed, which I think is exactly the problem for adults who are new to the movie. Perhaps it can&apos;t be taught, the reverence I mean, but the movie isn&apos;t any less fun and awesome for new viewers, just less magical. I would rate it with stars or something but that&apos;s like trying to grade your own religion. I love you, Mr. Burton."

      "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to see a dubbed or subtitled (in English) version of this Russian film. However, I consider &quot;Tumannost Andromedy&quot; (&quot;The Andromeda Nebula&quot;) as one of the best sci-fi flicks dealing with space exploration, regardless. The plot, being very similar to another East European film, the Czech &quot;Ikarie XB1, is about a long-duration spaceflight to a nearby star, Epsilon Tucanea [or something, like that], in the year 3000.\n\nThe spaceship interior, just like in &quot;Ikaria&quot;, is very well-designed (there is even a swimming pool in the recreation hall], and once the astronauts land on a dark planet, the film features excellent special effects. The film&apos;s ludicrous and bombastic communist ideology should be overlooked, but the story [by A. Yefremov, who was also a planetologist by trade, so he really knew about astronomy and space] is rather intriguing. It is also nice to see the future Earth, where the air and waters are clean, and people live in harmony. (Nowadays, especially when seeing the contemporary cinema, it probably sounds rather corny - unfortunately...)\n\nIt seems, however, that this film is only the first of a planned two-part sequence (&quot;Part 1: Prisoners of the Iron Star&quot; [in Russian, of course] is being clearly stated at the beginning of the film), and the second part was never finished - probably because of the film&apos;s unfavourable reception. Nevertheless, I have found this film being very unique and atmospheric, even in its unfinished form and with its original language. (In used bookstores, the book [&quot;Andromeda - A Space Age Tale&quot;], upon which the film was based, is widely available.)",

      "name": "A touching and beautiful conclusion to Veber&apos;s &quot;Depardieu/Richard&quot; trilogy ...",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Fugitives&quot; marks Francis Veber&apos;s last collaboration with the Pierre Richard – Gérard Depardieu duo and the last opus of an unofficial trilogy that started with &quot;The Goat&quot;. For information, the second one, &quot;ComDads&quot; earned a César nomination for Gérard Depardieu in the Best Actor category and one for Veber for Best Screenplay. &quot;The Fugitives&quot;&apos;s screenplay was also César-nominated, so was the performance of Jean Carmet for Best Supporting Actor, and if not better than &quot;The Goat&quot;, the film beautifully concludes the misadventures of the oddest yet most defining duos of French Comedy.\n\nIndeed, the 60&apos;s had Louis de Funès and Bourvil, the hot-tempered middle-aged man and the lovable idiot, the 80&apos;s would have Pierre Richard and Gérard Depardieu, the likable loser and the no-nonsense tough guy, a formula that proved to be successful in the three movies. The word &apos;formula&apos; is less meant to diminish Veber &apos;s creativity than to highlight his writing talent, as he builds similar plots from totally different situations and manage to make something fresh out of a usual comical material, which mostly relies on the opposition between the two leads leading to some chaotic situations, but it&apos;s only from Veber&apos;s chaos that something positive can finally rise.\n\nIn the first two movies, Depardieu and Richard were hired to look for someone who disappeared, the unlucky daughter of a rich businessman, the runaway son of an ex-youth&apos;s love, and at the end a very precious lesson about life and acceptance predominated the resolution of the plot. In &quot;The Fugitives&quot;, the plot begins with a more dramatic tone. Depardieu plays Lucas, an ex-bank robber released from jail after a five-year sentence and Richard is François Pignon, an unemployed widower, and the father of a 6-year old little daughter, pushed by circumstances to accomplish one of the most pathetic bank robberies that ever disgraced the silver screen, so he can get the money to flee, otherwise his sickly daughter Jeanne, would be put in an orphan. There is a strange and cleverly written parallel between Lucas and Pignon, one is an ex-criminal who wants to go straight while the other, although well-intentioned, becomes a criminal. Talk about a perfect timing to meet each other.\n\nIndeed, the plot reveals its clever intricacy when Pignon decides to take one hostage and of course, his eyes go immediately to Lucas who only came to open an account and put the money he got from selling his gold watch. Right before the robbery, we see Lucas harassed by the Police Chief who counts on another arrest for his promotion, but Depardieu, with a remarkable talent, beautifully embodies the sincerity of a man who wants to get straight and means it. So when he&apos;s chosen as the hostage, aware of the confusion it will place in the Chief&apos;s mind, he gently whispers &quot;can&apos;t you take another?&quot; Of course, there would have been no story if Pignon followed his advice. Naturally, Pignon disobeys and what comes next confirms Lucas&apos; fears as he&apos;s forced to play the robber for his own safety. Accidentally shooting at his leg when they try to escape, Pignon puts the ill-fated Lucas in a situation where he will have to depend on him for a while. The story takes off.\n\nPignon sends Lucas to Jean Carmet; a doctor who happens to be more competent with animals, one of the film&apos;s best moments when he talks to him as if he was a dog (probably lost in translation, because the word for &apos;bullet&apos; is the same as &apos;ball&apos;) However, the middle act of the film strikes by a certain dryness of gags, and a storyline getting more serious and more pathetic. The name &apos;Pignon&apos; doesn&apos;t epitomize the idea of the lovable loser that would become a character&apos;s trademark in most Veber movies, this time, the film is borderline a poignant drama. But while Pignon struggles to get the papers and ask for a corrupt individual named Lahbib to help him, another storyline develops in a slow but beautiful way. Lucas lies in the doctor&apos;s bed and Jeanne takes care of film, she doesn&apos;t speak a word since her mother died. Lucas&apos; contempt for Pignon is constant during the two thirds of the film but it&apos;s compensated by the growing fondness he has on Jeanne. The little girl is convincing in the role of a sad wounded heart and plays as the perfect &apos;third&apos; emotional link for the duo.\n\nAnd it&apos;s not surprising that she would play a very pivotal role in the evolution of Lucas and Pignon&apos;s, friendlier in what seems to be a farewell scene, beautifully written by Francis Veber. She found a great fatherly figure in Lucas, possessing whatever is lacking in his father, and she can imagine having a future with both of them. Maybe the film suffers from too much emotionality that distracts from its original comedic purpose and I might agree with that, except that &quot;The Fugitives&quot; totally redeems itself in the last twenty minutes. The final act of &quot;The Fugitives&quot; is on the same level of comedic genius as &quot;The Goat&quot;, even better sometimes, in fact, it gets funnier one scene after another with a level of slapstick and comedy of situation you wouldn&apos;t have expected after such a dramatic set-up. Maybe the film got too emotional at some parts, but the pay-off was worth it. And at least, it didn&apos;t forget to be a comedy.\n\n&quot;The Fugitives&quot; is the cinematic proof that the effect a film can have on you mostly depends on the last part, that&apos;s why it should be judged till the end to be properly judged, and at the end, it&apos;s impossible to resist to this trio, this good-hearted bear, this funny-looking clown and this adorable little girl. The film beautifully balance between laughs and emotion until a magnificent finale transcended by Wladimir Cosma&apos;s score, one of his best, while we see the duo disappearing in the landscape, for the last time.",

The fine thing about this movie from the 80s is that it works on two levels. First you can watch it as a slapstick comedy and you will greatly enjoy Didi Hallervordens very own way of messing up offices and business meetings. But the movie is also a very clever piece of satire about business managers and their way of talking and behaving. That&apos;s the reason why I loved this movie as a kid and I&apos;m enjoying it even more when I watch it now. Obviously Dieter Hallervorden had a great time making this movie. His acting is simply superb, both as clumsy barkeeper Bruno Koob and as the cold and cynical businessman Hans Immer. The script is one of the funniest in German movie history and the story (taking a lot of surprising turns) manages to keep suspense at a high level throughout the whole movie. You won&apos;t meet a single German that grew up in the 80s who can&apos;t quote some lines from this German movie classic.",

Kanye West has a bipolar disorder for example. Not something easy to live with - not for him and not for anyone else close to him.\n\nAnd sometimes not even that close to him. The acting is superb and if it the first feature film of the director ... wow, very well done. A great drama with good acting with a limited budget (I&apos;m assuming but I&apos;m confident that is the case) is quite a feat ... even more so if you can pull it off in Germany (imho).\n\nThe pacing is good and while the movie would probably be scorned because of the sex and nudity (not that much if you think about it, but too much for the MPAA I assume), try not to fixate on that. It is a means to an end. And the scenes mean something - to the character(s)",

      "reviewBody": "What a beautiful film portrayal. Though this movie is slow-paced it is worth the effort to get involved viewing it. Lancaster and Malden are perfect antagonists on screen. The tenderness and gentleness shown to the birds by the inmates in the prison contrasts not only the harsh prison environment accompanied by the violent existence of everyday life but also the inner characters&apos; of the prisoners&apos; themselves whose tough exteriors mask the gentle love that surfaces when the birds are introduced into Robert Stroud&apos;s cell. Telly Savalas is in his element when this coarse and tough brute is elevated to tender emotions he thought did not exist in himself anymore after spending most of his life behind prison walls. This film has had a direct impact on my life as Robert Stroud&apos;s book on Bird diseases and their treatments have cured my own flock from ailments from time to time and I am so grateful for his brilliant common sense approach to disease and medicine. This is a brilliant film that I thoroughly enjoy each time I watch it. John Frankenheimer - where are you when we need you?",

Only in France, and thank God for it. All the cast are brilliant - charming and charismatic; the production design looks like a psychedelic gingerbread house; the score is exceptional; the singing genuinely heart-felt and moving; and the whole thing is carried off with such effortless confidence and unreserved joy that it&apos;s impossible not to fall in love with it.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, it&apos;s amazing now to see how young, baby-faced and gauche Charlie Sheen looks from this distance in time, particularly when he&apos;s trying to hit on Daryl Hannah.\n\nIn today&apos;s dumbed down movie world, Gordon Gekko could have been scripted and played exactly the same except for one thing: you&apos;d never see the scene when he suddenly stops to admire the ocean at dawn.  Fortunately Michael Douglas clearly added his own dimensions to the character whom, if left to Stone, would have been a cardboard money-grabber.  As far as Stone is concerned Gekko wants money for its own sake, but Michael Douglas manages to evince a man who revels in the power and influence that money gets him. Stone&apos;s dialogue actually undercuts this perception on occasion, as when Bud Fox yells at Gekko, &quot;How many yachts can you sail!?&quot;, and when Gekko, enticing Fox by outlining how rich he could be, says, &quot;Rich enough to have your own jet&quot; - as if owning a jet wasn&apos;t the minimum accoutrement you&apos;d expect from the least successful company director or minor pop star.  Other infelicities in the script include the moment when Stone wanted to signal that Bud Fox has reached the peak of success and found it empty: following the montage of the condo purchase and decoration, the perfect meal for two, culminating in making love to Daryl Hannah, Stone has Fox standing on his balcony, and apropos of nothing at all, he just says, &quot;Who am I?&quot;  It has to be said that Sheen wasn&apos;t really up to the task of delivering this atrocious line.\n\nI&apos;ve rarely seen a film in which the female lead was so comprehensively abandoned by the director.  Stone clearly wanted to focus all his attention on Sheen and crucially on Douglas, leaving Hannah floundering and unable to clearly express just how much into Bud Fox her character is at any one time. At the final break-up you almost hear Stone&apos;s sigh of relief at being able to get rid of the irrelevant female (probably forced on him by the studio) and concentrate on the man&apos;s world of stockbroking.\n\nI seem to be finding a lot of flaws in what is basically a most compelling and watchable film. Despite the complex jargon-riddled technicalities of the subject matter, the movie&apos;s plot grabs hold of the viewer from the first scene and never lets go.  Of course Douglas dominates most of the movie, until Fox sr. (Sheen sr.) throws the spanner in the works of his son&apos;s airline deal.  Thank heavens Charlie Sheen took the unbelievably courageous decision to have his own father (instead of Jack Lemmon) play his character&apos;s father because the two of them perform an absolute barnstormer of a scene in which every word, inflexion and facial expression is repleat with absolute truth; and it&apos;s all the more poignant considering Charlie Sheen&apos;s own personal difficulties which faced him in later years, and the well-publicised ups and downs of his relationship with Martin as a result. Had those troubled times preceded this movie, it&apos;s hard to imagine the performances could have been any different - that&apos;s how good they are.\n\nFantastic character support comes from Hal Holbrook, the always reliable Saul Rubinek and John C. McGinley (who does not seem to have changed at all in the intervening years!), a young James Spader and the magisterial Terence Stamp who understands the unutterable menace with which it is possible to lace the single word &quot;Mate&quot;."

Just when I was losing interest, I began to realize that I was watching a loose remake of &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, the great Humphrey Bogart-Walter Huston movie from 1948, one of my favorites.\n\nI think the scene where the old man began dancing a jig and laughing crazily after finding the &quot;precious&quot; ore tipped me off.   Although it was set on an asteroid, the plot was basically the same.

      "reviewBody": "I have an interest to declare. Sir John Betjeman was a cousin of mine. Admittedly, he was not a first cousin, but a distant cousin of my grandfather, and I never actually met him. He is, however, about the only celebrity I can claim as a kinsman, so I have always felt an interest in him. Another thing we have in common is a passion for churches, dating back to our childhoods. In this film Betjeman attributes his passion to an incident in which his father pointed out the tower of St Peter&apos;s church, Belaugh, Norfolk, during a family holiday. I cannot date my passion to anything quite so specific, but I would say that it dates back to around the time in the seventies when this programme was being shown, and my own father (a keen church explorer himself) and family holidays doubtless had a lot to do with it.\n\n&quot;A Passion for Churches&quot; was intended as a follow-up to Betjeman&apos;s earlier documentary &quot;Metro-land&quot; from the previous year, in which he explored the world of North London suburbia. Edward Mirzoeff, who had produced and directed &quot;Metro-land&quot;, began looking for a subject for another documentary he could make with the poet, and settled on churches because they are a frequent theme in Betjeman&apos;s poetry. All the churches shown here are in the Anglican Diocese of Norwich, which covers most of Norfolk and a small part of Suffolk. The area may have been chosen because of Betjeman&apos;s childhood experience, but also because East Anglia, the most densely populated part of England in the Middle Ages, is particularly rich in mediaeval churches.\n\nFor the most part Betjeman does not concentrate on his great enthusiasm, church architecture, probably because he realised that this subject would be of limited interest to the majority of his audience. His main focus is rather on various services and other events taking place in the churches of Norfolk- a baptism, a wedding, a Sunday school, bell-ringing, a Mothers&apos; Union meeting, a pilgrimage to Walsingham, and so on. (The groom at the wedding, Nigel McCulloch, was himself a clergyman, and later became a bishop). There are also sections dealing with clergymen with unusual missions, such as the Chaplain of the Missions to Seamen, Great Yarmouth, shown visiting a lightship, and with redundant churches. The film ends with shots of people around the country going to their churches for the Easter Sunday services.\n\nDespite Betjeman&apos;s obvious enthusiasm for his subject, however, &quot;A Passion for Churches&quot; has never really taken on the status of a classic piece of television in the same way as &quot;Metro-Land&quot; has. Betjeman&apos;s biographer A. N. Wilson said of the latter that it was &quot;too good to be described simply as a programme&quot;; it can be described as a poetic meditation on what might not normally be though of as a poetic subject, life in twentieth-century suburbia, a subject which in anyone else&apos;s hands would probably not have interested me very much. &quot;A Passion for Churches&quot;, by contrast, combines two subjects of great interest to me- churches and Betjeman&apos;s poetry- but I suspect that anyone who does not share my enthusiasm for these matters will not find a lot to enjoy here. 7/10.",

A precious gift about meaning of life and meanings of visits, about the games of children and problems of adults, about joy and the shadows of sadness, about a venerable manner and the lady helping him in ordinary problems.\n\nNostalgia ? Off course, but it represents more and , scene by scene, you feel it.\n\nA beautiful film as a precious circle of emotions."

      "reviewBody": "The French film La femme de l&apos;aviateur (1981) was shown in the U. S. with the translated title The Aviator&apos;s Wife. It was written and directed by Éric Rohmer.\n\nPhilippe Marlaud plays François, a young man who works at the post office while studying for law school. His girlfriend, Anne, is portrayed by Marie Rivière .\n\nThe relationship between François and Anne doesn&apos;t make sense. François is a decent, friendly guy. Anne is a sour, dissatisfied, misanthrope.\n\nAll of the characters in Rohmer&apos;s films talk and talk, and that&apos;s what we get in the first third and last third of the movie.\n\nHowever, the film comes to life in the middle third, when Eric meets Lucie, portrayed perfectly by Anne-Laure Meury. They talk as well, but they also have sequences in a park where something actually happens.\n\nThere&apos;s no way that a romance could be sparked. In the film, Lucie is 15. Yes, she has a great outlook on life and is very creative. Still, she&apos;s 15 and Eric is 20, so the relationship couldn&apos;t work. However, the chemistry is there, and while Meury is on screen, the movie really is effective.\n\nRohmer was the last of the famous French New Wave directors. All of his &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot; films range from excellent to superb. When he had finished the six movies, he moved to three &quot;Comedies and Proverbs.&quot; The Aviator&apos;s Wife was the first of these.\n\nThe film has a solid IMDb rating of 7.5. I would have rated it a 10 if Rohmer had showed us more of the relationship between François and Lucie. However, that&apos;s not the movie that Rohmer wrote and directed. I gave that movie an 8.",

The plot is very hard to follow and the action scenes comes only in bits (when they come are cool with gore and blood, but its a very talkie movie, and the dialogs sucks. Premutos was a great low budget movie. Then Ittembach entered more mainstream. The &quot;fromdusktilldawnesque&quot; Legion of the Dead was pretty cool and entertaining, but stuff like this or Riverplay make me think if i will watch a new Ittembach movie. 4/10 for the good productions values only."

      "reviewBody": "I owned this film for 8 months but did not see it because of all the negative hype on the board. Then I took the plunge. First off let me say that I was not a great Saratchandra admirer. His stories (except SWAMI) mostly portrayed women as weak minded, subservient (maybe true to the time, but not to be admired), and men as weak and mostly well bred but not well educated. I had no real recollection of the story as written. And, not being a great Dilip Kumar fan, I never watched the old version. So, I have no comparisons to draw, no plot line differences to talk about.\n\nI came away moved by the tragic love story that unfolded. It was not flawless, most Bollywood movies are not.\n\nNegatives - the sets were beautiful but over the top, ditto for the costumes. The duo dance was a great way to compare Aish vs Madhuri dancing skills (both were pretty even matched for me) but in the story line it was quite silly and should not have been there. There was no real need for the the two to meet, but this was Mr, Bhansali&apos;s directorial license. Chandramukhi&apos;s kotha and environs were lifted straight from Pakeezah, which was a very stylized movie and not authentic.\n\nPositives: Shahrukh Khan gave a very restrained performance, the silent tears accompanied with an anguish that only his eyes portrayed was a real departure from the screwed-up face crying. He was very very good in the drunk bits, very good in the anguished bits. It is remarkable how much this actor is accused of being typecast when every other year he pulls out an amazing performance - Dil Se (1998), Asoka (2001) and Devdas (2002) are all departures from his usual typecast romantic hero image. Recent roles in Swades and KANK are even more varied. The detractors will keep saying he overacted, or he portrayed no emotions, for me this was a truly great role as an anguished lover. Mr. Khan - your best actor award for this role in Devdas was well deserved.\n\nMadhuri - what can one say about this truly great icon? She was amazing, you felt her pain, her caring, her selfless love, the moments between her and Shahrukh sizzled. And her dancing was brilliant.\n\nAish - was a bit wooden at times, but not always. She had a chemistry with Shahrukh that was understated until she was beyond his reach, but come on - the woman looks amazing, is there any doubt that a hundred Devdas types are dying for her?? She was better as the movie progressed to the more serious part.\n\nThe movie went into an emotional downward spiral a third of the way in and I sat there moved and almost crying for these tortured souls the rest of the two hours.\n\nThe movie was eye candy in the sets and costumes department. The two leading ladies were stunning, Shahrukh was easy on the eye, yet there was something that did detract from this being a great film. Upon much thinking I have come to the conclusion that it was the over the top beauty of everything that really made everything a little unreal for me. How could such perfect people have such imperfect lives? In essence the little black mark on the lip was missing and that left me a little dissatisfied.\n\nIf Mr. Bhansali had stated that this was an adaptation from the original novel, people would forgive him the fact that Devdas in his version is a mature man and knows his mind (although fails to act decisively on it), and the fact that an aristocratic lady visits a courtesan&apos;s establishment and the two dance together.\n\nIf you do not compare with what did or did not come before, this was an intense emotional experience, anchored by great performances from Shahrukh, Madhuri and yes, even Aish.",

On retrospect, I am glad that I did so and also persisted, even though I hadn&apos;t ever heard of it before. \n\nThe movie poignantly deals with the subject of loneliness in forms that range from early adult disenchantment, midlife crisis to teenage angst. This emotional theme is depicted through the life of 3 sisters - Johanna, Ali and Mathilda, revolving around the struggles they are undergoing in their personal relationships. As such, every single character in the movie acted brilliantly and the language barrier did not remain imposing enough for me to understand and appreciate this work. In fact, I am quite inclined to watch other works of the director Vanessa Jopp now.",

      "reviewBody": "The Darkest Minds is the latest teen sci-fi franchise alike Hunger Games, Divergent, Twilight, The Host etc etc etc and alike the majority of them will never be a fully told story.\n\nIt tells the tale of a world where 90% of kids die leaving the remaining ones with a selection of super powers (For some unexplained reason). The government rounds them up and incarcerates them out of fear killing off the more powerful ones.\n\nIt follows the tale of one girl who is smuggled out and goes on the run. But who can she trust?\n\nPersonally I loved the concept, such potential! Under the circumstances a television series would have made a tremendous amount more sense as I think this is all we&apos;re ever going to see from the Darkest Minds universe.\n\nOur leading lady is fantastic, truly stellar performance and it wasn&apos;t until late in the film I realised it was Rue from the Hunger Games (2012) all grown up. Alongside her we have the excellent Bradley Whitford, Wade Williams, Mandy Moore and Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie (Though all of them are rather brief).\n\nOne thing that struck me was the leading man Harris Dickinson, he just wasn&apos;t up to the job in any respect and felt like a weak link throughout. I can&apos;t imagine how he got the job and question castings logic with that one.\n\nThe main issue with the movie is that it&apos;s the same as the rest. What I mean by that is these teen sci-fi types take a concept and then surround it by the usual tropes that are so blatant and so excessive it damages them beyond repair. This made the film cliched beyond words and criminally predictible.\n\nAll things considered it could be worse but all the teen sci-fi tropes, the fact this is all we&apos;ll get and thus leaving us with an incomplete story and a weak leading man stopped any potential it had dead in its tracks.\n\nGreat for what it is and I see the appeal, but this is to the movie industry what pop is to the music industry.\n\nThe Good:\n\nAmandla Stenberg\n\nDecent supporting cast\n\nSome very good ideas\n\nHearts in the right place\n\nThe Bad:\n\nToo many tropes\n\nVery cliched\n\nHarris Dickinson\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nHollywood needs to go back to the drawing board on this genre\n\nA world without kids sounds like my kind of place",

Elements of classics like &quot;Stand by Me&quot; keep the film grounded even as some of the plot developments get a bit far-fetched.\n\nThe acting is a huge plus here, with Annabella Sciora (getting more and more enchanting and beautiful with age), Jayne Atkinson (brutal, honest, and gut-wrenching as the grieving mother of the dead child), and Connor Donovan (in duel leads as the dead boy and his conflicted twin brother) highlighting the excellent ensemble. Cuesta&apos;s surprisingly subtle direction somehow manages to avoid both the salacious tendencies of a Larry Clark film and the annoyingly overt quirkiness of similarly themed films like &quot;Me and You and Everyone we Know&quot; to deliver a profound and perplexing tale of coming-of-age, revenge and loneliness.",

This western could be compared to CIMARRON, both versions, Wesley Ruggles and Anthony Mann, about the depiction of conquest of the West. The true, genuine story of America. It is a western that you can&apos;t miss, if you are a western lover, and not only. It is awesome, brilliant, riveting, splendidly made, with great spectacular sequences, such as the unavoidable indian attack which is really spectacular, especially for this period. The copy I watched was awesome in quality. It is available on you tube, so don&apos;t miss this opportunity to see this western made jawdropping on locations."

The cinematography, the period costumes, the landscapes and the sets were masterfully done in exacting details giving the movie a genuine feel of the period (Late Imperial China during the Boxer Rebellion). It is an historical drama as well as a tragic love story telling of a pivotal time in a family. The gravity of the film never lets up and the drama is, at some points, a bit over the top but the subject matter, the crumbling of a banking family by external and internal problems, is a heavy one. This movie comes with some very harsh scenes and will not be for everyone but those who enjoy well shot, well acted (if not a bit over the top on the drama), and well set period pieces with a touch of history will like the movie. I did.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Crossing the Line&apos; is a brilliant documentary of the life of Pfc James Dresnok since he defected as a young US soldier to North Korea in the mid-Sixties. He is said to be the only such living defector left in that country today. The two British men who made this film, it seems, were only given permission to do so as they had previously made a popular film about the North Korean football (i.e. soccer) team who as tremendous underdogs beat the mighty Italian team in the late stages of the 1966 World Cup. This documentary provides a fascinating portrait of James Dresnok&apos;s unique life. Whilst doing so, it allows the viewer to see a little of what is life in North Korea. I strongly recommend that others buy this DVD."

It&apos;s a gripping tale, and the sheer quantity of money and death in it is truly horrifying. And yet, there&apos;s also a sense in which this film leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth, as essentially it&apos;s a platform for a pair of major smugglers and one psychopathic killer to wax lyrical about the good old days, relatively free of moral condemnation. Still, it&apos;s an amazing story, one that seems more fit to video games than to real life, and its epilogue was the construction of much of the modern city with the proceeds from the trade.",

He says he used to narrate silent films (an old Korean custom?) and his tale plays like one too, laying old-time melodrama on with a trowel. There&apos;s murder, revenge, adultery, drug addiction, a girl driven to become an &quot;entertainer&quot;, a prison break, eye-gouging, acid to the face, and a vengeful ghost whose grave splits in two so she can ascend to heaven when she&apos;s done. I don&apos;t know what was going on politically at the time but the ghost&apos;s husband was tortured by the police and sent to prison for protesting the Japanese government.

      "reviewBody": "In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven&apos;t been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the &quot;children&apos;s fantasy&quot; genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation. \n\nAfter the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist, Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort&apos;s soul contained in hidden &quot;horcruxes&quot; but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.\n\nThe Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despair-filled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography, Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling&apos;s seventh book is separated into two movies, Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and side-stories from the book as possible into the movie&apos;s runtime, which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed. \n\nBut where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series, it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry, Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes; they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord, but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion (which ends abruptly). You&apos;ll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere- but that&apos;s the point: Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow, but I also didn&apos;t like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I&apos;m getting at? Aside from that, I can&apos;t complain much. Performances were fine, effects were impressive, and best of all, nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling&apos;s story.\n\nThe Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you&apos;ve enjoyed the HP movies so far, this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not, let the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 7/10\n\nP.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie.",

When Nell showed Ernie &quot;church&quot; and the panorama of the mountains was shown, I literally had tears running down my cheeks.  I was in an Atlanta movie theater.  It is then that I made up my mind to come west. I&apos;ve never looked back.  It is all due to this movie.  It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time.  I just wish Mr. Belushi were still with us.  At least Blair is.  I&apos;d like to see much more of her in movies. Blair Brown is VERY, VERY underrated.  She was wonderful in this film and the film itself should have gotten way more recognition. Just look at the difficulties the cameramen must have encountered for those climbing and coming down the mountain in the snow shots.\n\nOne person wrote that a bear entered the cabin.  It was NOT a bear, but rather a mountain lion.  The only bears in the movie were encountered when Ernie Souchak was climbing up the mountain with the guide, going to Nell&apos;s place.  See--I do know it by heart.\n\nHats off to Continental Divide!!!"

This is actually a very watchable movie, not the best Jess Franco I have seen, but still above average. More an erotic fantasy than a horror movie per se, it will appeal to fans of 60s/70s Euroschlock like &apos;Nude For Satan&apos; and Franco&apos;s classic &apos;Vampyros Lesbos&apos;. \n\nThe stunningly beautiful Christina von Blanc plays the lovely innocent Christina Benson, who is summoned from boarding school in England to the reading of her father&apos;s will in a spooky castle. She never really knew her father, or had previously met her bizarre relatives who live in the castle, which according to the locals is deserted. It doesn&apos;t take much to work out her family&apos;s &quot;secret&quot;, the title tells all. Christina however, is a bit slow to catch on. She spends most of her time wandering around in a daze, often naked (great news for us viewers!), and increasingly unable to tell dream from reality. \n\nThere&apos;s not much action in this movie, and very little horror, but it has an almost Argento-like nightmarish feel to it, and like most of Franco&apos;s output, is very stylish despite the obviously low budget. The sight of the gorgeous Ms. Blanc is more than enough for me to recommend this movie. One look at her and any failings &apos;A Virgin Among The Living Dead&apos; has will quickly be forgotten! An enjoyable fun movie."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s an early Freed Unit picture, and among other Freed staples it has the work of Roger Edens, snatches of &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Good Morning,&quot; plus a whisper of &quot;Broadway Rhythm.&quot; But it&apos;s kind of cuckoo. The director is Busby Berkeley, who wanted everything BIG even when the movie was supposed to be SMALL. Thus BB encourages the Mickster to go into his full Eugene O&apos;Neill mode and he out-shouts everyone in the movie, including the hurricane! That is, when he&apos;s not on the verge of tears. If a woman had so over-heated, you&apos;d say it&apos;s her time of the month; I can only guess Mick&apos;s ego went nuclear and BB wasn&apos;t interested enough to rein him in. He may not have even noticed. The most absurd stroke is that Rooney clearly believed he was a great impressionist too, and BB let him do crude impersonations of Gable and Barrymore, among others, that seem pointless and self- congratulatory. Judy is early Judy: shy, more Dorothy Gale than the windstorm of talent she&apos;d become in later Freed masterpieces like &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; and so forth. Some other oddities, or at least they seem odd now: a big number in which Mick and the &quot;kids&quot; march through the streets of a Long Island coastal town, carrying torches and proclaiming that they are the future has an odd Nazi vibe to it. Creepy. Then there&apos;s baritone Doug McPhail who was five years from suicide; he&apos;s the next Nelson Eddy except there was no next Nelson Eddy which may be why he poisoned himself. Johhny Sheffield, later to be &quot;Boy&quot; to Johnny Weismuller&apos;s Tarzan, is briefly glimpsed and such MGM regs as Guy Kibbee and Margaret Hamilston are around to ground the movie in solid professionalism. It&apos;s sure watchable, even today, but now you think: these people thought they were riding the wave and the wave was coming in to crush THEM.",

The scientists (predictably) just want to cut him up, but Tim Hutton plays the lone anthropologist who befriends him and teaches him how to sing along to Neil Young.  At times the film (pre-CGI) seems dated in appearance, but its strength is not to underestimate the difference between the Neanderthal&apos;s world and our own, nor his capacity to deal with it.  Good to see a sci-fi film that for once is more interested in substance than surface.",

If you&apos;ve been sick with god knows what, then you may well have had the same voyage as he.\n\nNo one has ever captured on film, to my knowledge, why and how doctors, famed and not famed, traditional and alternative, are so dammed frustrating when you have a problem that doesn&apos;t quit. I found myself relating totally to Moretti&apos;s utter frustration and since it ended without resolution re: his cancer, I can only assume he beat it.\n\nMany times I or someone I love has this same tortuous struggle to find A SINGLE healer who really knows what gives. I found the cancer scenes very touching but it was the 8 months of itching and trying so many meds and accupuncture most true to our lousy medical situations. So many and none got it, until one did correctly diagnose him. I relate! And he&apos;s not Woody Allen, whose films I usually soak up, he&apos;s unique and brave and extremely intelligent.

The law of the strongest is not only a matter of physical forces (strength, number), but also of mental ones (deception, manipulation, ambush, cynicism of the individual). The film has also a socio-economic dimension: the protagonist of the movie is a young man who has been released from the army. He has no job, but is hired by the immoral leader of a gang who appreciates his courage, his sincerity and his &apos;morality&apos; (his sense of justice). And the women in all that? They have no other choice but to follow the strongest, if, and only if, they are young and beautiful. As for the unborn child, there is more than serious doubt about the real father\n\nThe first film by Lee Chang-dong contains already many ingredients of his later movies: a train, spasticity, gratuitous violence or exploitation of innocence. It says a lot about the director&apos;s vision on the way of the world.",

      "reviewBody": "I have read all the bad reviews about this movie, and I have to agree with most of what has been said. It is true that the film is just plain ugly to look at, and the over-acting is sometimes embarrassing. But perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like &quot;American History X&quot; and &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;. If you put it next to a highly-produced Hollywood film like A.H.X, then sure this one will look sick in comparison. Or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world, it just isn&apos;t fair. The only thing these films have in common is their subject matter: skinheads. Period. Pariah lacks the artistic merits of these &quot;legitimate&quot; films. But when looked at in the &quot;trash film&quot; context, then this one becomes at least entertaining. Perhaps watch this one in the same way that you would watch &quot;Toxic Avenger&quot;, or &quot;Shaft&quot;, or &quot;Class of 1984&quot; etc.. Of course the way they portray skinheads in this movie is nauseating, offensive, and highly inaccurate. But lets face it; there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene, that when something comes along, we just have to see it. Anyway, look at the way punks are portrayed in &quot;Class of 1984&quot;. Murderous criminals! But like Pariah, that flick is good for a laugh. In short, look at this one while you&apos;re hanging out and drinking with friends. You have to admit, this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence. It is stomach-turning in some places. And if you want to see a good, thought-provoking film about skinheads, see &quot;Luna Park&quot;, the one about the Russian skinheads. But don&apos;t expect a lot of action there. By the way, remember &quot;Skinheads: Second Coming of Hate&quot; with Chuck Conners?? Now there is a classic. &quot;Pariah&quot; is almost good compared to that one! A.C.A.B.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an odd little kid&apos;s movie that looks more like a 60s TV show. In fact, it is a spin-off of a popular long-running Channel Nine children&apos;s program The Adventures of the Terrible Ten (1959-60), which was repeated on the ABC until 1964, and overseas for several more years.\n\nThe story involves a group of children living in rural Australia, who embark on several projects to raise money to save their clubhouse, and end up discovering a chemical that can make sheep grow coloured wool.\n\nThe film includes several rather smaltzey musical interludes where a number of ring-ins sing uplifting Christmas songs - the film&apos;s highlight is a 16 year-old Olivia Newton-John singing &apos;Christmas Time Down Under&apos;, but there is also an unfortunate love-song (&apos;She&apos;s the Girl&apos;) by Ian Turpie, who serenades two doe-eyed teenagers simultaneously, as well as an uplifting Maori song by Kiwi star Howard Morrison, and a group version of &apos;Click Go the Shears&apos;.\n\nIt may have pleased the under-ten crowd in the 60s, but now it&apos;s corny to the max. Apart from the appearance of ONJ, the film does offer some insight into what passed for family entertainment in Australia at the time, given that so few films were made at the time. But it is all a bit contrived and silly to take very seriously. (Admittedly the poor You-Tube version available today may not do it justice)",

It has all the common tropes and plot-points you&apos;d expect from a quasi-historical knights movie of the period. The Hero acts, look and feel like a typical hero would. The same can be said for the balding villain, the entrapped heroine, and the rest of the crew. Nothing about it&apos;s story really stands out in relation to it&apos;s peers. (save for perhaps an infiltration segment).\n\nReferences to the Lionheart mythos is sprinkled throughout the film - so to connect it to the wider history these films take place in - but it doesn&apos;t really affect the plot in any tangible manner. Ivanhoe&apos;s Revenge is in no way a grim ordeal. It&apos;s sensibilities are perfectly in-line with the light-hearted, adventurous feel that most Knight movies from this time period exudes.\n\nThe Revenge of Ivanhoe, though, is not bad in any overly substantial way. The pacing, acting, directing, and the production values are all serviceable for the kind of matinée-type flick this is. It&apos;s just a bit trite, conventional and uninspired, that&apos;s all.\n\n4/10",

Ultimately the movie is a touching coming-of-age story about the growing pains and glory of the young artists. Juxtaposed against popular images of frivolous teen stars, the movie aims to illustrate the hardships the performers endureÂ—from auditions to the training periodÂ—to get on stage and perform for just 4 minutes. I AM: SMTOWN LIVE WORLD TOUR in Madison Square Garden touchingly embodies youth and the evolution of the performers.",

Despite terrific special effect, it is choppy, uneventful, and an insult to the viewer&apos;s intelligence. But in all due seriousness, THAT WAS THE POINT!\n\nThis film, in it&apos;s original, pre-Renegade edition form, was not meant to be taken seriously. It was just a campy, fun film designed to be a reunion of the characters from part one. If you watch it expecting something deep, you won&apos;t like it. But if you view it as it was intended to be viewed, as a light-hearted reunion of Lambert and Connery for ninety minutes of fun, than FUN is what you&apos;ll get. Consider it like an early experiment of something &quot;Fifth Element&quot; perfected: a campy but good sci-fi film.\n\nWith this in mind, give it a try."

      "reviewBody": "This review is for the uncut version of this film, complete with elderly gentleman having his member nailed to a piece of wood. It&apos;s obvious that for the more serious S&amp;M scenes a body double was used for Bulle Ogier (the body double has hands that look about 20 years older than Ogier&apos;s and she was probably a professional dominatrix). Consequently it feels more like documentary footage shot in a dungeon. Combined with the real and graphic footage in the abattoir it all feels gratuitous and clearly thrown in just to &apos;sex&apos; the whole thing up a bit. I&apos;m sure at the time the shock value of this film was enough. But it&apos;s not aged particularly well. For instance, the scene at the châteaux loses it bite as it&apos;s immediately obvious to the modern viewer what&apos;s going on. \n\nI watch a lot of art-house films, often from the 60s and 70s, and with depressing regularity the female characters get slapped about by their boyfriends. When Olivier tries that with Ariane (Bulle Ogier) she head-butts him. I don&apos;t think I can ever remember seeing a leading lady head-butting someone outside of a martial arts film. It&apos;s genuinely a shocking scene.\n\nDespite all this if you strip all the exploitative material out you&apos;re left with quite a nice romantic comedy. Olivier (Gérard Depardieu) is such a buffoon, that despite the occasional thuggish outburst is rather non-threatening: the perfect romantic comedy staple. \n\nThe final reveal as to who Gautier is rather anti-climactic. I guess it&apos;s meant to be a fantasy within a fantasy sort of thing.\n\nThe best thing for me in this film were the Karl Largerfeld costumes.\n\nOverall: 6/10."

      "reviewBody": "This proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with British funding; unfortunately, the result is undistinguished (except by its exceeding unpleasantness and borderline-camp approach) despite stars and director. The former is led by a wooden Franco Nero and an ultra-hammy Telly Savalas as a couple of would-be robbers (if anyone is able to believe either actor  who generally exude cool  as a duo of bumbling crooks, he&apos;s more gullible than I am!).\n\nTheir &apos;job&apos; goes awry (ending in murder and saddled with cases of cutlery instead of jewels!)  however, the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently &apos;kidnap&apos; the son of a British diplomat (a miscast Lester, who even gets to kick trigger-happy Savalas where it hurts at one point). Still, they never actually ransom him and their sole intent is to cross the border into France; tagging along with them is Nero&apos;s girlfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani): soon enough, though, she&apos;s had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping; the crazy Savalas notices this and, following the girl, kills her. In the meantime, Nero and Lester have woken up  the former thinks his accomplices may have double-crossed him, so he goes on the lam with the boy in tow; after a brief spell at a rich old lady&apos;s country estate (which features totally gratuitous rear nudes by both Nero and Lester!), Savalas catches up with them. They continue their trek, where the trio run into a family of German campers: the situation degenerates to the point where Savalas shuts them inside their trailer and tosses the lot into the river  though he&apos;s badly hurt in the process himself; typically, it all ends with the &apos;heavies&apos; getting killed just as they&apos;re about to reach the border.\n\nThe film, therefore, contains most of the genre&apos;s typical elements  sleaze, sadism, violence, chases (the aftermath of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes havoc in the city&apos;s narrow back-streets and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright farcical), etc.; one mildly interesting aspect to it is that, by the end, Lester himself is seen to have been definitely (irrevocably?) marked by the experience  coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed.",

      "reviewBody": "You know I really was looking forward to seeing this movie, by only having read the synopsis. It&apos;s about this woman, Sylvia, who inherits a family castle in Italy. The other thing I knew, was that it was a (horror) movie from 1969. I didn&apos;t even know it was directed by Amando de Ossorio, the director who also was responsible for the infamous BLIND DEAD &quot;quadrilogy&quot;. If I had known this, I might have looked forward to it even more. But anyway, given the premise and the year this movie was made in, I was expecting an atmospheric Gothic Horror movie with at least a bit of gruesome or scary material in it. Well, I wasn&apos;t even halfway right. This is indeed a pathetic attempt at Gothic Horror, but the atmosphere isn&apos;t as effective as it should be and the story is uneventful and very predictable. I mean, yeah, there are a couple of scenes with red and blue lighting in some tombs underneath the castle that, when watched from a distance, vaguely look like something Mario Bava might have cooked up while he was drunk. But that&apos;s about it, as far as mood and atmosphere goes.\n\nI just don&apos;t get people that say &quot;It&apos;s a Euro-Horror classic&quot; and slap it with, for instance, 8/10. Yeah, it&apos;s an old horror movie. Yeah, it&apos;s from Europe. Does that make it automatically a decent genre-classic? If you want the answer to that, I&apos;ll just advice you to take Mario Bava&apos;s OPERAZIONE PAURA (aka KILL, BABY, KILL), and put it next to Ossorio&apos;s MALENKA and then tell me which one is the good movie and which the bad. Okay, yeah, I&apos;m getting a bit carried away here, probably because I was disappointed after seeing this Ossorio snooze-fest. FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD is not completely without merits. Let&apos;s see The castle setting is (always) great, even if it just features people walking around in it. There&apos;s a couple of busty ladies showing cleavage. One even gets some whoopee from a whip, while chained in a dungeon. The rest of the movie has Sylvia&apos;s boyfriend discussing with the town&apos;s doctor whether or not vampires do exist. And yes, we do get to see more than a couple of fake white fangs, but no blood really. No scares, no action (and by &quot;action&quot; I don&apos;t mean stunts or fights, but just something eventful or a couple of good moments). The little background story about the great-grandma (when she was young and quite attractive) being a witch and experimenting with alchemy was about the most interesting thing about the whole plot. Someone on here even pointed out that this was a comedy of some sorts. Well sure, the version I&apos;ve seen was a pretty bad movie, but I wouldn&apos;t exactly call it a comedy. Except for that final, idiotic running-over-the-bridge gag. Man, that was so misplaced So, I guess most of the movie&apos;s humor was lost on me. Apparently, there are different versions of this movie out there. Mine was about real vampires, had a stupid joke at the end, and only ran 74 minutes. And that, for me, was long enough.\n\nI say FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD is strictly for avid Euro Horror fans. Bad movie-lovers won&apos;t even have fun with it, because it&apos;s just not bad enough (although the acting was pretty much laughter-stirring all the time). I&apos;m not even mad I wasted my time on it, as it was part of a 9-movie box-set (called THE LIVING DEAD), and some of the other movies were more than worth it. So I&apos;m not complaining. Oh well, after all there was a witch burning at a stake and a wooden stick got driven through a vampire&apos;s heart, so if you please, you can think up an extra point just for that. But the gag at the end still remains dumb.",

It&apos;s ostensibly a contemporary love story between two misfits, but he laces the plot with science fiction elements that seem contrived at first until they start to affect the characters tangibly. The irony is that these far-fetched plot developments are what make the movie resonate emotionally. The two people at the center are Ruby Weaver, a single woman with an unfortunate track record of enabling men to meet her lowest expectations, and Sam Deed, a stranger from Dubuque who may be either mentally ill or a time traveler from the year 2470. Ruby is immediately drawn to Sam&apos;s sincerity but when he confesses to coming from the future, she inevitably feels like she is recycling old behavior by trying to save him from his delusions.\n\nIt reminds me a bit of John Carpenter&apos;s 1984 &quot;Starman&quot; (where an alien takes the form of a woman&apos;s dead husband) and a touch of Hal Ashby&apos;s 1979 &quot;Being There&quot; (where an insulated gardener tries to make sense of the world around him). However, Anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp on the movie by making Sam&apos;s seemingly insane assertions credible and Ruby&apos;s attraction alternately frustrating and empathetic. The acting by the two leads helps considerably here. Suffering from premature Oscar ejaculation, Marisa Tomei has slowly recovered her acting credentials, and this performance is among her best as she dexterously brings out all the hesitation and vulnerability in Ruby. As Sam, Vincent D&apos;Onofrio tempers his trademark intensity with a genuine sweetness that makes his child-like wonder believable. Holland Taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona to play Ruby&apos;s impervious therapist, while Tovah Feldshuh grounds the film with warmth and sensibility as Ruby&apos;s mother. The ending is clever with a nice use of stop-motion photography, even if it felt slightly derivative of the legendary &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode where Bones is stopped from saving a peace-loving missionary (played by Joan Collins, of all people) about to be killed. This one is more infectious than you may be assuming from the set-up.",

      "reviewBody": "HITTING A NEW HIGH puts the spotlight on LILY PONS and her coloratura soprano vocal range, but unfortunately has a plot that is beyond silly. For publicity purposes, JACK OAKIE and EDWARD EVERETT HORTON decide to perpetuate the idea that she was discovered in the African jungle, a bird girl who happens to have a gorgeous singing voice. Horton puts her under the tutelage of a voice teacher so that he can put her on display as his own singing discovery. From that point on, the plot is saddled with even more improbabilities until finally everyone is happy that Miss Pons has been anyone&apos;s discovery, so impressive is her singing voice.\n\nIndeed, RKO made sure that she gets to sing several arias (superbly), trilling her way through difficult arias with great ease and charm. But she was never the most photogenic of singers and no amount of close-ups are able to disguise the fact that she is not your typical Hollywood glamor girl. However, despite the banality of the plot, she seems a good sport to play the &quot;bird girl&quot; with such gusto.\n\nFor plot purposes, most of the spotlight is on JACK OAKIE, EDWARD EVERETT HORTON and ERIC BLORE--which turns out to be a good thing when it comes to comic relief. Horton and Blore are particularly effective in their zany roles, both capable of injecting some good laughs into the script.\n\nSumming up: Pleasant trifle does indicate that Miss Pons had one of the best soprano voices at the Met (for some thirty years), even if she was not quite star quality on the screen.",

I enjoyed lots of the jokes some I found really funny, others made me smirk and some not as funny but with the sheer amount of gags in this film your bound to not find all of em funny.\n\nI mainly enjoyed the film because I thought it was good, i enjoyed the action, the jokes, the animation and story (despite it not being very linear and rather silly) and I thought the voice acting was very professional. I do agree with many of people saying that this film isn&apos;t for everybody it is gory, full of nudity and swearing but I didn&apos;t in anyway find it offensive although I can see how some people might.\n\nOverall I think this was a good effort by Rob Zombie and while it wasn&apos;t on par with some of his other movies like House Of 1000 Corpses it was still a very good film.\n\nMy recommendation for people wondering whether or not to see this film is to check out the first 10 minutes if it hasn&apos;t appealed to you by then, then it&apos;s not your sort of movie but if it seems promising check it out because it&apos;ll be really worth your while.",

      "reviewBody": "Chris Weitz did a screening of this film at SMC, where I study film, and the reactions of the audience were engaging. The room was filled with a great aura and that was because the screening was filled with people with ethnicities from all over the world and that made the experience a lot more rewarding.\n\nThis guy is the same one that brought us American Pie and the second installment of the Twilight series? Yes he is, but let me tell you something, if these paychecks will make him do more movies like this one, then bring another 4 twilight adaptations right now! \n\nThe movie is about &quot;Los Mojados&quot;, these people who everyday crosses the border from Mexico to the US to look for &quot;A Better Life&quot; like the title implies, trying not to forget their roots, their culture and at the same time struggling to find money to pay the rent, to eat and to survive in the United States without a SSN and without ID. You will wonder why we need to prove we&apos;re not from Mars with a visa if God already gave us permission to be here on earth every single second of the movie, absurd and unfair things this world has.\n\nThe acting by Demián Bichir, who looks like a younger Vicente Fernández to me, is invisible. You sometimes think you&apos;re watching a documentary if it wasn&apos;t for the glossy production value of the flick.\n\nThis movie needs to be seen by a wider audience, you need to look for it. If you do not feel touch by it, you&apos;re surely made out of stone.\n\nThe direction by Chris Weitz captures the essence of East LA in a second. There&apos;s a scene in the movie where in a matter of 3 minutes you can see how many cultures collide in this side of Los Angeles and how this story can repeat itself in several cultures.\n\nThis is also a story about true love between a father and a son, and how you can forget about everything and try every little thing to give your child the things he deserves.\n\nOne of the best little movies I have seen this year.\n\nPS: If you like this one, and you&apos;re not afraid of B&amp;W cinematography (no, it is not in 3D either) run and rent De Sica&apos;s Umberto D., a great masterpiece of Italian neorealism.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s always a wonderful feeling when a film works its wonders on you. LITTLE WOMEN had that effect on me, and I&apos;m not even a fan of these types of stories. This adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott classic has real heart, warmth, and the right amount of sentimentality, amounting to a wonderful film. Katharine Hepburn stars as the tomboyish Jo, a free-spirited young lady who is dying for adventure but craves the time she spends with her sisters. The one that stands out among the four is Beth, a caring, sweet girl with a flair for the piano. If you don&apos;t get teary-eyed about her cause, you definitely pass for a curmudgeon. The only complaint I have about this gem is that the last quarter of the film doesn&apos;t seem to have the matching effervescence that the rest of the film had. It ends abruptly and off-balance. All qualms aside, this is a genuine classic, filled with great performances and characters you can&apos;t help but like. A true family entertainment. Rating: Three stars and a half."

I think if you&apos;re a dancer, it&apos;s probably worth the hour and a half, but if you&apos;re looking for a quality movie, this isn&apos;t really it. Rachele Brooke Smith, the main actress, needs a few more acting lessons before I&apos;ll watch her in a movie again. It felt like I was at a middle school play watching her act and she never stopped smiling during the whole movie, making it seem really fake after a little while. Her dancing was excellent though. Kenny Wormald is also an excellent dancer and his acting was better but his character came off as your average randy teenage boy, and I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s what the writers had in mind. The shiny diamond earring in his ear didn&apos;t help. The story is the same as most other dance movies, just with more ballet dancing than hip hop. But unlike other dance movies, the soundtrack really isn&apos;t worth it.",

They don&apos;t care about Communist ideals. The Russian character is the only positive character in the movie, a kind of Soviet James Bond. He finally conquers the main female character. Otherwise Soviet women are mostly absent from the movie. Clear signs of propaganda are two: 1) Italian hospitals are presented as being overcrowded so that at some point two patients (a man and a woman) have to share the same bed, 2) there is a lot of chaos in Italy and the Mafia stereotype is reinforced by a short Mafiosi.\n\nOtherwise there aren&apos;t any references to the Soviet Communist party as far as I recall. Lots of special effects and stunts, so I suppose the Soviets spent a lot of money on the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. A lot of films that I have watched fall under that category, admittedly. Still it is really worth watching and the music is fantastic as well.\n\nIt is a film that tells different stories about western bag pack tourists in Asia. The lives of each of the tourists are mostly not connected with one another, but sometimes intertwine. This film tells the story of two British bag pack tourists who come to Asia, together, to enjoy the night life. One of them is domineering, organized, thrifty, but not always good at communicating with people. His desire to always be better at everything in everything than other people intimidates others and does not make him a pleasant person to be with. His friend is the total opposite. He is very extroverted, more pleasant, passive, but therefore disorganized and wasteful. In Asia he even realizes that he has no money, which makes him financially dependent on his bossy friend who walks all over him because of it. The more domineering friend&apos;s insecurity becomes more clear as he becomes jealous as his more passive friend manages to make out with a girl, while he does not even dare to talk to the other girls around him and therefore remains lonely. So he picks on the passive friend so much that that friend has to leave the country and go back home.\n\nThe story of the other tourist is totally different. In order to get away from a failing love relationship at home, a German lady enters a type of esoteric religious commune in India. If I am not mistaken it is the remnants of one of those Bagwan communes which are known for making their members only wear purple clothing. As few of the people in the group are single she, however, feels left out because she had come to the commune a lone. The only other single German with whom she gets a long with is too old for her. Because that commune, in another documentary, was associated with sexual abuse and authoritarian leadership, I found it bold of the Sonia Heiss to portray it so positively and to make it look so harmless.\n\nThe other tourist&apos;s story which is told in the film is a lady. She seems to have an Austrian accent. She could be from Germany as well. She befriends the a man who works at the travel agency, whom she contacts to book her trip, over the phone. They have never seen each other, but because he expresses his interest for her they organize to meet by a temple. She shoes up by the temple, they do not find each other. The reason for why this is so is open to the viewer. Personally, I think that because travel agent keeps on changing his age, he was the old man who hang around by the temple as she had appeared. She simply did not want to accept that such an old man wanted to go out with her and the old man was too shy to speak to her because she was so young that she could be her daughter. So that female tourist travels out of Asia to the USA without ever meeting the man whom she only knows through her long, strange telephone conversations with him.\n\nAnother tourist is a Scottish tourist, who is not the way they are usually portrayed. He does not have a dashing, exotic accent and gentlemanly manners or a quilt. He has a very humble appearance and acts like someone who even has a low self esteem. His accent makes him sound like English is his third language. His humor is not always appropriate and also annoying to say the least, but the fact that he accepts himself despite all of his odd personal qualities, and is well meaning, makes him likable to the people around him. His self-confidence reminds those around him to accept themselves as they are as they cannot be anyone, but themselves. This Scott made a strange woman pregnant and escaped to India, or some other Asian country, to have a lot of fun before he devotes himself to the parental duties that he is not looking forward to taking. However as he meets the German single girl who had just left that Indian commune which I had talked about, as a coca cola which he had ordered ends up being served onto her table by mistake, they fall in love as he tells her that the coke is his. I think that at this point the Scott realizes that it makes no sense to start a family which he does not want to devote himself to, as his lack of commitment would not making him very helpful as a parent anyway. So, it seems he simply devotes herself to the German girl.\n\nThe choice to make this a mosaic movie, telling 5 different stories, that each highlights a different aspect of the backpacking experience, I find no objection at all. Each of the stories (some more than others though) are very well done and explore the reasons people backpack and the challenges (internal and external) they encounter in an original and humorous way. The humor is quite subtle though and knowing a bit of German would be beneficial in appreciating that subtleness. The fact that these separate stories eventually not come together (in an Innaritu kind of way) or &apos;go somewhere&apos; I find in no way problematic as another reviewer seems to argue. Each story has meaning in itself and as any backpacker would happily point out to you: &quot;it&apos;s a journey, not a destination&quot;.\n\nWhat strikes me in the film is the way the characters all try to find some sort of meaning in lives which all lack direction, in a time in which they are not so young anymore.",

This film shows Taipei as gritty, dirty, ugly, poor and indifferent. The film was released in 1986 and it follows the police and ordinary citizens in situations which mirror everyday life, including shootouts and chaos. The first scene is a police siren and soon you see a dead man lying on the street. Scenes here are interwoven amongst the characters, who at first seem like they don&apos;t inhabit the same world. This makes the film kind of fascinating, that you&apos;re a fly on the wall in these people&apos;s lives. The use of stark imagery, shadows and light is very effective. The film, despite its title, is not about terrorism or the violence of a particular person. There are lies told in this film which cause some of the problems faced by the main characters. If you do not like moody, introspective films, I don&apos;t recommend this. However, director Edward Yang (whom we lost in 2007) has a very impressive body of work (you have to see &quot;Yi Yi&quot;) and this is an impressive film.",

      "reviewBody": "I sought out to see the handful of entries into the horror genre achieved by the late, great Brion James, which led me to check out &quot;The Dark&quot;.  It turned out to be an adequate late-night movie, owing a lot to the creature features from the 50s.  The concept of the monster in this film is original and intriguing, and the thing itself is actually scary-looking, too.  The triple conflict between the monster, the hero scientist who wants to preserve it, and the vengeful cop who wants to kill it adds to the story&apos;s effectiveness.  A few contrivances and assumptions are forced on the viewer towards the start of the movie, especially how the hero survives his encounter with the creature in the opening sequence, and his initial &apos;adventure&apos; with the waitress-cum-reluctant-sidekick, subsequently followed by their proper introduction at a nearby motel.  But it&apos;s all worth it once the characters reach the cemetery under which the monster dwells.  Most of the action takes place in a single night, which is always a plus for horror. And the whole picture has a very nice, um, &apos;dark&apos; atmosphere to it.\n\nI was surprised to see Neve Campbell&apos;s name appear in the opening credits, and although I was never a particular fan of her, she turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise in &quot;The Dark&quot;.  Brion James is excellent as the ruthless former detective hellbent on revenge against the creature at any cost.  And Stephen MacHattie plays up his undeniable resemblance to Lance Henriksen by doing his best to act like LH, too.  Worth watching as a late night rental. Though it never spawned a sequel, it probably deserved to, and I like to think it could still happen.  Especially if they can get Neve to be in it! 5/10",

Kinski is as slimy and menacing as always, Ollie turns to the booze when the pressure is on (no surprises there), and George strips to her underwear (no surprises there either!).\n\n5.5 out of 6, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",

Beginning gruesomely with the cruel slaughter of the well to-do Esguerra family by feral, home invading cannibal killers. 20 years later the sole traumatized survivor of this massacre, Lukas, (Richard Gutierrez) is fatefully recalled to his home town some in order to assist distressed chief of police (TJ Trinidad) interrogate the monstrously bizarre, inhumanly resilient patient, Guada (Cristina Reyes). Seemingly innocent, she is said to be responsible for slaying Lukas&apos;s brother and the similarly brutal deaths of the vengeful police chief&apos;s own family!\n\n&apos;Patient X&apos; remains a rousing example of frantic, blood-drenched Filipino folk horror! Evoking an eerie, doom-laden atmosphere frequently suggestive of horror maestros Lucio Fulci or George A. Romero in full fright! With blackened, claustrophobic shades of &apos;Assault on Precinct 13&apos;, baby-faced Dr. Lukas, Guada, officer Alfred and the other beleaguered occupants of the demonically besieged hospital nightmarishly discover that their increasingly berserk assailants are the dreaded Aswang! These ghoulish, preternaturally strong, flesh-eating fiends of fearful Filipino myth, and their ferocious outsized leader Marcus (Elvis Gutierrez) will stop at nothing to free Marcus&apos;s incarcerated ,Guada! Director Laranas is most adept at maximizing oppressive menace on such a modest budget, robustly orchestrating a shuddersome number of energized shocks as these truly horrific Aswang run bloodily amok in this horror haunted hospital! Fear-master Yam Laranas&apos;s feverish Filipino fright-flick &apos;Patient X&apos; is an infectiously watchable horror film, with the kindly doctor Lukas making for a likeable hero. So, if you dare, prepare to spend the night in intensive scare!",

All the people involved tell about their part in history, each from their own point of view, featuring themselves as the main character. Each story is colored, romanticized and embellished and all stories emphasize the intrepidity of the first person. The stories are told with a great sense for drama and big themes like trust and betrayal, truth and reality, tricks and deceit. By stringing together the small, subjective stories of each person involved, slowly a larger, &apos;objective&apos; history becomes visible. Like a mosaic from which one slowly distances oneself. Although at the end of the movie it becomes apparent that some stories have been spectacularly embellished, the chain-story they form undeniably leads to present time.",

      "reviewBody": "The main problem with Ich war 19 is that glosses over several essential realities. It seems like a Soviet propaganda movie trying to white wash the past. The invasion of Germany by Soviet troops in 1944/5 was nothing short of barbaric. 18 million people were driven from their ancestral lands - over 2 million civilians were brutally murdered. More than a million POW&apos;s were liquidated and another 2 million Ukrainians, Poles and White Russians of German descent were also exterminated by the Soviets. \n\nThe landscape was almost completely destroyed by allied bombing and soviet artillery. 80% of the buildings were destroyed. Women (and boys) were frequently raped on the spot. The boys were lucky - they were invariably bayoneted after-wards - but the women were passed to next comrade. Of course we can argue that this was justified because of the Holocaust and the German barbarism in Russia and Poland. But women and children? \n\nThe film does not even suggest this was happening. It represents the war as a sort of part time activity in which a few unlucky people got killed. The buildings are all intact. The people all look well fed. The faces look completely undramatized. It doesn&apos;t bring home the reality of truth. \n\n1945 was truly horrific for everyone between Berlin and Konigsberg (Kaliningrad)It is an indelible scar on the memory of everyone old enough to remember it. This film does not convey that horror.",

      "reviewBody": "There are very few ratings on this and no reviews, which I find a bit odd.\n\nIt is certainly a unique movie, but then again, many Japanese movies of this genre are. The synopsis doesn&apos;t really capture the idea. Danda is not a very large part of the movie, as you&apos;ll notice by the fact that he isn&apos;t in the top cast.\n\nThe movie revolves largely around the mask maker, the groups who oppose each other, who Hiroku truly is, and the phenomenon itself. The wearing of masks extends into other schools and eventually becomes somewhat of a fad. Many people choose to be &quot;reborn&quot; into a new person by shedding their personality and using the mask to reveal their new one. This leads to unhinged behavior, including violence in some cases.\n\nIt definitely has the message of who a person becomes when they become anonymous. Much like how anonymity on the internet tends to allow for more freedom of speaking one&apos;s mind. There is a lot going on, but I don&apos;t feel like it is hard to take it all in. Certainly some elements could&apos;ve used more screen time, but dragging the movie out probably would&apos;ve been difficult. For an hour and a half watch, it is pretty good and keeps you fairly interested in figuring out what exactly is going on in terms of who is who, and what not. In some ways, it is predictable, but in other ways it can be a bit elusive and has a different ending than expected.\n\nAs for the cast, you&apos;ll certainly notice some fairly popular people on the Top Cast section. They&apos;ve also worked together in other movies, so seem to do well on screen together.",

If you are more than halfway sober or awake, its little derivative winks of &apos;intelligence&apos; might actually appear half-assed and grating. I&apos;m a fan of both John Hannah and Eddie Izzard, but neither actor can rescue this made-for-TV-grade formulaic crap-pile. And the &apos;intelligent&apos; bit of that formula is the one that most grates on me: when the films throws out references to Tarantino, musical theatre, The Sweet Smell of Success, etc.(naming a character Elmo Somerset? Good lord), it&apos;s insulting. And when the twists are revealed, I hardly feel that the makers of Circus are knowing masterminds. They blindly stumbled through this movie, hoping that they could pull this foolish scam of a movie off."

They tended to be passable affairs but the moment any tried to be anything beyond psychological they lost credibility.\n\nHere we see a paper boy (Shocker) besotted with a young mother and does everything in his power to become part of her life, even if it means taking out those who stand in his way.\n\nThe actor playing the kid never went on to bigger and better things and that is a shame as he is excellent here. Also starring Alexandra &quot;Baywatch&quot; Paul and William &quot;One of my personal favorite actors&quot; Katt alongside industry veteran the late great Frances Bay. The cast truly do make a movie that on paper should have been mediocre into something relatively watchable.\n\nSure it&apos;s predictible and some moments are more than slightly far fetched, but it&apos;s watchable stuff for what it is.\n\nThe Good:\n\nStellar cast\n\nCompetent antagonist\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSeen it before\n\nSome moments are a tad silly\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nThis is reason no.534755378334890 why I&apos;ve not had kids\n\nBaywatch both started and killed Alexandra Pauls career",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Harold Lloyd&apos;s least-known films and, consequently, perhaps his most underrated feature; I was first made aware of this factor by Leonard Maltin&apos;s awarding it the full **** rating in his Film Guide and, ever since that time, I&apos;ve been pining to catch up with it!\n\nNow that I&apos;ve watched it for myself, I can say that the film is an undoubted classic (certainly among Lloyd&apos;s best work) and the only reason that I didn&apos;t quite go all the way with my own rating is the fact that, even for its brief 58-minute running-time, the plot line is somewhat thin: \n\nHarold is a millionaire who becomes the unwitting benefactor of a modest mission; believing himself to have been conned into such a position, he determines to put a stop to it - that is, until he meets and falls for pretty missionary&apos;s daughter Jobyna Ralston. Then, he resolves to attract customers to the joint - which, considering that the neighborhood is filled with tough guys and gangsters, this will take considerable resource on his part. Nevertheless, he succeeds and the men eventually become fond of him so that, when Lloyd&apos;s impending marriage to Ralston is announced in the papers and his rich society-pals decide to &apos;save&apos; him from such a fate, the gang take action to bring the couple back together again.\n\nWhile clearly reminiscent of what is perhaps Charlie Chaplin&apos;s greatest short, EASY STREET (1917), the film&apos;s level of gags and the star&apos;s typical ingenuity is extremely high - with only the gangsters&apos; drunken havoc during its last third overstaying its welcome; this section, however, leads to one of Lloyd&apos;s most hair-raising stunts - actually inspired by similar scenes in both GET OUT AND GET UNDER (1920) and GIRL SHY (1924) - as a double-decker bus (with atop it the star and his &apos;flock&apos;) races driverless along busy city streets on its way to Harold&apos;s wedding. Other hilarious highlights include: the early destruction of two cars owned by our reckless hero - the first happens because of a crate of cat food in the middle of the street, which the black chauffeur mistakes for the real thing and tries to avoid but ends up slamming straight into another car, while the second contrives to run out of gas on a railway track and is summarily scuttled by an oncoming train; as well as another re-used (this time from GRANDMA&apos;S BOY [1922]) but undeniably irresistible routine involving the indigestible &apos;cakes&apos; which Lloyd is made to eat by his beloved at the mission.",

      "reviewBody": "The same year that George Lucas and his team developed groundbreaking special effects to bring audiences bizarre alien creatures and dramatic space battles in Star Wars, this US/Japanese co-production settled for far less advanced techniques to bring its dinosaurs to life, making it an embarrassingly clunky, yet still rather charming addition to the Lost World genre. Rivalling The Land That Time Forgot (1974) for worst movie dinosaurs of the decade, The Last Dinosaur features Tokusatsu-style men-in-rubber-suit monsters that are wholly unconvincing, but which will undoubtedly hold much appeal for fans of all things kaiju (the film&apos;s T-Rex even sounds like Godzilla).\n\nRichard Boone stars as Masten Thrust, the wealthiest man in the world (but still unable to hire a decent graphic designer to make his company a decent logo), who leads an expedition to a lost world in the polar region, where he hopes to find a living Tyrannosaurus Rex. Joining him on the journey into the unknown are geologist Chuck Wade (Steven Keats), scientist Dr. Kawamoto (Tetsu Nakamura), photographer Francesca Banks (Joan Van Ark) and brave Masai tracker Bunta (Luther Rackley). After navigating their way to the prehistoric land in a laser borer craft, the team are attacked by a tribe of savage cavemen and face danger from a T-Rex that steals their transport and stomps their camp.\n\nEntertaining for its sheer silliness, The Last Dinosaur features unrealistic miniatures, a laughably bad Pteranodon that endlessly circles the sky, and a triceratops that somehow conceals itself in a rock face to launch a surprise attack on the T-Rex. Other dumb moments include Francesca unknowingly standing on the back of a giant turtle, the T-rex stealthily sneaking up on its victims unheard, Masten ordering Bunta to find 200 yards of tough vine (that&apos;s 600ft, or 182 metres, but the ever resourceful Bunta comes through), the T-Rex being yanked off its feet by a tumbling boulder (attached to the dinosaur by that tough vine!), the speedy construction of a massive medieval-style catapult (I&apos;m still not sure where that axe came from), and Chuck and Francesca miraculously transporting the steel (so presumably extremely heavy) borer over land to re-launch it in a lake.\n\n5/10 - it&apos;s silly, it&apos;s stupid, it&apos;s technically inept, but it&apos;s also quite fun as a result.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;MIRRORS 2&apos;: Three Stars (Out of Five) \n\nSequel to director Alexandre Aja&apos;s 2008 remake, starring Kiefer Sutherland, of the 2003 Korean horror film &apos;IN TO THE MIRROR&apos;. This sequel centers around the same concept of the first film, visions of murders seen in the reflection of mirrors by a night security guard, but features different characters and an all new cast. This time the night security guard is played by Nick Stahl. It&apos;s directed by Victor Garcia (who&apos;s directed other such direct to video horror sequels as &apos;RETURN TO HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL&apos; and the upcoming &apos;HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS&apos;) and written by Matt Venne (who also wrote direct to video horror sequel &apos;WHITE NOISE 2: THE LIGHT&apos;).\n\nStahl plays Max Matheson a new night security guard at Mayflower Department Store (the same building from the first film) who takes the job where his father (played by William Katt) works after the former guard quits due to self inflicted injuries. Max has recently suffered the loss of a loved one in a traumatic accident and is still severely troubled by it. Soon after he starts working Max begins seeing images of a missing girl in the Store&apos;s mirrors as well as fellow co-workers causing themselves grotesque bodily harm. As these visions continue to become real Max tries to use his powers to prevent them and solve the mystery of the haunted girl.\n\nI never saw the original Korean film but I did like Aja&apos;s remake (which is all Aja seems to do). I do think it&apos;s probably his weakest film though. While this sequel is not as good as Aja&apos;s film it is a satisfying continuation. The mirror death scenes are haunting, the murder mystery and characters are somewhat intriguing and the acting is decent. For a direct to video sequel I found it pretty impressive. Not a great horror film but it gives the viewer what it wants.\n\nWatch our review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlah-RpxRPU",

Any guy I ever watched it with, hated it though, so I&apos;d say it is first and foremost a film for girls. Besides, with this film you get what you can expect from reading the title. It&apos;s an adaption, loosely based on the Cinderella story, set in the 1980s. Nothing more and also, nothing less. I also saw it as a 4-part mini series first and then later on only in the cut TV movie version (They cut 4 episodes á 45 minutes into a film of 90 minutes..you do the math..). This November the new DVD version with the 4 original episodes was released here in Germany, so if you understand German and want to see this film again, make sure you buy the newer version. (I did). BTW: Is it just me or did Bonnie Bianco sound just a tad like Jennifer Rush?",

      "reviewBody": "How can you be French and not love this film? First the lead is French;and in a small supporting part,there is Victor Francen,one of Julien Duvivier&apos;s (&quot;La Fin Du Jour &quot;,1939) and Abel Gance&apos;s (&quot;J&apos;accuse&quot; 1918 and 1937) favorite actors.Plus &quot;La Marseillaise &quot; in the final sequences.Plus Olivia De Havilland who has been living in Paris for years.Except for Bertrand Tavernier,most of FRench critics do not speak highly of Mitchell Leisen&apos;s overlooked gem.\n\nThis is the kind of superior melodrama I love.Olivia De Havilland is one of the greatest actresses of all time,one of those who never think twice when it comes to playing demeaning parts.She is so moving,so tender and so endearing that beauty Paulette Goddard almost leaves me indifferent.And I wonder why Boyer...\n\nThe very structure of the film is highly original,being a long flashback,the hero telling his story (perhaps too much voice over) to a director to earn money (but we will know why in the last minutes )because he thinks all his trials can make a great film!Truth can be stranger than fiction cause he is in a film himself! The subject of the movie is still topical today when you see so many people leaving their country for the wealthy ones (not only America:in France ,Russians and others are actually fighting to get French citizenship).For that matter,one of the peaks is when Victor Francen declaims Emma Lazarus&apos;s poem which is graven on a tablet within the pedestal on which the Statue of Liberty stands.There are subplots and Mitchell Leisen&apos;s talent manages to make them as interesting as the three leads .You may remember the lady who wants his baby to be an American and the way she makes her dream come true,maybe more than Boyer/Havilland&apos;s honeymoon.\n\nA honeymoon that takes them to an old Mexican village where they go to mass,with a candle in their hand.A scene that recalls Murnau&apos;s &quot;daybreak&quot; .\n\nEmmy (De Havilland) is a woman who has never known love.She really wants to hold back the dawn ,to make her dream longer than the night.She gave all she had and she &apos;s so altruistic she even returns good for evil.When she realizes that she&apos;s through with her pursuit of happiness,she simply puts her glasses.\n\nI had seen Leisen&apos;s film when I was still a child.I saw it last night.With the same pleasure.",

To me it has quite a Nam feel to it, (the progression of the relationship between the inmates, and the constant battle with the higher ranks). Deterioration of character screams out &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, but the team aspect shows a strong influence from films such as &quot;Platoon&quot;. The film itself is set during the time of Nam, but can&apos;t be bracketed as one. Charlie Sheen has once again took part as the lead role in a great film. I can&apos;t see the film working with any other actor ! His cold manner, but warm heart is seen also in the classic &quot;Platoon&quot;. All in all this film is a good modern story. Which I recommend to not only Vietnam film fans, but to a general audience.",

But that one last game is too much for him and he falls over dead.\n\nJohn&apos;s family not only has to deal with the loss, but also the realization that his business was in trouble and the family is broke. Everyone will have to take a job to keep the family from losing the house. Son Henry wants to be the breadwinner so his mother Grace will not have to work, but he is in nursing school. Education will have to wait.\n\nHenry&apos;s Uncle Colin works as a doorman at 1500 5th Avenue, so he gets Henry a job as a doorman. George, the supervisor, is very demanding and expects Henry to do everything right. This means no relationships with the tenants, but treat them nice. Still, after Henry starts work, Henry and Scarlett notice each other right away.\n\nHenry works alongside Raul, who does as little as he can get away with, and he seems to date a lot of women. Ultimately he shows he cares.\n\nThere are a couple of funny scenes involving an unsupervised kid with money and a pair of hookers. Henry should have been more careful.\n\nHenry develops a relationship with Scarlett as he makes deliveries to the penthouse apartment. Even though she has a boyfriend, Buck is a rich drunk. At Scarlett&apos;s birthday party, Henry even gets called on to use his nursing skills to save a life. And it&apos;s not the only time his nursing skills get used: a gay couple has a dog who gets away from them and almost dies.\n\nWhen Scarlett&apos;s mother finds out about Henry, she is not happy. Her husband Phillip, though, is more accepting.\n\nSo will this Romeo and Juliet romance work out? \n\nSarah Roemer is so pretty and easy to like. She&apos;s just perfect for the role of Scarlett. And the character is very patient and accepting of others who are different.\n\nOn the other hand, Mimi Rogers does what she does best: a conceited but not necessarily mean rich person who wants only the best for her daughter.\n\nJoseph Cross makes a very good lead. He&apos;s easy to like and very determined.\n\nAnnette O&apos;Toole does a very good job as Henry&apos;s mother. Those who know her as the all-American mother of Clark Kent may not be pleased at what she ends up doing, but she is still very much like what she was on &quot;Smallville&quot;. Only with a New Yawk accent.\n\nRachael Leigh Cook is tough and independent and won&apos;t take attitude from anyone. I didn&apos;t like her as Henry&apos;s sister but she is very good.\n\nWhether you like him or not, Joe Pantoliano does show talent here.\n\nSnoop Dogg is also quite good.\n\nIt&apos;s a pleasant romantic comedy."

      "name": "Herzog and Cage Deliver",
      "reviewBody": "Bad Lieutenant, The: Port of Call: New Orleans (2009) \n\n**** (out of 4)\n\nWhen it was announced that Werner Herzog would be remaking Abel Ferrara&apos;s 1992 film there was all sort of outrage with fans asking how anyone could remake a film as far &quot;out there&quot; as that. I think most of these complaints were from people who didn&apos;t know Herzog because if you did know his work you&apos;d know he wouldn&apos;t just simply remake something. As was expected, this version has very little to nothing to do with the 1992 film so people can walk into this expecting something original. The film follows a simple storyline of a Lieutenant (Nicolas Cage) who is investigating the execution deaths of five people, including kids. He begins cracking down on known drug dealers in the area but he&apos;s also doing battle with his prostitute girlfriend (Eva Mendes) as well as his drug addiction to cocaine and heroine that is getting bigger by the hour. It&apos;s funny but the screenplay to this film probably would have fallen through the cracks had someone like Herzog not been behind the camera. That&apos;s not to say this is a bad screenplay but the entire investigation and all the side plots are pretty basic but it&apos;s thanks to Herzog&apos;s vision and Cage&apos;s performance that this film will go down as the wacky, over the top ride that it is. I didn&apos;t find the film flawless like some as a good ten minutes could have been cut out of the second act but the film is still very impressive. The important thing to remember going into the film is that you&apos;re about to see a very dark comedy so I guess one could call this the greatest comedy ever made about a drug-addict cop. Cage is what makes the movie because his performance here will rank as one of the greatest of his career. I think it has become easy to make fun of Cage and throw cheap insults at him but it&apos;s important to remember that when he&apos;s on fire he usually can&apos;t be touched by anyone and that&apos;s certainly the case here. Is he over the top? Sure but he&apos;s suppose to be. His performance is so dead on that you can help but look at him and feel that you&apos;re really seeing someone going through a major addiction. Cage&apos;s entire body seems to change shape throughout the movie as he grows more and more sick. The way Cage laughs at someone being called &quot;G&quot; is just priceless as is a terrific scene between he and an iguana. The supporting cast is very impressive as well with Mendes turning in a fine performance as the drugged out hooker, Val Kilmer as a psycho cop, Fairuza Balk as another cop and the always reliable Brad Dourif as a bookie. Herzog&apos;s vision is all over this thing and I really loved the overall look of the movie. I loved how the start of the film has the camera constantly moving, which to me was to imply the state that Cage&apos;s character was in with all the drugs. The film is a dark comedy and for the most part both Herzog and Cage go full steam to bring out the laughs and this includes a hilarious sequence with a couple old ladies with one on oxygen and others with Cage seeing things that aren&apos;t really there. The terrific cinematography and nice music score also add a great deal as do the worn down streets from the post Katrina days. This certainly isn&apos;t among the director&apos;s greatest works but it&apos;s still something very fresh and original and it really stands out compared to the other type of films being released today."

The acting in no way lessens the impact or the bravery of these men who chose to, for what ever reason, stay and pay the ultimate price for their beliefs. Billy Bob Thorton&apos;s portrayal of David Crockett is nothing short of brilliant. It is by far the best portrayal of David Crockett I have ever seen. Some of the characters seem a little thin but not enough to to ruin the experience. Go with your gut on this one. I don&apos;t think you will be disappointed. I believe an honest effort was made to tell the tragic story of these brave men."

      "reviewBody": "Kinski is acting as if he hadn&apos;t read the script, or as if there was no script to begin with. His character Daniel Shore is the only link between two different plot lines, set in Marocco and Germany respectively. While there are some surface similarities between the two stories, it&apos;s hard to figure out what&apos;s going on, let alone what the actual sequence of events may be. As a result, the whole movie has a dreamy, semi-conscious quality. While that&apos;s probably off-putting for most viewers, I think it&apos;s actually an accomplishment. If you consider a certain kind of confusion a valuable experience, you will enjoy this. But if you look for straightforward storytelling, it will probably feel like a waste of time. Although David Lynch obviously plays in a league of his own, &quot;Daniel Shore&quot; reminded me of &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in some respects. It&apos;s a very promising first feature. I hope this well won&apos;t run dry any time soon.",

Steiner (as opposed to James Coburns&apos;portrayal in CofI) might have been intriguing but for the bland, and badly made film that surrounds him. Wheras Cross of Iron had at least a feasable script, the main theme of of war disillusionment and the plot to kill Hitler just gets in the way. I suspect this whole red herring was added to make the movie more palatable for its German co-producers etc.(or vice versa) the score by the Berlin Orchestra is ridiculous, and sounds like something from a fast paced breaking news cast; Also very distracting. Regardless, Burtons&apos; enigmatic portrayal of a stereotypically stoic German soldier stands out. It is just too bad this movie&apos;s makers failed to capitalize on their best assets: their actors!"

      "name": "Otto: or, a Truly Original Piece of Art",
      "reviewBody": "The brilliance of some films is visible on multiple levels. Films such as Network (1976) and American Beauty (1999) are both satirical, yet they can be simultaneously viewed as good cinema. Bruce LaBruce&apos;s Otto; or, Up with Dead People (2008) is not such a film. It can be read as a satire, Bruce LaBruce&apos;s whorish attempt at an instant cult classic, or simply as an entirely original work of art. Actually, it seems more like a combination of the three. Otto satirizes the zombie crowd&apos;s lust for films that only have merit for their shock value. In case you aren&apos;t familiar with him, Bruce LaBruce is famous for (infamous for?) his no-budget B films. He is one of few directors to have directed a porno and had a film premier at Sundance. Without seeing the film, Otto often comes across at an extremely misguided attempt to corner a niche market—gay zombie horror porn. With that said, the film is neither a horror film nor a porno. There is relatively little gore, and much less sex than the right wing IMDb trolls would have you believe. Otto may be a satire; Otto may be an attempt into instant cult status; but in any case, Otto is art.\n\nOtto; or, Up with Dead People was shown at the Sundance film festival. However, simply being accepted into Sundance does not mean a film is good. Otto was also shown at the wonderful MoMA in NYC. Once again, this does not mean that it is a perfect film, but it should be noted in what way the film is being perceived: as a work of art. Most people will dismiss Otto as a pointless B movie, but in reality it is not pointless. Otto is one of the most original works of feature length cinema from the past decade that I have seen. And this is not simply based on the subject matter. LaBruce utilizes his distinct style and unique cinematic techniques to make Otto a truly fresh work of art.\n\nNow onto the film. Otto (Jey Crisfar) is convinced that he is a zombie who just recently was resurrected. Stumbling around town, he comes across a flyer for auditions for a zombie movie, Up with Dead People. At the audition, the director of the film, Medea (Katharina Klewinghaus), is impressed with Otto&apos;s commitment to the character. Otto of course truly believes that he is a zombie, while Medea is sure that Otto is just a regular guy who always seems to be exceptionally dirty. Zombies are often presented as allegorical to &quot;the ultimate consumers who all eat the same things, congregate at the same places, act the same&quot; (Fangoria). With Otto, LaBruce completely reverses this idea. Otto is a complete outcast. Not only is he a zombie, but Otto is gay. He experiences what is either gay-, zombie-, or gay zombie-bashing and generally not accepted by society.\n\nAnother of LaBruce&apos;s interesting cinematic choices is presenting Medea&apos;s lesbian lover, Hella (Susanne Sachße) as a silent film character. Hella is always presented in grainy black and white and her dialogue is even replaced with intertitles. Medea and other characters are still presented in full color even while the black and white Hella is sitting right next to them. As a film studies major, I am forced to attempt to find the symbolism/hidden meaning behind presenting Hella as such. However, I have come to the conclusion that LaBruce was simply attempting to present Hella as a specific type of character from the silent film era and he does so with clever blatancy.\n\nOtto is not what most people would consider as entertaining. Otto is not what most people would consider as art. If you watch the film thinking that you will hate it, I can guarantee with complete certainty that you will hate it. Watch this film with an open mind, and don&apos;t take it too seriously or literally. Network and American Beauty are praised because they work on two levels. They exaggerate the existing conventions of Hollywood cinema in order to criticize whereas Otto cinematically breaks free of the zombie genre in its criticism. As Dr. Marco Abel would say, whether or not you like the film is irrelevant. Otto is a entirely original piece of art.",

To make it even worse was that both of the actors are so good that it looks very realistic. I was basically crying my eyes out during the rape and considered leaving the theatre. Usually I can sit through anything but this was really sickening, disgusting and beyond belief. After that sequence the movie does lighten up--but the effect lingers on. \n\nAlso the story is told backwards--why? It serves no purpose that I can see. In something like &quot;Memento&quot; it worked--in this one it&apos;s just annoying.\n\nThis is a hard movie to rate--on one hand the acting was very good and the script interesting but there&apos;s very annoying camera-work at the beginning (the camera keeps spinning around and never focuses), loud, ugly sounds and there was no need for this film to be so graphic. Seriously--why shot a 10 minute rape scene in all its &quot;glory&quot;? What&apos;s the point other than to sicken the audience? \n\nSo I liked the actors and the plot and dialogue but didn&apos;t like the direction, camera-work, audio or the unrelenting violence.\n\nUse your own judgment on viewing this.",

The mommy is constantly messing up, Tad is constantly messing up as well.\n\nIt might be enjoyable for kids, but I&apos;m not a kid and I like &quot;intelligent&quot; story. But no. From start to end, its &quot;oh, I made a mistake&quot;, &quot;lets go to plan B&quot;, &quot;oh, I made another mistake&quot;, &quot;let&apos;s go to plan C&quot;. Pffff\n\nEven the voice track is dumbed down with &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;euh&quot; to fill up the silences.\n\nBut the animation, the visuals are just great. But without a supporting script.\n\nI&apos;m not a movie reviewer. This is my genuine appreciation of this Tad."

This has strong connection to the old movies about &quot;Sune&quot; but with no feeling or comedy. I highly recommend watching the original movies about &quot;Sune&quot; were Håkan has a much more comedic part and charm. Even Håkans dad &quot;Rudolf&quot; used to very funny but has been reduced to a pointless role which adds nothing to the movie.",
