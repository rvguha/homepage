While the acting is the strongest reason to watch this movie, the special effects are not. Although the art direction and production value are solid, every exterior scene in this movie lacks realism along with any real substance of historical nature. Ideally, having most of this movie take place in the conclave room works to the advantage like a stage play and heavily relies on the performance of the cast to tell the story. This is where Conclave shines.\n\nA surprise addition to the cast is the late and great John Dunsworth from Trailer Park Boys. As soon as you see him on the screen, you are routing for him to be named Pope. Overall, a nice story with wonderful moments worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, what is so amazing about this film is that, for the time that it was made, how modern it looks. David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white.\n\n   William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not.\n\n   Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British&apos;s own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil. \n\n   And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Ever since I was a child, the morbid tale of Bluebeard intrigued me immensely. But apparently, it&apos;s not very easy to find adequate films about the lady-murdering Baron. I haven&apos;t been able to track down the 1944 version (starring John Carradine!) yet, but I was very happy when I got hold of this one. I figured it couldn&apos;t go wrong with this cast (Richard Burton and Raquel &apos;One Million Years B.C.&apos; Welsh), the period of release (the rancid 70&apos;s) and because it partly is an Italian production (they dare to exceed limits of good taste more easily). To my regret it turned out a disappointment Not that it&apos;s an entirely bad film, though. The classic tale is respected and the film implies an interesting structure, but it&apos;s so darn tame! To any creative director or scriptwriter, this plot would offer such a great opportunity to deliver a compelling, adrenalin-filled film but here it&apos;s not the case. It doesn&apos;t even feature the slightest bit of sleaze, which I actually hoped for. There&apos;s too few excitement and action while the chilling set-pieces are underused. To choice to have Richard Burton play Baron Kurt &apos;Bluebeard&apos; Von Sepper sounded like an ingenious casting idea but his performance only is so so. For those unfamiliar with the plot: it handles about a German WWI veteran who returns from the war a ladykiller.literally. His eighth wife Anne discovers a secret room in the castle and a horrible secret. The only good comments actually go out to the female cast! One thing you got to admit, Baron Bluebeard has a fine taste and eye for female beauty. Goddess Raquel Welsh is great as a nymphomaniac nun and also Sybil Danning, Nathalie Delon and Virni Lisi impress in their roles of ex-wives. Bluebeard is worth a peek if a TV-station would ever program it, definitely not worth buying.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting biopic of O&apos;Casey - named John Cassidy here - based on the pre-exile, Irish part of his life. The cast is very high-powered and the cameos by Michael Redrave (as W.B.Yeats) and Edith Evans (as Lady Gregory) are superb - as is a young Maggie Smith as O&apos;Casey&apos;s girlfriend. Julie Christie looks great, but doesn&apos;t have much to do. Rod Taylor is surprisingly good in the main role, but I feel it suffers a little from the change of director, and is ultimately unsatisfying, rather rushing towards its conclusion. It could have been a great movie, but the pacing is off. For me, the 60s Dublin locations are the real stars.",

      "reviewBody": "The beginning of this documentary is devoid of credits. We see dolphins swimming and leaping in the open water and sea birds diving directly into the ocean to snatch a fish. The narrator (Pierce Brosnan) says, &quot;This is a world of constant jeopardy, an endless cycle of birth, death, and renewal.&quot; Powerful waves crash into the rocky coast, where the sea lions return to give birth, but unwary seals become prey to predators (the black and white colored killer whales) in the shallows at high tide. Then again, the whales themselves risk being stranded there.\n\nMore marine life is seen before the view shifts to the coral reefs, &quot;a narrow band of sun-fed life only found in the shallows of the tropical seas.&quot; The skeletons of coral polyps – the smallest and most fragile of organisms – form the reef. The darkness is feeding time for some; the night-feeders with built-in sensors have no need of light. Fascinating and colorful sea creatures abound further below the ocean surface, but unfortunately most are not identified. There are poisonous jellyfish and manta rays. Just before the halfway mark of the film the scene moves to the Arctic (polar bears) and also Antarctic (penguins). In the Antarctic the temperature is seventy degrees below zero (-70°F) and the winds exceed one hundred miles per hour. The penguins gather speed in the cold waters before jumping out and landing on sheet ice. Meanwhile in the far north the polar bears search for nesting seals hidden in ice caves situated just below the surface. Thirty-ton gray whales travel six thousand miles to feed in the polar seas. After six hours of jostling, killer whales separate one unfortunate gray calf from its mother and move in when it is thoroughly exhausted. \n\nFrom the surface of the ocean we next enter a subterranean world, the deepest underwater area on the planet and where surface light does not penetrate. Seven miles deep (the Marianas Trench), it is a mystery world of perpetual night. It is a sparsely explored netherworld of odd life forms (again unidentified). The only light emanates from the undersea creatures themselves. Light is used as a lure to attract prey or as a decoy to confuse them. Poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas and boiling water spew forth in some areas. Yet, even near those settings some life forms exist. At film&apos;s end we hear that there are only a few thousand blue whales left on earth. The blue whales are earth&apos;s largest creatures by far.\n\nThe narration is limited and the orchestral music appropriate. If you like nature documentaries, you will enjoy this one, although there are several lulls.",

      "reviewBody": "Face to Face is quite good, but it is, essentially, two different movies based on two different books, stuck back-to-back for no apparent reason. Personally, I think the two stories share a sneaky anti-Christian undercurrent, but other than that they don&apos;t share a lot of similarities. The first story is based on a book by Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness), which is about a first-time navel officer who, while on watch, finds a murderous refugee from another ship swimming in the ocean.  It had a thoughtful and steady pace, and was fairly serious in its storytelling, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The second story is based on a Stephen Crane book about the gunslinging Marshall of a small western town who gets married in San Antonio.  It&apos;s a more light-hearted story which is surprisingly funny at times, especially when the town drunk puts on his 6-shooters and decides to stumble around town raising heck. I don&apos;t know why these two 40-odd minute movies were stuck together in order to make a feature length film, but it seemed to work pretty well because it told two complete short stories in under 90 minutes.  A neat and enjoyable film.  Whee!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster&quot; deserves more than the small cult following it has attracted. Due to the lack of its inclusion on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000,&quot; the movie is not widely known.\n\nThe story (what there is of it) concerns Earth&apos;s first mission to Mars.  A scientist (Jim Karen) has decided a robot would be better sent than a human, considering the enormous risks involved in interplanetary travel. Unknown to NASA, a ship containing the inhabitants of a doomed planet is orbiting Earth, seeking women to repopulate their species.  The ship considers the Mars mission an attack, and destroys the ship, but not before Col. Frank (the robot) escapes the explosion and lands in Puerto Rico(!)\n\nThis film, simply put, is a hoot to watch.  From Dr. Nadir&apos;s Play-Doh ears, to the most stock footage I have ever seen in a movie (featuring the groovy song &quot;That&apos;s The Way It&apos;s Got To Be&quot; by The Poets), to the toy air-guns used by the aliens, to common drapery being used to incubate the captured women, &quot;Space Monster&quot; delivers many delciously awful moments.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an unappreciated film, mostly because it&apos;s star doesn&apos;t exactly have a good reputation as an &apos;actor&apos;.  This film is definately worth catching and it is worthy of repeated viewings.  The music too is perfect for the film. It charts the rise of a Union leader from his humble beginnings to his fame. The story sustains the attention of the viewer throughout the picture. Stallone is better in the earlier scenes as a young Johny Kovak.  His acting limitations come about as we see him as an older man.  All he does his makes his voice a little husky and the make up on him (and other members of the cast) is ineffective. Early in his career, kovak has the dilema of bringing in the mob for help after an unsuccessful strike which results in one of his best men being killed.  If he brings them in, he can enforce his will on the big companies and make the union very strong.  Without them, he has little chance of the union growing.  To the dismay of his best friend, he takes them in.  His decision comes back to haunt him. Stallone tailored the script so he can play the good guy, originally Kovak wasn&apos;t a nice man.  There is a nice scene with him and Brian Dehenny who later would turn up as Rambo&apos;s nemesis in first blood. I would certainly recommend fans and non fans of Stallone to catch this movie."

There is none of the wit and wisdom of the characters in the novel or the delicate beauty of Dorian, and the ending is completely changed for no good reason.\n\nI still have to wait for the definitive film version that can (literally) flesh out the characters while still keeping the novel intact.

      "reviewBody": "I was looking forward to this film but it was a big letdown. The best parts of the film (and why I give it as much as a 4) are; 1) The efforts of the two main actresses. They really tried but those efforts were wasted on the uninspired dialogue, directing and editing. 2) The physical beauty of the settings, sets and some of the lighting and atmosphere. Even here, we have to subtract the fact that the movie was obviously not filmed in China and did not do a good job of pretending to be in China. The success there was in this area was wasted on the problems itemized below.\n\nThe bad parts of the film were; 1) Almost no character development. Every character is uninteresting. The two men are nothing but self centred brutes with no other characteristics. There was not much more depth to the women. It was hard to develop a full sympathy for them. And that is too bad. The opportunity was there and the actresses were there to do it. 2) Uneven story progression. It frequently goes from scene to scene in a disjointed fashion. How much useful content was cut? This seems to want to be an artistic, lush film. So why not stretch it out to 120 minutes or more and do justice to the characters and the story? This might simply be the director&apos;s fault but the editors and producers might have played a part in that. 3) Thin story. Not much happens. Some films can get away with that, but here, we don&apos;t even get nicely drenched in what does happen. 4) Uninspired directing. We get neither a fully indulgent artistic film nor something brash and in-your-face nor any kind of satisfying balance thereof. To be fair, the director might have actually created the material for a better film which was then badly edited. Alternatively, maybe the diversity of the production crew prevented the film from having a clear identity. 5) Old hat, tired symbolism. I don&apos;t want to put in specific spoilers but suffice it to say that it was very obvious and hyper familiar. 6) Lost potential. It&apos;s just a shame when some good components and potential are lost.",

One, a photographer, is a strong woman in her business, but is hanging on to a time when she was in love. She lost that love and sort of intimidates him into meeting her in a few days. She is getting older and more lonely and doesn&apos;t see life as worth much (really---in a Bergman film?). The other, played by Harriett Andersson is a young photographic model, has a fiery temper and she has driven off her lover. As she tries to get her bearings, she window shops, and is approached by a rich old man (a widower), who buys her an expensive dress, jewels, and shoes. They go to an amusement part where she has a great time while his strength begins to fizzle. They go back to his huge house and frolic like teenagers. They both have too much to drink and she is trying to seduce him when his daughter shows up and embarrasses both of them. She is stunned at how foolish she has been. The first woman meets her former lover, now a family man, and tries to rekindle the attraction. But then a series of events take place (I won&apos;t spoil the scene). The acting is excellent and there is actually a positive message that comes out of this.",

      "reviewBody": "I loved this movie. In updating my VHS collection to DVD I bought it a second time and was so glad that I did. I love the music score and the soft period lighting it provides in telling the story of Rose - a down on her luck teen-age almost adult girl who comes to live with a southern family during the depression in the 1930&apos;s. Although the film was edited for time (as all films are) the DVD provided more background information about the story through the commentary provided. Although I&apos;ve never read the book - watching it again has made me decide that I want to. \n\nI count this movie with others of its&apos; kind (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER to name a few) as providing a wonderful opportunity to become a part of another&apos;s family memory. These kind of movies are capable of evoking in us a remembrance of our own childhood and bringing out feelings of warmth and caring that many of us have in common.\n\nI highly recommend it for its beautiful photography and wonderful music.",

The problem was that I was not interested in having boxing lessons, however my parents and I had recently seen the Thrill of a Romance movie; and needless to say I developed a huge crush on Ester Williams. I asked my mother if she thought that my grandfather would pay for swimming lessons, and he did! As a result of seeing this movie, I learned to swim and then swam competitively from age ten through high school and then played four years water polo at UCLA. During the summers, while in college and continuing until age 62, I worked as a lifeguard and pool manager. Both daughters also swam competitively and had summer lifeguard jobs....... Thank You Ester Williams :-)",

The actors all did a phenomenal job and will was ofcourse the stand out performance. Namoi scott also did a great job aswell. The one problem i have with this film is that jafar looks way too young he doesnt have the same effect when he looks like that"

But there were opportunities missed to make it more enjoyable to watch. It&apos;s already a very dark movie... literally as well as figuratively. The grim tone of the characters moods and situation were reflected in the use of the dark and sometimes monotonous tones on screen. This in and of itself isn&apos;t a bad thing.. but you have to balance that with something a little more engaging for your audience.\n\nUltimately I still enjoyed this film for what it was. I&apos;m glad I watched it and while I personally believe that it was excellent at it&apos;s core, I can only assume that the lackluster responses are a direct result of how unnecessarily boring it was at times.",

His charming powers over Mrs. Thompson were hysterical, and the entire cast did very well with this movie.\n\nOne for the kids that mom and dad will enjoy sitting through, which is a rarity anymore, except for the likes of Shrek.\n\nOh, and I can&apos;t omit Rollo Weeks, as The Little Vampire himself. He was so charming, so perfectly nailed the role of Rudolph. As well as the role for arguably the cutest kid in movies, Jonathan Lipnicki, as Tony Thompson. The crush Anna had on him was acted out adorably by Anna Popplewell, as well. There was just great acting all around in The Little Vampire.\n\nA job well done by all involved. This will make my list of movies to purchase just to share with my grandkids that someday I&apos;ll have to spoil. Campy, scary enough for the little ones and entertaining for their parents. What&apos;s not to like?",

Death once had a near-Chuck-Norris experience. Chuck Norris can strangle you with a cordless phone. Chuck Norris once won an underwater breathing contest...against a fish!\n\nAs made obviously clear, I absolutely love these Chuck Norris jokes that can be found all over the internet! Maybe, just maybe, these jokes find their origin in this film in particular! After all, when you battle an ancient and demonic antichrist, who waited for more than nine centuries to bring upon the apocalypse, well, then you earned the right &amp; privilege to be referred to as the toughest macho in the universe! The opponent of Chicago cop Norris is named Prosatanos, and not coincidentally that sounds a lot like preposterous. &quot;Hellbound&quot; goes massively over-the-top in every department. The plot takes partially takes place in the year 1186, in 1951, and in the 90s. The action is set in Holy places like Israel and the Vatican, as well as in the drug/prostitution infested ghettos of Chicago. Christopher Neame depicts an obnoxious archeologist and the Antichrist. Chuck Norris has a black comic-relief police partner that he drags around everywhere, and yet he does everything himself. The unearthly beautiful Zoë Trilling briefly appears as a call-girl who caters Satan&apos;s wingman! This movie is - to quote the buddy cop - nuttier than a Snickers bar! It was also the last title to get released by the legendary Cannon Group. And just because they are so incredibly hilarious, here&apos;s another selection of Chuck Norris fun-facts:\n\nChuck Norris is the reason why Waldo is hiding. Chuck Norris can build a snowman out of rain. The dinosaurs looked at Chuck Norris the wrong way once, and you know what happened to them. Chuck Norris was exposed to the Coronavirus, and the virus is now in quarantine for a month.",

Soon they&apos;re dealing with legislation problems and greedy weasels with old money, but will Hayward&apos;s ambitious nature ruin her marriage as well as bring her past history to light? Well-produced but naive, rather plodding melodrama based on Wirt Williams&apos; novel &quot;Ada Dallas&quot; gives all the juiciest scenes to Hayward; Martin, on the other, is shunted off to the side (they&apos;re quite a pair anyway: he drinks, she smokes). The atmosphere of Southern plantations and back alleys isn&apos;t captured with much distinction (we don&apos;t even know what state this is supposedly taking place in), but the production is certainly colorful, even if the human interaction is rote. ** from ****",

In a mix of air force pseudo-documentary and private life scenes, you get impressions worth some thoughts from back then and there.\n\nIn kind of a nutshell, many contents are compressed. You have the American bomb (left over from WW2) that kills one protagonist, a visiting Soviet general (who was also in the Spanish civil war), a brief sketch of relations with Poland, detailed discussion of pilot&apos;s illusions, and much more. There are flight fitness tests which remind me of Space Cowboys, multiple jet planes (somehow Starfighter F-104 lookalikes) in the air, one crash with pilot ejection, alas, to too shallow waters.\n\nAll in all, an interesting viewing. You can watch this on YouTube, stitched together from seven parts. I found it worth the while.",

      "reviewBody": "At first it seemed to me a mystery why &apos;Vacanze di Natale&apos;, a rather tame comedy by Italian standards became such a hit, gathering a cult following and numerous sequels, until I realized that this was probably the first true chick flick in Italian cinema. For the first time, we see women manipulating men and chasing after them in equal doses to their male counterparts (where as previously this was strictly a one way street). Here, the attractive people clearly outnumber the usual ugly caricatures (even the least attractive of them, Jerry Càla, practices his playboy charm as a night club pianist). The father and son producing team of Luigi and Aurelio De Laurentiis clearly had a young, teenage audience in mind here, using wall to wall pop tunes on the soundtrack (no need for an original score) and festive pictures of holiday fun.\n\nAt the start we are introduced to a great deal of characters gathered together for a skying holiday at Hotel/Ristorante Fanes at Cortina D&apos;Ampezzo. But luckily there are just two mayor plot lines to keep track off. The funnier part revolves around piano playing playboy Billo (Càla) who is trying to rekindle a love affair with Ivana (Stefania Sandrelli) while juggling several other female flings in the air at the same time. The more romantic part sees young Mario (Cladio Amendola) falling for Samantha from Pittsburgh (Katarina Huff), who is already engaged to the easily excitable Roberto (Christian De Sica).\n\nBillo distracts Ivana&apos;s rich husband (Guido Nichelli) by pointing him in the direction of busty Licinia Lentini, but soon finds himself in the proverbial log cabin looking to hide several scantily clad women (don&apos;t get too excited however, this comedy is for all ages). Even Samantha ends up in that closet, tying the two separate plots together. All the other characters all have their funny quirks and amusing routines without getting in the way of the main stories. There is the usual clowning around on skis and sleds, but most of the film is played indoors, where the men play cards while the women read magazines. &apos;Vacanze di Natale&apos; was the start of a franchise for director/writer Carlo Vanzina and star Christian De Sica and ushered in the era of date movies as opposed to the &apos;naughty boy&apos; comedies of the previous decade.\n\n7 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "This was two movies slashed together.\n\nOne is the much adapted &quot;A Little Princess&quot;(most famously by Cuaron in the 90s and Shirley Temple&apos;s 30&apos;s version) , which is about heiress Sarah and her stay within Miss Minchin&apos;s boarding school before and after his father&apos;s death AND a weird 20 min sequence of Arabian Nights, added as a midnight &apos;story&apos; subplot - which might had been another movie/short that they felt needed to add an element of &apos;adventure&apos; to the film. It literally is a different film that captured ~20% of the film.\n\nFirstly, both Zazu Pitts and Mary Pickford looks old old for their parts. They were practically in their 20s playing ten year old but to their credit, they acted WELL for whatever that script was. You kind of see why Pickford played this juvenile roles to death. She has that youthful persona that really glisten on the screen.\n\nAgain, the script is so weird. It practically stops midway to add an irrelevant subplot AND the filmmaking does not really help. So its not really anything to write about. Its stagy, and pretty much standard of the film of the time. Very large sets and ungodly large props which seems to cater the larger actress lol. Then the ending just drops.\n\nLet&apos;s just say 1hr is not enough for the film&apos;s material.\n\nNot recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not even sure where to start with a movie like JOHN DIES AT THE END. It&apos;s one of those movies that just seems destined from the start to be a cult classic, but I&apos;m not so sure. I love a good WTF movie that I can share with friends over a few beers, but a good WTF movie does more than baffle the audience with the bizarre. A good WTF film will have an awesome story (e.g. cyberpunk Nazis on the moon = IRON SKY) and an engaging hero/protagonist (e.g. Rutger Hauer in HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN). Keep in mind, my examples are just movies that I personally enjoy in the WTF genre but the same principles still stand. I can&apos;t really agree that JOHN DIES AT THE END has either (much less both) of these qualities. I am a huge fan of Cracked.com and I&apos;ve been following the site since I first stumbled across it while searching for a time-waster while I worked tech support. Their content is most often hilarious and generally a bit informative too. I&apos;m totally down with supporting their writers in whatever endeavors they pursue if it means more of their excellent product. JOHN DIES AT THE END (written by senior Cracked editor David Wong) is on my shortlist of novels I&apos;m planning on buying from Amazon, but I was excited to find out that a movie would be released in the meantime and that it would be directed by Don Coscarelli. BUBBA HO-TEP is another great WTF film, so naturally I was expecting great things with the movie. The ultimate reality: it falls short of being the movie I wanted, but it has inspired me to move a little faster on picking up the novel.\n\nTo start, and you&apos;ll probably hear this from anyone who&apos;s seen the movie but not read the novel, JOHN DIES AT THE END doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense. It feels like there&apos;s a plot in theresomewhere. I just can&apos;t find it. I&apos;ve uncovered bits of it and pieced it all together but there are still a lot of holes. I&apos;ve pretty much given up on figuring out the plot in its entirety until I read the book. For now, I only know what I&apos;ve seen in the movie. David Wong (Chase Williamson) and John (Rob Mayes) are a couple of stoned losers who encounter a new drug known on the street as &apos;soy sauce.&apos; Soy sauce has the ability to give its user supernatural abilities thatI don&apos;t quite understand. Communicating with the deadand the futureand other dimensions, I think. And inexplicable knowledge. Anyway, David and John discover an evil plot involving body-snatching white bugs/fuzz and plans of an entity of pure evil from an alternate universe to dominate our world. See what I mean? I&apos;m not even sure. And everything I&apos;ve read tells me it&apos;s explained 100 times better in the novel, so I haven&apos;t given up hope. But, as a movie, it&apos;s lacking. Honestly, my interest waned around the time David was kidnapped by an annoying ghetto white kid (Jonny Weston) and the detective investigating the weird goings-on (Glynn Turman) went totally mental.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the big problem here: weirdness without any sort of context becomes dull real fast. For the first 45 minutes of the movie or so, I was loving it. The meat monster, the ominous Jamaican, the messed-up/dark sense of humor to the whole thingit was great. But once the &quot;story&quot; kicked into gear, I lost it. The best way to describe JOHN DIES AT THE END is this: it feels like a 100-minute trailer for a really awesome six-hour movie. There&apos;s a lot of interesting stuff going on here and the whole movie feels like it&apos;s on the verge of greatness but it never pays off. There&apos;s a lot of cool stuff that&apos;s introduced or mentioned and never fully explored. What was the deal with Roger North (Doug Jones)? And what about the alien slug with teeth that appeared three times in the movie? Was it a tool of good or evil? How exactly did Korrok&apos;s plan (Korrok being the ultimate evil entity from an alternate universe) involve the body-snatching bugs? If Dr. Marconi (Clancy Brown) was so awesome, why wasn&apos;t the movie about HIM saving the world? Seriously. Marconi was probably the coolest character in the whole movie and he&apos;s the most wasted. Brown gets higher billing than Paul Giamatti in the movie but he&apos;s only in it for about 5 minutes. What&apos;s the point of his character? He&apos;s stone-cold awesome in the few instances we see him in action, but we send David and John to help save the world? Where did the soy sauce come from? Is it a creation of Korrok? Did it have anything to do with the white bug swarms or not, because I&apos;m getting mixed signals.\n\nMore questions than answers with the plot, but at least some of the humor works well. Chase Williamson is pretty decent as David Wong and Rob Hayes did a great job, but I think a lot of fans of Cracked might agree that this movie would&apos;ve been exponentially funnier if Daniel O&apos;Brien and Michael Swaim had been cast in the lead roles. People who aren&apos;t followers of Cracked won&apos;t know who those two are, but it couldn&apos;t have hurt the movie&apos;s success seeing as how the release was so low-key to begin with. JOHN DIES AT THE END is a mildly entertaining distraction that will frustrate anyone in the market for a solid story but there are some good laughs to be had. If anything, I can say it&apos;s got me that much more interested in reading the book.",

      "reviewBody": "Twenty years ago, Milwaukee bank clerk Emil Jannings (as August Schiller) is blissfully happy with dear wife Belle Bennett and their six children. Dedicated to both work and family, Mr. Jannings carefully watches his bank&apos;s securities, and teaches son Philippe De Lacy (as August Jr.) to play the violin. When a crisis occurs, Jannings is the problem-solver. An amazingly punctual and structured man, Jannings is reluctant when asked to transport $1,000 to Chicago for his bank, but goes. On the train, Jannings is sitting across from bleached blonde Phyllis Haver (as Mayme) when the conductor arrives to check passengers&apos; tickets. When Jennings produces his ticket, Ms. Haver catches a glimpse of the bank&apos;s $1,000 securities, and is enthralled. She succeeds in seducing Jennings, assisted by champagne. He wakes up in a strange bedroom, minus both blonde and bucks. Jennings tracks Haver to a saloon and accidentally kills her tough boyfriend Fred Kohler in a struggle...\n\nWracked with guilt over his actions, Jannings decides to go along with the story, after the criminal&apos;s body is mistaken for his own, to spare his family embarrassment and scandal. Twenty years pass...\n\nPresently, Jannings is still estranged from his family. He heavily carries the weight of shame as he works picking up trash in a park. Wandering tramp-like, he sees grown-up son Donald Keith (as August Jr.) has becomes a successful concert violinist. Jannings manages to attend Mr. Keith&apos;s performance. Taught by Jannings, young Keith handles the violin expertly, shedding a tear when playing one of his father&apos;s favorites. Keith does not know his father is alive, watching in the audience. Jennings shadows his family when they place flowers on the grave of the eldest sibling, who died serving in World War I. During a Christmas snowstorm, Jannings encounters son Keith, who pities the old tramp with a silver dollar. Keith enters his warm family home as father Jannings walks off into the cold evening, alone...\n\nUnfortunately, &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; is a LOST film but portions of the film have turned up. Two surviving excerpts are from the last act, when Jannings is a haggard old tramp. The first part is from a documentary; mainly, it includes Jannings discovering son Keith. The second part is, fortunately, the film&apos;s emotional closing sequence, when Jannings and Keith meet. With the documentary&apos;s narration included, the available footage forms its own &quot;short&quot; story and is a good sample of the film&apos;s worth. It is available on &quot;Fragments: Surviving Pieces of Lost Films&quot; (2011) released by &quot;Flicker Alley&quot; and has been shown on &quot;Turner Classic Movies&quot; (TCM). In fact, the stellar Jannings performance is the highlight of &quot;Fragments&quot;...\n\nJannings&apos; performance was one of the two for which he won the first &quot;Academy Award&quot; as &quot;Best Actor&quot;. The award was for his roles in both &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; and &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1928). Due to the former&apos;s foray into over-sentimentality, the award was seen by critics as something better remembered as for the latter film. Comparing &quot;Best Picture&quot; standings, &quot;Film Daily&quot; placed &quot;Way of All Flesh&quot; at #4 and &quot;Last Command&quot; at #3 for their years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; had the latter at #5 while the former in the earlier year&apos;s top ten (exact position not given). Some of Oscar&apos;s early awards are puzzling, but awarding Jannings&apos; still obviously superb characterizations is easy to applaud.\n\n********* The Way of All Flesh (6/25/27) Victor Fleming ~ Emil Jannings, Belle Bennett, Donald Keith, Phyllis Haver",

It was a Japanese period piece in which King Kong destroys sections of ancient Tokyo, in former days was called Edo.\n\nEdo being the period from 1603-1867 when Japan was isolated from the outer world in the period of (I believe) the 17th or 18th century. Granted, Kong invaded Japan (in this film at least), but in the Edo timeframe. They threw in some Caligari-esquire, expressionistic structures so&apos;s he&apos;d have something to climb...! It sounds very strange!\n\nKong itself is said to look like a kaiju that Sid &amp; Marty Krofft (&quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;) would have designed, a dodgey gorilla, in this movie, that grapples with not only a titan bumble bee, but at one point, ensnared in Moloogra&apos;s trap (a 20-story tall ant lion), the over-blown primate is harassed by troublesome mayflies! Sadly, this movie constitutes perhaps the most tragic loss to World Cinema since Disney pulled the plug on SONG OF THE SOUTH, (1946) --- or Cozzi&apos;s HERACLES (1983)"

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most interesting and entertaining fantasy movies ever made. Unfortunately, it is relatively unknown, (especially in the UK where it cannot be found on DVD or video, and it has never seen a release on either of these formats to my knowledge- it does however, show up every 5 years or so on Channel 4-so look out for it there.) It also seems to be compared unfavourably with &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, which is a shame, as it surpasses this admittedly fine film in many ways. The story is typical fairy tale stuff, a poor farmers&apos; son rescues a princess from the evil clutches of a sorceror, but it somehow transcends this simple tale and becomes something so much darker, and scarier than it&apos;s more famous rival. There is a cruel streak running through this film which is totally absent from &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, and which makes this movie more like a horror film than a childrens fantasy.This fact was obviously picked up on by the film censors in the UK who gave it an &quot;A&quot; certificate (children to be accompanied by an adult) way back in 1967 when it hit the cinemas here- it was also cut by around two minutes of the more violent moments. On the down side, the monsters in &quot;Jack&quot; are rubbery and unconvincing- which is unfortunate, and does make some of the scenes look very fake indeed, and in this respect, the film is no match at all for the beautiful models on display in &quot;Voyage&quot;- but the optical colour effects when spells are cast, and especially the nightmarish blue tints during the scary witches&apos; attack on the boat, are breathtaking and look very magical, and there is also a fabulous finale when the evil &quot;Pendragon&quot; turns into a dragon and fights to the death with Jack. Younger children will find this movie too frightening, even now when kids see a lot of things they should&apos;nt. Older kids will probably find it a bit too corny for their tastes. Which only leaves nostalgic adults and the 6-10 age group left to enjoy this movies&apos; many charms- a shame."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sirens&quot; seems to have touched a nerve here.  Some reviewers dismiss it as derivative soft-core drivel.  Others love it.  It probably helps to know that there&apos;s little derivative about the story-it&apos;s based on real people and a real incident. Sam Neill&apos;s character--Norman Lindsay--was real.  Lindsay, a prolific artist and novelist, was also a libertine living a Hugh Hefner lifestyle when the rest of the world was awakening from the Victorian Age. &quot;Sirens&quot; was filmed at the Lindsay home and gallery, a 40-acre estate now run by the Australian National Trust.  The artworks are all Lindsay&apos;s.  And the storyline is based on an incident in which the Anglican Church dispatched a cleric to convey concerns about &quot;The Crucifixion of Venus.&quot; As for the plot, it&apos;s simply a humorous retelling of what might have been--with lots of voluptuous nudes and erotic symbolism tossed in for good measure.  Yes, it&apos;s all quite predictable.  You know five minutes into the film that the Converters will become the Converted. But it&apos;s a fun ride getting to that inevitable destination.    `Sirens&apos; is not for everyone.  If full-frontal male and female nudity offends, you will be offended.  If ridiculing the Church or its values offends, you will be offended.  And if the notion that the cure for a boring marriage is a little extra-marital dalliance offends, you will truly be offended. Otherwise, it&apos;s a little erotic gem and a great way to start an even better evening. :)",

      "reviewBody": "Tracey Berkowitz is a 15y.o. girl on a night bus, covered by a curtain shower, talking directly to you - nonsense. He memory is fragmented, chaotic, fancy, and on a loop. She has left home, is looking for her missing little brother Sonny and is in trouble.\n\nWe are drawn into Tracey&apos;s chaotic mind and soul, but also towards her path of growth from child to woman, from fairy-tale worlds to harsh reality and acceptance of the self. This is a very interesting story about a teenager that is not pretty, cleaver or happy. Although this is a movie about teenagers, there is nothing sweet about it, as presents very hard topics: rape, bullying, loneliness, lack of self-esteem, confused self-image, delusional thoughts, insecurity, and mental trouble.\n\nTracey&apos;s memory fragments and thoughts appear in mini-screens within the screen and on split-screen images, which show different angles of the same scene or different scenes altogether. The non-linear narrative is very challenging. Pay extra attention to the first 15-20 minutes of the film, because they are the most difficult and the ones that really give clues to understand many of the things that happen later on.\n\nThe film is more complex, visually, at the beginning, when Tracey&apos;s mind and emotions are more confused, and becomes simpler and more linear at the same pace that Tracey&apos;s mind clears, to be completely linear at the end, when she accepts herself and the events related to Sonny. In other words, Tracey&apos;s troubled mind and emotions are directly linked to the way the movie is visually organized. The movie is also full of symbolic psychoanalytical elements, from the gender of Tracey&apos;s psychiatrist and the settings in which the consultation happens, to the appearance of different animals (a crow, a horse, and &quot;a dog&quot;), to the way the scenes have been patched and shown to the viewer.\n\nEllen Page is fantastic, despite the dramatic demands of her character. She was 20 when the film was shot, but she is believable as a 15y.o. girl. That&apos;s not only her physique, is the great actress she is. The rest of the cast are OK in their respective roles: Ari Cohen and Erin McMurtry as Mr &amp; Mrs Berkowitz; Zie Souwand as sweet Sonny; Toronto Songwriter and performer Slim Twigg as jerk Billy Zero, Julain Richings as Dr Heker, among others.\n\nA few important flaws ruined what could have been a great movie. The main idea is brilliant but, since we get mostly Tracey&apos;s subjective approach to reality, the rest of the characters are somewhat pointless and can&apos;t be trusted by the viewer; in fact they are just hinted. I did not like the end, not the way it ended, but how the end was presented and how we get there - what triggers Tracey&apos;s epiphany? That is so because the mood of the movie and, most importantly, its tempo were not the right ones.\n\nThis is one of those movies that are a challenge for the viewers, that need of their full awareness and attention, that have a difficult knot to untie, but also one of those movies that can be interpreted in different ways and make your brain produce sparks. One of those movies that you get or you don&apos;t, nothing in between. To me, one of those movies that, the more I think about it, the more I want to watch again.\n\nAre you ready for it?",

      "reviewBody": "I am no expert on Nero Wolfe stories, but do know that in some ways Columbia Pictures got the story right and in other ways they dropped the ball. This is no surprise, as Hollywood back in the day often disregarded the original source material...more so than in this film. The biggest way the story differs from the original is the character Archie (Lionel Stander). In the book from which it was based, he was quick-witted and sophisticated. Here, however, it&apos;s Lionel Stander playing his usual sidekick duties...and comes off as uncouth and really slow-witted (at best). Fortunately, they got Nero Wolfe closer to the book as well as many of the details of the case.\n\n The story begins with a foursome playing golf. It&apos;s interrupted when one of the party drops dead! It&apos;s soon reported in the papers that the guy died of a heart attack. Here&apos;s a huge problem...the agoraphobic* Nero immediately declares to Archie that the dead man was murdered. How could he know or guess this when all he knows about the story is a tiny blurb in the paper. There&apos;s no inside information he&apos;s privy to...and the article says the man died from a heart attack. And, given that B-movie detectives are almost always right, when he convinces authorities to exhume and re-examine the body, it is discovered he died from poison...poison from a South/Central American snake, the Fer-de-Lance**.\n\nThis film simply isn&apos;t for purists....as Columbia, like most all the studios of the day, didn&apos;t trust the source material and altered it. If you aren&apos;t a purist, the film is enjoyable fluff...much like 100001 other B-mysteries of the era. Edward Arnold is good as Wolfe...but not much else to make it stand out as a mystery movie.\n\n\n\n*An agoraphobe is a person who never leaves their home due to the fear and dread of the outside world.\n\n**This snake was said in the film to come from the Argentine. I checked and this snake is NOT found in Argentina but the top of South America and Central America.",

In this kind of movies is really easy to fall in the conventions and make a story full of clichés with police chases and all powerful heroes, but not, fortunately the director takes another perspective and gets into the life of the &apos;Mulas&apos;, and shows the whole picture without any prejudgment. \n\nIs admirable how a person that had never been in Colombia, before the movie, understands the problem and shows it in a so delicate and powerful way, and is able to put it in the big screen without extremes so common in films about Latin America made by foreign directors, as an example watch Len Loach&apos;s Carla&apos;s Song. \n\nThe story of the movie is quite simple: a 17 years old girl has many economic problems and takes the &apos;mule&apos; work as an opportunity to get the money she needs. The narration is lineal and relays absolutely in the work of the two main actresses, and this is the success of the movie, the work of the two girls is superb, they transmit lots of energy in the screen, and although sometimes the decisions of the characters are quite sudden, their interpretation makes them absolutely believable. \n\nThe movie changed the cover, for commercial reasons of course, and that is a shame, because the first one was really beautiful, it showed Maria in the airport in the middle of a group as if she were in a procession, but the new one although good is more obvious and drug oriented and lacks the delicacy of the film. \n\nLet&apos;s wait for Mr Marston next movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank&apos;s Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you&apos;re watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold.\n\nI can&apos;t blame Trank for the discrepancies I have with the movie because he is not at fault. Apparently the producers demanded reshoots which rear their ugly head about 20 minutes from the end. It turns from this relatively dark, stylish superhero drama to an overblown one-liner infested CGI-fest. Mind you, I was still pulling for the heroes the entire time, but the moments following, preceding and including the final confrontation are so forcefully rushed and haphazardly put together it completely disconnects you from what the first hour of the movie set-up. The climax is generic and lackluster, and the believable shaky chemistry the characters shared in the beginning of the movie becomes incredibly forced and awkward. The shift is so drastic it&apos;s as if they Frankenstein&apos;d two separate movies together, making for one extremely disjointed watching experience.\n\nMiles Teller and the rest of the cast have the benefit of being immensely likable. They worked well together and had palpable chemistry for a good chunk of the movie. Even Doom was fine. Once I got past the fact that it wasn&apos;t the comic book&apos;s adaptation of &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; and took him at face value as a sci-fi villain, I thought he worked wonders and actually posed a genuine threat to humanity. The CGI as a whole is great - a few moments will leave you scratching your head as in &quot;was that really necessary?&quot; but for the most part, the alternate dimension looks fantastic and the few fight scenes there are (literally only two or three) are executed well.\n\nAgain, these are simply hints of what the movie could&apos;ve been. It&apos;s obvious Trank had a vision with this world, and it&apos;s a damn shame that we won&apos;t be able to see it in full effect. What we&apos;re left with is a promising set-up and a complete mess of a third act with potential bleeding out right up until the final frames. Fantastic Four is more realistic and immersive than the other two adaptations, but unfortunately not as fun as either. What we&apos;re left with is an exercise in &quot;what could have been&quot; and another superhero movie with promising aspects that simply did not click.",

      "reviewBody": "The Resurrected is a peculiar entry into the Lovecraftian horror genre, and it&apos;s a shame that this 1991 film hasn&apos;t garnered more attention from horror enthusiasts. It&apos;s an oddity, a slow-burn horror that blends neo-noir, science fiction, and supernatural elements, resulting in a somewhat confusing yet intriguing cinematic experience.\n\nThis film, directed by Dan O&apos;Bannon of Alien and Return of the Living Dead fame, is a clear labor of love. O&apos;Bannon&apos;s influence is evident throughout, with the film bearing the marks of a director passionate about crafting a unique and unsettling experience. Unfortunately, while the film has its merits, it also has its fair share of shortcomings, which may explain why it has flown under the radar for so long.\n\nThe Resurrected follows in the footsteps of its director&apos;s previous works, boasting impressive practical effects and a gripping, well-paced narrative. The screenplay, by Brent V. Friedman, is a standout feature, seamlessly blending three distinct genres. It&apos;s a refreshing change from the often poorly paced and vapid writing of late 80s and early 90s horror. The movie also benefits from strong performances, particularly from Chris Sarandon, who delivers an unhinged and memorable turn.\n\nHowever, the film&apos;s slow pace may be off-putting to some viewers. It often feels more like a TV miniseries that has been condensed, which detracts from the overall impact. While the conclusion is spectacular and justifies the slow burn, with some truly impressive practical effects, the journey there may test the patience of viewers accustomed to faster-paced, more immediate horror thrills.\n\nThe Resurrected is a film that divides opinion. It has all the ingredients for a cult classic, but its slow pace and odd tone may deter some from seeing it through to the end. For those willing to embrace its peculiarities, there is much to admire, from the ambitious narrative to the impressive practical effects. However, with a pace that often drags and a story that feels more suited to a longer format, it is easy to see why this film has not achieved wider recognition.",

      "reviewBody": "It is 1967, and Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a quiet Midwestern university, has just been informed by his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) that she is leaving him. She has fallen in love with one of his more pompous acquaintances, Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), who seems to her a more substantial person than the feckless Larry. Larry&apos;s unemployable brother Arthur (Richard Kind) is sleeping on the couch, his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is a discipline problem and his daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) is stealing money from his wallet in order to save up for a nose job. While his wife and Sy Ableman blithely make new domestic arrangements, and his brother becomes more and more of a burden, an anonymous hostile letter-writer is trying to sabotage Larry&apos;s chances for tenure at the university. Also, a graduate student seems to be trying to bribe him for a passing grade while at the same time threatening to sue him for defamation...\n\n&quot;A Serious Man&quot; is the the latest comedy by the Coens brothers&apos;s and it turned out to be one of the worst films I had the displeasure to watch this year. The film is essentially a dark comedy, which seems to be the Coens favorite genre, but with emphasis on the dark. Burn After Reading, the Coens previous film, was also very dark but at the same time, extremely funny. A Serious Man doesn&apos;t deliver any laughs whatsoever, and seems to be filled with inside/personal jokes. In Brudges is another good example of a well done black comedy, even thought tragedy ensues, we can&apos;t help but laugh. By now, I hope it&apos;s clear that I enjoy dark humor as much as the next guy but there&apos;s just no humor at all in A Serious Man. I could have still enjoyed the film, had the story been well written but it wasn&apos;t. It&apos;s a conglomerate of silly situations and awkward moments glued together with no resemblance to an actual story. A modern retelling of the Book of Job? Perhaps. A well written story? Absolutely not.\n\nThe film didn&apos;t deliver on any level and ended up being painfully dull. The reviews for this film have been so positive, and it was so well received by the critics that those who hated the film will be, I&apos;m sure, immediately accused of &quot;not getting it&quot;. Maybe you do have to be fully aware of the Jewish culture, or a big fan of the Coens brothers to actually enjoy the film but, as I stand, A Serious Man is a terrible film, that apart from the great set and wardrobe, has no redeeming qualities.\n\n2/10"

      "name": "Far from being a bit of a dog&apos;s dinner, this independent film about grief and social alienation does enough to illicit a positive response.",
      "reviewBody": "Year of the Dog is another one of those films attempting to get under the skin of the notion that comedy and one&apos;s potential to fall into madness, at least cinematically, are closer than you initially think. As a matter of opinion, comedy and madness, or the idea that a character can loose control of their surroundings after having existed within the realms they occupied for so long, can indeed go hand in hand; they can play out in a balanced fashion, particularly when there&apos;s something especially biting or satirical about it, resulting in pieces from recent years along the lines of Verbinski&apos;s The Weather Man or Harron&apos;s American Psycho. Take this, and sprinkle in a little bit of sub-text to do with contemporary suburban America and the oddballs one would seemingly encounter within such an environment, and you have what people like to describe as an &quot;off beat&quot; film trying to cover some serious ground, albeit getting tangled up somewhat in the process.\n\nYear of the Dog&apos;s lead is Molly Shannon&apos;s Peggy, a middle aged American woman living alone in a nice American neighbourhood, on a nice estate, in a decent house and with her pride and joy in the form of her pet dog she names Pencil. To say she loves Pencil understates things somewhat; she all of adorns him, lavishing attention on the thing no end – even allowing it to sleep with her on her bed come the nighttime which, to some, would be the beginnings of madness before all the strife has really begun. The pair of them are so attuned to one another, and she to the species in general, that during walks in the park, Peggy cannot help but stare lovingly at all the other pooches owned by all the other people doing as she does now, while Pencil is even granted some brief screen time of his own when he agonisingly watches her back out of the driveway to get to work thus, he is tragically left all be himself. Peggy&apos;s life is what it is: single, but more than happy with her pet. Where her boss has his work and Peggy&apos;s brother Pier (McCarthy), plus his wife Bret (Dern), have their very young children, Peggy has her dog.\n\nHer boss is Robin (Pais), a largely inanimate gentleman with a reservedly cold tone. He outlines certain harsh realities in his office that morning at work, the background of his composition busy with a motorway in the distance plus traffic charging in either direction; hers, in comparison, is the rest of the office: a stilted and quieter set of items on show highlighting respective positions in life as specific facts broadly linked to ability and qualifications are mercilessly outlined. Her work colleague is the busier Layla (King), an African-American woman with a penchant for films; a cheating partner and some pretty lousy advice for our heroine when things get tougher later on. Those things arrive when poor Pencil dies, a mysterious death at a relatively young age when he is heard yelping and yapping one summer&apos;s morning out in a neighbour&apos;s back garden. It is Al&apos;s (Reilly) garden in which Pencil is found, dialogue with the man revealing he too lost a dog when he was very young and helped combat it by maintaining an interest in hunting. Briefly, the film&apos; hypothesis rears up and it is no mystery as to why the scenes with Al work as well as they do, with this idea of grief, and ways in which to deal with grief, simmering beneath a surface while never fully blooming out into a constructed whole.\n\nWhat follows is a film essentially showing to us why it is that, at least socially, our Peggy could never quite hit it off with humans and found such solace with animals. She comes to occupy lonely places peppered with bright hues of colour; breaks at work scored with music you&apos;d more than likely hear rolling out over a baby&apos;s crib as a parent attempts to get them to fall asleep, very much instilling a certain child-like sensibility about her. We observe Peggy effectively begin her life anew, the death of Pencil the upsetting of the established norm and systematically launching her out onto a slide downwards in psychological well-being when she is forced from beginning again at the bottom in acquiring a new dog and rebuilding. Trips to family members Bret and Pier feel unnecessary; the mutual affiliation she has with Newt (Sarsgaard), a pound working animal specialist, are tied up in there somewhere while a sub-plot to do with co-worker Layla&apos;s man having an affair known only to Peggy is dropped in for good measure.\n\nOn the overly positive side, Shannon does well to carry the film; doing so with that look about her face, that expression which constantly suggests a deeper, more unremitting sense of tragedy and pain beneath an exterior which you could be told is one of a joyous person, and yet still be moved to ask questions. She has something going about her alluding to stark emotion just waiting to explode out of her that has, so far, been repressed. Things connect and link up with one another uneasily in Year of the Dog, and the electricity is only sporadic in its arriving to the forefront; the idea of the grief and confusion born out of the death of a pet not working quite so well as other ideas did in the aforementioned examples, but making for a film straddling a line between blackly comedic urban drama and a flat-out tragedy asking us to just break down at get seriously upset. Over it looms the ghost of Jeunet&apos;s 2001 film Amélie, and while at times its politically imbued content gets the better of it, often forcing it to come across as a Vegan convert video or a self-aware animal rights promotional film, it holds up its end neatly enough.",

Based on a true story, the picture has a tense documentary feel to it that makes it highly engrossing and fascinating early. The production does begin to tire late though as Christensen&apos;s crazed personality starts to come shining through with dementedly over-the-top results. Still a well-paced and intelligent take on American journalism and the pressures associated with the field. Worth a legitimate chance. 4 stars out of 5."

Sometimes the ideas seemed heavy handed, and other times, motives and characters underdeveloped. \n\nBut on re-visiting the pieces fell together, and while the underlying ideas still sometimes felt familiar, the sting of the satire danced beautifully with the underlying sadness of the main character.",

Rishi Kapoor and the late Divya Bharti did a wonderful job as did our hero SRK who is looking mighty hot, young and full of energy in this action/love story. It is fun to go back and watch the styles of the movies made in the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s. They can have cliché&apos;s and corny scenes sometimes but they are still fun to watch. This movie is about a jealous uncle played by Puri who comes between the love story of Kapoor and Bharti. Shah Rukh Khan enters the movie at the right time to save the day and the rest is action packed and enjoyable. Watch this movie if you are a fan of SRK or Bharti who did a fine job. The songs were good and the dance number of Aisi Deewangi is always a fun watch! Also just to set the record straight, Shah Rukh Khan did NOT crown himself as the Baadshah of Bollywood, that was a title he has earned which anyone can truly see why if you just watch the line of work he has done from Deewana to Don!",

      "reviewBody": "Very loosely based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft, this Full Moon cheapie deals with an ex-con going to the town of Leffert&apos;s Corner to dig up a corpse that his late father stuffed with money. Unfortunately for him, his father&apos;s old partners are on his trail. On top of that, Leffert&apos;s Corner has been dealing with attacks from underground creatures for years, and they live beneath the very cemetery the money is buried in.\n\nAnyone going into this expecting a faithful Lovecraft adaptation certainly aren&apos;t going to find one here. Don&apos;t expect a good movie either. Right from the opening scene, we&apos;re immediately hit with some horrible acting, and it doesn&apos;t get much better from there. The lead (Blake Bailey), who also narrates on occasion, is particularly awful. The only actors who don&apos;t come off too poorly here are Allison Mackie as an eccentric femme fatale and Jeffrey Combs as the town doctor. Ashley Laurence (credited as Ashley Lauren for some reason), such a likable heroine in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films, is just annoying here as a bitchy Rambo wannabe.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of really bad editing in this thing, and the attempts at action suffer for it. What little story there is doesn&apos;t come together in any satisfactory manner either. The ending is laughable, especially when you throw in Bailey&apos;s final voice-over. Full Moon has managed to churn out a few good movies, but this isn&apos;t one of them. I bought the VHS for 50 cents at a video store that was going out of business, so at least it was cheap."

He appropriately acted out the gap between him and Rosamund, both in age and in social background. The artistic design and cinematography is good, but the story was OK but not impressive enough to make it great. However, I think Wallace got a lot of potential and I look forward to his future works!! After this movie his name is constantly linked to big-name actresses such as ShuQi, Ruby Lin and Miriam Yeung, proving his ability is far beyond his good looks.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen dozens of Christmas specials and only two of them warm my heart and make me think of that excited feeling I got as a child. One is a Charlie Brown Christmas. The other is Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too. Now the reason that this special is my favorite is simply because I&apos;m a bigger Pooh fan than a Peanuts fan. But there&apos;s also a reason this special is such a classic. Most specials are pretty clear in teaching that Christmas isn&apos;t about what we get but what we give or who we spend it with, I think Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too teaches that message the best way. In usual Pooh fashion, it doesn&apos;t have to stop the story to explain why Christmas is better with loved ones. It simply embeds the message in the very sweet story. Pooh and his friends are some of the best role models when it comes to friendship and caring for one another despite their differences. Children can get a lot out of this special and for nostalgic adults, it may just bring a tear to your eye.",

Action senses is pretty short and the ending just sucks. The boss is really weak at the ending. I thought the first movie was much better, more bloody and better story line. The first movie contain challenges that Azumi and her friends got to go to through. My favorite enemy in the first movie was the crazy guy that in the white kimono. He just plain crazy and kill everything in his way. This second movie seem to focus more one story or try to. Sure, there is one good fight seen in the bamboo forest with Azumi versus bear ninja guy(use claws and wire as weapon). The second attempt of this movie made probably to sell the cute actresses. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;ll go and watch the cute ninja girls in action, but for action and story line. It just plain triable. I don&apos;t mind of having female as a warrior. Just watch it yourself and decide if it good or bad.",

I never keep my hopes up for sequels and this movie was no different. This was atmospheric and despite what some people say, it did have a plot, although it was all over the place (so it&apos;s kind of hard to explain). The acting was good from all. Takashi Shimizu is a great director, he knows how to create suspense and keep it for the duration of the movie. He also knows how to keep an &quot;all over the place plot&quot; very easy to follow. I&apos;m also glad he introduced some new elements into the plot which made it much more interesting. (Can&apos;t wait until the final installment)! And finally, the curse (Kayako and Toshio) is still as scary and creepy as ever. There were many scenes that had me very creeped out.\n\n3½/5.",

      "reviewBody": "This is my personal favorite of Terence Hill&apos;s solo movies. I know &quot;MY NAME IS NOBODY&quot; is first rate movie making, and it&apos;s probably the best movie i&apos;ve ever seen, but&apos;s its not my favorite. &quot;THEY CALL ME RENEGADE&quot; is about Luke Mantie (played by Terence Hill) who is a loner, who just lives on the road, driving his jeep with a trailer attached that his horse, Joe Brown, resides. One day, a 15 year old punk named Matt, played by Terence Hill&apos;s son, Ross, tells him that his father, Moose, is in jail and he need to speak to &quot;Renegade&quot; Luke. Luke and Matt drive to the pennitentary and Luke finds out that Moose is in Jail for a crime he didnt commit, and Moose needs Luke to settle down and move in to a house on a big piece of property and become Matt&apos;s legal guardian. Luke says NO, so Moose threatens to get his cell mate to forge the papers...child abandonment is a serious offence. Luke and Matt don&apos;t get along at first but they start to develop a brother type relationship. They both get in a few ordeals with 2 truckers, screw a whole bar full of drunks out of 500 dollars with a butterfly knife throwing contest and they have to get revenge from an evil Lawyer with the help of a rough Biker Gang. This movie is full of action &amp; comedy, its a classic to me because i&apos;ve been watching it for years. Where they screw the money out of the drunks is hillarious and the fight between Terence Hill and the lead biker is a grand scene. I recomend this movie to ALL fans of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer movies, action movie goers, or people who are looking for a good &quot;road/buddy&quot; movie. I have seen it for sale in places like WALMART and ZELLERZ for $5, it&apos;s definatley worth that much! Rent it, buy it, just see it, you may like it as much as I do!",

It was nice to &quot;escape&quot; for an hour and a half. \n\nAn 8 year old boy, Tom, is taken by his father to stay with his grandfather (who he does not know) for a while. The boy is at first reluctant to stay with his grandfather, but over the course of the movie the affection between the two grows. The boy&apos;s mother disappeared in the Alps five years previously, and the boy seems obsessed with finding out more about the circumstances of her disappearance. Is she dead? Could she still be alive? \n\nTom goes to school in the village, and makes friends with an older boy. They have adventures together as Tom tries to work out ways to get higher in the Alps to look for his lost mother. \n\nThe movie ends on a positive note, with a reconciliation between the boy and his distant father.",

Mixed in this reality video is a number of street fights and other altercations, mostly consisting of teenagers. The star of the show is definatly the Bum Rufus, with the help of his sidekick Donald. By far the best editing was when Rufus picks up a mallet and comments on a broken ankle. The only complaint I would have is that there is more of the Teen fighting which gets dry after a while. Would be better if there was more Bum footage. No problem, I guarantee there will be sequels as well as copycat reality Bum video&apos;s, which is unfortunatly the direction of today&apos;s entertainment world."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll always have a soft-spot in my heart for the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise. Especially as an 80&apos;s baby/90&apos;s kid who grew up in a pop- culture environment where the psychotic hockey-masked killer Jason was known and loved by pretty much everyone... even kids like me who didn&apos;t see the films until we were older and only vaguely knew what they were about thanks to the whisperings and hints of our older siblings who were actually allowed to see the movies. (Usually renting them 2 or 3 at a time on trusty old VHS from the local Video King to watch after we younger brothers and sisters went to bed.)\n\nAt the time this review is being posted, the franchise has been running strong for well over 35 years. Boasting 10 films in its original continuity, the fabulously entertaining (and dopey as heck) cross- over spin-off &quot;Freddy VS Jason&quot;, a somewhat underrated reboot in 2009 and a planned new film due out sometime within the next year or two. \n\nBut even a franchise so huge has to start with a small, humble beginning. Before the fame. Before the recognition. Before the birth of the pop-culture idol that the series spawned.\n\nYes, it all started with a teeny-tiny production back in 1980- the original &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s almost impossible to really discuss this film critically without delving into spoiler territory (which I try to avoid in my reviews), though I will try my hardest to do so.\n\nThe film revolves around a group of young Camp Counselors who are prepping the infamous Camp Crystal Lake for a reopening about 20 years after a mysterious double-murder and a tragic drowning involving a young child. However, it appears someone isn&apos;t exactly a happy camper and doesn&apos;t want Crystal Lake back in business, and this mysterious figure begins to pick off our protagonists one-by- one until a tense climax reveals the dreaded truth...\n\nIt&apos;s no surprise at all that the film is essentially a glorified rip-off of the iconic slasher-horror that is John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;Halloween.&quot; Director/Producer Sean S. Cunningham has been pretty candid about essentially wanting to create his own &quot;roller-coaster&quot; version of the Carpenter Classic with this film. Heck, they had ads and posters in the paper before the script was even written.\n\nBut the problem I really have with the film is that it all feels so routine. Even often boring and sometimes toothless. While it may not be fair to judge it by modern standards, even for its time, it just doesn&apos;t have that much going for it. (Especially as the very same year of release, such classics as &quot;The Shining&quot; and the underrated &quot;The Changeling&quot; were chilling audiences to the bone.) It&apos;s a very aimless, meandering film, with sloppy plotting and far too much focus placed on seemingly-pointless sequences for it to attain the &quot;roller-coast&quot; feeling the director was going for. The first half of the film is just too much a chore to slog through. And once the horror finally kicks in, it&apos;s just the same rinse-and-repeat formula scene-after-scene, with really only a few gruesome deaths here and there to pique audience interest. All those old clichés and tropes that even at the time had become slightly predictable.\n\nNow, I know what you&apos;re saying- those are the things people love about these flicks. The clichés and the gore-galore. But it&apos;s so slowly paced and messy in this movie, it&apos;s hard to really get into it. It really isn&apos;t until the plethora of sequels that the formula is established and the pacing is tightened enough for those clichés and tropes to finally become fun and entertaining.\n\nAs it stands, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; does have its place in horror royalty. But I firmly believe it&apos;s more for spawning the long- running franchise that followed and less for the quality of the film itself.\n\nOh, and I guess it&apos;s also kinda famous for introducing some guy named Kevin Bacon as a supporting character... but I&apos;m not sure if he actually went anywhere after this. \n\n(Please appreciate the obvious sarcasm there. I loves the Bacon!)\n\n&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; gets a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 from me. It&apos;s worth seeing because of its important part in the history of the overall franchise. But it&apos;s one of the weaker entries and lacks the style and entertainment seen in later films.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;La Vergine Di Norimberga&quot; (aka. &quot;The Virgin Of Nuremberg&quot;/&quot;Terror Castle&quot;) is a wonderfully atmospheric, and delicately demented Gothic gem from genius director Antonio Margheriti, that should appeal to every fan of the uncanny. No true Horror fan or even cineaste in general could possibly deny that the late Margheriti had a great talent to create a Gothic atmosphere. Especially his 1964 masterpiece &quot;Danza Macabra&quot; (aka. &quot;Castle Of Blood&quot;), starring the incomparable Barbara Steele is pure Gothic brilliance and ranks among my personal favorites. While &quot;The Virgin Of Nuremberg&quot; does not quite reach the brilliance of &quot;Castle Of Blood&quot;, in my opinion, this is yet another excellent Gothic Tale that no lover of Gothic- and Italian Horror can afford to miss. The film is terrifically set in a medieval castle full of terrible instruments of torture. Mary Hunter (Rosanna Podesta), whose husband Georges Rivière) is the owner of the castle since he has inherited it from his father, awakes one night hearing screams. The castle was once owned by a blood-thirsty judge, and, after four hundred years, the judge suddenly seems to be walking the castle again, craving for blood...\n\nThe film builds up a wonderfully creepy and yet often beautiful atmosphere from the first minute, the eerie castle-setting, ingenious camera-work and sublime score by the brilliant Riz Ortolani go in hand how it will only be experienced in Gothic tales from the good old days. For the year of its release, 1963, the film has an unusually high gore level, and an enormous nastiness. Horror icon Christopher Lee (as far as I am considered, one of the greatest actors ever) has a small, but great role. Lee is once again outstanding, and my only regret with &quot;The Virgin Of Nuremberg&quot; is that he had not quite a lot of screen-time. The English aka. title, by the way, is not quite 100% accurate. &quot;La Vergine Di Norimberga&quot; does indeed translate as &quot;The Virgin Of Nuremberg&quot;, however, it is also the synonym for a gruesome medieval torturing device - the iron maiden. Atmospheric, excellent and very, very creepy, &quot;The Virgin Of Nuremberg&quot; is a Horror experience that no real genre-lover could possibly afford to miss. Films like this one prove that Margheriti was Italy&apos;s second only to Mario Bava when it comes Gothic Horror. A must-see for every Italian Horror fan or lover of Gothic greatness.",

The story goes quickly and has its own charm. But there is also a sad reflexion. It is the moment where Polish popular cinema begins to feed on itself. The most characteristic thing about Polish commercial cinema is its resemblance towards the hits signed &quot;made in USA&quot;. That pretending looks as false as Jerzy Kiler pretending to be the Killer. Machulski knows about this perfectly and makes fun of it. In one of the funniest scenes Pazura plays in front of the mirror some on-screen characters like &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; or &quot;Leon&quot;.",

The performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren&apos;t supposed to share with fellow movie go&apos;ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. By today&apos;s standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50&apos;s horror.",

The atmosphere (constant yelling of his mother in law, constant complains of his wife, bubbling of his child and the father in law watching some stupid TV broadcasts over and over again) at home suppresses him and he is slowly having enough of it. One day, he walks out and on the evening walk around Warsaw, he gets in to a random party where he meets this girl he likes very much. And this is where it all starts. From that point, he is becoming more and more fascinated by that girl but the fascination can have its dark sides too. That involves loosing control, getting involved in different situations etc. The director, Wajda (very well recognized internationally), made yet another brilliant, psychological movie about human emotions, relationships, weaknesses, hopes and such. I don&apos;t want to give out more but surely, if you come across this piece it is worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "After the death of Tommy (Bill Cone), who was stabbed by a woman at the cemetery, Jody (Bill Thornbury) and his friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) attend the funeral at the Morningside funeral home. Jody is followed by his teenage brother Mike (Michael Baldwin), who has just lost his parents and is afraid of losing his big brother that intends to travel.\n\nMike snoops around the cemetery and sees the mortician known as The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) carrying Tommy&apos;s coffin alone without any help. Mike breaks in the mortuary to investigate the mystery and discovers weird dwarf creatures with yellow blood and dangerous flying spheres that protect the location. When he is chased by The Tall Man, he cuts his finger and brings it home to show Jody to convince his big brother that there is a dark secret in the mortuary. Jody, Reggie and Mike discover that The Tall Man is from outer space and is transforming dead bodies in dwarfs to work as slave in his world. Now they decide that The Tall Man must be destroyed. Will they succeed in their intent?\n\n&quot;Phantasm&quot; is one of the most weird and original cult movies that I have ever seen. The surrealistic and dreamlike story entwines horror with sci-fi with many twists and bizarre characters and situations.\n\nI saw &quot;Phantasm&quot; for the first time on VHS in the early 80&apos;s and I have just seen it again on DVD and surprisingly the film has not aged, only the clothing, the hair style and the special effects. But for fans like me, it is still attractive and entertaining. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Fantasma&quot; (&quot;Phantasm&quot;)\n\nNote: On 28 April 2023, I saw this film again.",

Leo seems to have more decent movies then not so it&apos;s fairly safe to assume if he is in a movie it&apos;s worth the watch. Great acting on all parts. Tilda Swinton was great too as she usually is. The plot was interesting but a little predictable. I enjoyed Richard losing his grip on reality a little, it made it more believable. I played with the idea of rating it a 7 but it got more interesting even though it took a minute to get there so I&apos;ll stick with 8. Id recommend it to a friend.",

      "reviewBody": "Love animation, it was a big part of my life as a child, particularly Disney, Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry, and still love it whether it&apos;s film, television or cartoons.\n\nAlso have much admiration for Tex Avery, an animation genius whose best cartoons are animated masterpieces and some of the best cartoons ever made by anybody. &apos;The Early Bird Dood It!&apos; was one of the first cartoons from Avery&apos;s finest period where he made some of his best ever cartoons. While it is not quite one of my favourites from him, there are cartoons of his that are a little more imaginative and took more risks, also not being as talky, &apos;The Early Bird Dood It!&apos; is nonetheless great and a fine representation of what made Avery so good and influential.\n\nIt is no surprise that, as with a vast majority of Avery&apos;s cartoons regardless of the period, the animation is excellent. Very rich in colour, the backgrounds have meticulously good detail and the character designs are distinctively Avery in style and are fluid in movement. The music, courtesy of Scott Bradley, is typically lushly and cleverly orchestrated, with lively and energetic rhythms and fits very well indeed, even enhancing the action.\n\nCan&apos;t fault Avery, whose unmistakable and unlike-any-other style is all over, nor the dynamic voice acting and the very engaging characters. The bird for most of the cartoon is the most interesting, but the cat is the cleverest characterisation when it is revealed it is not what it initially appears. The ending is an unpredictable delight.\n\nOverall, great even if even better was to follow. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I found it particularly revealing that, having spoken so much to people overseas, that they had very little interest in emigrating to North America or Europe. I guess it&apos;s easy to romanticize places you&apos;ve never been to! Having spoken to so many people, many for whom life is life than perfect, they come to realize that life in India, or Mumbai at least, is maybe not so very different after all. I particularly like young &quot;Sweetie&quot;, a very pretty young woman who seemed to live up to her name, but later when made a supervisor and trainer was not at all shy about dressing this guy down on camera for failing to meet her standards. Not at all the stereotypical submissive Indian woman the media sometimes portrays.",

And it&apos;s really nice to see Andrew Divoff playing the role of the hero for one time. The budget wasn&apos;t that high and you can see this on the screen, but a high budget doesn&apos;t guarantee a good movie (&quot;Air Force One&quot; anyone...?). This one&apos;s alright, watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an important documentary I&apos;ve watched a few years back. I am surprised how it&apos;s so unknown and under the radar. It&apos;s an excellent documentary. It&apos;s not flashy , it&apos;s not fast and filled with stimuli. It&apos;s real, unique and intimate.\n\nIt depicts the story of fishermen in El Dakhla in Morocco. Fishermen and the fishing community. The people don&apos;t have many means as it is, since many factories have closed. But since the time of the documentary and some years before it, it became even worse. Since now they have to oblige to a stoppage of months (it think 6!) of fishing entirely. These people based their whole lives around fishing and of course a stoppage is hurting them a lot.\n\nBut where it becomes enraging, is when we see a giant ship - not far from the sight of the fishermen that are forbidden to fish - hurling fish in by the thousands and destroying the whole ecosystem that the so called stoppage is supposedly trying to protect. It&apos;s actually insane. We see these Swedish captain chilling in his cabin with his feet whilst monitoring the fancy technology to see where all the fish is. Being completely oblivious about how much men and women he&apos;s hurting. It was maddening to see this. And beautiful to witness the patience that overcame the fishermen&apos;s enragement. They had no other choice.\n\nWe get to know a woman that can&apos;t find work anymore since many of the fish factories have died, now has to beg for some fish from fishermen and sell it to support her family, even though she&apos;d rather fish for herself. A beautiful woman, that shows me more feminism than I&apos;ve seen in 200 western &apos;feministic &apos;privileged millennials combined. And the things is she probably doesn&apos;t even know the word - not that she&apos;s ignorant - no, just unlucky and underprivileged. But all the way determined and feisty. She is feminism.\n\nWe get to know a shopkeeper that sells small items to the fishermen and also is hurting because of the stoppage.\n\nWe even see Moroccans that have no choice but to work on the boat of those Swedes. It also results in some painfully funny commentaries they have. Besides the very enticing subjects they approach and talk about amongst themselves.\n\nIt&apos;s funny how many people from Europe always only see one side of the story, of the so called &apos;luck-seekers&apos; from African countries etc, but they don&apos;t see how much of the opportunities of many people in &apos;3rd world countries are taken on the daily. Even their fish , a few miles in front of the stopped fishermen! This documentary at least shows a bit of this sick injustice that goes on in the world and is never portrayed in the media in the west. And all it takes is some empathy to understand and see, and know more about the complexity of migrations. \n\nIt is also beautifully filmed in my opinion, its like the people don&apos;t even realise the camera(man) is there. It&apos;s very private and peaceful somehow. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve watched it 5 times already.\n\nThis is a must see, for many reasons. People travel the world and only see what they want to see but preach open mindedness. For this you can simply sit down, let it play and enter your mind, feel and learn something.",

All short films are hilarious, in a crescent order. My favorite is the last, which satirizes the humanly body functions during intercourse. A must see, for all generations of movie likers. Rate: 5/5"

The plot is a collation of almost all the cliches of the genre, from the comic romances to the villainous thief who must be brought to justice by the hero (in such stories, for some reason, it is almost always a poacher captured by a forester).  The setting is a sunny countryside where a couple of lovable vagabonds provide musical interludes, singing the title song &quot;Grun ist die Heide&quot; while strumming the musical instruments that they carry around from village to village, sleeping in the fields like true sons of nature (no mention of what they do in the wintertime).  In short, this movie is extremely interesting as a glimpse of the mentality of its times, but for no other reason.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, direct to DVD&apos;s are usually unoriginal, badly cast, and have lazy performances. This had none of those problems. It had three actors from the show Bones, which usually is terrible when TV actors do a movie between the break, but they were all enjoyable, especially Ty Thyne. Newcomers like Paula Rhodes were excellent, and I felt like the story was beautiful. Despite bad production values you never want to leave the screen. This captures you in ways most films forget to do: story, characters, humor, heartbreak, and balances them so well. While I don&apos;t like most dramas for trying too hard this film never seems to force emotion out of you, you give it freely. My only complaint is the lighting department gave it a strange look, and the cameras were bad. Other than that, the film making is surprisingly spot on, check it out, it&apos;s on Netflix.",

      "reviewBody": "Director David Gordon Green&apos;s critically acclaimed Undertow is a strange but gripping experience. I don&apos;t know any other film quite like this. We&apos;ve seen the slow pacing build up tension in the plot before in films, but it&apos;s so much more than that in Undertow  it&apos;s the pace of a family&apos;s life in the deep backwoods of Georgia and it it patiently lets us absorb everything. Maybe I was in a sensitive and impressionable frame of mind when I saw it, because I remember being so shaken and touched by this fare that its visuals and mood still haunt me.\n\nBut this patient, slow pace is the calm before the storm as it comes to an end when the brother of the father of the family comes to visit, newly released from prison. Josh Lucas is this brother, and he captures the shady nature of his character with effortless conviction. His presence is felt in scenes he is not even in. Upon arriving to the family, the film just takes a completely different turn and we follow the two brave kids in the family on the run in the south from their uncle.\n\nThis is further emphasized by attention-grabbing frames that freeze whenever intensity builds up. This may seem anti-climactic, but it&apos;s extremely effective and it makes the chase sequences very exciting and 1970s-influenced. So it essentially shifts between chase mode and (eerily) quiet South-paced calm in a genius way. If you like your films fast-paced and action-filled however, its brilliance may be lost on you  but if you give it time, Undertow will surprise you as it&apos;s unpredictable, even in style. This is just how meticulously-crafted it is.\n\nThe film is grimy, dense, brooding and realistic and it zooms in on the deep necks of Georgia, featuring some gorgeously striking visuals, making you feel the dirt and heat of the deep south as if you were right there, breathing the murky warm air from the brown rivers. Some say Green&apos;s directing style is reminiscent of Terrence Malick (it is very visually-driven) but I don&apos;t think so  rather it is an insult to the former; Green clearly knows what he&apos;s doing and lets nature visuals facilitate the story he tells, while Malick lets the story facilitate his pointless nature visuals.\n\nI loved Undertow more every minute it progressed and am now prepared to give this film a 9 out 10. I also have it firmly stapled in my top 10 films of all time list and that is quite a feat for such a low-key dark horse. \n\n9/10",

They try to cram too much into a short space and then move too quickly without making sense of what happens. There is also some corny screwball stuff which interferes with the flow of the film. This is what you would call a b picture with some good appearances by an interesting cast but it has an identity crisis going from serious danger in the air beginning with hot fox Davis and ends up as your average who done it vehicle.",

Although Sabata is named in the title, surprisingly he is not the central character of the movie - he&apos;s a supporting character. Also, he is made to be a villain, not a heroic character. Most of the movie is focused on the characters played by Richard Harrison and Fernando Sancho. The two actors have some good chemistry together, and also manage to deliver a considerable amount of light comic relief, which is welcome. There is a significant problem with the movie, and that is that the middle section of the movie moves at a crawl, with little done to advance the story. But if you are patient, the movie ends up being an okay spaghetti western."

Needless to say there is no such thing in the movie. Django and Bull, two gunmen with nothing else to do, look for a woman who knows the secret of a gold treasure. Quite a lot of baddies want to lay their hands on the gold, too, of course - not an unusual story, but &quot;Il momento di uccidere&quot; still is a spaghetti western above average due to excellent camera work and editing plus the ironic, yet very tough George Hilton starring as Django. Horst Frank (&quot;Preparati la bara&quot;) is among the villains, while Walter Barnes plays Django&apos;s partner as such a rogue you wonder how he happened to be one of the good guys. Loni von Friedl acts convincingly as the pretty heiress who has more than one secret to hide. A movie without any serious flaws, really.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Very interesting, but rather odd documentary from Eric Chaikin (&quot;Word Wars&quot;) was screened at the AFI Dallas Film Festival. I say odd because there is no obvious agenda other than providing an expose on the stress caused by the preparation for the bar exam. The film could easily serve as a character study in how varying personalities react to stress and how the legal profession views itself.\n\nThe film follows the paths of six very different individuals as they spend the 10 weeks prior to the exam preparing for the make-or-break moment. These individuals range from recent law school grads to a really nice guy on his third attempt to an artsy, near hysterical young lady to a guilt-ridden mom to a never-say-die older gentleman on his 41st attempt. As a viewer, we get enough of each of them to feel their pain and understand how they deal with the pressure. Silently, we find ourselves pulling for some ... and the others, not so much.\n\nThe brilliance of the film stems from the insightful meanderings of those practicing in the field of law and those on the periphery. Most effective are the legendary Alan Dershowitz, Robert Shapiro and Texans Joe Jamail and Mark Lanier. Others offering commentary include Nancy Grace, John Stossel, Catherine Crier and Scott Turow. Vernon Jordan also recalls his bar exam and how racism played a role.\n\nThe film needs to be viewed by all law students as both a &quot;scared straight&quot; warning on exam preparation and valuable insight into the profession of law. In particular watch Mark Lanier&apos;s eyes as he makes his point about how he connects to a jury. It is a frightening moment that displays why he is one of the most powerful trial attorneys working today.",

But this turned out to be a disappointment for me. I expected more from these stars and director George Marshall.\n\nFor all the sophisticated dialog that Rex Harrison delivers he&apos;s also a guy who countenances murder as a diversion for him to steal a Goya painting from the museum. It didn&apos;t quite compute with his character.\n\nAfter training her in the art of thievery, Rex finds Rita balking at the more disagreeable parts of his profession. So she can never testify against him, he marries her. Apparently that must be a part of the Spanish legal system as well, even under Francisco Franco. Later on she turns the tables on him, but you have to see the film to find out how and why.\n\nColor cinematography might have helped especially since a good deal of this film was done in the Prado Museum and the movie audiences could have gotten a look at some of the great old masters like, Goya, El Greco, and Velasquez.\n\nIn the end The Happy Thieves depends on the charm of its leads and they&apos;re not up to it. No one would have been.",

I can&apos;t fathom how this film managed a PG-13 rating when G would have been just fine. Disney has made less innocuous horror movies. The critters, like those in Monsters, Inc., want only to scare the kiddies, perhaps to bottle their screams but we&apos;re never really told what the &quot;living dark&quot; creepy-crawlies are there for -- although they do appear to shop in the same stores as the too-cool vampires who prefer sweeping black overcoats.\n\nTight script? Ha! Maybe for a student film project, this thing rocks. The dialog is stiff and silly, awkwardly sidestepping any swear words with a &quot;gosh&quot; or &quot;darn.&quot; The parents are flat, Brady Bunch rip offs and Jesse James&apos; part could have been better brought to life is they had used a marionette. The older brother did a good job; he at least showed some range of emotion.\n\nIf there&apos;s such a thing as a wholesome horror movie, this is it."

In the age of MTV and MP3, we are used to the idea of carrying routinely our favorite songs everywhere from streets to bathroom, and it&apos;s pity that we hardly experience anymore the authentic ambiance of intimate music gathering such as miraculously acted and filmed in Jalsaghar. Music in other era and other place must have been high point and extra-ordinary moment of community life, source of the spiritual inspiration for civil life as well as its destruction. The decor and lighting of the music room is sumptuous and otherworldly, in perfect contrast with the wearisome monotony of domestic scenes the declining aristocrat is forced to endure."

      "reviewBody": "Feeble (and rather ludicrous) attempt at German film noir. Söhnker&apos;s the hard-nosed news-hound who has written a story about an &quot;easy&quot; way to score a bank. When his article serves as a blueprint for a robbery involving a double murder, he becomes the prime suspect but manages to flee custody and hunt down the real killer on his own. What starts out interestingly, pretty soon turns into a routine little thriller complete with hard-drinking (almost every scene in which two male characters meet starts with their knocking back a shot of &quot;schnaps&quot;), hat-wearing men pounding dimly-lit streets in heavy rain, negligéed femmes fatales running smoky back-room gambling dens and scrubbed, squeaky-clean secretaries secretly in love with their boss.\n\nWhile Kurt (&quot;Ich denke oft an Piroschka&quot;) Hoffmann certainly is one of the more accomplished directors of German post-war cinema and Albert Benitz&apos;s moody camera-work and Werner Eisbrenner&apos;s brooding score are excellent, this never rises above mediocrity, due to a script which is, at best, formulaic and contains just about every cliché known from hundreds of 40s Hollywood thrillers. The actors (including the miscast lead) seem strangely uninvolved and struggle with the - mostly preposterous - dialog (hardly anybody ever utters a sentence someone might say in real life - an unfortunate tradition which has continued up to this very day: dialog in German films often sounds like a bad translation, simply because everybody in this country - including screenwriters - has been raised on poorly dubbed films) and scenes which, at times, simply don&apos;t play. Everything seems interminably drawn-out, and each and every little detail is spelled out so that even the most lame-brained viewer gets it. Which, all in all, makes for a rather tedious affair to sit through.",

      "reviewBody": "Pusinky aka Dolls is a Czech coming of age/road trip movie following the 3 friends Iska, Karolina and Vendula. School is finished; deadbeat jobs wait for Karolina and Vendula and college with lots of strange people and pressure by the family (no freedom to choose subject etc.) for Iska. Going away to Holland appears as the solution, aiming for the land of opportunity – away from the family, easy living, freedom, drugs, money – a chance to stay together even it is only for a while. \n\nThe story sets out as college girl is vegetating in a sports camp – send there by her parents with her little brother (who is actually good at sports) to watch her. Her two friends arrive to rescue her and with all the best intentions of taking her away from there...\n\nSo what is new, why should you watch it? \n\nWell, this is a very Czech and European movie, so the mood is can be pretty downbeat and slow moving at times. This makes it believable and gives the actors room to develop the characters and the story room to build up secrets and tensions between the three characters, which make the movie more interesting. \n\nSo the acting is excellent and the story has lots to offer, if you are OK with things being sad and taking their time. Oh and the soundtrack fits the movie quite well.\n\nWhich brings me to the &apos;but&apos; – the story is about teenagers with loads of awkwardness, mood jumps and opportunities wasted. This is annoying at times and makes you think: How can they be this stupid? Well they are teenagers this is part of growing up, making mistakes. Still, even realizing this it is not easy to watch some parts of the movie. \n\nThen there is the feeling that the movie has nothing really new to offer – maybe I have just watched too many movies. Maybe I have missed something as I watched the movie with subtitles. \n\nSo overall, I enjoyed the acting, most of the story and was annoyed by the teenage characters. Would I watch it once? Yes. Would I watch it again? Probably not. 6 to 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Considering the fact that this 1933 movie was produced during the depression, when moviegoers expected pure entertainment, the results were exactly what they wanted. Glenda Farrell&apos;s hard-boiled Florence Dempsey was what filmgoers were looking for. Please note that many of the movies of the period had male and female stars who were fast talkers and wise-crackers. Such stars as Cary Grant, Carole Lombard, Rosalind Russell, Bette Davis, James Cagney, Mae West, W. C. Fields, William Powell, Myrna Loy, etc. were the norm and not the exception.\n\nThis wonderful movie was way ahead of its time. It&apos;s two-color look was also something very different for the 1930s and its washed-out looked helped give it a more sinister appearance. The later &quot;House of Wax&quot; used 3-D and having seen it in the movies I can tell you it was probably the best of the 3-D movies. Even better than &quot;The Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;.\n\nFay Wray was pure candy and she practiced her scream well for the upcoming &quot;King Kong&quot;. I have seen most of Lionel Atwill&apos;s work and I believe the underplaying of Ivan Igor helped make him a more credible monster. The movie was well cast and one can not help but notice the uncanny fact that most of the actors in &quot;The House of Wax&quot; were chosen because they looked like the earlier actors except for the difference between Charles Buchinsky (Bronson) and Matthew Betz as the loyal mute assistant.\n\nAlthough enjoyable, &quot;The House of Wax&quot; was no match for the earlier edition. It&apos;s understandable that &quot;The House of Wax&quot; did not use the characters of Florence Dempsey and Gavin Gordon. Sidekicks didn&apos;t work as well as in the 50s.\n\nI wonder what the movie critics of the 30s thought of the &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum?&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "I have been using IMDb to obtain feedback on movies for several years now, and what I find is that people here tend to be a little too bias toward A-list, blockbuster movies. Chihuahua does not fall into that category by any means, but that does not warrant dismissing it outright. It is true that the film&apos;s cast could have been put to better use, but given the parameters set by the Disney-style writing, they did what they could and it was enough to let me enjoy their performances. I read a review on here that commented on the inaccuracy of geographical information. I agree that if Disney is going to make a film like this, it is unfortunate that they do not take the time to educate their young audiences a little. We wouldn&apos;t be talking doctorate level research here, just basic fact-checking.\n\nThe plot of this movie was not deep, but not many Disney movies NEED to be in order to cater to their young audience and family demographic. I am a twenty-something and I am able to tolerate Disney&apos;s material, because I accept it for what it is: shallow, vapid entertainment designed to convey squeaky-clean ideals to impressionable youth. Sometimes, they take that squeaky-cleanliness too far, like making light of the dog fights, but overall, it is all rooted in the same objective: to maintain their target demographic and intake revenue.\n\nTo the people who reference the different caliber of Disney&apos;s entertainment ten or more years ago, I concur with you. It would be good for Disney to trace its roots a bit and return to basics, but it would take a lot of cutting through green to accomplish that.\n\nI enjoyed this movie. There was a comment on the discussion board mentioning that the trailer distorted people&apos;s initial impression. I am one of those people. Once I got into the movie though, I applied my usual preconditions for judging Disney films and had a good time. It was cute and in Disney&apos;s typical fashion, it contained half-baked attempts to teach the kids a thing or two (inaccurate or vague as they were).\n\nGo into it knowing it&apos;s Disney and will thus inherit the characteristics of all their work, and you&apos;ll be fine.",

      "reviewBody": "What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg&apos;s magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I&apos;ve seen with great acting by children. Spielberg&apos;s camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs&apos; &quot;interaction&quot; with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

But no, this garbage seems to be a Nouvelle Vague material, Jean Luc Godard like crap, especially speaking of the writing, the story, so silly. The directing is not so bad though and the main interest is for sure the couple Serge Gainsbourg - Jane Birkin."

Yes it is rough in some places, but it is an improvement over The Ewok Adventure and I give this one extra points for having the balls to kill that annoying older brother Eric Walker right at the top.  I wonder what happened to the little kid Cindel.  I though she was quite promising. I personally think aiming at children in film writing can water down the dramatic impact.  The ewoks were the Jar-Jars of Return of the Jedi, a dramatic buffer between incidents in which we already had an emotional investment.  The Mos Eisely Cantina would be a more lucrative setting for a TV series or set of TV movies."

      "reviewBody": "The script for this movie is really bad, a collection of tired clichés. And that&apos;s a shame, because there is enough talent here to have made a good movie.\n\nLawrence Tibbett was unquestionably one of the great singers of the first part of the twentieth century, and definitely one of the first American stars of opera, along with Rosa Ponselle and Grace Moore. He was a handsome guy who could act, and he had real stage presence, which you can see in this movie.\n\nAnd that is what saves this movie from being a total loss. Several of Tibbett&apos;s signature roles - Tonio in Pagliacci, Escamillo in Carmen, Figaro in the Barber of Seville - get captured here, so that we can see why he delighted opera audiences for two decades at the Met. The opera excerpts are never presented or explained, however; they just get performed, leaving most of the audience to appreciate the music, if they can, without any idea what Tibbett is singing so well. That was expecting too much, I suspect, and it&apos;s a shame, because the three excerpts are good performances that could have been integrated into the script a lot better.\n\nWe also get to see Tibbett sing two popular numbers, and they are perhaps the most striking in the movie: a setting of Kipling&apos;s &quot;On the road to Mandalay&quot; and the spiritual &quot;De glory road,&quot; with both of which Tibbett does a great job. Again, however, there is no effort to integrate them into the plot. At one moment, Tibbett sings them as examples of &quot;beauty&quot; to other musicians. Then they&apos;re over. \n\nThere isn&apos;t much else to notice in this movie. If that is Virginia Bruce doing Micaela&apos;s aria from Carmen, she does a good job of it.\n\nThe rest is all clichés. Why, you might wonder, does the movie start with Tibbett&apos;s character leaving Bruce&apos;s character stranded in the countryside with a broken down car? That should have aggravated her to no end. Instead, she falls in love with his voice.\n\nIt never gets any better.\n\nThis marked the end of Tibbett&apos;s movie career, and you can see why. But in this case the fault was not Tibbett&apos;s. The script was the villain!",

With understanding, this film helps the viewer to grow a little in faith, hope and love.\n\n... well, that is all I really wanted to say, but IMDb now requires ten lines of text for a review. I noticed the early reviews of Marcelino were extremely negative. If you have a lot of anger towards Christ or the Church, you will *not* like this film since it shows different types of people turning their hearts towards Jesus to varying degrees. This is not sinister propaganda, but the way the world really is. Christians are not the monsters you imagine them to be. If the Nazis *had* made films like this, as one reviewer suggested, instead of the inspirations to resentment and violence they actually did make, the world might have been a better place.

Nicol Williamson is as believable as upper middle class Sir Edward More as he was as a violent, self-destructive Irishman in The Bofors Gun. Not that this would have been beyond the talents of Anthony Hopkins or the originally cast Sir Edward, Richard Burton, to name but two. Though would Burton&apos;s often worldly-wise screen persona have been quite right here? Criticism from other reviewers and external commentators concern the liberties taken with Nabokov&apos;s novel, which I happily admit not to have read. Steven Puchalski (Shock Cinema, 2017) cavils that while the original Margo was only 16, &quot;the film stars are only separated by four years&quot;. Well up to a point Lord Copper. In 1969 Williamson was 33 and Anna Karina 29, but he LOOKS an unfashionable 50, she LOOKS like a 20 year old gold digger. Is this not what acting is all about? An adolescent Margo would have made it too much like Lolita, making sympathy for Sir Edward more difficult. Some also disapprove of the updating to a contemporary 1960&apos;s setting. Leaving it in 1930&apos;s Germany would probably have meant the intrusion of politics, a time consuming distraction from what is essentially an individual tragedy. And Anna Karina wouldn&apos;t have looked so good in 1930&apos;s garb as she does in bikinis and miniskirts. So what&apos;s not to like?",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this back in the late 80s on the USA Network (when it was still in its weird, still-trying-to-find-an-identity-among-all-the-other-basic-cable-channels days) on an edition of the sorely missed &quot;Commander USA&apos;s Groovy Movies.&quot; My dad taped this movie from that show (like he did with many Godzilla and Gamera movies on that ancient, crappy VCR we had in the 80s). I think he regretted it for some time afterwards, b/c my mom was not happy.\n\nBasically, this is probably one of the most violent kaijus ever made, and even though I&apos;m not easily shocked, I watched that ancient tape again the other day, and was surprised how violent this movie is, and how graphic the violence is. It&apos;s also fairly unoriginal, as it&apos;s merely one of many Godzilla knockoffs, made cheaply to make a quick buck. \n\nStill, if you want to watch a cheap kaiju knockoff with shock violence, it&apos;s worth hunting down a copy. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d let kids watch this, even though I saw it when I was 6 or 7 years old, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d let a kid that young watch it."

      "name": "Oliver Stone&apos;s greatest film!!!",
      "reviewBody": "I have stated many times that Oliver Stone is an incredible film maker whose films sizzle with excellent cinematography, good acting, and original storyline. He makes controversial films that are sometimes unappreciated by the public and the critics. I said and believed all this even before I watched &quot;JFK&quot;.\n\n&quot;JFK&quot; is a film that stars many A-list actors in major and minor roles, but they give deep imprints nonetheless. Tommy Lee Jones, the Oscar nominated actor of the film, gives a performance that I almost missed due to my not recognizing him. Jones plays Clay Shaw, a powerful figure in New Orleans and a secret homosexual who knew about the plot to kill the president. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the widely publicized murderer, Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, fresh from his Oscar in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, as Dave Ferrie, a man who is struggling to cope with the heavy accusations and mysteries of the JFK murder. Donald Sutherland in an Oscar-worthy performance, as an informant that talks to Jim Garrison, played wonderfully by Kevin Costner. Other great appearances include Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Michael Rooker, and even Walter Matthau in a bit appearance.\n\nMany of these fine performances were worthy of Oscars, but if there is one man that deserved an Oscar more than anyone else, it would have to be Oliver Stone, who did not win Best Director OR Best Picture. Who did he lose to? &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. While I do consider the film to be an excellent thriller featuring one of Anthony Hopkins&apos; greatest performances, I must say that in terms of scope and daring, &quot;JFK&quot; was a far superior film. The cinematography was far more varied and ambitious, as well as the subject matter itself. I can understand why &quot;JFK&quot; was passed over, but the reasons are not fair to the extraordinary film given to us.\n\nThe appearance of &quot;JFK&quot; is astounding. You are taken to a time of much distrust, horror, confusion, corruption, and cover-up. The murders of JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK all influenced the time periods and the peoples. Many people tried not to think about it, or else they were scared into silence. Some, like Jim Garrison, tried to present the truth of &quot;JFK&quot;, and their efforts are being felt even now.\n\nBefore I saw this film, I had seen Oliver comment that &quot;JFK&quot; was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. He was not implying that everything was true, and some of it isn&apos;t true. But after seeing this film, I am convinced there was definitely more to the story than was originally told, as I believed even before I saw &quot;JFK&quot;. This gave me a knowledge of the period, and awareness of the people participating in the drama of the time.\n\nThe point of the film is not entirely based on the story of the JFK assassination. It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple, nor is it always presented by the government. People must struggle to find the truth sometimes, and if it is covered up, it could be lost forever. The film is an attempt to show us that the murder of President Kennedy was a time of much confusion and mix-up. So what was true and what was not? Many eye-witnesses gave conflicted views, while other circumstances were strange in their origins and happening. And while he gave us this, Oliver Stone also presented us with the best film that he has yet made, and his resume is incredible as it is.\n\nI have seen the films &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;: films that Oliver Stone won Best Director for. Why did he not win for &quot;JFK&quot;? Why did it only win 2 Oscars? For me, it is another example of how disappointing the Oscar results can be. I urge all to see this epic film of mystery and deceit, of truth and lies, the work of a master film director known as Oliver Stone.",

In the scenes of the blast-off, the supporting bar which holds up the rocket model is clearly visible!  Fans of `Forbidden Planet&apos; will notice the heavy use of the `electronic tonalities&apos; borrowed from that classic.

No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie, the author judge his mother&apos;s life by her journal. Not a wise choice.\n\nThe author&apos;s elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father&apos;s second marriage is &quot;not fair&quot; for her mother. Then, she said she doesn&apos;t love her mother. So, she don&apos;t love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie, I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However, I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.",

      "reviewBody": "Boxer review :\n\nAnother desi adaptation of Stallone&apos;s Rocky after Dharmendra&apos;s Main Intequam Loonga (1982), Boxer was a slickly executed sports drama with top notch performances from Mithun Chakraborty and Danny. Sharad Saxena, playing the main antagonist Raghu, was super impressive but unfortunately, the film couldn&apos;t do much for his career.\n\nDirected by Raj (Daddu) Sippy, the film features a retired boxer (Danny) who turns alcoholic nurturing an angst to win the game!! Circumstances drive his son (Mithun da) to the ring where he is pitted against the present champion Raghu (Saxena). The boxing sequences remain the film&apos;s highlight with the climax turning in to a cliffhanger!!\n\nR. D. Burman churned two melodious numbers - &apos;Tere dil mein bhi kuch kuch kya hota hai&apos; and the wedding song &apos;Shadmaani O Shaadmaani&apos; which had Danny shaking a leg..\n\nUndoubtedly, Boxer is one of the best Bollywood movie made on the sport but sadly, turned out to be a box office failure when released in early 1984. It was Mithun da&apos;s home production and he lost a lot of money on it.\n\nLater, the film found its due and was referenced in Vikram Bhatt&apos;s Ghulam (1998) where Sharad Saxena played a boxer again. His photo from Boxer is prominently featured in that movie. Anil Sharma&apos;s hit film Apne (2007) liberally borrows its central theme from Boxer where a son wins the champions trophy for his father.\n\nOf all the films on boxing, Boxer is Bollywood&apos;s best contribution so far. Its my personal favorite!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

      "reviewBody": "In Garbage Warrior, Mike Reynolds captures people&apos;s imagination of new ways of building homes with renewable products such as beer bottles, tires, and plastic soda bottles. The homes seem to be so beautiful that it could entice anybody to live in. The documentary depicts the journey architect Michael Reynolds endures in trying to create a community that is self-sustaining. He believes that there is a spiritual connection to nature that there needs to be a focus on, and that can work away from mass consumption and mass production. He is seen as a pioneer and true humanitarian that could actually change New Mexico&apos;s standards of home improvements. \n\nThe documentary main arguments are the endless possibilities of using and recycling waste products, an ecological environment, bureaucratic attack, and strong visionary attempt. He created &quot;Earthships,&quot; defined as passive solar home made of natural and recycled materials, thermal mass construction for temperature stabilization, and renewable energy and integrated water systems make the Earthship an off-grid home with little to no utility bills. He started to turning away from his label as an architect and started to consider himself a biotecture, which he defines as a profession of designing buildings and environments with consideration for their sustainability with a combination of biology and architecture. \n\nAfter creating these communities that were self-reliant, this created friction with the developers and the state legislators in New Mexico because he did have his homes regulated up to housing codes. As the documentary progressed, the destruction of his communities, when developers labeled these communities as unsafe and unhygienic, caused him to reevaluate his goals. After he was revoked his architecture license, he made it his mission to take a state legislative role, and lobby for architects to create more homes that would be self- sustaining. As he was continuously being shot down for his ideas, he decided there was no hope in changing the standards set by the state, but he still does not give up. This demonstrates the states unwillingness to move away from making profits and establishing a better way of way of living. \n\nWhile politicians and lobbyist are ignoring the severity of the global warming and the intensity of droughts and extreme weather, Michael Reynolds is called to India after a tsunami strike causing hundreds of people to lose their family members and homes. He can utilize his skills without restrictions because of the people&apos;s desperation to solve the problem. The purpose of this segment was to show that desperation is the new father of invention. Oliver Hodge portrayed most of the politicians as villains and Reynolds as an unsung hero. \n\nThere is an urgency that Reynolds express that humans are not going to survive on this planet for much longer if conservations is not taken into action. But there is a downside, he is only working to create a test site rather than actually create homes for people to live in. Based off of the film, there seems to be a fear of conservation because the awareness was slim. His home ideas needed to be altered because the people of the state needed to see an economical prosperity. People could not understand why these Earthships would be better alternative. So then the argument is, how much of it is actually is his idea anymore since he changed so much of it? \n\nFilmmaker Oliver Hodge solely targets on Mike Reynolds&apos;s point of view rather than providing an on camera interview with a developer or regulator as to why the communities were shut down. Why were these homes so unsafe? The argument seems to be very one-sided. There were some issues that were dangerous for the people that would have moved in. For instance, when they had created an Earthship with complete windows, the home was too hot and started to melt everything that was made of plastic. There are reasons for these regulations, so that peoples&apos; lives would not be put in danger. Also, these Earthships could not work in everywhere in the United States, but it could allow people to spin ideas off of these inventions. \n\nIt takes years before Reynolds ideas are approved by legislators, so that he can construct only a test site. My questions are then: how much would the system have really changed if he had gotten approval from the beginning? Could he have gone further if he had just regulated his sustaining ideas up to many codes? Does it take a person to conform to regulation to make a real change in the system? As an architect, he should have known that his communities would not last because his Earthships were not up to code. Someone was bound to find his communities unsafe.\n\nOn the contrary, these risks need to be taken in order to develop better ideas and work towards homes that can be self-sustaining. This does not excuse the state from its responsibilities of changing the standards of what is acceptable of construction materials. I really enjoyed the documentary&apos;s core honesty of how stubborn changing the system can really be. \n\nGarbage Warrior makes it seem impossible for any change to happen to make an impact on society, which can be intimidating. In my opinion, it seems that Earthships would only work in an environment that was humid, dry, and tropical. How well would the homes stay together after a monsoon in India or heavy rainfalls in California? This documentary is mostly targeted to people whom live in a desert. But it does offer an insight of how menacing and tedious the system really can be. There is a sense of hope that Reynolds offers because if people gather together to change the standard; it can make a real impact. He could not do it without his allies in legislation and his fellow architects and builders.",

I could almost swear that one chick had a cesarean scar. I was lured to this crap fest by the IMDb rating.

It is probably the best comedy directed by Annelise Reenberg and it is a prime example of the genuine innocent style in the early days of comedies set in the countryside of the Fifties. The pace is moderate and everyone act out in sympathetic and noteworthy parts. A number of the finest character actors of the time show their best efforts in this drama with genuine rural atmosphere. It was only later in the Sixties this popular concept deteriorated into conformity. The dramatic drive centers around who of three men in the village is the actual father of a young woman who suddenly pops up to find her roots. Moral values still ranked high in the Fifties, and it was a tricky matter to portray sexual activities taking place outside marriage, even in retrospect. But boys will be boys, and there is an overall acceptance of the set-up, where three men relive their youth together having accomplished such a brilliant offspring as the innocent maid servant Karin Nellemose.",

      "reviewBody": "Following my recent viewing of Israeli director Moshe&apos; Mizrahi&apos;s French movie MADAME ROSA – the 1977 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film – I decided to watch the only remaining contender in that category sooner rather than later. As it turned out, the official Israeli entry was the weakest of the five final selections and I am guessing that its sheer topicality – being based on a very recent hijacking episode that had grabbed world headlines – was what made it jump ahead of other notable competitors among the 24 international Oscar submissions, namely Larisa Shepitko&apos;s THE ASCENT, Wim Wenders&apos; THE American FRIEND, Bo Widerberg&apos;s THE MAN ON THE ROOF (1976), Paul Verhoeven&apos;s SOLDIER OF ORANGE and Krzysztof Zanussi&apos;s CAMOUFLAGE.\n\nFor the record, my relative disappointment with OPERATION THUNDERBOLT has just been exacerbated by my discovering that I had acquired and watched the U.S. Theatrical Version (culled from a TV screening on the MGM channel) – which has characters mostly speaking their lines in English, barring the occasional lapses into French and German – rather than the original version which has characters (be they Israeli, German, French or African) rightfully speaking in their native tongue...and which is available as a &quot;Full Movie&quot; video on &quot;You Tube&quot; and on a renowned torrent download site! Having said that, craggy-faced chief hijacker Klaus Kinski&apos;s equally distinctive voice can be heard in both versions but, apart from his trigger-happy cohort Sybil Danning and nemesis Assaf Dayan (as the Israeli commando second-in-command), he is the only recognizable name in the cast...that is, if one is to discount the personal, silent appearances of the Israeli politicians that faced the crisis in real life, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres; in any case, the acting honours here are stolen by Yehoram Gaon as the ill-fated commando leader Yonatan Netanyahu (who, at one point, is amusingly seen reading Alistair MacLean&apos;s &quot;Circus&quot; - a novel I also read myself as a kid). This sharply contrasts with the contemporaneous, star-studded, rival re-enactments of the events for U.S. TV, namely VICTORY AT ENTEBBE (1976; which I had intended watching last year for Burt Lancaster&apos;s centenary but had to jettison it due to time constraints) and RAID ON ENTEBBE (1977) – both of which, incidentally, also exist in longer and shorter edits.\n\nWhile the fact that the viewer is aware from the outset of the narrative&apos;s outcome can perhaps lead to the film feeling rather predictable, the presence of a surprisingly restrained Kinski (billed &quot;Kinsky&quot; in the all-English opening credits!) and Danning make up for that; on the other hand, while the final assault on Entebbe airport occurs towards the very end of the film and can thus appear to be a long time coming, the swift depiction of it is quite electrifying (especially the sight of Kinski&apos;s twitching body as it expires early on in a hail of machine-gun bullets). Seeing the names of commercial 1980s Hollywood entity Cannon Group founders Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus among the makers of this film somewhat undermine its proposed authenticity (shot with the full co-operation of the Israeli government and Air Force); indeed OPERATION THUNDERBOLT (which, decades afterwards, also became the name of a video game!) succeeds more as an action movie than a psychological or political thriller which might not have been congenial to this particular subject but serves as a veritable template for the later Cannon Group star-studded blockbuster THE DELTA FORCE (1986; also helmed by Golan and easily Chuck Norris&apos; most prestigious star vehicle) complete with overblown rousing music throughout.",

      "reviewBody": "NIGHTS AND DAYS based on the novel by Maria Dabrowska is perhaps better known as a 12 episode-TV series than a film. Indeed, there are episodes that focus on particular aspects, each one with a seperate title. Yet, as a matter of fact, that condensation for the needs of a feature film does not make the story and its depiction lose its charm. Simply because it is so awesome and still inspiring at multiple levels - a costume drama that has stood a test of time. Let me consider some of its strengths in more details...\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE DIRECTOR and DIRECTION. Jerzy Antczak handles the adaptation and the direction in a particularly subtle manner. His cooperation with the cast resulted in some splendid effects: it is all fluent, interesting, nice to watch, there are rarely any long scenes that were quite typical in some other productions of the genre and there is a very skillful grasp of the times the story is set in. There are not many liberties taken with the original literary cource and the story of Niechcic family is depicted respectfully. Their story being set in a difficult period for Polish history: the partition of Poland is unique and very touching. It was the period when the country did not exist in the map and was divided into three: the Prussian part, the Russian part and the Austrian part (1795-1918)\n\nTHE LEADING CAST: Barbara (Jadwiga Baranska) and Bogumil Niechcic (Jerzy Binczycki) are the embodiment of a couple that represent different characters, totally different expectations of life one could have and yet something unites them. Apart from the patriotic aspect of their story that foreign viewers might find difficult to grasp, Jadwiga Baranska portrays a subtle woman who is clearly in love with city life and struggles to live this way. Clearly, she does not love Bogumil as one would wish to. Even she admits from time to time that she is not a good wife for him. She longs for her &apos;man of dreams&apos; that gave her flowers, she longs for grandeur, for charming manners but, in the long run, she comes to accept and even like the very spots and people fate has placed her in. It is one of the few films when the leading character&apos;s reflections and thoughts are expressed in the script. She is a thinker. Jerzy Binczycki, on the other hand, portrays a man whose heart and mind are set on village, on land, in love with the field and ready to dedicate all his life to that. Serbinowo, where they spend most of their lives, is his homeland, a piece of land and the house that he seems to live for and leave for his children. Yet, the fate occurs to bring on certain unexpected events.... They are an unforgettable couple and a true highlight of the story symbolizing the Poland of the time as well. They experience their joys and sorrows, they go through tough and lighter moments, they embody nights and days. While Bogumil represents belonging, Barbara represents individuality. Jadwiga Baranska, the director Jerzy Antczak&apos;s wife, being interviewed about the role&apos;s effect on her life and her career, said that, in a way, the character of Barbara Niechcic appealed to her and has truly been &apos;the role&apos; of her life.\n\nTHE SUPPORTING CAST: NIGHTS AND DAYS is a pleasure to watch because of its characters that come and go perhaps; however, leave a lasting impression on a viewer. It is a great achievement in the production of this genre because a real danger is the situation when there are too many characters and in time, viewers get confused who was who (not to mention the fact when they are similar). That is not the case with NIGHTS AND DAYS. Daniel Ostrzenski played by a great Polish actor Jerzy Kamas provides many episodes with some fun manifesting a man of upper class living standards. His wife Michalina (Janina Traczykowna) with her specific tone of voice has some hilarious scenes where priorities of life come out. Stanislawa Celinska as Agnieszka Niechcic is a representative of the young generation of the time between the 19th and the 20th century with the ideas of liberty that grew in societies and the ideas of emancipation as well. Her sister Emilka (Ilona Kusmierska) is different, more naive perhaps, slightly laughable but likeable. Their opposite is Tomasz Niechcic, their brother played by Kazimierz Mazur. What a character! Although his mother constantly calls him Tomaszek (a more affectionate way), he seems not to care about anyone or anything....Among the background characters, one should pay attention to Celina Katelba (played by Anna Nehrebecka) - quite a tragic personality and quite a psychological conclusion from her relationship with Janusz (young Olgierd Lukaszewicz in the role). It is hard to mention all but finally, when I think of characters, I would like to point out Zarnecka, a cook at the Niechcices&apos; (Ryszarda Hanin). A woman who seems vulgar at first but we grow to like her as Bogumil and Barbara did...\n\nMUSIC: There are quite a lot of films the story of which is set in that very special period and they can boast really wonderful tunes, the melodies catchy to the ear and to the heart. However, I doubt there is actually any that may equal this one here written by Waldemar Kazanecki. This soundtrack provides the viewer with magnificent impressions, helps us journey into the times of that grandeur, elegance, great ideals, charm. The waltz of NIGHTS AND DAYS are really inspiring and so beautiful that they leave a trace in the hearts of even most &apos;unmusical&apos; audiences. As if we were waltzing in time and space, waltzing to our nostalgia and memories that never were and, as a matter of fact, have always been.\n\nLOCATIONS: Yet another aspect that really constitutes the key to understand the story and embodies Poland are the stunning locations. I do not only mean the beautiful mansions the film was shot in, the lovely gardens, the breathtaking interiors from the period when furniture was a sort of &quot;art&quot; and not merely practical use. I foremost mean the lovely views of nature, the fields with people working, the tree alleys, the unforgettable depiction of forests in winter, the longing and joy carved in the soil that suffered a lot and helped people survive. Sometimes, these moments might seem a bit long for viewers who expect action but, remember, it appears to be more and more logical assumption that action condensed the sensitive perception of art and the art itself tremendously.\n\nNIGHTS AND DAYS with many of its episodes is still one of these productions that may bring your mind to some different world, the world where people did not lack sorrows, epidemies, mourning, the times when our country did not exist, when its &apos;masters&apos; declared its downfall and yet, there was a strange hope in survival, that simple attachment to the land and one another, when nights and days were passing by to changeable tunes of love in sacrifice, disappointment, rises and falls, duties of belonging and uniqueness of individuality. Above all, the brightness of days that may shed light upon the darkness of nights...",

      "reviewBody": "The Hoaxters only rates a four out of ten. The production value is very high, and it has big-name stars doing the narration, but the subject is so repugnant that it is almost nauseating to watch.\n\nI&apos;m glad it wasn&apos;t listed as a Documentary, because it is certainly anything but. Its purpose is indoctrination, pure and simple. It is sort of the American version of a Leni Riefenstahl film, except that her films are a lot more upbeat and enjoyable to watch.\n\nIt starts out equating Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito. Then, the first banner headline word zooms across the screen: &quot;COMMUNISM&quot; Almost immediately, Stalin is equated with the first three. &quot;All dictators are the same,&quot; is chanted throughout the film at intervals in between segments of the narration.\n\nThe film is a classic example of what George Orwell termed &quot;double-think.&quot; It rails against &quot;The Big Lie&quot; while at the same moment spouting some of the most incredible whoppers I have ever heard! Just a minor example is J. Edgar Hoover, the King of Blackmail, stating that he would never want to see anyone publicly embarrassed as a result of his investigations.\n\nAt one point, it is railing against dictators and the one-party system, and in the same breath has the nerve to show film footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy! \n\nThe thing I personally found most offensive was its presentation that all the anti-war protests at the White House were engineered and funded by the International Communist Party, and that as soon as Stalin and Hitler had a falling out, the demonstrations instantly evaporated.\n\nThe film kept my interest. In fact, it is fascinating. But rather in the same morbid way as I imagine watching a train wreck taking place would be.\n\nAt the very least, &quot;The Hoaxters&quot; is worth watching as a lesson in history, and also as a textbook example of propaganda techniques which are still widely used and very effective today.",

Not only does it boast a pleasingly sarcastic dialogue and delightfully witty characters, but it offers just the right amount of romance and cheese to avoid 93 minutes of cringing. The story was very uplifting, albeit predictable, and the photography was worthy of a gasp or two. Set in the beautiful Austrian alps, this movie contained the perfect ingredients for a light and enjoyable flick: humour, romance, dramatic twist and happy ending. Perhaps it&apos;s not Oscar worthy, but it&apos;s certainly worth an hour and a half of your time.",

Along the way, we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated.  We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place.  Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.\n\nIn the end, the movie amounts to a warning (really though, the movie has several different aspects to it) about what happens to people&apos;s freedoms when they &quot;look the other way&quot; and ignore injustices happening to those around them.\n\nIf you&apos;ve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this, I strongly recommend that you do so.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very detailed description of the life of a French family.  It is a sweet story gently told.  It is about growing up, expanding horizons, the influence of friends and family members, enjoying happy times together, and reacting to life&apos;s inevitable problems.  In this film we recognise moments in our own lives.  The film has a universal theme.\n\nIn a documentary style the older son Marcel relates how his father Joseph a schoolteacher takes up positions in various parts of France and how before school-going age he sits at the back of the class and quickly learns how to read the text on the blackboard.  Family life seems to revolve around teaching and the classroom until Aunt Rose meets Jules on a park seat and eventually marries him.  After Jules joins the family circle father learns that there are more things in life than the educational system.\n\nWhen the family rents a villa in a wild part of Provence, Jules instructs father on the use of the gun and they go on hunting sprees together.  On one of these expeditions the son gets lost and meets up with a local boy about his own age.  From him he learns about local birds, the eagles, the owls and scary stories about how these wild birds go for the eyes of their prey. This escape into the wild is a charming part of the family&apos;s life story and the final parting between the two boys when the family finally leaves is indeed moving.\n\nThe story is sprinkled with amusing incidents.  For most boys the birth of a child is nothing short of a miracle.  They conjecture that the navel is a kind of button which can be unbuttoned to let the baby out.  And when father learns to shoot, Jules attaches a target to the outside toilet door.  Father is delighted when he gets a bull&apos;s eye and Jules does well too. Not so the maid who happens to be inside the toilet at the time.  Fortunately she emerges shaken but unharmed.\n\nThe film covers so much of French life.  It is amazing how much is packed in.  The story unfolds at an easy pace with beautiful music that never intrudes and scenery that astounds. I can recommend this little masterpiece about how wonderful family life can be.",

It&apos;s an interesting enough premise, but there&apos;s not a whole lot of action here, just interminable chit chat with the protagonist who quickly gets on your nerves. Karin Dor and Klaus Kinski are welcome in support, but not quite enough to make this very enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "Lowly Stockholm vice-squad officers, Jarnebring and Johansson, are first on the scene of a robbery and go on to unearth apparent corruption in high places, but the threads are difficult to pull together and the case is hard to crack.\n\nThere are so many pleasures in this film that it&apos;s a shame that it is so rarely seen. Quite apart from being a good thriller director Bo Widerberg brings twists and slants to what would otherwise be the sort of film that we&apos;ve seen a hundred times. Although a buddy-buddy movie, J &amp; J&apos;s relationship is constructed back-to-front. Instead of going from &apos;chalk &amp; cheese&apos; to reconciled dream-team, they begin as good friends, with implicit trust between them as colleagues, but the events of the film put this under strain. As a corollary there is no neat ending. \n\nThere are some good moments of humour as American and Swedish culture brush up against each other, but the greatest departure from the standard is the insight into Johansson&apos;s personal life. Occupying no more than a few minutes screen time, we see the result of his marriage break-up. The scene where he attempts to recapture his relationship with his son is almost painful and his furtive eye contact with another metro traveler is nicely captured. In fact, these brief interludes convey more about the loneliness of a failed relationship than many an entire film. Overall they add a rare depth to this genre. Add to this a great car-chase and the technique of putting a rear facing road-pointing camera on the front of a car, which brilliantly conveys menace.\n\nThere is also a well-developed sense of place with all the action set in a wintry Stockholm and it&apos;s environs. While we see the city&apos;s underbelly (down-and-outs; winos; criminals; alienated youth) it is still an affectionate portrait. \n\nTwenty years on there are some non-P.C. moments as when a suspect is recognised partly as he is seems to be the only foreign-looking person in Stockholm. The ending can also be criticised for leaving a feeling that the ball is still in the air, but this is largely because we cinema-goers are so used to complete resolution.\n\nThis is the sort of film that should be made more often. Widerberg rivaled Peter Weir as a director who could make an entertaining yet meaningful and character-driven film."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Twilight Samurai (Tasogare Seibei)&quot; is a domestic drama and romance set in a very specific historical and cultural setting amidst civil strife, recalling &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot;\n\nAs in much of the cross-fertilization of samurai movies and Westerns such that one can easily imagine a Westernized version, the opening situation recalls &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; where a retired gunfighter just wants to be left alone to farm and raise his children and tries to resist pressures to stop putting his fighting skills under a literal grubby basket.  \n\nHiroyuki Sanada gives a superbly nuanced performance as a rebel against the expectations of being the lowest of a high class in a rigidly caste society by embracing the sarcastic titular sobriquet. He is painfully reluctant that he is ever so circuitously revealed to be much more.  World weary yet still proud, he gropes for words to explain to his shocked patriarch why he, as an indebted widower, prefers to come home straight from work to see his daughters grow up day by day than follow the family&apos;s dictates and anguishes to his best friend about his marriage prospects.  \n\nGradually, surprising people around him are revealed to be as equally complex and frustrated with the roles their society insistently demands even as small step by suffocating step political and social webs inexorably ensnare them tighter and tighter. The flashes of their assertions of their individuality in unexpected moments make for quiet, gripping moments of tension and relief.  As his returning childhood friend, Rie Miyazawa has a beautiful, spirited feminity that makes Sanada seem even more of a macho hunk in contrast.  \n\nA kind of Jane Austen action flick, it is the kind of movie where antagonists&apos; stares make you hold your breath in suspense and the touch of a hand brings forth your tears.  \n\nThe translator made a policy decision of just transliterating many traditional Japanese terms, from &quot;sensei&quot; to various styles of sword-fighting, etc. rather than try to find English equivalents.  While their meaning can be pretty much inferred from context, it did help that post &quot;Kill Bill&quot; I&apos;ve been making up for a benighted education that lacked samurai movies and Japanese history.  \n\nI found the voice-over narration by the younger daughter a bit schmaltzy and unnecessary.  The closing song seemed jarringly period-inappropriate; if it wasn&apos;t a Japanese cover of Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; then it was a real close imitation with the only clue in English that it was used with permission of EMI.  \n\nThis is the first of novel adapter/director Yoji Yamada&apos;s 77 films that I&apos;ve seen and I certainly now want to see more."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen both Rec and Quarantine, and enjoyed both of them immensely. Quarantine 2 was not a movie I had my heart on seeing, basically because I didn&apos;t think it could live up to the standard of its predecessor (or the Spanish original.) On that count, I was right. This isn&apos;t as good as the first movie. Having said that, one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that, so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments, my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works, in other words. That fright quality isn&apos;t as sustained as it is in the first movie, though. In fact, this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they&apos;re not feeling too well. If you&apos;ve seen the first movie, then you know what&apos;s happening (or, more to the point, what&apos;s going to happen) so you&apos;re basically just waiting for it.\n\nOne thing that I noted was that the events of this movie were taking place at the same time as the events of Quarantine. In fact, one of the airplane passengers is using the airplane&apos;s wifi to watch a news broadcast about the quarantined building in Los Angeles. While the disease and its effects are pretty much the same, there&apos;s more of an effort made here to get to the background and origins of the disease, which is really dealt with only in a few hints toward the end of Quarantine.\n\nQuarantine (and Rec) are filmed in a &quot;Blair Witch&quot; style - hand held cameras recording the action as it takes place. Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to movie-making. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death, quite frankly, so I didn&apos;t miss it. It&apos;s clear that the ending of this movie was also intended to set up another potential sequel. That was just a little too obvious. Basically, I&apos;d say this isn&apos;t as good as the movies that spawned it, but as a horror movie it&apos;s still very effective. (7/10)",

It really made me think of movies made by Ed Wood: so incredibly bad that they must become cult-classics. The timing in the movie amounts to nothing. There is no dicernable structure to be seen for miles around. The plottwists are too ludicrous for words. But it was all made with a lot of love and that is something that counts.\n\nThe sets on the other hand have been crafted in such a perfect obnoxious American suburban way that they made me shiver. The same thing counts for the costume design, absolutely fantastically horrible, all that Polyester.\n\nAt least John Waters in consistent in one aspect of the film: everybody is a lousy actor. There is absolutely nobody in this cast that can even remotely put on a decent performance. Edith Massey in particular is absolutely too horrible to watch. If only Joaquin Phoenix were old enough at the time, he would have played the role of Dexter Fishpaw to perfection, but he would have been too good for this cast.\n\nThe is the perfect exhibition of obnoxiousness and a great satire of American moral values.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Two years after she played the widow of a German general in Judgement At Nuremberg, Marlene Dietrich took up the task of narrating the documentary The Black Fox. Dietrich who certainly saw in her life the beginnings of Adolph Hitler&apos;s rise to power. Fortunately she had the good sense to leave Germany. She visited there post World War II on a few occasions, but Dietrich was never really welcomed back. She died in 1991 in Paris and only then did she come back to Germany to be buried.\n\nWhat&apos;s different here is the use of a German folk tale The Black Fox with accompanying art work, interpolated into the film between scenes of the usual newsreel footage. Dietrich reads part of the tale which was adapted by Goethe and it&apos;s entertaining with a new perspective. Especially for German audiences brought up Goethe&apos;s literature.\n\nI also noticed that the story Dietrich narrated was encapsulated in many ways by Burt Lancaster&apos;s speech acknowledging his guilt in Judgement At Nuremberg. Run that after The Black Fox and you&apos;ll see what I mean.\n\nIt&apos;s a story that cannot be told often enough and The Black Fox won an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature in 1962. Quite deserved.",

      "reviewBody": "Revered French filmmaker Patrice Leconte attempts to craft a wordless documentary in the vein of Koyannisqatsi but generally misses the boat, its visual artistry hampered by a vague, simplistic &quot;message&quot;. Had this been made by Cambodian filmmakers, I might be obliged to think differently, as undoubtedly they would have, too. Granted, it&apos;s full of pretty imagery (mostly of poor people, of course) and a sweeping (though inappropriately leading) tragi-operatic score by a massive European orchestra with choir seen on screen at regular intervals, most inappropriately at the end. There&apos;s a French subheading/tagline for the film that translates directly to &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; which indicates that -- in spite of defenders who think the film deserves a more exalted reputation because of its music and imagery alone, or those who see no editorializing going on -- Leconte clearly WAS trying to make a &quot;statement&quot; with this film, a la such broader-canvassed productions as the aforementioned Koyannisqatsi, Baraka or Chronos. But where the directors of those films made that message one part of a larger commentary on our crazy world, and usually contrasted it with imagery of bustling, technology-choked metropolises and the like, Leconte seems to have thought that a vanilla travelogue of seemingly random yet very carefully selected scenes of lower-class, rural Cambodian malaise and ennui (read: people staring into the distance not realizing they&apos;re being filmed) set to an emotionally-charged choral musical backdrop would be enough to &quot;open the eyes&quot; of his audience to how the have-nots of East Asia really live. Instead, his show comes off like the work of a (typically white-privileged) 20-something millennial Social Justice Warrior whose sense of righteousness and predictable reverence for all things East Asian is not matched by a well-informed understanding of his host country and what sets him apart from the unwitting people he&apos;s essentially exploiting for profit. Apart from pictorially, DOGORA doesn&apos;t seem like the work of an accomplished auteur like Leconte. It&apos;s a tourist video with an &quot;epic&quot; soundtrack -- by the noticeably all-white Bulgarian State Orchestra -- layered in to &quot;open your eyes&quot; to its rather shallow, ill-defined &quot;message&quot;: that the indifferent, often bored-looking faces of rural and small-town Cambodians going about their day-to-day lives are actually the face of a people locked in some kind of eternal struggle that the filmmaker doesn&apos;t actually identify.",

The dreadful, creepy n isolated atmosphere added more intensity.\n\nThe opening statement and the way it is handled, all gav this movie a documentary feel n made it more terrifying.\n\nThe whole film has this dark n isolated look but the best part is nothing is shot in dim light or shaky cam or with flickering lights stuff.\n\nScreaming from Marilyn Burns got on my nerves at times. Her constant jumping from the windows n repeated screaming n the trauma she goes thru made the movie more emotionally scary.\n\nSome may find the dinner scene to b the most iconic n terrifying coz it gives the entire idea but i found the scene wher Leatherface keeps chasing the victim with a chainsaw to be pure nightmare n pure terrifying n intense stuff.\n\nAlso the scene wher Leatherface maniacally dances with his chainsaw is downright creepy.\n\nThe first kill is the most brutal n shocking. Ther is no gore or violence portrayed but jus the impact of the scene is brutal. The swing of the hammer and the way the victim falls to the ground and starts shaking, is just plain brutal n unbearable to watch.",

Three years later he&apos;s persuaded to come out of retirement for &apos;one last job&apos;, only to find his new client is Lee Maxwell (Chazz Palminteri) - the hitman who killed the presidential candidate. Ridley&apos;s job is to keep Maxwell alive long enough for him to inform against the Russian (I think) mob, all the while controlling his desire to kill him himself.\n\nThis film is so bad it crosses that fine line into &apos;entertaining&apos;. First, as far as bodyguarding goes this really is amateur hour:\n\nRidley (to a colleague on the candidate&apos;s security detail); &apos;Where&apos;s your body armour?&apos; Colleague; &apos;Ah, I didn&apos;t bother, it&apos;s too hot&apos;.\n\nWow, wonder what&apos;s going to happen to *that* guy...\n\nAnd,\n\nRidley (when said colleague is injured, leaving Ridley as the *only* agent with the candidate); &apos;I can&apos;t help him. It may be a ploy to draw us out.&apos; Presidential candidate; &apos;If you don&apos;t help him, he may die. Can you live with that?&apos; Ridley; &apos;Okay, you wait here.&apos;\n\nThose aren&apos;t spoilers; they both occur in the first five minutes!\n\nIt doesn&apos;t get better. A squad of bad guys in balaclavas and carrying assault rifles, and bodyguards brandishing twin pistols - in full view of *everyone* in a crowded nightclub - don&apos;t cause *any* panic until they actually start shooting?\n\nThe plot is about as original as a Steven Seagal movie, but with even more laughable decision-making and cliched dialogue. Actually, I could totally see this with JCVD as Ridley, and the bloated Buddha himself as Maxwell. Not that that&apos;s ever going to happen.\n\nAs an action flick, 3/10; as a laugh, 7/10! Averages out at...\n\n5/10.",

If the viewer is looking for a light comedy, this film will do the trick.\n\nMolly Gunn, a spoiled young woman, finds out in the worst way she has been rendered destitute because of the man in charge of her trust fund has swindled it and ran away with all her money. She must face reality, so she takes the easy way out in trying for the job of being the little girl Ray&apos;s nanny. She is in for a rude awakening!\n\nMolly finds out that Ray is a grown woman trapped in a little girl&apos;s body. Ray is wise beyond belief. She makes Molly&apos;s life a living hell until Molly realizes that the little girl is to be pitied because she hasn&apos;t known any happiness in her short little life.\n\nThe combination of Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning is what makes this film work. Both are fun to watch together. Both actresses show they have a strange chemistry that works on the screen. The supporting cast does its part, but of course, we can&apos;t take our eyes from Dakota Fanning.",

      "reviewBody": "Brooklyn Rules is a good story about the undying love and loyalty of three friends growing up in Brooklyn, under some very difficult circumstances. Some fine acting by Alec Baldwin and Scott Caan and very good dialog, so listen carefully. I think this movie has a minor flaw. Sometimes it moves a little slowly but the story line does keep you interested. There is some very funny dialog in this script that breaks up some of the serious moments in the movie, which I liked. This movie is also very violent at times but I believe it was a necessary part of the story.The script,written by Terence Winter was very good and superbly directed by Michael Corrente. I also liked the way this movie was filmed, the set decoration was good and so was the lighting. It made a lot of the scenes very easy on the eye. All in all, I came away from this movie feeling good. It reminded me of growing up with my friends, not under the same circumstances, mind you, but just the way good friends talk to each other with brutal honesty and oh yes, always a wisecrack.I recommend this movie because it is about all of us in some ways. I think people will identify with the characters, I think they will like the film.",

The decent, if not great or awesome, romantic comedy has a solid Italian flavor with Stanley Tucci with a so-so Italian accent and Bridget Fonda as the recently spurred and widowed wife that come together in this fireworks movie that contains an interesting (though not compelling) look at the explosive product storyline. Except for a confusing and disjointed wet piece of the letter that Bridget Fonda discovers though it is predictably tied up by the end, this is an average comedy movie that is light-weight but entertaining, worth a DVD rental price over the weekend with that special one.

      "reviewBody": "Wacken is not only the name of a small town in the very north of Germany. Every year the largest Heavy Metal festival in Europe is held in that little town counting 1.800 inhabitants. For five days, thousands of freaked out people with long hair and black clothes invade the town to celebrate &quot;W:O:A&quot;, &quot;Wacken Open Air&quot;.\n\nThe film is supposed to be a portrait of the lives of the people from Wacken, what they do for living and how they think about these five days when more than 60.000 (75.000 in 2007) long haired, evil looking &quot;metalheadz&quot; conquer their small untouched world. As I said, it is supposed to be....\n\nThe film leaves me with many unused possibilities. Example: There is a girl and her grandmother living in Wacken. Granny tells us about how she was forced to leave Prussia in WW2 and how she came to live in Wacken. In the next scene we see her praying before going to bed, her granddaughter tells us, that she is a very religious woman and she doesn&apos;t think very well about the festival and the people. But granny herself is never asked for her opinion by the director.\n\nWhat do these old people think about rock music and heavy metal? Why does granny find it so bad? What are her worries? What are her fears? What image does she have of all the black clothed people shaking their heads to music that tells stories of murder and blood? The film doesn&apos;t ask enough questions.\n\nWe get to know many people from the village, but we get to know the surface. The director simply doesn&apos;t ask enough questions, she just lets the people talk. Talk about their jobs, their lives as farmers, the stories of their weddings.\n\nBut that&apos;s nothing special. If I want to hear stories about being forced to walk from Prussia to Germany during WW2, I go visit my grandma. If I want to hear stories about farming, I watch TV-documentaries.\n\nThe film is called &quot;Full Metal village&quot;, but it makes one mistake: It doesn&apos;t confront the village with the metal at all. The special thing about Wacken is the people from that small village being confronted with the biggest metal festival in Europe. Wacken is an average German village with average German people who have average jobs and average hobbies, the film shows the everyday life in an average German village. I don&apos;t want to hear stories of their cows and what the difference between a cow and a calf is. I want to know: What do these average farmers think about the festival?\n\nThe film didn&apos;t give any interesting answers. Because it didn&apos;t ask any questions at all.",

      "reviewBody": "Scott James a retired martial arts champion gets caught up in a complicated web involving a wealthy heiress trying to hire him for an assassination job that includes an international terrorist group of ninjas and their training ground called &apos;The Octagon&apos;. Who&apos;s actually led by his brother, turned nemesis from his youthful days. His friend A.J. takes up the offer of the job, but Scott does he best to convince him out of it. Although he finds himself stuck in it, when A.J. goes after the group. Along the way he gets help from an old friend/work buddy McCarn.\n\nWhenever you got a ninja problem, Chuck Norris is your man. Though, I take it you already know that and will be relishing in every sequence involving Norris putting his boot into some ninjas. He&apos;s here to punish those who abuse their ninja abilities. It&apos;s too bad that many of those moments are very few and far between. As Norris wants to play detective, have flashbacks of his past, go for job interviews and constantly listen to his pondering voice in his head. And what&apos;s with the echoing lisp to it I couldn&apos;t stop myself from laughing whenever he decided to take some time out to express his thoughts in his head. Just brilliant! Only Norris could pull it off with such grace, ha-ha! This bizarre aspect only enhanced the unusualness and hazy cloud that formed amongst the over-populated material. I never thought I&apos;ll be saying this about a Norris film, but it has too much going on in the story and this makes it feel rather drawn out when its not shoving in those crackerjack martial art sequences. Otherwise with so much going on and it never truly being clear. From that it manages to rally up many random revelations and plot developments. Despite this its still a corn riddled outing on Norris&apos; behalf and the junky script only goes on to prove it. The stupidity, machismo and ninja talk features rather heavily to heavily in the woodenly talkative script.\n\nThis is one of Norris earlier features and one of his first lead roles. He&apos;s pretty much leaden in his acting abilities on this occasion (they gave him too much dialogues, when he should been kicking ass and having fun with it), but he would go on to hone down that charismatic appeal and personality he holds so greatly in the films that followed on. Or am I the only one of a few who thinks that? I find his presence to be far more engaging when his in more action-oriented roles that ask for some slight wit along the way. Anyhow this was probably made to turn him into the next American martial arts star, which would take him to Hollywood for even bigger roles. Oh no, that didn&apos;t entirely happen and he did get into some b-grade action flicks that flooded the 80s with the odd occasional big flick (Invasion USA, Delta Force). His acting is passable as a reluctant, but I must do it for the team Scott James, but when it came to the action. Those alert senses were brisk and flashy. When the film finally kicks into gear (in the latter end), up pops the very well choreographed and swiftly executed fight sequences capably directed by Eric Karson. Those final two fight scenes are a real blast. Too bad he couldn&apos;t get the pacing of the whole film to be like that, as it&apos;s downright sluggish for most part. Making up the rest of the performances is the wittily badass Lee Van Cleef (who steals the few scenes he&apos;s in) as the sneaky underhand McCern who feeds Scott with information he needs. Karen Carlson is horrible. Best leave it at that. Art Hindle is reasonable as Scott&apos;s go-getter friend A.J. Tadashi Yamashita nails down that venomously vile turn as Scott&apos;s brother Seigura. An elegantly biting Carol Bagdasarian turns up as a trainee terrorist who wants to make amends. Also in tiny, but potent parts are Jack Carter, Ernie Hudson and Richard Norton. The gloomily cheap b-grade production pretty much looks it. The lighting comes across as poorly dim and editing is quite haggard, but the beaming music score and stylishly vogue camera-work are competently suited into the picture.\n\nA mildly amusing (and at times unintentionally rib-tickling) offering, but it just takes too long break out of it chains and the flat-nature to begin with for some might just be too hard to overcome. Really Chuck Norris&apos; fans need only apply.",

      "reviewBody": "Strange arthouse film labelled as a horror to lure House with the Laughing Windows fans like me into a false sense of security. There is the odd creepy moment in this one, but what the film is all about is something else entirely. Someone ask Pupi Avati because I don&apos;t have a clue, although I did get a huge Federico Fellini vibe from it all.\n\nFurther muddying the waters is my basic command of Italian and the visual quality of the version I watched being akin to that of an eighteenth generation VHS of a porn film and you get the idea that the odds were not in the film&apos;s favour. With that, let&apos;s move on to what it may or may not have been about.\n\nA group of actors and one writer are currently working on their newest play, which seems to be about one of the actresses involved and her child Thomas. Meanwhile a man wanders about a cemetary talking about the same thing, before suggesting to the actors that they hold a séance. After speaking in a child&apos;s voice, a child called Thomas does appear to the actors, who then take him to their next destination.\n\nAmong them they agree to let Thomas himself decide whom he spends the rest of his life with, as the actors confront their own anxieties, and an old (sometimes young!) man kind of stalks them throughout the film. That&apos;s about all I can tell you about the plot, which may or may not have happened at all, seeing that the ending doesn&apos;t make any sense either.\n\nThere&apos;s an avalanche of surreal visual material throughout the film, as the script writer digs up stone bust in front of a ruined castle and babbles about the voices in his head. An old lady is led through a hotel where old crones, labelled either alive or dead, lie in beds around them. Someone orders an ice cream and the waiter runs up hundreds of stairs to serve it. Actors walk seamlessly from a stage to the middle of a wood. You can see why even with an HD copy and full subtitles, things wouldn&apos;t be any easier to figure out.\n\nThis isn&apos;t my kind of thing at all to be honest.\n\n Mariangela Melato has the biggest eyes I&apos;ve ever seen on a person.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s certainly not the first or only film to have ever been made about an automobile with some sinister trait; John Carpenter&apos;s adaptation of Stephen King&apos;s &apos;Christine&apos; is the chief example to come to mind for me. Unlike some other instances, though, there&apos;s a wonderfully wry sensibility about the presentation, stopping just short of outright humor in telling a story about a car that runs on blood instead of gasoline. Moreover, the narrative here is as much about the manufacturer as it is about a singular vehicle, and we&apos;re treated to corporate boardrooms, showrooms, and beautiful women modeling with cars as much as anything else. Not just that, but at some points the picture is almost parodic, such as in the directness of the dialogue and scene writing, or the extra contrived introduction of a romantic element. &apos;Upír z Feratu&apos; is an oddity, for sure, but I&apos;d also be lying if I said it wasn&apos;t fun!\n\nFun - but not flawless. The storytelling often seems rather sideways, not just for the cheeky feel about it all, but for how much the plot focuses on Dr. Marek&apos;s investigation while bypassing footage of the car in question. It does meaningfully meet the qualifications as a horror movie, especially with instances of blood, gore, death, and broader underlying nefariousness; at the same time, latter are employed sparingly, and the horror is thematic as much as it is actualized, if not more so. It&apos;s almost more of a plain thriller with an aspect of horror added as flavoring. Speaking of themes, filmmaker Juraj Herz and co-writer Jan Fleischer weave in clear-cut if passing underhanded commentary on modern obsessions with cars, the psychological impact of cars and the impulse behind the wheel to keep moving, and how modern civil engineering is shaped around automobiles instead of people, though I don&apos;t think these are explored as much as they could have been. Not least as the titular vehicle is sidelined for much of the runtime, there is also a sense of the plot being more than a little incohesive as it bounces back and forth; it quite seems to lack a strong center, and plot development is sometimes altogether rather vague. Scenes as written are fine, though at large there could have been more focus; I take no issue with Herz&apos;s direction, except perhaps to say that the title could have been rendered with more vitality, and energy.\n\nYet &apos;Upír z Feratu&apos; only wanted to have a good time, and even if it&apos;s not perfect or wholly captivating I think it ably achieves its goal. The production benefited from splendid resources being available to it, including apparent access to an actual rally. The effects and stunts are terrific, and Richard Valenta&apos;s cinematography is admirable. The cast give commendable performances, particularly Jiri Menzel with the nervous, harried disposition he gives protagonist Dr. Marek. Like those themes that are briefly touched upon, I think the biggest issue facing this feature is a failure to meet its full potential, and really delve into the possibilities the premise lays out. The writing does speak in part to the callousness of the Ferat manufacturer, the implications of further vehicle production, and the core notion of a car operating on its driver&apos;s blood. Yet whether it was a creative choice of Herz and Fleischer, possibly standards enforced in the contemporary Czechoslovak film industry, or some other factors or combination thereof, the tale comes off more as a conventional thriller about corporate malfeasance than it does a saga of darker vibrancy. We get what we were promised, and what we came for, yet only in bits and pieces, and not to an extent that&apos;s fully satisfying.\n\nI do think this is enjoyable and worthwhile on its merits, but very simply it&apos;s just not all I had expected or hoped it would be. For all the peculiarity of the concept, in practice it&apos;s nothing all that special or noteworthy. I&apos;m glad for those who get more out of &apos;Upír z Feratu&apos; than I do, yet I just think that if one is planning to watch, they should temper their expectations. Watch, by all means, but don&apos;t go out of your way for it, and maybe just save it for a quiet day rather than specifically set time aside.",

And after 2022 Jan Zizka (Medieval in English) this is the second try to do something more worldwide looking after many years, our film makers normaly don&apos;t even try, they make just TV movies targeted to a Czech viewer or fairytales or stupid comedy movies which are really low quality (which is sad, because our old comedy movies are really good), but Medieval had 10 times higher budget and looks worse than this super cheap movie.\n\nMovie is just detective story from cyberpunk future, nothing too complicated, there are some nice ideas and moral dilemats, creators say that they worked on that for 9 years, so people who say it&apos;s stealing from Altered Carbon should consider that it&apos;s just a coincidence, the same asi similarities to Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nMovie takes place somewhere in &quot;central Europe&quot; and names and places are selected on purpose that you don&apos;t exactly know where it is, some names are Czech, some Polish, some sounds German and city is mix of Prague, Warsaw and few other cities, but due to low budget, the vast majority of shots is very short and places where something is really doing on are small, similar to TV movies or theater, which is logical with that budget, part of movie takes place in comunity of people who deny technology, which is a logical way to save money, but I noticed that a lot of people hate the movie for not beying enough sci-fi and Cyberpunk, they have to know the budget! It&apos;s a miracle what they did with that money and it&apos;s just a start, if it earns money, they have big plans with this universe, so please support this movie made by new young creators with mostly new actors and actresses and you will get more in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "A well produced, horror flick that follows some many traditions in this field. A good &quot;hook&quot; script idea with a poorly thought out, daft explanation. Too many horror films-when dealing with out of this world concepts-do exactly the same. Lets have a brief 10 minute exposition of the just read out from the script by a leading character! Still, it has some creepiness and fairly good cinematography, a muted. bleached colour/contrast (ala Saving Private Ryan). The plus points are the enemy-shadows of their former selves; shadows of SS army ghosts (or ae they?). Aside from the problems with the &quot;lets quickly make up an explanation&quot; theory thrown in, the main problems are as follows: The mercenaries seem to made up of a spectrum of foreign soldiers-which is fine-but the accents of some are amusingly bad! &quot;You can be sure o one ting. No-bod-dy gives a foook about oz!&quot; says the &quot;African&quot; guy. The accents didn&apos;t totally kill the films &quot;playing it straight&quot; approach, but did bring out a wry smile!\n\nUnlike Neil Marshall&apos;s Dog Soldiers effort, this film lacked any sense of humour at all and might have been better for a &quot;Hicks&quot; type character from &quot;Aliens&quot; to have a mordant black sense of doom and humour. There seems to be one Irish soldier employed for this purpose but most of his lines fall fairly flat for the most part, although he is merely unrecognisable from the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost &quot;Spaced&quot; series, where he played (a v.funny) cycle courier with a mind messed by drug use! Overall, the visual design was very good despite its obvious budget constraints, such as the ghost/zombie elements-notably the Nazi approach from the back-lit tree-line. Are they underfire, or not? Well worth a watch then but I walked away feeling that it could have been so much better. I think the writer of this might have been influenced by a few films but...... Many years a go (back in 1977) I went to see cheap schlock horror movie starring Peter Cushing, about a zombie U boat crew who rise from the depths to kill the cast one by one. It was quite effective for the time-probably a bit daft and tame now-but the memory of it stayed with me. Shock waves, Almost Human and Dead Corps were the titles it ran under.",

      "reviewBody": "I might not get the highest possible rating for my comments on this movie but I&apos;m going to be totally honest. First, I read the book and then shortly afterward saw the movie. In my opinion the movie did a good job of getting the whole story from book to screen. A lot of the scenes caught the mood I felt when I read the book, or even shed some light on them for me. C. Thomas Howell played his part very well and showed acting skill, but he just seemed too nice, too sensitive to enjoy fighting for its own sake the way his brothers did. I could believe Darry and Soda looking forward to a fight with the Socs but I just did not get the feeling from PonyBoy that he was a fighter. Even Johnny Cade seemed more on edge, more &apos;ready to fight&apos; than PonyBoy, who played all his scenes really well - he just didn&apos;t convince me he was someone who enjoyed a fight.\n\nOf all the actors cast for the film, and really all were done well, I think Ralph Macchio as Johnny Cade was the most perfectly cast based on how I perceived him to be from reading the book.\n\nTo be honest, when reading the book I could tell it was written by a woman. I enjoyed it very much, and would say if you have a few hours, the book is not too long to read and I&apos;d recommend it even more highly than the film.\n\nThe Outsiders is a very good film in any case and worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "I attended the World Premiere of &quot;Bill&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival. That fact alone is actually surprising to me, as my viewing habits tend to lean towards dramas, and this is anything but. In fact, festivals this year have been weighed down by heavy films that are about as dark as they come. &quot;Bill&quot; could not be more different, and what a refreshing change and much-needed uplift is this all-out, unabashed comedy. Co-directed by the husband-wife team of Bernie Goldmann and Melissa Wallack (who penned the script), &quot;Bill&quot; has all the elements required of the genre: characters to whom we can relate, a clever storyline, and laughs aplenty.\n\nAaron Eckhart (&quot;Any Given Sunday,&quot; &quot;Erin Brockovich,&quot; &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;) is Bill, smack dab in the middle of a life becoming all-too familiar. His job is falling apart (he begrudgingly works for his irascible father-in-law), his marriage is going to pieces, his body is going to pot, and, perhaps most horrifying, his hair is rejecting his head. Bill needs a change, fast, and is not-so-voluntarily signed up for a mentoring program at the local high school. He is teamed up with young Logan Lerman (&quot;The Butterfly Effect,&quot; &quot;Hoot,&quot; &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;), who plays The Kid, literally (Lerman&apos;s character is never identified by name), and the two join together in battle to fight the demons at the heart of Bill&apos;s midlife crisis.\n\nA magnificent ensemble cast including Elizabeth Banks, Timothy Olyphant, Jessica Alba, and Kristen Wiig (and far too many more to mention) are all up to the task of providing enough comedic fodder to fill several films. Discussing their characters in depth would be too revealing, and my policy is to allow the reader to find a synopsis elsewhere if desired. Ultimately the partnership between Bill and The Kid is what drives the story, and the chemistry between Eckhart and Lerman is central to the success of the film. And it works. The Kid is smart, streetwise, sexy (or so he thinks), and has the self-confidence of someone thrice his age. In short, he&apos;s everything Bill aspires to be. It&apos;s a role-reversal device that&apos;s at the heart of many classic comedies, and Wallack&apos;s brilliant writing makes it work.\n\nDespite being an independent film (read: low budget) &quot;Bill&quot; has the look of a Hollywood movie. The design is bright and the sound and editing give it a crisp, bouncy feel. Best of all, the cinematography with Peter Lyons Collister at the helm is second to none. He&apos;s one of the best in the business, a classic comedy veteran, and it shows.\n\nIt&apos;s always hard to single anyone out in a fine ensemble cast but in both screenings I attended Lerman stole the show. He unquestionably got the biggest laughs and was the crowd favorite. I hesitate to call him a newcomer, as at the tender age of 15 he already has 10 movies and 23 television episodes under his belt, but he&apos;s one to watch for and has a bright career ahead of him. But this is Eckhart&apos;s film to make or break, and his sense of comedic timing and puppy-like ability to elicit just the right amount of empathy from the audience create those touching moments that leave the viewer wanting more. And so I attended the second screening as well, and enjoyed it even more. And that&apos;s the true test of a comedy. From this writer&apos;s perspective, &quot;Bill&quot; not only hits its mark but is also sure to be a winner for years to come.",

      "reviewBody": "My title doesn&apos;t quite trip off the tongue, but one thing about fairy tales is that they can be set and adapted to anywhere in the world, the characters being wholly universal.\n\nPremiered on Film 4 tonight, as part of a &apos;Fright-Fest&apos; double bill, this eerie movie starts out like all Hollywood &apos;horror&apos; flicks - you know, dark slippery road at night, middle of an impenetrable forest, driver uses his mobile - almost enough to put folk like me off, but maybe clever as it entices the new cinema-going market as they feel smugly content with what they&apos;re watching - until:\n\nYes - a fairytale house in a clearing, with cute kids and cuter parents and lovely toys and dreamy food...again, drawing us in but generating a sense of unrest and unease, as we know this is labelled as a &apos;horror&apos; movie and ultimately, things have to get sinister and bad at some point. These they indeed do, but it takes time, maybe too long but, for once, there&apos;s a real story that&apos;s far more than some lazy adaptation. I&apos;m not really au fait with the original Grimm story, but this extends and takes it to another dimension, without the sense of feeling that it&apos;s gone too far. It is ultimately the story that generates the most chills - how often can you say that, these days?\n\nThe art direction is the trump card here, along with the acting of the three main children. The associated cinematography and music assist greatly, bringing it all up to a standard that&apos;s amongst the best from modern Korea. There is quite a lot of violence, but only where the story requires it and some shocks to keep the blood pumping. It probably won&apos;t provide enough instantly gratifying gore and gruesome details for Friday night party types to Twitter about but for those wanting a more meaty fare, this has a lot going on.",

      "reviewBody": "Because it&apos;s a newer version of a classic horror movie (and it went directly to video), I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon&apos;s take on Edgar Allen Poe&apos;s classic story, but after finally catching it; I can honestly say that I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t see it earlier! While the Roger Corman/Vincent Price version of the tale is far better, this update still has a lot in store for the horror fan, most notably it&apos;s superb European styled atmosphere, and a fine performance by Lance Henriksen, which may even be the best of his career. While these elements are contributors to the film&apos;s success, the main reason why the film works is the story behind it. Of course, it&apos;s based (albeit loosely) on Poe&apos;s classic tale, so the story is bound to be solid; but it doesn&apos;t take all of it&apos;s influence from Poe, and so Dennis Paoli can take a lot of credit for the screenplay he wrote for the movie. The idea of &apos;the pendulum&apos;, along with a &apos;pit&apos; can conjure up many feelings of dread and pain, and this film adequately capitalises on that with it&apos;s excellent torture filled finale! \n\nAs mentioned, Lance Henriksen gives what is maybe his best performance in this film. He is both powerful and frightening in his role as Torquemada, the head witchfinder of the Spanish Inquisition. When he says &quot;I am the inquisition&quot;, it&apos;s enough to make your hairs stand on end. Henriksen is a criminally underrated actor and one that certainly deserves more praise...it&apos;s just unfortunate that he tends to shine in movies that don&apos;t get noticed. Also in the cast is &apos;Re-Animator&apos; himself, Jeffrey Combs, who shines in a small role as someone in the inquisition. The film isn&apos;t wholly serious, and Stuart Gordon has seen fit to add some comic relief to the proceedings, which is OK but I feel that the movie would be better off without any &apos;relief&apos;. Certain elements from other Poe stories appear, such as a man being bricked in behind a wall, and this film seems to treat it&apos;s subject material with respect. The European horror style is a major plus factor in my opinion, and should please fans of movies from the sixties and seventies. On the whole; surprisingly good!",

Trouble is these touches do not blend well with an overly complex murder plot. It&apos;s more like awkward storylines bumping each other rather than blending together. Appears a rewrite was in order, after which, maybe a little longer runtime. Too bad, because had the parts blended better, we might have had a genuine sleeper.\n\nAnyhow, it&apos;s a good chance to catch Rogers on her way up Hollywood&apos;s starlit ladder. Despite her later dancing and fluffy sparkle, she shows here an ability to act out the serious professional woman, a reporter who&apos;s humorously sabotaged by rival reporter Talbot. In fact, their final scene shows Rogers&apos; innate versatility that later twirls atop the dance floor.\n\nAll in all, check out the flick, not so much as an awkward whodunit, but as an atmospheric drama with comedic overtones, and also a chance to catch a movie icon on her early way up."

However, Henrik is believed to be gay by the other students in the class, particularly roughneck Patrick, so Kristian distances himself from him.\n\nKristian becomes fast friends with Patrick and his gang when, in one horrible scene, he helps the lad set on a poor girl in class and rip her top off. Kristian is further surprised, however, to find that Patrick is gay, and is in a relationship with an older man. Meanwhile, he sees an ageing female pop singer in a nightclub, and makes the hard-to-swallow decision to begin a sexual relationship with her, despite her being at least thirty years older than him, and looking it.\n\nThe girl who he humiliated tells him to &quot;forget about the sweater thing&quot;, and starts a relationship with him too, despite the fact that when we last saw her she was struggling to cover herself, shrieking and crying and running out of the room, humiliated and traumatised.\n\nHe&apos;s also shocked to his core by his friend&apos;s homosexuality, shaking and crying that &quot;it&apos;s not normal, nobody else is like you guys&quot;... but yeah, you guessed it, does a pretty quick turnaround on that one.\n\nThe movie begins fairly realistically but ends up going for a quick, unbelievable resolution, and even ends with a musical routine.

      "name": "A bad sequel, but an OK movie in the slasher horror genre!",
      "reviewBody": "A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&apos;s Revenge (1985), oh boy. It is not the worst movie in the series but is not the greatest sequel either. It is very Underrated which I understand why because the film has a lot of problems. It is my at least favorite film. Even tough it is a bad sequel it still follows the roots from first movie with a different story, different idea,different cast and that is good. The first time that a boy was a main hero in A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. In the rest of the sequels was always some girl as a hero. 4,5,6 and the remake (2010) are seriously the worst ones in the movies, the best one is Wes Craven&apos;s A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Freddy was still serious - not as much joking around and you feel for the main character - plus his girlfriend was smoking hot - didn&apos;t know he was bisexual. What can I say? I don&apos;t hate the film and I like it for a bit but that&apos;s it. \n\nI like the film because it follows the roots from the first film, It is mentioning Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) yes I am a Nancy Thompson fan! I love her very much and this film has respect to Nancy Thompson! While showing the diary and the telling the story&apos;s about her. Walsh family moved in to Thompson&apos;s house. That&apos;s what I like a bit this film. It is a horror film, Freddy kills a doesn&apos;t people, specially in the pool that was just awesome. Kim Myers as Lisa Webber was really smoking hot and she cared about Jesse. I like this film for it. Freddy stripped the coach down and killed him in that gay overtone because the coach was into some freaky sexual stuff, because I remember the coach being in leather and bondage looking clothes when he runs into Jesse.. So yeah Freddy killed him in an extreme version of what the coach liked. From the looks of the coach&apos;s bondage like clothes he had on you can assume he likes to be whipped and stuff like that. So his death scene was very fitting and that was awesome, I like that a lot. The love scene between Jesse and Lisa conger and defeating Freddy was amazing! The nightmare on the bus was just really extremely awesome even the ending scene was awesome. \n\nThe film has major problems that I just don&apos;t like that. For most of the movie Freddy&apos;s Glove was missing and they had to use the blades on his fingers. Reportedly it was stolen after filming and they had to scramble to make a replacement. They should have watch for that glove. Wes Craven refused to work on this film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn&apos;t like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. I agree with that, why the main hero has to get him self into been manipulated and go murdering people around? That&apos;s just not right and it is wrong in my opinion. The film was too short and it become a little boring by time to time. I didn&apos;t like the gay scenes including the couch who was a molester and a gay in this film. I am glad Freddy killed him. The story had potential, but it just failed. The part where Jesse runs into gym teacher at the s&amp;m bar and then he brings him back to the school and has him do laps and makes him take a shower, after he was tired. Looks like he was prepping Jessie for ass rape. That was the worst gay scene in the movie ever and it hurt the film so much! \n\nAnyway with all the problems in the movie, the story did work well. Freddy in this film is at his darkest plus the make up FX by Kevin Yagher on Freddy made him look more and scary then I ever seen him look in any of the films after this one. It had a very good cast and effects and you finally saw Freddy&apos;s whole face it was a nice sequel. I think Jack Sholder did a great direction debut I don&apos;t think, he did a terrible job which he didn&apos;t. Robert Englund did a great job in this film, that is one of the reason the film isn&apos;t the worst than other sequels are. It is at least my favorite horror slasher film because it really did had a potential and it failed. It was OK sequel tough, but still a bad one and I have a lot of respect for Mark Patton cheers for him!!! Anyway I am giving this film a 7. rating even tough it deserves less.",

The killer and the film&apos;s antagonist is Dr Karl Glock (Richard Lynch), a psychiatrist who brainwashes people to commit the killings. To those who have been brainwashed, cops appear to be giant insects or horrible creatures, and they unintentionally kill the cops.\n\n&apos;Scanner Cop&apos; is a spinoff to the &apos;Scanners&apos; series, which started back in 1981. The final act is a wild ride filled with hellish images. It becomes an all-out clash between our hero&apos;s powers, and hallucinations.

The film has a good story that holds the interest; pacing and the editing between the three stories of the girls and their romances are done well. Another excellent feature of this film is the photography. The opening sequence with the fountains in Rome and Frank Sinatra&apos;s music is beautiful. There are other beautiful scenes in the film of the Italian countryside and Venice. In summary, this is an old-fashioned romantic film that displays how three women find love and the lengths that they will go to be in love.",

But this was definitely a film where the parts were greater than the whole.  It had some good moments (and, like many mummy movies, the early scenes in Egypt were among the highlights), but overall the film&apos;s plot unraveled faster than the mummy&apos;s wrappings.  (I would recommend one of Hammer&apos;s classics, be it the 1959 MUMMY or 1971&apos;s BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY&apos;S TOMB, over this.)  I have to admit I have only seen the version released here in the U.S., which is 88 minutes compared to other running times of 115 and even 122 minutes, so maybe the longer cut would help.  Would like to point out something, however:  Throughout many of the reviewer comments made about the film on IMDB, it is repeatedly stated that writer/director Russell Mulcahy must be an American because of all the mistakes the movie made when it comes to London lifestyles...sorry, folks, but Mulcahy is from Melbourne, Australia."

      "reviewBody": "The Wedding Banquet was the first Ang Lee film that I watched. I remember I was about 10 or 11 years old when I watched it. At that time, I did not understand the movie at all. However, as I grow older, I watched it again and I realized what a masterpiece that Ang Lee had accomplished. Coming from the same background, as Taiwanese immigrant to the United States, I can certainly relate many of issues with the protagonist Wai-Tung. My parents are exactly like Wai-Tung&apos;s parents. They have high expectation of the son and carry on the family name is the most important thing. Ang Lee did a very good job on depicting the traditional father figure in Taiwanese society. My father, very much like Wai-Tung&apos;s, is a very serious person. To him everything has to be done straight and upright. My mother on the other hand is very sentimental. She would just cry like Wai-Tung&apos;s mother in the movie. Taiwanese mothers always care for their son so much that they literally do everything for their son, just like how Wai-Tung&apos;s mother sets up a blind date for him. My parents are so serious that sometimes if I joke about me liking a man they would get upset. Therefore, I really can understand how Wai-Tung has to hide his secret for such a long time in the movie.\n\nI like how Ang Lee uses Wai-Tung to represent Taiwan; Wei-Wei to represent China, and Simon to represent the US. In the movie, there is one scene where Wei-Wei wears a red dress in the air port picking up Wai-Tung&apos;s parents, I just could not help myself but laugh at the expression that Wai-Tung&apos;s dad gives when he sees Wei-Wei. He must think her as another communist he fought in the Chinese civil war. Another fascinating thing about this movie is that I watched it again in my film study class and even the movie is in mandarin, my classmates seem to understand the messages and laugh about them. I guess it is the magic of the movie. It really can transcend time and languages. Overall, Wedding Banquet has became my all time favorite of all the Ang Lee films.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes these low-budget science fiction features are amusing for unintended reasons, but this one is enjoyable because it has an interesting story and because it is well-crafted for such a low-budget movie. Since its effectiveness comes mostly from the story and from the solid acting, even with a bigger budget it might not have been significantly better.\n\nThe menace of &quot;X the Unknown&quot; is based on a far-fetched but interesting concept, and the story gets good mileage out of the premise, without pushing it too far. There are a couple of plot holes, but not so bad that they pull it down, and in general the story has the kind of internal logic that holds it together as long as you grant the premise for the sake of a good story.\n\nThe cast does surprisingly well. The characters are not the kind of roles that are particularly difficult to play, but they are the kind of roles that are easy to overplay, and that often are overplayed. Here the actors make their characters lifelike without trying to grab the attention, and it works pretty well.\n\nDean Jagger has good presence as Professor Royston, yet he avoids the kinds of stereotypes that sometimes make such characters annoying. Some of his little habits and mannerisms help to make the professor more human. Leo McKern also turns in a good performance. Edward Chapman&apos;s character is quite one-dimensional, yet he does a creditable job with it. It&apos;s also rather fun to see a very young-looking Anthony Newley in a small but entertaining role.\n\nAll of the cast members do a good job with a script that is plain but workmanlike. The special effects are rudimentary in technique, but they are good enough, and it&apos;s certainly preferable to have plain-looking special effects and a good story than to have flashy visuals and a dreary, pointless story. As a whole, &quot;X the Unknown&quot; delivers good science fiction without frills or padding, and it&apos;s easily among the better of the 1950s low-budget sci-fi movies."

      "reviewBody": "Someone who, as the result of long military deployment at the end of the Cold War, saw nearly every theatrical release of the time is familiar with the Eastwood Mayoral Late Bubblegum Period. Scholars define this as Clint&apos;s tenure as mayor of Carmel, between the Marine anthem &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; in 1986 and Clint&apos;s Western opus &quot;Unforgiven&quot; in 1992. In 1988 he put a belated end to Dirty Harry in the &quot;Dead Pool,&quot; in 1990 he had a PG-13 bondage scene with Sonia Braga in &quot;The Rookie,&quot; and in between there was this streetwise chase caper that was, to our loss, his only work with Bernadette. Bounty hunter Tommy (euphemistically a &quot;skip tracer&quot; since he&apos;s chasing a girl) captures bail jumper Lou Ann in Las Vegas and becomes caught up in the chase for a cash stash hidden in her pink &apos;59 Caddy convertible by her drug-addict husband &amp; his white supremacist, counterfeiting friends. Clint is at his most likable in these average-Joe tough-guy roles, men who survive only by their wits in seedy jobs (bounty hunter, bank robber, detective, street boxer) &amp; take their lumps when they fall for lost causes or damsels in distress. Peters is fantastic in a humdrum role, going from sullen to sassy to sexy to sensitive without letting us down for an instant. The film is pure fun for its first two thirds, featuring little besides the two stars (Clint mimicking Bernadette&apos;s unique soprano is not to be missed). Geoffrey Lewis, an essential in all Eastwood movies like this, is entertaining as ever, this time as an addled hippie forger. The story follows the formula of several movies of this period, the best of which was &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (Cop/bounty hunter finds initial quarry, who&apos;s a patsy holding the key to bringing down a really nasty criminal/terrorist outfit). Unfortunately, the bad guys are too psycho-nasty for the light-hearted script, which also features Lou Ann&apos;s baby as a hostage. The pre-&quot;Sopranos&quot; mob bad guys of &quot;Midnight Run&quot; brought just the right amount of humor to distill their menace, but if you can find anything funny about neo-Nazi redneck drug addict survivalist militiamen who kidnap babies, please seek therapy. Clint actually gives it a shot near the end, so never let it be said he&apos;s not up for a dramatic challenge. &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; isn&apos;t worthy as the only vehicle for the Broadway star and the greatest tough guy of his day, but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours at sea. Compliments to &quot;Speed Channel&apos;s&quot; Lost Drive-in for bringing this &amp; other forgotten car movies back to the small screen.",

      "reviewBody": "Of Human Hearts (1938)\n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nThis MGM film starts off as melodrama then moves to soap opera before eventually crashing as something completely cornball. Thankfully we have a terrific cast delivering fine performances or else this thing wouldn&apos;t work at all. It tells the story of a preacher (Walter Huston) who is constantly battling his son (James Stewart as adult, Gene Reynolds as child) who eventually wants to go in a different direction and become a doctor. The son goes off to medical school and constantly has to write home asking his poor mother (Beulah Bondi) for money and never really giving her the time or credit she deserves for her sacrifice. OF HUMAN HEARTS offers up a terrific cast but the story turns so incredibly cornball during the final fifteen-minutes that you can&apos;t help but throw your hands up in the air and wonder what the studio, writer and director were thinking. This is certainly far from a bad movie but this is due to the terrific cast including Huston who turns in another strong performance. He plays the part in the typical Huston fashion, which means integrity and stern. Stewart is also very good in his part as he manages to really make you believe how naive and rather stupid his character is when it comes to what his mother is doing for him. Reynolds plays the part as a child and he too is wonderful and works extremely well with Huston as the two are constantly going against one another. Bondi deserved her Oscar-nomination as her role doesn&apos;t feature too many lines but we get to know everything we should by her simple body movements and some extremely strong work with her eyes, which tells so much. The supporting cast includes good bits by Guy Kibbee as a cheap store owner, Gene Lockhart as a janitor, Ann Rutherford as Stewart&apos;s girlfriend and Charles Coburn as the town doctor/drunk. One of the best performances in the film comes from John Carradine who is only here for about four-minutes as he plays President Lincoln. The performance by Carradine is very striking because of how he plays the part. The actor comes off incredibly strong and you can&apos;t help but feel as if you&apos;re watching a real president. I was really shocked at how close Carradine looked like Lincoln so you have to give the make-up department a lot of credit. However, this scene is extremely bad as Lincoln calls Stewart in from the Civil War to jump on him for not writing to his mother!! This scene is so incredibly bad and it leads to an even worse conclusion that you can&apos;t help but wish Carradine had gotten a separate movie where he could have played this part. It also doesn&apos;t help that the screenplay doesn&apos;t make the preacher or the son characters you really care about because both of them seem way too self-centered. With that said, if you&apos;re a fan of any of the cast members then you might want to check this out but sadly it&apos;s yet another MGM that contains way too much sugar for its own good."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Blonde&apos; is an Italian language film with English subtitles that seem to flow by all too quickly, but then Italians seem to like to talk quickly anyway. The opening titles make it appear that the viewer is in for a boring movie with its detailed, close up look at the mechanism of a watch with commentary on how to fix it or what to look for when doing so. It is vaguely reminiscent of one of the scenes in &apos;The Graduate&apos; in which Benjamin, Dustin Hoffman, is floating in a pool totally bored. The protagonist, Tommaso, is a student watch repairman who is taking the final classes on his craft before going into business for himself. His life is boring, although he does have a waiting fiancée. On the way back to his apartment at night, he hits Nastassja in a crosswalk with his car as she decides to cross against a red light signal. She suffers amnesia and the movie moves on from there. Sergio Rubini is both the director and Tommaso, which is a nice way to get to appear in a movie with Nastassja Kinski and have control of it at the same time. The script is fine because there aren&apos;t any glaring logical errors in it, although one could nit-pick and find something to complain about. This is probably the only movie in which Nastassja is actually hysterical - one will have to see the film to know why. The first half of the film deals with Tommaso trying to help Nastassja recover from her amnesia, the second half is what happens afterward. Of course, Tommaso falls for Nastassja and the second half deals with his pursuit of her after she suddenly disappears. Sergio Rubini at least knows one good way of making a Nastassja Kinski film: put her on the screen in many closeups at varying moments, catching her without much make up, fully made up, show her facial texture with flaws, wrap her in an expensive torn dress from the accident, buy her an outfit to replace the torn dress, let her get wet in the rain, show her in stunning designer clothes, AND above all just let her act. &apos;The Blonde&apos; was released in 1992 and only recently has been released on DVD in a full frame format, not letter boxed.",

      "reviewBody": "Alienating film. It has always upset me the way that documentaries have to add some degree of theatrics to themselves, for example, like when they make one person reenact something that did happen. In this film this was particularly off putting. So the scenes where the lady is writing or travelling and gazing at the horizon or something like that , they always feel so forced and uncomfortable. But talking about the most prominent of the film&apos;s features i was mildly interested in what it had to say in the beginning but the uncompromising and unclear way that they put some of the issues related to the theme of the movie, namely the multiculturalism and the whole al qaeda conflicts was really unsatisfying. The film makes a big deal out of itself as a political film but, at the same time, refuses to any sort of didacticism. Not only that but the points of view expressed in the film are many times ambiguous and confusing.\n\nSo this is a documentary that doesn&apos;t really document much as it refuses to explain things, at the same time as it is an art film without much feeling to it. Not feeling it too much but the subject was interesting enough",

Although the actual robbery is seen briefly, it made the man famous for stealing from an institution not likely to have been robbed.\n\nWe come to the story as Vincent Goumard, a free lance journalist makes contact with Spaggiari&apos;s men under the pretext of an interview with the notorious bandit, now living in a South American country, not unlike Brazil, but not identified by name. Unknown to Spaggiari, or his associates, Goumard was acting with the police and the idea was to kidnap him and return him to France for justice.\n\nThe problem with the film, directed by Jean-Paul Rouve, is that it never makes up its mind whether to be a comedy, or a thriller. Mr. Rouve makes the mistake of other actors in trying to act and direct. Perhaps a better film would have resulted with another man in charge. As an actor, Mr. Rouve does not convince. When all is set and done, nothing new comes out about the caper.",

It&apos;s virtually impossible to tell who is being killed as each stunt man falls from the rocky heights. No uniforms or scorecard to know if any casualty is a win or loss for the good guys. The most noteworthy performance came from George Ardisson, who channeled a slice of Dan Duryea for a smugly crazed take on this villain gig, complete with a leering smile that projects more menace than mirth.",

These were great comedy teams. Elke especially did a great job, her first Carry on and she was just splendid, likable, funny with a great delivery and a cheeky smile.\n\nSome truly funny moments, Petter Butterworth trying to coax Kenneth and Elke to hire his caravan, Elke&apos;s looking for scrubbers, the striptease, lots to chose from.\n\nEven the theme music makes me laugh, it&apos;s such a cheeky and funny tune, perfect for the film. 9/10",

The bookies take &quot;a tip&quot; from a sympathetic freak, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nI rented this movie because the cast looked amazing, and it didn&apos;t disappoint.  The plot line seems at times a bit dis-junct, but even when the story slows down, it opens up room for some brilliant performances.  John Turturro is rarely seen at this level....a cross between  the &quot;wired / freaky&quot; guy he plays in the Coen Bros films, but here he displays a sympathy that is rarely seen in this kind of character. The bookies are headed off by George DiCenzo, who almost steals the movie....Michael Badaluco (recently on &quot;The Practice&quot;) and John Spencer round out the trio. In a scene that makes the film, Jimmy Smits is great in a cameo as a gambler who can&apos;t pay.   Scott Glenn takes yet another turn as the cop who seeks retribution.\n\nThere are few gambling-mafia- type movies that offer a sincerely comical look at the world of low-level wise guys (without avoiding the cliche&apos;s that you find in almost every knock off of a Scorsese film)  this film manages to pull it off, and is at times very funny in the process.",

Jackson, Melvin Van Peebles, Fred Williamson and critic Elvis Mitchell are among the people interviewed for this entertaining documentary that takes a look at the blaxploitation movies of the 1970&apos;s. \n\nAt just under a hour there&apos;s no question that this doesn&apos;t contain the greatest details but it at least has many of the stars that were in the movies as well as people like Tarantino who has kept the genre alive for new fans to discover. The best thing about this movie is that we get some very good discussions about race relations at the time and how these movies were fresh and original and especially in how these movies helped give black crowds a different type of hero.\n\nThe documentary covers not only the popularity of these films but also the controversy that haunted them. Both subjects are discussed in great detail and we also get some wonderful clips from various movies. There&apos;s also a great interview with Grier who of course was one of the best actresses from this era and certainly one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen."

Well, I was pretty satisfied: although it is no masterpiece, the global atmosphere, and especially the gorgeous views of the city are very well put together. The actors are very convincing too, especially Juliette Binoche, radiant, Luchini, a surprisingly good dancer, and Albert Dupontel. It is just a pity that there are so many simultaneous stories, some of them don&apos;t really bring much to the plot and could have been cut, to leave more time to the others.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this movie for all people who want to get a feel for what Paris is all about!",

      "reviewBody": "Naoyuki Tomomatsu&apos;s &quot;Stacy&quot; of 2001 is a messy and confusing, but highly entertaining and amusing humorous gore flick like it will only be made in the Land Of The Rising Sun.\n\nIn the near future (beginning of the 21st century), girls between 15 and 17 suddenly fall victims to a mysterious epidemic plague. After a period of gratuitous &quot;Near Death Happiness&quot; (&quot;NDH&quot;) , the cheerful girls die, only to rise from the dead as flesh eating zombie-schoolgirls, commonly referred to as Stacies. These Stacies infest the streets with their desire for flesh, until they are &quot;repeat-killed&quot;. In order to repeat-kill a Stacy, she must be cut in 165 pieces, a task which is performed mainly by the &quot;Romero Repeat-Kill Troops&quot;, Swat teams in trucks specialized on Stacy-disposal...\n\nWhen watching &quot;Stacy&quot;, I couldn&apos;t help but laugh my ass off almost throughout the entire film. The plot es absolute nonsense, and there is no suspense at all, but it is (besides the excessive gore) exactly the absurd story that makes this movie such a joy to watch. &quot;Stacy&quot; is furthermore a tribute to Zombie-Classics, as the whole movie is full of references to movies like &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; or George A. Romero&apos;s &apos;Dead&apos; films (&quot;Romero Repeat-Kill Troops&quot;, a popular chainsaw called &quot;Bruce Campbell&apos;s Right Hand, etc.).\n\nThe performances range from bearable to awful, but since this is a movie with a twinkle in the eye, that has to be seen with a certain sense of humor, the terrible acting is not really bothersome. As mentioned above, the gore is extreme, which is the movie&apos;s main purpose, and which should serve as a recommendation to my fellow gore-fans. &quot;Stacy&quot; may be pure nonsense, the plot is unbelievably odd and confusing at times and the acting is terrible, but the movie is certainly quite amusing for a fan of splatter flicks. Recommended for a good, gory laugh.",

      "reviewBody": "Paul and Diane Stanton (Dermot Mulroney and Diane Kruger) are living a comfortable life in Santa Fe, New Mexico but conflicted with their daughter&apos;s stage four lung disease. After months of waiting on the national waiting list so their daughter could get a replacement, Paul discovers a friend, gubernatorial candidate James Harrison (Sam Shepard) has had an illegal heart transplant. Harrison agrees to tell Paul all he knows, which sends Paul to Tijuana to find a mysterious Dr. Navarro, the man behind the curtain of illegal organ transplants. \n\nOrgan transplants are just as dangerous and just as illegal as human trafficking, and can cause as much and more heartache. &quot;Inhale&quot; takes a regular family man and places him in war-torn Tijuana to try to save the life if his little girl using any means necessary, which makes you question his moral authority. Good films do just that, they make you think. Great films, however, leave you thinking. \n\nDermot Mulroney doesn&apos;t usually play the leading character but gives a tour-de-force performance here. He is beaten and bruised on his journey but does not give up and held my attention throughout. The beautiful Diane Kruger is equally as good but underused as his frantic wife, tending to be a sidelines character who never gets her due. Sam Shepard successfully plays a slick politician, and the entire Hispanic cast, including the equally slick Jordi Molla, hold their own. \n\nThe script has a few problems, mostly with explanation. Shepard&apos;s character&apos;s relationship to Mulroney&apos;s character is never quite explained. It appears they work together and are close, then suggests the opposite when Shepard is running for Governor. Kruger is underused, which takes away from much of &quot;Inhale&quot;&apos;s potential. She is a fantastic actress but seeing her cry isn&apos;t enough. She&apos;s too good to be so one - dimensional, which suggests some of the film never made it off the cutting room floor. \n\nJames Newton Howard&apos;s soundtrack blends seamlessly into the background, becoming a character in itself as it differentiates New Mexico and Mexico. The ending is perhaps the biggest fault of the film. The choices Paul makes throughout takes him to a surgical room where he is faced with an incredibly difficult choice. When we discover which choice he made, we are made to think if it was right. If we never knew, that would have left us thinking long after the screen went black. \n\n&quot;Inhale&quot; takes the organ trafficking debate head on, which is admirable. Yet the film isn&apos;t as good as the message it gets across.",

He is a distinct personality that his men and others under his care recognize as &quot;leader&quot;. I bought it totally. He is distant, sexy and loving to a small son. He is brave and a heroic personality. Just the kind of movie I love with Gary Cooper. The Florida vistas are wild and beautiful. The whole thing just entertained me and I came back for more. I don&apos;t remember this one from T.V. reruns so it was brand new to me. I highly recommend to people who love westerns (especially with Gary Cooper).",

He was supposedly killed by insurgents while saving his fellow soldiers. Five weeks after the public ceremonies, the military finally admits that his death is the result of friendly fire. What this documentary reveals is more than a fog of war. There is manipulation. This is not simple bureaucracy. There is a cover-up. Tillman&apos;s parents express their personal outrage at being lied to by everybody and are forced to dig for the truth.",

      "reviewBody": "A few years earlier than George Stevens mammoth all star film about the life of Jesus was this film by Nicholas Ray. Taking, it&apos;s title from the Cecil B. DeMille silent film, this version of King of Kings is in no way a remake of the DeMille epic. This King of Kings is a moving reverential account of the life of the obscure carpenter from Galilee whose thoughts still move millions today. The voice you hear doing the narration bridging of the various episodes of Jesus&apos;s life is the familiar one of Orson Welles.\n\nNicholas Ray shot this film in Spain with the broad central plain serving as Judea in the early years of AD. Unlike Stevens, Nicholas Ray used second line players for the most part, the biggest name in the cast is that of Robert Ryan as John the Baptist. \n\nJesus is played by Jeffrey Hunter and if you were to ask today&apos;s movie fans what they most remember about Hunter, they will either say his role in the original Star Trek pilot as Captain Christopher Pike, or his two roles in John Ford films, The Searchers and Sergeant Rutledge. Some reviewers have remarked about Hunter&apos;s blue eyes, personally I think Nicholas Ray might have cast Hunter with those baby blues to mark Jesus as indeed unique among the populace of Judea. In any event it&apos;s a sincere portrayal that Hunter gives. He&apos;s most effective in the Sermon on the Mount scene.\n\nKing of Kings takes a great deal more liberties with the four Gospels than does the Greatest Story Ever Told. It fleshes out the peripheral characters in the Bible giving them more identity than Scripture does. Barabbas as played by Harry Guardino is a guerrilla leader rather than a bandit and Rip Torn who is Judas is one of his associates who leaves Barabbas after the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nJudas&apos;s motives for betrayal are explained as an effort to force Jesus&apos;s hand. He wants Jesus to use his power of miracles to aid in the freedom fight against Rome. I think most people view Judas as doing what he did because he totally failed to understand the mission and nature of who he was following, What Ray does here is deepen that context.\n\nThere are a few scenes in their besides this part of the storyline that are not biblically found. After Jesus saves Mary Magdalene, Carmen Sevilla as Mary goes searching for him and visits with Mary his mother who is played by Siobhan McKenna. They talk for a bit, McKenna describes some of the miracles attributed to her son.\n\nJesus himself drops out of biblical dialog in a scene where he asks to visit John the Baptist. The scene is with the Centurion Lucius who was present at the massacre in Bethlehem and later would pronounce His epitaph at the cross. Ron Randell plays Lucius and his Lucius is a world weary professional soldier, sickened by the court of Herod the Great and his successor Herod Antipas. He hates having to serve these people because Rome is backing them as surrogate leaders. Randell has a key role here, he serves as a prototype for the gentiles who Jesus says his disciples must minister to.\n\nBeing inveterate star gazer I am, I do like The Greatest Story Ever Told better. But King of Kings is still a fine retelling of that selfsame story.",

In my opinion, that book goes into a lot more detail than this documentary, because it&apos;s wall-to-wall quotes and a lot more subjects are covered, but it was cool seeing a documentary that touched on some of the same topics.\n\nWhere it lacks actual extended discussion on writing rhymes, this doc makes up for it with quite a few interesting moments on screen -- most of the rappers kick a verse or two and they often go on tangents and happen upon some interesting topics even if they aren&apos;t really about the &quot;craft&quot; of rap, as the title suggests.\n\nWell worth watching if you&apos;re a hip-hop fan, and a nice companion to the &quot;How To Rap&quot; book.",

A cheap and cheerful rip-off of better sci-fi films (in particular TERMINATOR 2, with which it shares many stylistic similarities), it&apos;s made without an ounce of originality and yet plenty of enthusiasm, to the degree that it actually turns out to be entertaining to watch. Yes, it&apos;s a piece of trash through and through, but it&apos;s entertaining trash – and I&apos;ll take entertaining trash over a boring blockbuster any day of the week.\n\nThe plot is unconnected to the first film, and one again there are no cybernetic cops, although we do get low-rent action man David Bradley returning as the hero. This time around he&apos;s up against a villain clearly influenced by ROBOCOP&apos;s Clarence Boddiker, and there&apos;s an absolute ton of action thrown in along the way as he battles an army of unstoppable cyborgs. I don&apos;t know where Firstenberg got his budget, but the movie is chock full of cheesy fight scenes and endless explosions; barely a minute goes by without extras being gunned down in slow motion by the robotic army.\n\nSome aspects of the production are intensely irritating, like the endless and moronic musical score, played on an organ for the most part, which really saps life from many of the scenes. The editing is pretty dodgy too with a couple of shots transposed and most of the action filmed in a repetitive way. Bradley&apos;s acting is terrible as is that of the rest of the cast, although I did gain enjoyment from Morgan Hunter&apos;s ultra-hammy bad guy. But this is a movie for trash fans all the way.",

But my parents wanted to see &quot;Bus Stop&quot; and they didn&apos;t want to get a baby sitter for me and my three year old brother, so they dragged us along.   But they had made a mistake when reading the starting times of the films and when we got to the theater, &quot;The Last Wagon&quot;, not &quot;Bus Stop&quot; was starting.   From the moment Richard Widmark shot the first bad guy even before the opening credits and the enveloping overture, I was hooked on him, the western scenery, the action, the anthropological dramatization of Comanche vs. Apache tribal hostilities at the same time that all Native American cultures were being wiped out by encroaching white &quot;civilization&quot;, and the enthralling background music.    When the co-feature of &quot;Bus Stop&quot; concluded, I wanted to stay to see &quot;The Last Wagon&quot; again.  My parents had to drag me out."

      "reviewBody": "Abel Ferrara&apos;s &apos;The Driller Killer&apos; is generally best know for igniting the &quot;video nasty&quot; debate back in the 1980s in Britain and little else. Which is a shame because it is a fascinating low budget psychodrama. The horror or slasher tag it is usually given is quite misleading and will no doubt disappoint hard core horror fans expecting quite a different kind of movie. Sure it does eventually lead to a violent climax but it is closer to being a character study of a man driven to insanity by his squalid, and increasingly anarchic urban environment. Almost like a bargain basement &apos;Taxi Driver&apos; with some CBGBs era atmosphere thrown in. Along with Uli Lommel&apos;s little seen &apos;Blank Generation&apos; there are very few other films that successfully document the mid 70s NYC punk scene of The Ramones, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, The Cramps et al, and &apos;The Driller Killer&apos; is worth viewing for this reason alone.\n\nFerrara himself plays the lead character, tortured scumbag artist Reno. In his later, more sophisticated, and yes, better movies this role would no doubt have been played by someone like Keitel, Walken, Hopper or Gallo. Ferrara doesn&apos;t have the acting chops these guys have and so the movie suffers somewhat, but even so, his performance is crude but effective. Unknowns Carolyn Marz and Baybi Day as his girlfriend and his girlfriend&apos;s girlfriend respectively are both more than adequate, and The Roosters may be second rate but help lend some authentic punk rock feel to this underrated slice of urban nihilism. While by no means my favourite Abel Ferrara movie, this movie doesn&apos;t deserve to be dismissed. I like it."

The parents exploiting their son for money strikes into the heart a family that is so far away from the respect and courtesy of old Japanese values.\n\nAs a contradiction, Oshima rejects the classical repertoire of Ozu or Mizoguchi and creates a radical language much more to his own invention. The soundtrack unsettles, the camera movement is slow and anxious ridden and the characters push against any sort of likability. The fact that a small boy is the most morally conscious out of a cast of adult characters is especially telling. Also used are still images and colour filters, almost a surefire way to portray the inner thoughts of a young boy who can&apos;t adequately express himself. The widescreen filming allows for much detail in the scenes, a rush of intricacies flood each shot. Exquisite to look at but also plenty to think about.\n\nOshima is usually volatile in his ideas and this leads him to be a not very consistent filmmaker but when his ideas align themselves like this, there are very few who could direct better."

Though first of all a disclaimer, I have no issue with low/no budget films. Yes they have a natural disadvantage on multiple fronts as you&apos;d expect but it&apos;s not a deal breaker.\n\nAwful juvenile writing however, that is.\n\nI cannot stress to you how bad the script is, I didn&apos;t even realize until late into the film it was meant to be a comedy. It&apos;s just dialogue between our two leads and I cannot believe how pathetic, immature and absurd it all is.\n\nIt&apos;s not funny, unless you&apos;re 5. It&apos;s not a horror in any shape or form. It has absolutely no structure and brings not one single constructive thing to the table.\n\nUgly, mindless, stupid beyond words.\n\nRants\n\nI get the desire to grab a camera and play filmmaker with your friends, I really do. I understand non-existent budgets, no production values, poor quality cinematography and weak editing. What I don&apos;t get is when people with zero talent produce excrement like this, what were they thinking? Who was the demographic? Did they genuinely think this was funny? What did they aim to accomplish?\n\nBreakdown\n\nHideously ugly Dialogue is puerile beyond belief Has no redeeming features at all.",

      "name": "Run-of-the-mill Buddy movie by Walter Hill with a lot of crossfire , killings and multiple mayhem",
      "reviewBody": "2 cops, one from Soviet Union , bouncing Arnold Schwazzenegger, other from Chicago cop , wisecracking James Belushi , join forces to catch the Eastern Bloc&apos;s biggest drug czar. The hunk , unstoppable Russian arrives in Chicago , teaming up with a reluctant , unorthodox cop on the traíl of Soviet pusher , cop killer , Ed O&apos;Ross. Along the way , the Russian Arnold who barely smile in this one , walks in, demolishes the bad guys and walks out again , just some odd bruise for effect. Later on , the peculiar relationship among the outlandish cops goes on growing , including sympathetic dialog , as the cops compare firepower and the Russian policeman states : Who is Dirty Harry¿ . This main cast formed by the boxoffice actors Arnold Swazzenegger and James Belushi being well accompanied by a competent support cast as Peter Boyle as chief police , Richard Bright as a deputy , Pruitt Taylor Vince as a hotel manager , Brent Jennings as bad guy , Gina Gershow as a dance girl , Brion James as a prisoner and Larry Fishburne as a Police Inspector , among others.\n\nLots of slam-bang action , swearing , shouting , shooting , and knocking over cars and other convenient obstacles with no much sense , it claims to be the first Hollywood production to be shot in the Red Square , Moscow . But , at times , it seems too similar to Hill&apos;s previous films . There shows up the tough Arnold , no matter how different the script , producers always give him the same role .Here is much the same in any language , even when Arnie is a Soviet policeman comes to Chicago to bring home a Russian ringleader who shot his comrade copm. Here presumably Arnold takes his shirt off less than other films . Arnie growls the usual phrases and expeditive sentences, along with James Belushi as a local cop giving some passable lines in a canon of crass national jibes .This is &quot;48 hours&quot; by Walter Hill formula crosses with Gorky Park by Michael Apted .This is a surface material , moderately entertaining and contemptuous , as well as amusing enough , thanks to the loads of action and fights .At any rate, a partíal return to form for Walter Hill with Arnold playing the Soviet the way he plays all his juggernaut , only more taciturn, as usual . The most visually interest stuff happens in Moscow when Arnold takes off enemies and the thrilling final , when occurs a violent confrontation between large buses , being hugely amplified by spectacular vehícles crashes .\n\nIt contains atmospheric and evocative cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.And pounding and thrilling musical score by the prolific James Horner , though composed by synthesizer . This is a major production , well and lavishly financed by the powerful producers Maro Kassar , Andrew Vadjna from Carolco Productions . The motion picture was professionally directed by Walter Hill.The veteran craftsman Hill is a good writer , producer , filmmaker who has made a lot of films of all kinds of genres , working from late 60s , early 70s to nowadays . As he has directed action movies as Hard times , The driver , Southern comfort , The warriors , Extreme prejudice, 48 Hours , Another 48 hours , Last man standing , Johnny Handsome , Undisputed. Science fiction: Supernova . Western: Geronimo American legend, Wild Bill . Long riders . Comedy : Brewster&apos;s millions . Terror : Tales of the Crypt . Musical : Crossroads . Rating 6/10.",

For clothes, furniture, the contrast between the house of Claude Zoret and Michael, for realism of relation between painter and his protejee, for precise portrait of Lucia Zamikoff , for eulogy of dedicated friendship, for honest traits of love - to sacrifice - for beloved one, against his terrible gestures and high ingratitude.\n\nA profound beautiful film for the splendid performance of benjamin Christensen and for nice portrait of Michael proposed by Walter Slezak. Not last, for correct perspective about homosexual relations, realistic reflected in this case. And , sure, for nice portrait of Julius, the butler , by Max Auzinger.\n\nSo, just precious for message and its wise construction."

I was not sure if that would translate with a foreign film but it has exceeded my expectations. It was shot very well, the actors and child actors were wonderful and extremely well written. This film deserves the highest accolades and will be well worthy of all the award it will eventually win. I was delighted to see this film at a Nordic Film Festival and has made more of an impression on me than any foreign film ever has. I have been thinking about different parts of the movie on a daily basis since I saw it trying to analyze all the complex characters. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants a very unexpected treat!",

Álex de la Iglesia) A weak Spanish satirical comedy about an unemployed advertising executive who suffers a horrific accident in which he falls at a construction site and is pierced through the skull by a piece of iron rebar, yet remains conscious during the entire ordeal. In the process of getting help he engages the service of a publicity agent, and attempts to exploit the situation for all it&apos;s worth. The film tries to make a philosophical statement about the nature of a society that would encourage or support such self-serving behavior, but the film doesn&apos;t take it far enough. This could have really been a powerful drama or a scathing black comedy, but just came off as a lackluster effort.",

There is some solid acting and the characters are not totally unbelievable, though they appear a little like the usual all-American suspects. I definitely don&apos;t agree with the frequent criticism that the movie lacks an explanation. The lack of an explanation is the actual concept of the movie. If the movie provided one, it would be as much fun as looking at a filled-in sudoku. The viewer is given food for thought by the different explanatory approaches done by the movie characters. I liked the reference to the &quot;lost colony&quot;-case, a historical oddity concerning the unresolved vanishing of a group of early settlers in America. I agree that the ending can be understood in a way that makes it seem cheesy - I interpreted it differently and so for me it was satisfying. I don&apos;t want to give anything away so let me just say as much: In my opinion no one survives at the end, but that certainly is disputable. My rating is a solid 6, although I was tempted to give more just to lift the overall rating since imo it is undeserved.",

      "reviewBody": "Paul (Picoli) is hired by vulgarian US producer Jerry Prokosh (Palance) to rewrite a screenplay for his adaptation, which Fritz Lang (himself) insists on shooting in a hyper-stylized, mythological fashion. Paul&apos;s relationship with his trophy wife Camille disintegrates as she feels abandoned by him to Prokosh&apos;s advances, and sees him subdue himself to these great men.\n\nIt is about film-making - of course! - it is about the plight of the artist, but where it succeeds most is in the carefully examined slow destruction of Camille and Paul&apos;s marriage. Raoul Coutard&apos;s cinemascope photography, filled with lush colors, only serves to highlight how little Paul is and how out of his depth he is. He and his wife hide it in different manners: Paul by trying to assert intellectual superiority over his wiser-than-she-appears wife, therefor earning her contempt. She hides by relying on her sensuality.\n\nGodard typically references his love for film in a way that many will find pedantic, and the lush score isn&apos;t always wisely used, overwhelming and sometimes even obtrusive. But thankfully, Godard&apos;s message and cast survive the director&apos;s pseudo-intellectual short-comings. Bardot is perfectly cast as the ignorant innocent who strives to appear and be smarter than she is (even sporting a brunette whig at some point, in what is really a sad moment of self-loathing), but fails. Camille never convinces when she speaks, but the pain in those eyes is intensely real. Picoli&apos;s Paul is easier to sympathize with, as the &quot;reasonable&quot; whose every move to please anyone dooms him further. It is a cruel lesson and warning about relationships.\n\nThe film also serves a more sarcastic and amusing (and far more conscious) duel between Palance&apos;s Prokosh, superbly vulgar and dramatic, and Lang, who becomes a wise and immensely charismatic figure that stands against compromise. It is sad that this was the German master&apos;s only performance in front of the camera.\n\nLe Mépris is slow, and if you get caught too much in Goddard&apos;s referencing and hyper-stylization, it will bore you. But if you really follow these characters, you&apos;re in for a unique, edifying and sometimes unnervingly uncomfortable ride.\n\nMust be seen several times under different angles to be fully appreciated.",

Gena Rowlands is a powerhouse actor in this gutsy film about survival, courage and compassion set in the fast-paced, gritty New York City of the 70s.  The acting all-around is exceptional.  The film is riveting from beginning to end. You get swept up in Gloria&apos;s dilemma right away.  The scene where she has to decide whether to save herself and turn the kid over to his assassins is very believable as you can see and feel how desperate one would be in such a dire situation.  Another great scene is at a Penn Station coffee shop where she confronts the stalking mobsters at a nearby table.  You can hear a pin drop in that restaurant as she stands there saying, &quot;I&apos;m Gloria.  My hand is on my gun in my purse!&quot;  Yet another great scene is the crowded subway where she literally throws punches with one of the mobsters who has caught up with her.  Everyone in that graffiti-laden subway car presses against the walls trying to get away when Gloria pulls her gun.  She says as she gets off: &quot;Ya punk!  Ya Punk.  Ya let a sissy beat you, huh?  You punk!  Go ahead, punk!.&quot;  Then the subway car closes and she and the kid get away yet again. So, get lots of popcorn, turn off the phones and curl up in bed with the lights off for this one!"

Two special memories: firstly, the football coach selecting his own kin above unrelated boys who have greater talent!; secondly, the moments when Tomas looks directly into the camera (giving us a wordless message) is never over-played (the film would undoubtedly be denigrated if that were the case) - great direction!",

In contrast to today&apos;s boring slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.\n\nThis is a B movie about the making of a B movie...that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home.  Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule.  The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add &quot;realism&quot;. Unfortunately, &quot;realism&quot; is something they could have done without.\n\nJohn Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.\n\nThe horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders.  (At least there&apos;s truth in advertising.)  It&apos;s just sad that the ghoul didn&apos;t understand that there was a movie being made above him.  How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work?  Face it, you just can&apos;t go around tugging on Satan&apos;s coat and expect him to take it lying down.\n\nSterno says perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.",

      "reviewBody": "Seema (1955) is a gem from the black and white era of Bollywood. A true classic indeed. It&apos;s an idealistic movie with a strong psychological base.\n\nSeema (threshold / boundary / limit) is the story of Gauri (Nutan) who is an orphan and lives with her greedy and exploitative uncle and aunt. She only earns for them by working as a maid-servant in a household but they treat her very poorly. A criminal-minded male-babysitter Baanke (C.S. Dubey) also works in the same household and keeps on trying to make advances to Gauri. When discarded, he traps Gauri under the false charge of theft. She is released by the police on the personal guarantee of her guardians (the greedy uncle and aunt) but now they refuse to keep her with them. Being labelled as a thief, now this innocent and truthful girl does not get any job elsewhere too. Lustful people cast their eyes on her physic only. Homeless, jobless, starved and bearing the stigma of the theft that she had not done, she gets filled with anger for Baanke, she approaches him but again gets cheated by him through his sweet talks and the police catches her again. Now seeing almost the whole world against her, she loses her temper and starts behaving like an insane person. Since her guardians have refused to take her to their home, the police sends her to a charitable institution (known as Aashram) meant for the care and rehabilitation of homeless females only which is run by a benevolent person Ashok (Balraaj Saahni) with the help of a lady called Didi (Pratima Devi) who is the superintendent of the females living in the Aashram and a male assistant - Muralidhar (Sunder).\n\nGauri is not ready to live there or listen to anybody in this regard. Her insane behaviour continues resulting in the breakage of furniture, window glasses etc. and she refuses to consume any food (though she has not eaten anything for quite a period). The inmates of the Aashram as well as the people associated with the management of that are not able to understand her anguish and the cause of her stubborn and rebellious behaviour. However the in-charge of the Aashram, i.e., Ashok refuses to be judgmental towards Gauri and asserts something similar to the assertion given in the beginning of this review - &apos;Being unaware of the background / experiences of some person, you can&apos;t understand why he / she behaves the way he / she behaves; you may not be knowing the bitterness of life that he / she might have gone through&apos;. And when Gauri accepts food from the hand of a little girl and showers her affection on her, he immediately realizes that she is noble at heart and needs sympathy (as well as empathy) to recover from some trauma that she might have undergone.\n\nNow Gauri gets normal with the passage of time and by the effect of the positive environment in the Aashram but still the fire within her heart against Baanke has not been mitigated and she wants to take her revenge from him. She gets empathy and help from her inmate Putli (Shubha Khote) who has been a criminal in her past. She moves out of the Aashram one night and reaches Baanke. She beats him black and blue and thus vent her anger, stuffiness and frustration out; returning to the Aashram thereafter feeling light and relieved. However, for breaking the rule of the Aashram (going out without permission and without any escort), she gets punishment to live in seclusion for a night. Considering it an injustice (as she feels that by punishing Baanke, she has done nothing wrong), she starts behaving rebelliously again which immediately renders a message to Ashok that perhaps the theft-charge levied on her was not genuine. He traps Baanke with the help of Muralidhar and by arranging his confession, gets the stigma of being a thief washed away from Gauri&apos;s forehead. Now Gauri not only becomes absolutely normal but she also refuses to leave the Aashram and with utmost gratitude towards Ashok, keeps on working tirelessly and sincerely to meet the noble objectives of the Aashram. Ashok works very hard despite the fact that he is a heart patient. He is able to sense the tender feelings in Gauri&apos;s heart towards him but feeling that he may not live for long and getting concerned for Gauri (perhaps because he also has started loving her within his heart), he asks her to marry Muralidhar and settle down in life. Besides, he decides to move out of the city for some time so that Gauri is able to drive her thoughts away from him and marry peacefully in his absence. However it does not happen and the true love of Gauri only triumphs in the end.\n\nShankar Jaikishan have composed unforgettable gems with the help of the heart-conquering lyrics of Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. It contains Manna Dey&apos;s classic devotional song - Tu Pyar Ka Saagar Hai, Teri Ek Boond Ke Pyaase Hum on one hand and Lata&apos;s gems viz. Suno Chhoti Si Gudiya Ki Lambi Kahaani, Mann Mohana Bade Jhoothe and Baat Baat Mein Rootho Na on the other. It also contains Mohammad Rafi&apos;s impressive song - Hamen Bhi De Do Sahaara Ki Besahaare Hain. However the song which I am never able to forget even for a moment is Rafi&apos;s classic philosophical song - Kahaan Ja Raha Hai Tu Aye Jaane Waale, Andhera Hai Mann Ka Diya To Jala Le (where are you heading for O traveller; there&apos;s dark before you, hence first light up the lamp of your heart before proceeding).\n\nSeema is undoubtedly an excellent movie. A masterpiece for sure.",

      "reviewBody": "Still photographer and occasional film director David Hamilton ventures into the homevideo realm with a Japanese-French production &quot;A Summer in St. Tropez&quot;, a dreamy, impressionistic film of young girls&apos; daily life at the famed resort. Sans narration and with minimal dialog or action, pic is an okay mood piece for fanciers of Hamilton&apos;s soft-focus photography. Aside from home tv use, it could play theatrically as a short subject if trimmed by about half.\n\nUsing back-lighting and diffused light photography (pic is visually reminiscent of Hamilton&apos;s &quot;Bilitis&quot; feature right down to the casting of numerous svelte young femmes), &quot;St. Tropez&quot; features surprisingly little nudity in its languorous visuals of young women at play. Episodic treatment is ultimately a bore as we observe the girls at mealtime, swimming at sunset, out picnicking and dancing, winding up with an authentic-looking wedding processional.\n\nAbsence of dialog is a plus, alleviating the need to dub or subtitle, but there&apos;s little to rivet one&apos;s attention. Hamilton&apos;s most stylish segment, a still photo-montage suddenly cutting to live action as the lead actress wakes up everyone in the &quot;dorm&quot; was done better originally by Chris Marker in his classic sci-fi short &quot;La Jetee&quot;. Film is aided in sustaining its mood by Benoit Widemann&apos;s dreamy keyboard and strings musical score.\n\nMy review was written in September 1983 after watching the film on a Thorn-EMI videocassette."

As I was a little child I could not now about the movies but that day my mother, grandmother, my uncles wife all got together and prepared delicious foods, and watched that movie on TV. Perhabs on that day all women in Turkiye were watching that film. \n\nMavi Boncuk, a delicious movie has reference to this film. On that movie Munir Ozkul says: - Aaah Awaara (at the time he looks to Awaara&apos;s poster) I&apos;ve grown my children by selling it&apos;s tickets, played for 6 months on those days.\n\nIt is a fact that Awaara was a great success, on those days a film was playing for only a week but Awaara was in vision for 6 great months. I only remembered a scene from the film I watched when I was 6 years old, this is the scene that Raju stole a watch. Then 3 years ago I bought this film and watched with friends, my friends were very impressed with the movie, and we watched again and again.\n\nAwaara is a milestone for Turkish cinema, it is filmed again by great Turkish actor Sadri Alisik in 1966. Arabesk is stated to enter Turkiye with Awaara. Adalet Cimcoz and Ferdi Tayfur spoke Nargis and Raj Kapoor in Awaara&apos;s Turkish dubbing version and film is great with that excellent dubbing.\n\nFilms song is also sung in Turkish lyrics by Sadri Alisik and song was also a hit."

      "reviewBody": "Call me strange, but Kim Ki-Duk&apos;s THE ISLE is one of my favourite Korean movies. Not just the beautiful imagery, not just those scenes that had people fainting in the theatres, but because I empathised a lot with the characters, and the symbolism of their environment and their actions was very much in tune with my sensibilities. OK, so I&apos;m strange .\n\n Much as I enjoyed watching it, I won&apos;t try and argue that watching THE ISLE is a &apos;pleasant&apos; experience - not one to leave you with a smile, so I was prepared for something a little bit serious and grim with ADDRESS UNKNOWN.\n\n It is not a little bit serious and grim at all... it is *completely* serious and amazingly grim.\n\nKim Ki-Duk is less interested in exploring the somewhat global issues of human feelings here, but instead wants to explore the feelings of a nation - Korea, still living in the shadow of the Korean war. The characters here come across as a little apersonal (it&apos;s ok, I just invented it) because they are embodiments of the country&apos;s experience... the division, the loss of autonomy, the dehumanisation that people feel, caught up in the conflicts between North and South and between Capitalism and Communism. Obviously to suggest that this was a universal Korean experience would be unreasonable, though Kim Ki-Duk is not interested in exploring balancing factors in this particular movie. People suffer. And suffer. And suffer. And then they suffer for a while. He is relentless in his examination of the pain that he clearly feels, for himself and for his country.\n\nIt must be said that I know almost nothing about Korean history (though I am learning a lot as I type!), or of contemporary Korean society, so I don&apos;t know how common the feelings that Kim Ki Duk expresses here are, or how realistic his assessment of Korea&apos;s post war condition is. It all feels very believable, very convincing... but certainly none of the Korean people I have met are quite as utterly miserable as they must be if ADDRESS UNKNOWN were an accurate depiction of their lives.\n\nI think there is no doubt that for at least some people, and some communities, the feelings that Kim Ki Duk brings to the fore in the movie represent real feelings and real situations. But I think that it must be assumed that it is not an even-handed assessment of the situation, that he was quite certain what he wanted to say and permitted no deviation from it. In a way this is the movie&apos;s undoing... it is so relentless in its pursuit that it becomes too easy to get detached from it, to treat it as political allegory rather than a tale of human hardship. A little more warmth, a little bit of humour, maybe just one or two moments where at least one character was *slightly* happy... and I would have been much more able to bond with them, and their tragedies and miseries would have been that much more poignant as a result.\n\nA fairly small matter, and to a degree this observation may simply be an observation that I am not Korean. The movie is a very personal look at the feelings and circumstances of a nation, and having had no comparable experience myself, it is obvious that I&apos;m going to struggle to fully relate.\n\n If I couldn&apos;t empathise with the characters though, I could at least sympathise with them. The characters themselves were good characters, and the performances were mostly very good. Notable exceptions are the American soldiers in the movie, whose English dialogue and delivery is really quite embarrassingly bad  The movie is very light on dialogue - little that is important is expressed through words, because it doesn&apos;t need to be. Always a good thing in a movie.\n\nIt is the younger characters of the movie that are centre stage, those who were born years after the Korean war ended, but are still suffering its consequences. It&apos;s always refreshing to see young actors deliver mature performances, and this is one such example.\n\nTHE ISLE probably impacted me mostly because of the visuals - the beautifully photographed and haunting environment in which the movie took place. ADDRESS UNKNOWN is not nearly as pretty, which can partly be based on location, but also the fact that the style is a lot more realistic, gritty even, as opposed to THE ISLE&apos;s abstractness. It is still well filmed though.\n\n I wrote of THE ISLE after seeing it:\n\n&quot;if you want to take away the beauty of his film, you have to be willing to pay the price of the horror&quot;\n\nADDRESS UNKNOWN is a less successful movie for me because once you get past it&apos;s horror, instead of beauty you find there&apos;s just a bit more horror . OK, it&apos;s not as bad as that... but the tone is quite unremittingly bleak. I don&apos;t know whether to recommend the movie or not. I liked it, but I&apos;m not sure how many others will. Definitely not a movie to put on to take your mind off a troublesome day anyway!",

The music was fantastic and maintained a level of intrigue and surrealism that produced a sense of mythic reality and impending urgency. Anastasiya Dontsova was phenomenal as Young Alisa and Mariya Shalayeva, who played Alisa from ages 17-18 years old, was spellbinding. The many closeups of her anxious face were a delight to the beholder. Although the pacing was a little slow at times, the story moved forward with a sense of inevitability that I imagine reflects the current circumstance in Russia today. It&apos;s always wonderful to see great films still coming out of the former Soviet Union.",

Tierney couldn&apos;t have chosen a better comeback and Laughton a more fitting farewell.\n\nIt&apos;s up to the majority leader, Bob Munson (Walter Pidgeon) to get the President&apos;s (Franchot Tone) nominee for Secretary of State (Henry Fonda) confirmed, but it&apos;s not going to be easy.\n\nSenator Cooley from South Carolina (Laughton) believes that Robert Leffingwell once had Communist ties and doesn&apos;t want him confirmed, even if it means digging up marginal people (Burgess Meredith) who claim to have known Comrade Leffingwell.\n\nAn ambitious, aggressive young senator (George Grizzard) loudly wants Leffingwell approved, and he will do anything to make it happen - even if it means blackmailing the chairman of the hearing, Brig Anderson (Don Murray).\n\nThere is pressure on the President to withdraw Leffingwell, and he refuses; the President puts pressure on Anderson to get him confirmed, and, sticking to his own principles, Brig, despite a tremendous threat to his home and political position, refuses to reconvene the hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, if Leffingwell stays in and there&apos;s a tie, it will be up to the Vice President (Lew Ayres) as the President of the Senate, to break it.\n\nThis is a brilliantly done film that has you glued from the first moment to the last. It not only gives a vivid portrait of politics and how the Senate works but keeps the viewer in suspense for the entire movie.\n\nThe acting is magnificent. Franchot Tone gives a sturdy performance as a President running out of time; Lew Ayres underplays and makes sympathetic the role of the compromise Vice President; Walter Pidgeon is elegant and authoritative as the majority leader; Henry Fonda gives a straightforward, honest portrayal of a man who wants to serve his country but has to go against some of his own beliefs in order to do it.\n\nThere isn&apos;t a wrong note throughout, even down to a very young and pretty Betty White who has a tiny role as a Senator and Peter Lawford as a Jack Kennedy type. Inga Swenson is the insecure Mrs. Anderson and gives a heartbreaking performance as a loving wife who feels she has failed her husband in some fundamental way.\n\nLaughton is great, but he is given some very florid dialogue, and he rises to the occasion by hamming it up. It was an appropriate choice given the script. Gene Tierney, as a wealthy widow/hostess who sees Pidgeon on the side, looks beautiful and gives a charming performance.\n\nThe end of this movie is incredibly powerful, and the scene with the President, Vice President and Senate Majority leader Munson is one of my favorites for a special reason. In the book, the Vice President, who is terribly worried about the President&apos;s health, has an encounter with the President and then goes back to his office and expresses some emotion about the meeting.\n\nThough the scene isn&apos;t in the film, Lew Ayres obviously read the book and has the same emotional reaction, but unspoken, on the Destroyer. Unless you&apos;ve read the book, you won&apos;t pick it up, but it&apos;s an even greater scene if you have.\n\nIMDb members have posted that nothing has changed today. In politics, I&apos;m sure that is true. In films, unfortunately, things have changed.\n\nA character-driven film rich in dialogue like &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; is hard to come by. See it and revel in the film-making past and shake your head at the timeliness of the story.",

It was her father who was murdered.\n\nFor a poverty row western Santa Fe Bound is not too bad Tyler is one of those actors who does well as hero and villain, his most famous role is one of the western genre&apos;s meanest villains Luke Plummer of Stagecoach.

      "reviewBody": "As the Chinese proverb has it, a tree may grow sky high, but its leaves fall back to its roots. In Traces Of A Dragon, directors Mabel Cheung and Alex Law document how Jackie Chan re-traced his roots and those of his father, Chan Chi-Long (real name Fang Daolong) - whose story makes up the backbone of this remarkable &apos;home movie&apos;.\n\nIn 1999, having always assumed he was the only child of a cook and a housemaid, Jackie was surprised to learn that not only was he just one of numerous siblings, but also that his kung-fu fighting father had a previous life as a Shanghai gangster - then as a hit-man for statesman and Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nHis mother, meanwhile, whose failing health precipitated his father&apos;s belated confessions, had been an opium dealer known locally as the &apos;Third Sister&apos;, whose idea of fun was striding into a casino with a horse whip.\n\nThe product of a Brady Bunch-style marriage between these two extreme personalities, Jackie was separated from his parents aged eight after they emigrated to Australia, spending the next 10 years in a Peking Opera school. So his shock and bemusement as the irascible rogue relates these tales is genuine, particularly when Fang describes his narrowly-avoided decapitation by the Japanese (&quot;They cut off nine heads! The neck shrunk into the body!&quot;), accompanied by graphic stills.\n\nThe film&apos;s narrative often becomes overwhelming, as it encompasses decades of political upheaval caused by the Sino-Japanese War, World War II and the Cultural Revolution, during which entire families were torn apart. But the emotive moments as the disbelieving star comes to grips with his heritage render the historical immensely personal. This is especially true in the final scenes, as Fang hunkers down among his sons and their relatives for a long-overdue family portrait. An old man finally at peace.",

It has no theme (people who actually know something about movies knows that theme and story are totally different), is only one collection of happenings on Mexican boxer Chávez around his career... and that&apos;s all!! So is surprising that Luna, who has encourage to promote Mexican documentaries, bring to theaters a crap like this. If you are from out of Mexico, and you want to see some good documentaries, watch something about Juan Carlos Rulfo, Yordi Capo, the short films of Mexican students or else but this movie.",

Indeed,the story is simple but the films succeeds in matching romantic line, dances and comedy.Moreover,the actors are quite good and the songs are really nice.So the film gives you 100 cheerful minutes and the opportunity to learn more about the splendid culture of Latin America.",

As he becomes an over sexed young man he will need to figure out what&apos;s behind the concoction leading to all his success. He might not like what he finds...or he might...\n\nThis movie is directed by David DeCoteau (Puppetmasters III) and stars Billy Jayne (Cujo), Judy Landers (Armed and Dangerous), Olivia Barash (The Doors), Stuart Fratkin (FRIENDS), Raymond O&apos;Connor (The Rock), Linnea Quigley (Night of the Demons) and Troy Donahue (The Godfather Part II).\n\nThis definitely should have been called &quot;Teenage Sex Mutants&quot; which was the background song most scenes and the song played at the concert (the band was actually pretty good at the concert too). The dream sequences were funny and the alien special effects were hilarious. The cast is way better than you&apos;d expect, as was the casting of the female companions. The storyline was one long soft porn video till the aliens revealed themselves.\n\nThis is great for what it was but bad overall. I would score this a 5/10 and only recommend seeing it with the appropriate expectations.",

It takes you through 60 years of the life of its two main characters (Ravi and Masha) and tells the story of their unfulfilled love. The cinematography is outstanding, the acting is great, especially for Indian actors, the sets are so alive and the story telling is of a quality like you don&apos;t see it often these days. The film is slow, but in a nice way. You just need to open your heart and go with the story and it will just take you on the most amazing trip. I have seen many Indian films, but &quot;Shadows of Time&quot; is different, it gives you a glimpse of real India (opposed to film India), its colors, its faces, streets and light. The film takes place in Calcutta and it really transports the atmosphere of Calcutta from 40 years back.\n\nGreat!",

      "name": "A typically imaginative and highly idiosyncratic examination of the artist from director Derek Jarman",
      "reviewBody": "Quite simply unlike any other biographical film you will ever see, Derek Jarman&apos;s acclaimed production of Caravaggio (1986) is a lovingly constructed, highly personal cross-reference of tormented sixteenth century genius, twentieth century iconography and a somewhat satire on the shallowness of the burgeoning eighties&apos; art scene of which Jarman was very much part of. Exploring Caravaggio&apos;s life through his work, the film distinctively merges fact, fiction, legend and imagination in a bold and confident approach that will probably leave serious art enthusiasts and casual viewers outraged by the complete disregard for accurate, historical storytelling.\n\nShot with a typically avant-garde approach, director/writer Jarman doesn&apos;t so much fashion a biography of the artist, but rather, creates a personal reflection of the man using intimate characteristics that appeal to his film-making sensibilities. This makes Caravaggio more of an interpretation of the filmmaker than the artist himself; somewhat self-indulgently focusing on Caravaggio&apos;s struggle with bisexuality, perfectionism and wanton obsession; perhaps even glossing over the more intricate workings of the character, for instance, his own passion for art and his battles with the various religious and creative constraints of the period.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame some of these ideas aren&apos;t further elaborated upon, because, at its heart, Caravaggio is really an exceptional film. As I commented earlier, it&apos;s perhaps unlike any other film you will ever see; an iconoclastic vision with a cinematic imagination that knows no bounds. Caravaggio is a film in which a 16th century setting gives way to the various anachronisms of passing trains, tuxedos, motorbikes, typewriters and chic nightclub settings. It is a film in which every frame is rendered in reference to the artist&apos;s work, composed with rich, shadowy colours that bring to mind the contrast between fresh and rotting fruit, and an unrivalled interplay between sound and production design that is reminiscent in its intense savagery of two dogs angrily ripping each other to pieces.\n\nThere is no other &apos;based on fact film&apos; that has demonstrated such a wild and evocative recreation of real-life hysteria and events, with the possible exception of Peter Jackson&apos;s masterful Heavenly Creatures (1994) or even some of Jarman&apos;s subsequent projects like Edward II (1991) and Wittgenstein (1994). With a cast of now very well known faces, such as Nigel Terry, Sean Bean, Tilda Swinton, Michael Gough, Dexter Fletcher and Robbie Coltrane - not to mention some of the most beautiful photography ever committed to film - Caravaggio represents an impressive and enjoyable combination of art and cinema that is now, twenty years on, ripe for rediscovery."

      "name": "Kevin Spacey &amp; Denis Leary = Black Comedy Gold!!",
      "reviewBody": "Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary&apos;s character and he said &quot;From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation.&quot; The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it&apos;s actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town&apos;s less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other&apos;s throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I&apos;m sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary&apos;s character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and &apos;laugh out loud&apos; good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;LIMITLESS&apos;: Three Stars (Out of Five) \n\nBradley Cooper has came a long way from TV&apos;s &apos;ALIAS&apos;. Here he headlines his first major motion picture, taking over a role once filled by Shia LaBeouf (who backed out of the film after hurting his arm in an automobile accident). A film with Robert De Niro playing a supporting player! As a whole the movie is entertaining but nothing great and Cooper&apos;s leading man performance is adequate but not spectacular. I think he&apos;s better in ensemble pieces like &apos;THE HANGOVER&apos; and &apos;THE A-TEAM&apos;. The film tells the story of a down on his luck writer who takes a secret drug which enhances the level his brain is able to function at, making him &apos;super smart&apos;. It&apos;s directed by Neil Burger and written by Leslie Dixon (based on the book &apos;The Dark Fields&apos; by Alan Glynn).\n\nCooper plays Eddie Morra, a New York City writer who&apos;s recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, who has also recently been seen co-starring in &apos;SUCKER PUNCH&apos;). He&apos;s struggling to meet a deadline for a book he&apos;s been contracted to write when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law (Johnny Whitworth) who offers him a free sample of an unknown pharmaceutical drug called NZT. The drug provides him the ability to use a hundred percent of his brain&apos;s full capacity, as opposed to the supposed normal twenty percent, and makes him super confident. When he comes across a full stash of the drug he begins succeeding at everything he had always dreamed of. Then the side effects kick in and he discovers there are others after the drug as well that will stop at no cost to get a hold of it.\n\nThe movie has an interesting premise and is played out at an amusing pace but it&apos;s full of holes and moral detachment. Without giving away too much I&apos;ll just say that if you stop to think about many details in the story they don&apos;t really make sense. There&apos;s also several things the main character does in the film that are highly morally questionable yet they&apos;re portrayed as if they&apos;re heroic actions. I also think Cooper isn&apos;t quite cut out to carry a film like this and makes the character even a little less likable. With all it&apos;s flaws the movie is still somewhat interesting and intriguing and definitely entertaining. It&apos;s a mixed bag but worth the watch.\n\nWatch our review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",

      "reviewBody": "David Cronenberg&apos;s film, based on a novel adapted by its author, Patrick McGrath, is set in London in the late 1980&apos;s, and explores the effects of an infamous Conservative government policy, whereby expensive, outdated mental hospitals were streamlined and the inmates released with limited supervision, a process that was termed Care in the Community. The film focuses on Spider, an elusive mental patient, institutionalised for most of his life, now released and returned back to a halfway house in East London, the place of his childhood, to fend for himself in the outside world. \n\nThis does not look to the uninformed like a Cronenberg film, there being no teleportation, telepathic head-blowing or the like, but once viewed, the film is clearly in Cronenberg&apos;s territory. From the beginning of the 1990&apos;s, he has seemed to be searching (it seems to me at times desperately) for new subjects in which to explore his morbid fascination. This fascination concerns the consequences of illness. Illness is given outrageous forms in his earlier films, a car accident which debilitates Christopher Walken in The Dead Zone, for instance, one of its effects being morbid clairvoyance. In Spider, Cronenberg focuses on the effect of illness on the brain, with its manifestation in what we would call the real world, when scientists actually view our &apos;real&apos; world as a simulation made by our brains (and therefore our bodies). \n\nAs ever, Cronenberg, unlike other directors, does not condescend and go for the easy option, in other words making Spider a neatly disturbed, good-looking human, glamorised by his tragic sense of unreality, i.e. A Beautiful Mind. Instead, he really explores what it might be like for an intelligent man who tries to make sense of a world and past warped by mental disturbance, and questions his perception and sense of reality. Cronenberg gives Spider pathos and humanity, but never glamorises him. \n\nRalph Fiennes inhabits Spider naturally and impressively, bringing to the role his consistent qualities of commitment and intensity. The supporting cast is wonderful. Gabriel Byrne plays Spider&apos;s father with his rich sourness and Miranda Richardson, in a double role, shows why she is such a hidden, rough gem of British acting (at least to the wider world).\n\nIn Spider, Cronenberg Is Back To His Best With A Characteristically Original Film About Society and Mental Illness"

      "reviewBody": "There are those who are blessed with talent and those who are touched by genius. This thought kept going through my mind as I watched Louis Jouvet as Topaze and concluded that he definitely belongs in category 2. Pagnol was none too keen on this version directed by Louis Glasnier but I strongly believe this to be the best of the five versions, if one includes &apos;Mister Topaze&apos; of Peter Sellers of course! Pagnol himself had two tries. His first attempt in 1936 which neither I nor anybody else seems to have seen, starred Alexandre Arnaudy. I cannot imagine sitting through that having seen Arnaudy&apos;s laboured, over the top performance as &apos;Cigalon&apos; for the same director. He had another go in 1951 with one of his regular collaborators Fernandel who is simply fantastic in the part. All of Pagnol&apos;s words have been reinstated which makes the film overlong and at times tedious. Even Fernandel&apos;s well-rounded portrayal cannot prevent this version outstaying its welcome. Suzy is played by the elegant Helene Perdriere but she pales in comparison with the wondrous Edwige Feuiliere of 1933. The scenes that work best for Fernandel are those with Marcel Vallee and Pierre Larquey, both of whom reprise their roles as Muche and Tamise from Glasnier&apos;s film. Larquey especially is given a greater opportunity here to shine. Although Glasnier&apos;s film creaks a bit technically, it is played by all with an energy and verve which is irresistible. Jouvet is simply the toughest act to follow. What a pity that Glasnier never again reached such heights. Apart from the Pearl White series his only claim to fame is a worthless film(made in Hollywood naturally) called &apos;Reefer Madness&apos; about the evils of Marijuana. In my opinion it should also serve as a warning of the perils of watching terrible actors. For those interested in such trivia, both Feuilliere and Perdriere were costumed by Schiapiarelli, which just goes to prove that some things cannot be improved upon!",

It has an excellent cast of characters, who were all well developed, the film takes the time to give background and history on the characters before jumping into it.\n\nThe storyline was good too, it had plenty of twists and turns throughout keeping the viewer guessing, and managed to avoid predictability (unlike &apos;Hollywood-big-budget&apos; films) and really pulls the viewer in.\n\nThe cinematography really stands out, clever shots, great colour use in some scenes too and really brings a different kind of life to the film. Most notably for me was the alleyway beating scene, the dark plot twist/events of that scene are contrasted by the brightness and the popping colours. Definitely interesting visually as well.\n\nOverall, certainly well worth the watch.",

My subjective opinion is that if you can&apos;t make a point in 90 or 120 minutes, why even bother and 200 minutes, come on, quality before quantity. But you could probably enjoy this movie if you are interested in Croatian films in general, because this is a very specific school of film mainly based on politically funded comedies, social drama and war films.",

      "reviewBody": "Hou&apos;s latest film, I saw as part of Village Voice&apos;s Best Undistributed Films of 2001 series, feels like a mixing and modulation of his last three: a young woman&apos;s abortive but contemplative contemporary existence (GOOD MEN, GOOD WOMEN), a moment-by-moment addiction to thrill-seeking (GOODBYE SOUTH GOODBYE) and a love affair entombed in drugs (FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI) all figure into Hou&apos;s attempt to lyricize the moment we are living in -- NOW. The result is a film that seems immensely fascinated in each moment it is capturing -- luminescent bodies dancing in an underground rave; a man inhaling and exhaling smoke from a makeshift bong; the absolute wonder of one&apos;s facial imprint in an immaculately white snowbank -- until those moments lead to other moments of inescapable banality or dread.  Hou enhances this addiciton-to-the-moment with a voice-over that takes place in 2010, giving away plot points before they happen on-screen; since narrative convention no longer matters, the result is an even more intense experience of the moment tied in with an odd sensation of retrospection (no one messes around with the concept of history more than Hou).  The give-and-take of this kind of project is that not everything will succeed on a dramatic level, but the experience of this film (and I do mean *experience*) is too exquisite to be denied.  There are no less than half a dozen moments in this film, easily the most sumptuously photographed of the year, whose sheer beauty in harmonizing time and image are timeless treasures: objects and settings seem to take on a life of their own, before they are inevitably swept under the ever-moving carpet of time.",

      "reviewBody": "Between 1948 and 1960, Disney made fourteen nature documentary films, seven of them short subjects and seven of them full length and all narrated by Winston Hibler. Starting with &apos;Seal Island&apos; and ending with &apos;Jungle Cat&apos;. This series was called True Life Adventures, seen as a big fan of Disney and nature documentaries and after wanting to see some older nature documentaries. The True Life Adventures series is a more than worthwhile one and of consistently high quality (especially the short subjects) and do prefer all of them over most of the recent years DisneyNature films.\n\nAll the previous True Life Adventures short films are brilliant and among the best and most comprehensive documentaries one can find on their respective subjects. While not quite as good as them and perhaps an ever so slight letdown in comparison, &apos;The Olympic Elk&apos; is still great with many things absolutely outstanding. Actually don&apos;t know very much about elk or their life cycles, despite being a fan of nature documentaries, and found myself truly illuminated and riveted (a lot more so than expected which is not always the case with unfamiliar subjects.\n\nMy only real issue is some of the terminology used, some of it being to me out of place and outdated.\n\n&apos;The Olympic Elk&apos; is fantastic everywhere else though. It&apos;s beautifully shot in vivid colour and the scenery is completely natural and is gorgeous and unyielding in equal measure. The music is not used too much, fits well tonally and doesn&apos;t over-bear in terms of sound. Personally didn&apos;t detect any awkwardness.\n\nIt is highly informative and did find myself learning a huge amount, actually it is one of the more illuminating True Life Adventures documentaries). It is also very engaging and investable, not so familiar territory in film, television in general has been alienating at times but most times that is what makes them interesting and gives them freshness. The latter is the case with &apos;The Olympic Elk&apos;. The elk and the other animals that pop up from time to time are amazing, beautiful to watch and their personalities shine. The life cycles, their strengths and their adversities were fascinating to learn about, was handled seriously but not too much so (the target audience is clear here) and also emotionally investable.\n\nNarration writing is thoughtful and good natured, never sounding juvenile or over complicated. Winston Hibler&apos;s narration delivery has always divided those that have watched the True Life Adventures films, personally had no problem with it in all but one. Here it is good natured and even the more deadpan delivery doesn&apos;t come over as that monotone.\n\nGreat overall. 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I had heard about Fearless for a long time and was never in the right mind to see it. It&apos;s the story about how survivors of a plane crash cope with life afterwards, their neuroses, fears and personal demons. It is a quiet film, so quiet that one can barely hear the inner tremblings of the main character.\n\nHe is a survivor without fear. He has summoned up a supernatural lack of fear towards life and psychological health now that he has survived a plane accident. In times of crisis, he has the ability to block fear and to live on adrenalin alone. He has become in the eyes of the other plane passengers, a hero and an inspiration.\n\nBut even though this lack of fear is his saving grace, it is also threatening to jeopardize his life. He copes with the nightmares and emotional traumas with  the same reaction that helped him along on that fateful day. But in real life, this way to cope is unhealthy and even dangerous. One must live afraid to be a normal person. One must worry about finances and loss of love.\n\nThe film is imperfect, as any great film should be. There are slow moments and perhaps a little too much pop psychology. (But the film is as subtle as it gets). There are marvelous character touches, such as a lawyer trying to file a lawsuit who keeps apologizing for his greediness. (The film exposes the genuine dilemmas of trying to compensate victims and their families).\n\nPerhaps the most amazing scene is a reenactment of the plane crash itself. I won&apos;t give anything away about the story, but the scene is hauntingly beautiful; it shows the overwhelming force of the wind and the earth ripping apart the fusilade and all the parts of the luggage and cabin that humans normally deal with. It is a violent, horrifying scene and a horrifying memory, but for the main character, he can imagine it with the appropriate distance and  without the pain. This accident was the defining moment for his life, and after that scene, we realize how amazing it is that he and the rest of them could have survived, and how fragile their life was in the face of overwhelming force.\n\nThis story imagines a disaster and how useless it is to be afraid of a force more powerful than any individual (and that is the main character&apos;s profound insight)."

      "reviewBody": "Basically &quot;Before I Hang&quot; is very simplistic and inconspicuous thriller story, but it is almost evidently brought to a much higher level solely thanks to the always-reliable performance and natural class of the iconic Boris Karloff. I wrote it before and I&apos;ll write it forevermore in my reviews: this man was simply amazing! With is moody voice, he could narrate the content of a phone book for all I care, because I would still hang on his lips. His charm and charisma make every movie atmospheric and his grimaces when he transforms from a seemingly gentle elderly person into a cold-blooded murderer (as masterfully demonstrated a couple of times in &quot;Before I Hang&quot;) are utmost petrifying! Mr. Karloff truly was – and still is – horror personified! So, that concludes my ode to this brilliant actor, and on to the film itself. &quot;Before I Hang&quot; is actually another loose interpretation of the classic novel &quot;Les Mains d&apos;Orlac&quot; by Maurice Renard. The novel first got turned into a film in 1924 already, in the German expressionist masterpiece &quot;Orlacs Hände&quot; starring Conrad Veidt, and several more times since, including two films starring Peter Lorre (&quot;Mad Love&quot;, &quot;The Beast with Five Fingers&quot;) and another one starring Christopher Lee in 1960 (&quot;The Hands of Orlac&quot;). Although the source material isn&apos;t specifically credited here, it&apos;s clear that Renard&apos;s novel also provides the basic plot idea. The movie opens with a beautiful and long Boris Karloff plea in court. He&apos;s physician Dr. John Garth, sentenced to death by hanging because he attempted to cure a man but failed. Awaiting his execution, Dr. Garth continues his experiments with the consent of the prison director and the help of the resident doctor, and he uses himself as guinea pig when he injects the serum into his own veins. Dr. Garth&apos;s execution gets overruled after all, but he begins to notice that the serum rejuvenates him. Unfortunately, however, he used the blood of a convicted murderer to finalize his serum and this bad blood is now slowly turning him into a merciless strangler as well. Classic Karloff material, in other words, with numerous fantastic monologues and a handful of eerie moments. Short (barely 60 minutes), intense and to the point; where would (mad) science be without Boris Karloff?",

      "name": "A whole lot of fun!",
      "reviewBody": "This was neither the first nor the last film to ever explore the idea of a person out of time and the follies that ensue, but it might well be the silliest. Jean Bernard-Luc and Jacques Vilfrid go to great lengths in their screenplay to shape the most ridiculous farce that they could, from the introduction of high-strung businessman Hubert and those around him, to the thawing of the ice man and efforts to claim him, and amazingly becoming more outrageous still in the second half as preposterous accommodations go awry. The characters, dialogue, scene writing, and narrative at large are all specifically bent toward feverish energy and blustery nonsense, and from top to bottom we&apos;re treated to substantial detail to flesh out these elements. I&apos;m personally of the mind that &apos;Hibernatus&apos; doesn&apos;t make a big impression at first, possibly even feeling a tad forced, but it&apos;s well done all the while - and the second half is so strong that it unquestionably makes up for earlier relative weakness, and then some. Ultimately this is a classic that&apos;s very much worth the wait for it to build strength, equally smart and funny and well worth seeking out.\n\nFilmmaker Édouard Molinaro follows Bernard-Luc and Vilfrid&apos;s guiding ethos to the letter with direction that maintains the unfettered zip throughout all of these eighty-two minutes. Every scene buzzes with thrumming electricity, and I can only imagine that every shooting day was fun at least as much as it was work. Of course, Molinaro&apos;s task is made much easier by a terrific ensemble, as every actor fully leans into the zestful tenor of the project. Louis de Funès has the most star power, and proves why with a performance that especially makes use of his animated personality and comportment, but his co-stars handily keep up. At one point or another Claude Gensac, Bernard Alane, Michel Lonsdale, Pascal Mazzotti, Martine Kelly, Paul Préboist, and everyone else all have a moment to shine, and the high spirits they bring to the picture are a major component of its success.\n\nIt also can&apos;t be overstated how fantastic this looks in every other capacity. These are some gorgeous sets that were constructed for this, most of them in the latter half, and I&apos;d love to pour over every inch of the de Tartas home. Likewise, the costume design is plainly outstanding; between these two facets alone it sure seems like the producers &quot;spared no expense,&quot; as the saying goes. The hair and makeup is no less excellent, any stunts and effects that are employed come off swell, and Monique Isnardon&apos;s snappy editing lends in its own way to the vitality of the proceedings. The themes of composer extraordinaire Georges Delerue mostly stick to the background, but mirror the light, playful mood at all times, and Raymond Pierre Lemoigne&apos;s cinematography is splendidly sharp. Granted, all these aspects pale in comparison to the writing, and in turn the direction and acting, but suffice to say that everything comes together wonderfully well to make &apos;Hibernatus&apos; the superbly entertaining delight that it is. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d go so far as to say it&apos;s a total must-see, but if you do have the opportunity to watch, there&apos;s definitely no going wrong with this. Appropriate for all ages and recommended for all comers, this is a joyful romp that&apos;s well worth checking out!",

A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to &quot;fuck you, bastard&quot; and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject but in the Germany I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who kills Turkish children and paints them white. In order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert&apos;s lullaby but we won&apos;t see his face. \n\nI don&apos;t even believe they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are quite obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. It&apos;s probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the earliest films I recall watching on Italian TV along with a couple of Maciste efforts; all have not turned up since then, so I was glad to catch ACHILLES again even if in an English-dubbed version (and a rather muddy print at that)! Incidentally, the copy I acquired ran for a hefty 115 minutes (some missing-frames issues probably explaining the 118-minute duration listed on IMDb) – yet, on the &quot;Film.It.Tv&quot; website, its length is given as just 92?! \n\nInterestingly, the film makes for a variation on/companion piece to the superior THE Trojan HORSE from the previous year (though that one actually had an official sequel, albeit emerging a much-inferior product, in THE LAST GLORY OF TROY, also from 1962!). Although Achilles also appeared in the first of those titles, he was given his own &apos;vehicle&apos; here; curiously enough, since this was helmed by Girolami, it is worth mentioning that his more famous director son – Enzo G. Castellari – would make his own modern-day rendition of The Trojan War with the entertaining HECTOR THE MIGHTY (1972)! \n\nAnyway, muscle-man Gordon Mitchell is Achilles (demonstrating his essential lack of education by bursting into &quot;Hi-yah!&quot; yells when commanding his troops into battle rather than the more formal &quot;Forward!&quot; uttered by his peers Patrocles, Ulysses – played by &quot;Euro-Cult&quot; stalwart Piero Lulli and depicted as a greedy fellow – and Aegamemnon!). The titular rage, then, is certainly present in the hero&apos;s characteristics given his frequent outbursts but, obviously, it is a specific reference to the legendary &apos;unbeatable&apos; warrior&apos;s revenge over buddy Patrocles&apos; death when he surreptitiously dons Achilles&apos; armor to face the enemy champion Hector; ironically, though much is made of the protagonist&apos;s own death occurring soon after that of Hector&apos;s, the film cuts abruptly following the latter&apos;s demise! \n\nThe film is certainly above-average for the genre but, as I said, still some way behind THE Trojan HORSE (for the record, this had starred Mitchell&apos;s rival in the field Steve Reeves) which, by largely eschewing the essentially low-brow nature of this one, had proved among the more literate peplums out there...",

      "name": "Dolph&apos;s Commanding Performance! (tee-hee).",
      "reviewBody": "Command Performance delivers! It&apos;s a well made, well paced action flick. Like Mechanik, it&apos;s better than a lot of the theatrically released rubbish of it&apos;s year. I&apos;ve seen too many horrendous action flicks at the cinemas this year, that rely purely on big budgets, but have nothing else, no effort, no integrity. Like Fast and Furious, Wolverine, Terminator 4. There&apos;s a concerted effort here to do something good, that&apos;s not only fun, tense, but has a bit of drama thrown in as well. CP is an action fans film. It&apos;s 80&apos;s style action gold. It kicks ass! \n\nDolph stars as Joe, former bad ass biker, with a shady past, who&apos;s since turned drummer. The film opens on a rock concert in which Joe is playing in the band backing up star turn Venus (Melissa Smith), who&apos;s pretty much a Britney clone. The Russian president and American ambassador are in attendance, meaning that naturally, terrorists will come and start shooting, and hold Presi, hostage. Joe is the reluctant hero, who teams up with an FSB agent to try and bring Kasov (Dave Legano) down. We know from then on what&apos;ll happen. Dolph is gonna open a big old can of whoop-ass, and make the terrorists drink it down. Much like the Defender, D&apos;s first directing gig, once the terrorists show up, the pace never really lets up. And the film has scatterings of action until the finale. Joe himself is a different character to what Dolph normally plays. He&apos;s not straight laced. He&apos;s not driven by revenge, and he&apos;s not always been on the right side of the law.\n\nThe action itself is good. It&apos;s simple put it punches. It&apos;s tightly edited, giving it a good pace, and when someone gets shot or killed in close combat, there&apos;s a good delivery of blood to show that they ain&apos;t gonna be getting back up. The surroundings are tight, claustrophobic, making the action quick, rough, frantic. When Dolph takes someone on in a fight, he goes in fast and hard, using any weapons he can at hands. Dolph&apos;s gone for pretty grounded action. Everything needs a base in reality. Joe&apos;s tough, he can kick ass, but he kicks ass like a biker, so D doesn&apos;t whip out the martial arts moves. And his showdown with Dave Legano, is very much like the end fight in Men Of War. It&apos;s down and dirty. The only thing that lets this down, is the budget. After all, this is a Die Hard formula, and it lacks the one big set piece, or a good money shot stunt. Think Bruce jumping off the Nakatomi plaza, or Seagal jumping off a boat in Under Siege. \n\nThe film looks great. Dolph and his DP Marc Windon, have gone for a Bourne/docu kind of vibe. Once the action kicks in, the pace of cutting picks up as well. It gives everything a sense of kinetic energy, without resorting to mindless shaky cam. But more-so, the energy helps hide the small budget. Windon&apos;s lighting is naturalistically stylised I supposed you could say. He was going for part Bay, part music vid, part Bourne, and it works. It certainly enhances the production value of the film. As for Dolph, his direction gets better every film. The opening of the film really establishes the style of it brilliantly. It&apos;s well shot, and very well edited by veteran cutsman, Peter Hollywood (Adventures of Baron Von Munchhausen, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). Most importantly, he&apos;s got a good sense of cutting action. \n\nDolph gives a good performance as Joe. He&apos;s laid back, cool, and a bit of a kid at heart. But he&apos;s got a bad streak in him, and he has to bring his dark side out when it comes to kicking some A-holes. I worry sometimes about Dolph directing himself, because he&apos;s not got the outside perspective on his performance. As Dolph&apos;s FSB tag along Mikhail, Zahary Baharov is good. It&apos;s an important role that demands not sucking, and Baharov is far from sucking. Melissa Smith does okay. She&apos;s not got much of a role at all. As is typical of action flicks, she&apos;s got a pretty wafer thin female role. There&apos;s little chemistry between Dolph and Smith, if only because the coupling looks pretty funny on screen, more than anything else. Lundgren the 2nd, Dolph&apos;s daughter Ida, also stars, and for her screen debut, at 12 years old, does pretty well. The biggest worry was also the bad guy. Die Hard formula flicks live or die by the bad guy. I worried that Legano could bring down the film single handed, but he&apos;s actually pretty good. In fact he&apos;s one of the best DL villains in a long time. He gives his role plenty of intensity. He&apos;s a different villain to Gruber (Die Hard), or Stranix (Under Siege), driven by a different goal. He doesn&apos;t wallow in smug, he just gets on with it. \n\nOverall though, this does not disappoint. It delivers what you want in an action film. It&apos;s well made too. The film probably needs a bit more humour in it, though there are plenty of one-liners and sight gags, but could do with a bit more. All the scenes are well done, bar one, which features the three young women of the film. It briefly halts the film, and the dialogue is terrible. But it&apos;s the only scene in the film that isn&apos;t at least competently done. Mercifully it&apos;s short, and then returns back to the D-man. Still, CP is the best DTV actioner of the year by far, and one of the better action films in general. It&apos;s just about on a par with The Mechanik. ****",

And that&apos;s not unusual. As I write, even the more well-known of the East European directors like Andrzej Wajda, Krzystof Zanussi have so little distribution. So no wonder others are relatively unheard of. Among the East Germans like Konrad Wolf (director of this one), I think Frank Beyer has one on DVD (Jakob the liar - that too probably after the success of its English remake), and Wolfgang Staudte has one with his 1946 masterpiece - The murderers are among us. Sorry I spoke so little about the film itself, but it&apos;s so frustrating that European arthouse is so much subordinated to Hollywood."

      "reviewBody": "Not everyone gets the just of this movie but for those that do it is a laugh riot!! Stallone is hysterical as the animated Cosmos Carboni who is incessantly trying to make an easy buck with random scams. Armand Assante plays Lenny, Cosmos&apos; older brother and voice of reason for the Carboni Boys. Finally, there is the younger brother Vick who can haul 300lbs of ice up 15 flights of stairs without blowing his breakfast but has the IQ of a gnat. So many scenes are gut busters in this movie and I don&apos;t want to give them away but a few of my favorites include: Stallone waking up hungover to discover a plate full of roaches on his previous night&apos;s dinner. He proceeds to take aim on the plate with his Louisville Slugger and shatters it along with the roaches with his brother and pet bird looking on. The same day he is out in the streets freezing with a stolen concierge outfit on, holding a monkey chained to a table and chanting &quot;see the dancing monkey!&quot; This is his latest money making scheme after Vick won the monkey in a previous night&apos;s arm wrestling match. Anyway, it&apos;s crude and low brow humor, but that is what makes this film a great Friday night viewing among good buddies."

      "reviewBody": "The story is one that is very fanciful and enjoyable. Two incongruous friends, Tommy and Jeff (Gene Kelly and Van Johnson) are hunting in Scotland when they come upon a town not on any map. Brigadoon is a lovely village but it soon becomes obvious it&apos;s a town out of time. Actually, it&apos;s a magical town that is stuck in the 18th century and it appears and then disappears every 100 years--which is a serious problem as Tommy has fallen in love with one of the residents (Cyd Charisse).\n\nI liked this film quite a bit, though it did have two flaws. The sound stage was too often an obvious sound stage--with obviously painted mountains as a backdrop. Also, I think it might have benefited if they&apos;d made Jeff less of a completely cynical jerk. It was odd seeing a nice-guy actor like Van Johnson playing a nasty little alcoholic and they part could have been better without the crabby aspects of the character. However, the music is lovely, the story sweet and there is still a lot to admire in this film.\n\nI happened to watch the 1966 made for TV version of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; a week ago--and I enjoyed it enough that I sought out the original theatrical version from 1954. Both, naturally, are very similar though there are a few differences. First, because Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse were in this Hollywood production, naturally there would be more dancing than singing. Second, oddly, the story of how Brigadoon came to be was changed for the 1954 version. I have no idea why. And, finally, the 1954 version was made to look like a typical Hollywood production that was, as I mentioned above, made in a sound stage--and the 1966 version had a few actual outdoor scenes and much of the rest looked like it was on a theater stage. Both are very watchable, though I prefer the 1954 film. If you would like to see the 1966 version (starring Robert Goulet), it is available to watch free at archive.org.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t admit this to too many people, but the single most significant historic event I have ever &quot;witnessed,&quot; was watching the first lunar landing as it happened, on television, as a ten year old kid. Okay, maybe there was a thirteen-second delay, but I was right there with those guys-- my heart pounding, skipping a beat every time Uncle Walter (a.k.a. Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America) interjected his incomparably eloquent journalistic commentary. But even Cronkite couldn&apos;t suppress his awe as mankind&apos;s greatest achievement unfolded before our eyes.\n\nThe documentary, &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon,&quot; directed by David Sington, and presented by Ron Howard (who partnered with ThinkFilm to help usher the project to completion), is not only a romantic, dramatic, suspense-filled fantasy to behold, it grips you with deep emotion and vests you with our heroes through every sequence of their quest. And it&apos;s all real.\n\nWithout a single frame of CGI or simulation, the filmmakers compiled astounding, never-before seen footage with inserts of intimate confessions by some of the remaining Apollo crew members who took part in the nine moon landings. &quot;Shadow&quot; shows just part of how the work of 400,000 scientists and engineers came together to make President Kennedy&apos;s dream of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade, a reality. These are parts worth seeing.\n\n&quot;The extraterrestrial film footage, shot by the astronauts themselves, has been brought out of storage only a handful of times since the sixties and seventies,&quot; Chris Riley, the film&apos;s co-producer explains. Considering that there may not be any more footage shot on or from the moon by an actual human, again in our lifetime, this film is very precious indeed. \n\n&quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; effectively evokes that brief time in late-20th century America when we thought that the government was doing something right. This documentary puts a human face-- and soul-- into those bulky space suits, and let&apos;s us know what it was really like to be on those harrowing missions.\n\nCommand module pilot Michael Collins admits to having being excited, but not fearful. At times, mostly worried-- that all the machinery would work as planned. The documentary reveals a few of those times the machines didn&apos;t, or almost didn&apos;t work. And startlingly, how much &quot;luck&quot; played a part in the operations. &quot;Shadow&quot; nearly gives us a first-person experience of how a body feels, what the physical sensations of being shaken, slammed, and thrust-- first off the ground, then through the atmosphere, finally into the eerie calm and quiet of space. The men talk of how they felt a fool&apos;s complacency, if only for a second, after a rocket stage would break away and fall to earth, until anticipation of the next stage&apos;s violent expulsion reminded them that it too, would detach as planned, or explode killing them all. It makes the Space Mountain ride at DisneyWorld sound like a massage. \n\nAlthough Neil Armstrong, known to be somewhat of a recluse, does not make an appearance, he is certainly there in spirit. His fellow crew members make it known they felt he was the right choice for the first man out. That he was preternaturally calm under pressure, they concur. Recollecting how Armstrong delivered those poignant first words as he descended the steps of the LEM, and how it might have been more tempting for them to simply yell, &quot;Whoopee! I did it!&quot; But Buzz Aldrin asserts that he also holds a record for a lunar first. In one of the many hilarious moments in the film, his feat is captured on video as proof. \n\nMost of the men who went on the Apollo moon missions tell in this film, of the moment while in space, viewing the galaxy from a perspective very few of us will ever see, they experienced the profound realization of their own insignificance, while comforted with a certainty of infinite connectivity with the very stuff of the universe. Contrast that with the &quot;hero&apos;s parades&quot; and instant celebrity into which they were violently thrust upon return to terra firma. Additionally, some of the astronauts confess the guilt they felt, knowing that many of the pilots and friends they had trained and served with, were being &quot;shot at, shot down, and were fighting for their country&quot; in Viet Nam.\n\nSome might have viewed America&apos;s race to the moon was little more than a diversion, cleverly orchestrated by government propagandists, from the colossal turmoil of the times. Others, saw it as a symbol of hope-- that there was something greater beyond our mere earthly squabbles.\n\nWatching this film reminded me of what America is capable-- how much can be accomplished in the interest of science, ecology, or the most human of natures, curiosity-- not to be underrated. Present and future resources, research, and funding if thoughtfully channeled, just might be able to find alternate sources of energy, cure cancer, and save the planet from ecological disaster.\n\nPresident Kennedy foresaw that the way out of the Post-War confusion and the Cold War paranoia, was to coach us back to the top of our game. Just a few years before what would eventually become the debacle of Viet Nam, this was perhaps one of the last times America truly was champion of the world. Getting to the moon made us feel like winners. We were proud. I still am.",

Dropped at the curb to enjoy Quarter Saturday at the Movies.It left me so traumatized that I was sitting in the lobby when my mother came, uncharacteristically silent. I had spent most of the time after the &quot;binocular&quot; murder, trembling alone with the thought, &quot; What grown-up dreamed this stuff up for a child to watch? What are grown-ups really like?&quot; I knew some of them didn&apos;t care what they exposed kids to to make a quarter! I remember trudging to the lobby as if in a fugue state, afraid to turn my back on that abomination. \n\nI know there are folks who love this genre, and as long as they are grown-ups, they can do the backstroke in ketchup blood and wallow in sadism. Free country. But this movie gave me nightmares into adulthood. It&apos;s probably still lurking in my psyche today. It is why I know that children must be sheltered from material adults can handle. \n\nI guess it was effectively gruesome and twisted for the fans of the genre.",

The cop and robbers angle is an afterthought, since it&apos;s the characters that make this movie.\n\nAn effectively sympathetic drama that is nevertheless buoyed by some sudden violence between the cops and the bad guys.

      "reviewBody": "Forgiveness or Revenge: When faced with the criminal destroying everything you stand for, which path would you choose? What leads to spiritual enlightenment, following a preacher formally educated in a religious discipline, or a peek into a heart filled with childlike innocence. Can a human truly be classified as being God or Devil, or are both entities inside each of us, and only the circumstances dictate who manifests outside? With a biblically inspired tale set in the backdrop of the lives of Christian fishermen in Southern Tamil Nadu, these are some of the questions director Mani Ratnam seems to be asking.\n\nWhile the ideas of sin, redemption, revenge, forgiveness in cinema have been around since the beginning of cinema itself, the choice of the sea as a backdrop allows the director to use the various moods of Mother Nature to elevate the emotions in the depicted events, and credit, in this regard, is due to the cinematographer, Rajiv Menon. For a movie with seemingly lofty intentions, the actors do not disappoint. Arvind Swamy as the pragmatic priest who uses carrots and sticks to straighten a boy with an adverse past, Gautham as the enigmatic young hero in constant struggle to grapple with his place in the society around him, Thulasi the young convent girl who refuses to grow up, and Arjun, the man who made a deal with the Devil, and would stop at nothing to get ahead, all of them play their characters convincingly. The disappointments in the movie are the under utilization of some songs in the excellent soundtrack, and the final showdown which, although shot splendidly, could have packed a stronger emotional punch, either through better dialogue or by tweaking the storyline. Part of this could have also been an outcome of editing, and one hopes that an uncut version of the movie releases on DVD at some point that better explains these problems.\n\nFollowing Thalapathy and Raavan, this is the director&apos;s third venture to be inspired by a religious epic. While the other two movies were more direct retelling of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, Kadal is not quite a reinterpretation of an epic, but characters and events were certainly inspired by the stories from the Christian faith (the betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection). Is it mere coincidence that the hero, born as a child to a woman named Mary, and constantly referred to as God&apos;s son in the movie, sported longish hair, mustache and beard on his thin visage almost reminding us of the Biblical son of God. Of course, if indeed the purpose was make a movie inspired by the story of Christ, then unlike Raavan and Thalapathy, why is religion an explicit element in this movie. Perhaps, since the question posed is that of choosing a path for life, a religious backdrop is inevitable. In a tale about forgiveness, Christianity may have provided the ideal landscape.\n\nDirector Mani Ratnam, it appears, has indeed traveled a far distance from his evergreen hits such as Mouna Ragam, Roja, Anjali, where the movie takes you through an emotional journey without necessarily asking you to stop and think about what you just saw. Movies such as Raavan and Kadal have through their sub-textual intent made us question our premises about their stories and possibly, our own.",

      "reviewBody": "Vincent Price&apos;s follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter – albeit resourceful – showman. Though a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?), this offers more than enough Grand Guignol-type thrills and overall camp value (Price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating &apos;missing&apos; star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own two feet. Incidentally, director Brahm&apos;s involvement here proves no mere coincidence – since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles (both starring Laird Cregar) he had previously helmed i.e. THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young leads are played by Mary Murphy (as Price&apos;s ingénue assistant) and Patrick O&apos;Neal (as her police detective boyfriend – curiously enough, he would himself take the lead in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one). An interesting sideline here is the latter&apos;s adoption of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about Price&apos;s downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run! Watching the star in a made-to-measure role, the film emerges a good deal of fun – particularly at a compact 73 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "Linda Brewster (Tawny Kitaen) makes two mistakes when she throws her big party. MISTAKE #1- she invites her morose, ex-boyfriend, Brandon (Stephen &quot;Patch&quot; Nichols) to the bash. MISTAKE #2- When someone breaks out the novelty device of the title, Linda allows it, rather than tossing it in the fireplace and praying for forgiveness. Worse yet, she delves deeper into deviltry, consulting the WITCHBOARD for advice.\n\nSoon, Linda is plagued by nightmares, and begins yelling obscenities like nobody&apos;s business! Supernatural shenanigans quickly unfold, resulting in grisly, &quot;accidental&quot; deaths. Not surprisingly, Linda&apos;s current boyfriend, Jim (Todd Allen) thinks she&apos;s losing her mind. When the world&apos;s goofiest medium (Kathleen Wilhoite) is called in, all bets are off!\n\nOne of the more memorable mid-to-late 1980&apos;s horror films, it was Ms. Kitaen&apos;s big star vehicle. Fairly good at being overwrought, she screams and panics her way through most of her scenes, while her boyfriends worry about her. Their ensuing bromance will be tested to its core.\n\nAlmost a character in itself, Linda&apos;s pile of red hair soars whenever she&apos;s tossed around by the peevish ghost! No, this movie isn&apos;t overly frightening, but it is still enjoyable after all these years. Especially, the hair-flailing finale!\n\nP.S.- Indeed, there is a shower scene, and yes, Ms. Kitaen does don her birthday suit... while screaming a lot!..."

      "reviewBody": "I saw &quot;Turn Right by the Yellow God&quot; twice.  Once as a sneak preview at the Copenhagen International Film Festival and last week in the movie theatre. I plainly love this film.  The story is unique and original - and most of all free of the banalities that one might expect from a story about fathers and sons, estrangement and (misdirected)human pride.\n\n Briefly, the story concerns Philip, a successful architect (Peter Gantzler, whom we fondly remember from &quot;Italian for Beginners&quot;) who is estranged from his father with whom he had no communication with for 25 years.  He is further estranged from his wife who is at an ashram in India and has a strained relationship with his 18 year old son, David.  Upon learning of his father&apos;s death, Philip is overcome by strange compulsion to attend the funeral away from Copenhagen. During the funeral Philip runs into Karl (the magnificent Jesper Klein) who claims to have known Philip&apos;s father well. Realizing the futility of the long estrangement Philip, on a whim, invites Karl to come to Copenhagen and be his guest for some time, hoping that in the process he&apos;d learn something about his father.  From there the story takes many twists and turns as David returns to the house, one of Karl&apos;s old flames (Judy Gringer) arrives as well, and the household plunges into a veritable chaos.\n\n `Turn Right by the Yellow Dog&apos; is not free of faults.  I did not particularly like the score, and Judy Gringer&apos;s role should have been expanded on.  But despite the omission, `Yellow Dog&apos; is one of those rare films that actually touches and comments very wisely on the family and human conditions without being trite.  I was touched and moved, and can&apos;t wait to own the DVD when it is released.",

      "reviewBody": "Prolific director Jess Franco made a lot of crap during his career, but in his filmography there are several hidden gems - and Faceless is definitely one of them! True to Franco&apos;s style, the film is trashy and sleazy throughout, but it&apos;s the eighties atmosphere that sets this film apart from the majority of Franco&apos;s opus, as Faceless takes in trashy eighties pop and themes of vanity, which ensure that the film is always obviously a product of the eighties. The story has been used many times before - mostly in films made in the sixties; films such as Eyes Without a Face, Circus of Horrors and Franco&apos;s own The Awful Dr Orloff (which gets a nod in this film), but never before has this sort of been given as much blood, gore and nudity as it gets in Faceless. The film begins with the disappearance of a model named Barbara Hallen. Her father hires a private detective to find her, and while on her trail in Paris; the detective eventually makes his way to a private clinic where strange experiments have been going on. The not so good doctor has a woman whose face he wants to fix - and he&apos;s using skin from young women to do it! \n\nThe film&apos;s biggest plus point has to go to the scenes of gore! Sequences that see things such as a needle in the eye, a drill through the skull, a chainsaw decapitation and numerous surgery sequences are well done, and bound to delight gore fans. The cast is also a standout element of the film, as Franco recasts Howard Vernon in the role of Dr Orloff, and we&apos;ve also got performances from the likes of Telly Savalas, Anton Diffring and Jean Rollin&apos;s beautiful frequent collaborator, Brigitte Lahaie. The story isn&apos;t massively strong, but it&apos;s not bad either as Franco strings a few different threads together and that, along with the gore and skin going on throughout, tends to ensure that the film is always interesting. The music that Franco has chosen is good in that it suits the style and feel of the film, but Franco uses the central song a bit too often, and it starts to grate after a while. Overall, Faceless might not do much for fans of serious films, or for those that dislike Jess Franco in general; but Faceless is one of the better films that the director has worked on, and comes recommended to the right sort of people.",

He does not realize his agent (Aldo Maccione) and acting coach (Julien Guiomar) are only manipulating him to further their own careers. A great deal of European stars have small parts or cameo&apos;s, some parodying themselves. Edwige Fenech is the most prominent of these, playing a starlet willing to sleep with anyone to get where and what she wants.\n\nWhile stuck in an elevator for what seems like forever, a famous movie producer (Michel Galabru) offers Antonio a part in a Hollywood production. It is ironic that the footage shot in L.A. looks like it was all filmed on one day of driving around town. Hollywood turns out to be the final crippling blow for Antonio when he is forced to become a stuntman.\n\nThis cynical look at the movie business is just a collection of unrelated comic scenes. In the end, both Antonio and the film have still achieved nothing. His moronic character does not exactly conjure up a lot of sympathy either. At least Edwige Fenech is always worth a look, earning the film another point (though she only appears sporadically).\n\n5 out of 10",

But neither the eye operation nor the job go as planned. Nia Peeples gives an enjoyable performance as the optometrist who gets involved in the action and begins to like it....and you won&apos;t believe she was 45 when she made this, she puts many women 10 years younger than her to shame. Plus, the image of her with a gun is painting-on-the-wall worthy. The two most interesting things about &quot;Connor&apos;s War&quot; are the gimmicks the director uses to depict Connor&apos;s &quot;night vision&quot; as it goes in and out, and the morally vague world the screenwriter creates, where the characters played by Garwin Sanford and Blu Mankuma may be at war with each other, but they show a similar disrespect for human life. Yes, there isn&apos;t really much that&apos;s new in this film, but it&apos;s done well enough and I don&apos;t regret watching it. (**1/2)",

The biggest problem is that there are so many cliffhanger moments that you really can&apos;t take the film too seriously. The worst thing is that none of the characters are all that likable so you have a hard time wanting to see them live. Be forewarned that there are a lot of real animals slaughtered (and eaten) on screen."

I had a great time watching it in the theater and I plan to see it again in the future. If you were weary about seeing this movie, I recommend it. It&apos;s not as gross and disturbing as it looks. The grossest scene is where Norm&apos;s character is attacked by a small dog (named &quot;Muffin&quot;) and his blood sprays all over the room. Some gross stuff happens in the morgue, but it&apos;s not as graphic as the Muffin scene. The entire cast is on top of their game in this movie and it doesn&apos;t disappoint. If you like Norm Macdonald, Dave Chappelle, Danny DeVito, or anybody else in the cast, then you&apos;ll definitely enjoy &quot;Screwed&quot;!"

      "reviewBody": "Spiders (2013) \n\n* 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nAnother &quot;big monster&quot; movie with this one here centering on a Russian space station that crashes into the subway system of New York City. At first the &quot;issue&quot; seems to be clearing itself up but soon giant spiders are on a killing spree. SPIDERS somehow managed to get a theatrical release, which is kinda strange considering this really isn&apos;t any better than the type of monster pictures that show up on SyFy week after week. This is certainly far from a horrible film but I honestly couldn&apos;t recommend it over countless other low-budget &quot;B&quot; movies that I&apos;ve seen here the past decade. At least with the movies that you see on SyFy they are cheap, fun and offer up some sort of badness. SPIDERS, on the other hand, really isn&apos;t all that fun. The title of the movie should have been &quot;Walk Around and Talk&quot; because that&apos;s pretty much what happens throughout the running time. We&apos;re introduced to our &quot;heroes&quot; who pretty much argue with one another as they walk through the streets of New York seeing all the destruction. As for the spiders, the effects are slightly better than what you&apos;d see on SyFy but at the same time they&apos;re still pretty cheap and aren&apos;t very convincing. The look of the spiders aren&apos;t too bad as they&apos;re at least mildly entertaining. Of course, they were in 3D in the movie theater so watching at home I wasn&apos;t able to judge that. The death scenes in the film are mostly forgettable and there&apos;s just nothing special to any of them. The PG-13 rating certainly holds the film back from being &quot;more&quot; and, again, the stuff you see on SyFy is better."

I had never heard about it but my attention was drown by the appealing list of the involved artists, all protagonists of the best examples of the Italian classic moviemaking: Monicelli, Comencini, Age, Scarpelli, Manfredi, Volonte&apos;, Adorf to mention only the main ones. I did not expect much from it when i pushed the &quot;play&quot; button of my TV remote control and I suspected that my ignorance about the very existence of this movie was a clear evidence of some major failings in it.\n\nRarely I had been so wrong in prejudging a movie! I thoroughly enjoyed the superb acting (starting with Manfredi, in one of his first - and quite satisfactory - major roles), the spotless and engaging script, the brisk albeit quite resourceful direction, the artistic black and white photography, the subtle soundtrack. The movie is a canny combination of drama and comedy. Lots of hilarious situations and witty jokes - but in the context of a very sad and sometimes poignant story of a jail escape attempt conceived by a bunch of two bit petty criminals. Among them, a simpleton (Manfredi&apos;s role) who is unwillingly caught into the escape plot and ends up paying a huge price.\n\n90 minutes of pure artistry. One can wonder - given the serious overall tone of the movie - if it can be considered part of the canon of the celebrated &quot;commedia all&apos;italiana&quot;, but who cares about categorizing? Enjoy this movie anyway: maybe it is the very Janus-like nature if this unexpected masterpiece which is part of its irresistible charm and interest.",

Here is a combination between puppets and live action people and it works well, since the puppet here is a non moving toy with life induced from children&apos;s imagination. That has worked before and it works this time, too, being the age before the introduction of digital effects changed filmmaking radically. This production is mostly for younger kids but the presentation is interesting enough to catch the attention of grownups as well, and the film spun a sequel however not up to the standard of the first film. Jørgen Vestergaard also made some documentary films, particularly one about the prolific Danish-Dutch Oscar winning film animator Børge Ring.",

      "reviewBody": "Gorin Visnic pulled this movie off well. I was unsure of his acting outside of ER. The movie has a cool plot, and there a few leaps we must make with character actions and general believability, but how many supernatural movies don&apos;t require such. I&apos;m not saying call the Academy, but as mentioned this is a &apos;sleeper&apos; movie that will entertain you if you enjoy the supernatural thriller genre. I was glad I rented it, and I&apos;m a bit picky in general. It isn&apos;t the fastest paced film as it develops slowly, but you&apos;ll probably like it if you like Gorin. The female lead is credible as well, as is Gorin&apos;s wife in the film. The Supernatural element of the movie was a new one to me, which is further reason I&apos;m taking the time to write this, as I thank those who have done such for me, as it drives a fair amount of my &apos;tweener&apos; rentals. Ciao!",

      "reviewBody": "If we even think it&apos;s worth our time to invest in this &quot;fairy tale,&quot; then we can outline the criteria by which we judge the entire thing. Here are the points: Was making a sequel really necessary? After watching it, it&apos;s clear that it wasn&apos;t. The end result is the tarnishing of the original work from the 80s. Where do we even begin? Is there anything good to consider at all? The visual effects seem like they just threw in everything they had. The editing is poorly done and the cuts are distracting. In terms of the story and its structure, it&apos;s probably just a joke. Things happen in the plot as if someone randomly decided to include them, without any real purpose. The excuse that it&apos;s a fairy tale doesn&apos;t even hold up here. The characters&apos; motivations, if they even exist, are basic and weak. The acting performances are below average and often downright terrible and annoying. The dubbing and that sound are the epitome of how bad Slovak dubbing can be. I don&apos;t want to undermine the efforts and time of everyone involved, but wasn&apos;t there anyone who could have told the director that this is a waste? Or is there no way to reach out to people in Slovakia? The question is, how was it possible to make a film like the first part 40 years ago, without the resources ? What we are doing today? It&apos;s something to ponder, but it&apos;s unlikely the director will ever consider it.",

      "reviewBody": "A drama centered on an orphaned Palestinian girl (Freida Pinto) growing up in the wake of Arab-Israeli war who finds herself drawn into the conflict.\n\nYou might wonder: Freida Pinto is Indian, so why was she cast as Palestinian? -- Some critics took exception to this, or the idea that she is too beautiful to play an ordinary girl. Are ordinary girls not allowed to be beautiful? And while her Indian heritage may seem out of place, I think this should be overlooked in light of the fact she is a tremendous actress and sold the character well.\n\nWhat is so great about this film is that the politics are not the issue. The life of a young girl is. This is a film that shows the humanity of the Palestinians -- the DVD cover asks if Miral has the &quot;face of a terrorist&quot;. After seeing the film, you have to say no. While the story covers a wide swath of history, from 1947 to the 1993 Oslo agreement, the politics are not the problem.\n\nSchnabel tells me many of the critics were negative, and I do see some complaints that the editing was choppy, or the bizarre remark that Schnabel does not know how to direct women. Presumably many critics took exception to the positive portrayal of the Palestinians and the negative portrayal of the Israelis.\n\nIn fact, though, this is how one might view the film if looking for a certain angle. The Israelis are presented negatively, yes, but not inaccurately. But the Palestinians are not really presented positively -- just as human beings. There is still a father telling her daughter not to get mixed up with the PLO, and one scene has a stepfather raping his wife&apos;s daughter. That can hardly be seen as being positive (though the real point here is that people should be judged as individuals, not as members of a group).\n\nThe cast is all excellent, with plenty of Arab flavor. We have Willem Dafoe (a native of my city, Appleton) and Vanessa Redgrave for the &quot;white&quot; aspect. And then Alexander Siddig, probably best known as Bashir from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, somewhere in-between (Siddig was born in Sudan, but was educated in London).\n\nThe film is PG-13, making it less raw but more accessible to audiences. This may have toned down the realism a bit, but it in no way compromised the emotional outreach that was a steady undercurrent.\n\nGeoffrey Macnab calls the film &quot;courageous and groundbreaking&quot;, while Mike Goodridge calls it &quot;sincere and thought-provoking&quot;. Both are correct. The more unusual comment comes from Claudia Puig, who says, &quot;Schnabel puts his unmistakable dreamlike stamp on the film.&quot; Now, Schnabel is first and foremost a painter, so his goal is art. But to call this film &quot;dreamlike&quot; just seems off. This struck me as pure realism all the way. But who am I to judge? \n\nAnyway, great film, and one that will be sure to spark discussion regardless of which side (if any) you stand on in the ongoing Middle East debate."

      "reviewBody": "In 1863, in Fairhope, Alabama, a group of former Confederate soldiers robbers a commerce bank and kills many clients and employees. While escaping to Mexico, they spend the night in an isolated house that belonged to a dead soldier of their company. When weird events happen in the stormy night, they find that the dwellers are demons.\n\n&quot;Dead Birds&quot; is a reasonable low-paced horror movie. The watchable and forgettable story has good special effects and entertains, without being special. Indicated for a rainy weekend only. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Casa dos Pássaros Mortos&quot; (&quot;The House of the Dead Birds&quot;)",

James MacAvoy follows his outstanding performance in Last King of Scotland with a tour de force. Robin Wright plays her role just right. Kevin Kline&apos;s performance might be my favorite of his ever. Outstanding period feel with great on site shooting at homes in Savannah, GA. Got the impression that at least the film company made a serious effort to get the look right. The Q and A after the screen I attended really highlighted the efforts they put into the film to get it right. Noted historian James McPherson was a consultant strongly recommended film when it comes out on April 15th.",

      "reviewBody": "If I may say so, &apos;Delta Force 3: The Killing Game&apos; doesn&apos;t sink because Chuck Norris is gone. It&apos;s just a generic 90&apos;s actioner with a b-movie cast made up of less famous sons and such. It&apos;s the lack of memorable set pieces, too many cliches that is the real killing blow. It&apos;s still a Cannon Film so there&apos;s cheese including gratuitous boobs within the first 30 secs and setting off a minefield.\n\nIn Moscow a suicide bomber hits a peace conference and the mastermind is terrorist leader Kadal. He sends a tape to the American government making demands to pull out of the middle east or he&apos;ll detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil. Delta Force under the lead of Maj. Stewart (Nick Cassavetes) are sent in to get him, but along for the ride are Russian Spetsnaz lead by Cpt. Leskov (John Ryan). Tensions ride high between the men and there&apos;s some friction, but more importantly they have to stop the bomber in Miami now that they know his identity.\n\nMike Norris (son of Chuck) fires off guns and does martial arts once. Eric Douglas (son to Michael) is the demo expert who befriends his Russian equivalent Pietre (Mark Ivanir). Cassavetes here in a b-movie acting role before he went on to bigger success as a writer &amp; director. The cold war trope about US vs Russia baked into the men who in predictable fashion grow to respect each other. &apos;Delta Force 3&apos; is watchable, but doesn&apos;t offer rewards for sitting thru it&apos;s exercise in &quot;been here, seen that&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I avoided watching &quot;Freedom Writers&quot; before because it looked like another &quot;Dangerous Minds.&quot; Come to find out, it is another &quot;Dangerous Minds,&quot; but slightly better. Hilary Swank is a stronger actress than Michelle Pfeiffer IMO and she integrated more pertinent and impactful learning into the students&apos; curriculum, but it is still another &quot;Dangerous Minds.&quot; I mean it&apos;s virtually a carbon copy of &quot;Dangerous Minds.&quot;\n\nErin Gruwell (played by Hilary Swank) was a pie-eyed teacher eager to teach youths of color from disadvantaged backgrounds. She chose Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach where she&apos;d be the English teacher for Freshmen.\n\nErin got more than she bargained for from the angry resentful crowd, but she stuck it out. When many teachers would have quit or mailed it in, she stayed the course to see if she could make a positive change in the pupils&apos; lives.\n\nMy criticisms of this movie are identical to my criticisms of &quot;Dangerous Minds.&quot; This movie was an amalgamation of other movies which did not do as well and in which the educator was a person of color. So, what you have already seen in movies such as, &quot;To Sir, With Love,&quot; &quot;The Marva Collins Story,&quot; &quot;The George McKenna Story,&quot; &quot;Lean on Me,&quot; &quot;Stand and Deliver,&quot; and &quot;Sister Act 2,&quot; you see in &quot;Freedom Writers.&quot; The kids are angry, disrespectful, violent, lost, and forgotten. They are simply waiting for someone who cares and has a lot of patience and time to come rescue them. In this movie, Erin Gruwell was that person.\n\nI talked to my wife, who is a teacher, about this movie. She and her colleagues left the theater with the same sentiment: this movie is impossible. Erin worked two additional jobs to supplement her income to purchase things for her students and she neglected everything and everyone else in her life, including her husband (played by Patrick Dempsey). Is this the model Hollywood wants to establish for a profession that&apos;s already overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated? So every teacher should give up everything else in their life for the sake of their students? And what about the teachers that teach for thirty years or more touching the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of students? Are they somehow less?\n\nI say that because what&apos;s not given enough attention is the fact that Erin followed that class of students out of high school and never returned to teach high school again. She gave all of herself to one class of students and no others. So what about the thousands of kids like her students who came after them?\n\nI&apos;m not trying to denigrate Erin Gruwell&apos;s accomplishment, but I also don&apos;t want her to be overly glorified. What she did for those kids was amazing and I actually liked the movie, but I think the movie trounces over all other teachers who stay put and try to reach as many kids as they can with a more sustainable method.",

      "reviewBody": "In a small town in Norway, or maybe a suburb to one of the bigger cities, we meet a group of people and get involved in their lives for three hectic days before Christmas. These people all tell us their story, and at the same time tell the story of somebody else.\n\nWe meet Reidar (Joner) and Juni (Bonnevie). They are patients at a mental institution, and have a close relationship (but to many of the viewers a strange one, I would guess) Juni hits people who touch her and we are not talking feminine slaps here, but full on break-your-nose-punches. Juni is also suicidal, and Reidar does his best to look after her. Reidar is a very responsible person, who is likely to take the blame for everything. He is also an astrology expert. Based on his constant studies, he has come to the conclusion that the sky might fall down any minute. Reidar&apos;s hope is that though we might not be able to save the other planets, we might save our own. Along with these two protagonists we meet a wide and colourful gallery of characters, they are all involved in each other&apos;s lives on some level, and they all have a story to tell.\n\nIt is very difficult to write a summary of this film, because it is so well made. If I write about one person, I have to mention more, and more, and soon I am giving away most of the plot. The film is full of surprises and lovely and vulnerable characters. It is extremely funny, and extremely sad at the same time. You laugh with tears in your eyes, constantly!\n\n My guess is that this is another one of the films that will be bought from Hollywood and made into a similar, but not half as good box-office wonder. I truly hope though, and recommend, that you go see this film in Norwegian, even if this is not your native language, and enjoy it.",

It is difficult to make a satisfactory film of such a literary icon; it is dangerous to try to make it a musical, as well.  I think this film is highly under-rated, and perhaps mostly by people who are not very familiar with its original source.  While much of the film could be considered &quot;hokey&quot;, I believe that the &quot;dance&quot; sequence of the pilot and the Prince in the spring is sheer delight (as their finding the source of water must have been).  Fosse&apos;s Snake and Wilder&apos;s Fox are phenomenal:  it doesn&apos;t take long for one to actually believe that they are animals rather than people portraying animals. This is a must-see for all, especially for those with children (they seem to &quot;get it&quot; faster than many adults.",

These themes are explored in &apos;Time Out&apos;, the story of Vincent, a man who loses his job and pretends he hasn&apos;t, rather than face up to the truth.  There&apos;s a nice absence of didacticism in the way this film is assembled, a rich picture is assembled but without any attempt to ram a single interpretation down the audience&apos;s throat; it adds up to a fine portrait of depression, and a loneliness that oddly can exist only within a relationship. But there&apos;s also a creativeness in Vincent&apos;s behaviour which is necessary to generate the plot but which doesn&apos;t quite square with the rest of the movie: the film is more convincing once Vincent is deeply trapped in the web of his own lies, rather than when he is spinning it.  At the heart of &apos;Time Out&apos;, Vincent remains an enigma unclarified: it is this that is both the film&apos;s strength and weakness.  It&apos;s not a perfect film, and the start is quite dull, but the longer it lasts, the deeper it feels.",

      "reviewBody": "I am an aircraft mechanic, so admittedly I have trouble watching a movie which will undoubtedly abuse reality in terms of physics and aircraft design. I recall seeing previews for this and being stunned at the laughable scenario of an inverted passenger plane. That experience dropped my expectation to essentially zero.\n\nWhen I watched this film I was surprised in two ways. Firstly, the scenario was more plausible than I had given it credit. Inverted flight is a problem for most planes because of aerodynamics. And while some aircraft are aerodynamically capable of inverted flight (even some passenger planes) it is additionally a problem because hydraulic and engine oil systems are often gravity fed. This means that if a plane is able to fly this way, most of them won&apos;t fly for long before systems begin to fail. The film did a reasonable job of portraying this as the plane was just barely able to sustain level flight with a full pitch down elevator position and displayed low engine oil press warnings which led to engine fire. I suspect the roll maneuver would require more altitude than the film suggests...but otherwise it&apos;s not far from what could happen in reality if this was actually attempted. Most engine fire T-handles are designed to instantly shut fuel and bleed air valves for an engine...which doesn&apos;t seem to happen here, but that was my biggest realism gripe.\n\nMy second surprise is that this movie has very little to do with aviation. Aviation seems to be the setting for the story, but the subject itself is substance abuse. The story could have just as easily been set around a bus driver or a ship captain. Given the fact that aviation was merely a setting for the story I have to give credit to the film makers for paying at least some attention to realism.\n\nI thought the story was fascinating. It&apos;s the sort of film that requires something of the viewer. You can&apos;t watch this without making moral judgements and that process requires each viewer to evaluate how they feel about certain subjects. The story creates just enough moral dilemma to get people thinking and any story that can succeed in that gets a pass from me.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is easily the best French film that has come out in the last years. It is an excellent comedy with the two great actors Dany Boon and Kad Merad but the movie has also its philosophical, dramatical and sad parts.\n\nThis movie is extremely funny, it is really difficult to make me laugh but this film made me laugh really hard several times. The best examples are when the postman and his director are having some drinks with half of the town while they deliver the letters or the scenes in the old mining town of Bergues, This movie is extremely touching and emotional. When the excellent Kad Merad tells his new partners and friends about his lies and mistakes, you feel really sad and ashamed for him. The movie&apos;s finale is also very emotional and a perfect and really philosophical conclusion.\n\nBut the real star of the movie is the whole region, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, where this movie is settled. This film presents strange and funny accents of the Sticks, their historical and charming towns, their way of living and thinking, their relation to the other parts of France and the clichés and prejudices about both sides. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais is more than just a part of France, it is a country within a country and a culture within a culture. I have been in this region for some weeks during an exchange program and I can tell that those people living there are mostly open-minded, very sympathetic and have many reasons to be proud of their region. I really like this movie as it reminds me of a few very positive and unforgettable memories. And I like the movie because it is different and finally a French film that doesn&apos;t present us Paris over and over again. The France is way more than just Paris and there are many beautiful and unique regions and people to discover and this successful and charming movie shows this to all the people out there.\n\nFor everyone that is interested in a touching, emotional and simply profound comedy movie or anyone that likes foreign cultures and lifestyles, this unique movie is an absolute masterpiece. I hope that other French regions will follow this example and make similar movies in the future and take the focus off Paris a little bit.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this film on a whim and I can tell you from the start that is mostly a waste of time. Mostly, because the vampires in the film, classical as they were, had this twist of high class addicts that tried to stay off human blood, but occasionally failed. There was even a night of the vampires where they just sat there and discussed their condition. This had a lot of potential. Unfortunately the discussion was stale, the basic premise of the film just a spout between eternal sisters (now that is hell) and nothing else.\n\nThe cast was also full of potential. Milo Ventimiglia is a decent actor and rather good looking; I bet he will do increasingly well. Roxane Mesquida is hot as hell, especially in the role of the out of control psychotic bitch. Michael Rapaport, poor guy, had a lot going for him but now is just a fat nobody playing ridiculous roles. However, I am pretty sure this cast could have done a decent job with a good script. Alas, this was anything but one.\n\nAdd to this the really bad direction, the weak effects, the obsolete camera techniques and you get a movie that looks made by a student for a cinematography exam. Just avoid it.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes a movie is too ironic and self-parodying for its own good.  This brilliant and cleverly-conceived film, despite having been panned by critics and drubbed by fans, deserves a hard second look by those with sufficient vision to look beyond the apparent formula of the film to see the deft irony that lies (not very far) beneath the surface.  \n\nThis film comes disguised as a romantic comedy.  Indeed, it has all the fantasy elements of the genre:  endlessly falling flower petals; attractive men and women initially at odds with one another; the protagonist&apos;s self-discovery; and (ultimately) a lush, romantic setting.  It doesn&apos;t spoil the film one whit to say that it even has the traditional rom-com ending of &quot;girl gets boy&quot; -- in fact, isn&apos;t that de rigeur for a romantic comedy? \n\n But beneath the trappings of the eternal quest for love lie uncomfortable truths that this movie keeps sprinkling among the rose petals for the viewer to confront:  people betray one another&apos;s trust for casual or selfish motives; trusting one&apos;s heart to &quot;love&quot; leads as often to heartache as it does to  fulfillment; what looks like love from one person&apos;s viewpoint is often something very different from the other side; being too needy for love stifles talent and ambition; and happy endings sometimes only appear that way.  \n\nLooked at as an ironic commentary on the imperfections and uncertainties of love and of the fantasy of &quot;happily ever after,&quot; this film is nearly perfect.  Looked at as a straightforward romantic comedy, it&apos;s awful.  But there are dozens of clues in the skilled writing and direction that point to irony, rather than romance, as the powerful engine that pulls this movie. Indeed, the movie takes vicious swipes at romantic comedy staples throughout:  the magical love story of the girl&apos;s parents, on which she was bottle-fed, turns out not to be quite what it seems; most other characters repeatedly fail in their love lives, or succeed only to suffer great loss as a result; and great-hearted social gestures are doomed to failure. Sometimes the irony is apparent in other ways, such as in the flower petals that fall too relentlessly and too often either to be ignored or to be accepted at face value.  \n\nThe message of this film, ultimately, is quietly stark:  everything is doomed to fade away, and we shall fade away, too, no matter whom we love or how deeply.  Whether we will get scorched by that love before we shuffle off is an open question.  This is not your standard romantic comedy message. Nor is this really a feel-good movie.  But it is very funny in places, cleverly constructed, well acted, and comes with an important message about love and loss.  It deserves a second chance.",

However, I thought it was a nice little distraction. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two main characters. Are they gonna win Oscars for their acting? Eh. They were obnoxious but I liked them. The music was great. I loved hearing all the new songs and hearing some old ones in a whole new way. Actually, I really enjoyed all of the music in the movie. Is this movie gonna change your life? Nope. It&apos;s definitely not going to do that. Sometimes a movie just is what it is and that&apos;s OK! Give it a chance....",

      "reviewBody": "THIS is a totally awesome, adrenalin rushing, down and dirty in-your-face 80&apos;s Italian exploitation effort, but of course you have to be cautious who you may recommend it to! If you&apos;re, for example, attending a convention for people with an enormous IQ and you got a couple of hours to kill, you probably shouldn&apos;t suggest watching &quot;Fists of Steel&quot; because the script&apos;s intellectual value is rather questionable. Or in case you&apos;re a guest at a feminist gathering, I wouldn&apos;t advise mentioning &quot;Fists of Steel&quot; neither, as the film is literally stuffed with macho characters and typically male showdowns. In fact, to put it rather bluntly, &quot;Fists of Steel&quot; is a movie for guys, and preferably guys that like their heroes invincible, their women docile, their action &amp; violence graphic &amp; plentiful and their dialogs and story lines rudimentary. I&apos;m not implying you have to be a retard in order to enjoy this film (otherwise, I&apos;d be one myself) but it&apos;s merely a relaxing and undemanding film to watch after a hard day&apos;s work or together with a group of friends where there&apos;s loads of beer and pizza.\n\n&quot;Fists of Steel&quot; is basically an attempt to cash in on the huge success of James Cameron&apos;s &quot;The Terminator&quot;, but without the rather complex time-traveling structure and advanced character developments. In futuristic America, where acid rain hurtles down daily and breathing poisonous air may kill you, beefcake Cyborg Paco Querak is programmed to terminate a blind &amp; crippled environmentalist whose movement is seriously annoying big-shot industrialist John Saxon. However, Paco&apos;s conscience prevents him from finishing the job and he flees into the Arizonan desert. He entrenches himself in a cheap &amp; sleazy motel where he falls in love with the friendly owner, arm-wrestles against aggressive truckers and patiently awaits the army of hired killers to come after him. There isn&apos;t a single moment of dullness in this movie and I was actually sad when it finished. The arm wrestling contests are incredibly entertaining to behold (muscles all over the screen), the car/truck/helicopter chases are extremely exciting and the fistfights are so harsh you can almost feel them. Daniel Greene is more than adequate in his heroic Cyborg-role but the supportive cast is even better with the almighty John Saxon as the über-bad guy, George Eastman as the jealous lead-trucker and Claudio Cassinelli (who sadly died during shooting) as one of the relentless hit men. Cassinelli&apos;s untimely death clearly caused a scripting problem, as his character is killed off screen. As always, Sergio Martino&apos;s direction is fast-paced and competent but nothing more than that. He was one of Italy&apos;s busiest and most versatile directors during the 60&apos;s, 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, so don&apos;t expect too much typical trademarks or personalized styles as he just wanted to finish the job quick and proper. Claudio Simonetti, the multi-talented brain behind cult band Goblin, was in charge of the music and that&apos;s another reason for avid fans of Italian exploitation film to track this puppy down. Great testosterone-driven entertainment, love it or hate it!",

Go and see this film: the dialogue may be a touch wooden, the effects a touch cheap and the acting a touch awful but you can see that there is a touch of class about this movie."

Very little film footage was actually shot, and the footage which was shot is more like rehearsal footage.

The sexual entanglement of two married couples who practice swinging among themselves in a modern French middle-class setting, the initial euphoria succeeded by antagonism, irritation and the ending of this pact. Along with the bold erotic scenes, the parable of the &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; is narrated by a family patriarch during a meal, while there is a brief dialogue in English, in this French speaking movie. Actors and actresses support ably their roles, while the focus is more on the women than the men. In the end a memory remains more sweet than bitter for those involved. I dare say the same applies to viewers."

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t be misled by the poster- Ajay Devgn, Salman Khan and Suniel Shetty have only one scene each in the movie where Ajay Devgn plays Ajay Devgn, Bhoi plays Bhoi and Suniel Shetty plays himself.\n\nThe movie&apos;s lead hero was Manek Bedi (Son of director Narendra Bedi ). But they could not sell the movie with his face so the poor guy&apos;s face didn&apos;t even make it to the posters. The producers marketed this movie as a Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn and Suniel Shetty film and cheated the audience by showing them Manek Bedi and Nasseruddin Shah as leads instead.\n\nActing debut of Veeru Devgan. This was the one and only movie in which Veeru Devgan acted. He played the role of a movie director. He was actually practicing as one year later he gave us a gem called Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999)\n\nBhoi plays himself in an action scene and saves Gracy Singh from goons by running them over by his bicycle. Bhoi and accidents go hand in hand. The leader of the goons is Gulshan Grover. This is a movie within the movie being directed by Veeru Devgan. Manek Bedi is playing Bhoi Ka Body Double in the scene where Gullu puts fire on Bhoi&apos;s shirt and Bhoi says Jalaygaa Kya ?\n\nAjay Devgn has an action scene and a song. No, not two different things. He is a truck driver and It is a song in which Amrish Puri&apos;s goons attack his girlfriend who is a dhabewali and Ajay Devgn sings and fights with the goons at the same time. So much multitasking used to happen in the nineties. Singing and dancing wasn&apos;t enough in this scene they sing, dance and fight. Dishooom !!!! The dhabewali is played by Ayesha Jhulka.\n\nSuniel Shetty has an action scene where he plays Commando Khan. He says &quot;Us Mulq ki Sarhad Ko Koi Choo nahin sakta, Jis Mulq ki Nigehbaan Ho Aaakhen&quot; This is interuppted by Kiran Kumar saying &quot; Is Mulq Ki Nigehbaazi karne wali tumhari Aankhen hi nahin, Kaleja bhi nikaal lenge hum..To which Suniel shetty replies &quot;Kalejaa nikalne waale... Kalejaa tham ke sun. And then speaks a long monolouge before fighting starts. So much patience Kiran Kumar had in those days.\n\nThe whole movie has 90s style action scenes with Sabzee ke thele falling all over the place.\n\nNasser Sahab hams it up in this one. His character has rainbow shades. It keeps turning 360 degrees. Good to bad and back to good.\n\nTiku Tulsania laughs during serious scenes and makes them laughable. He plays Madhoo&apos;s father. He says lines like &quot;Meri beti ko phisslakar, Meri Tijori mein Phissalna chahte ho?&quot; and &quot;Bohot achi tarah jaanta hun tum jaise naujawano ko, Jo Chalte hain Pathar ki sadak par, Lekin Chahte hain Noton ki Sadak.&quot;\n\nManek Bedi&apos;s voice is dubbed very badly. Infact everyone&apos;s voice is dubbed badly. He has no job and his brother is in jail. He is desperately seeking a job so he just randomly walks into a movie set and speaks to the director and says &quot;Kya yeh shot main de sakta hun. Main skating school chalata hun, Bachon ko skating sikhata hun.&quot; To which the director replies &quot;Areh Waah Skating janta hai, Isko Tayyar karo shot ke liye&quot;.\n\nVeeru Devgan has an action scene where he says to the goons &quot;Amitabh, Akshay, Sunny, Suneil&apos; sabko fighting sikhai hai maine. The goons reply &quot;Sher ke mooh se niwala chenega&quot; to which he replies &quot;Cheene ko main tumhari Jaan bhi Cheen Loon, Ration Card se tumhara naam bhi cheen loon.&quot;\n\nThe main villains are Arjun and Mohan Joshi. They are known for hammy performances.\n\nBecause Mohan Joshi says &quot;Ek bohot secret conference hai hamare faraamhouse par, Duniya ke kone kone se terrorist hamare faaram house par aa rahe hein. Duniya bhar mein Bumm Bilaasht karne ka contract humein milne wala hai.&quot;\n\nFamous movie director Umesh Mehra (Soni Mahiwal, Sabse Bada Khiladi) makes a special appearance as Movie director\n\nDirector of OH MY GOD! Umesh Shukla makes an appearance as a corrupt cop.",

      "name": "a review of MY FRIENDS and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2",
      "reviewBody": "MY FRIENDS is originally a project for Italian writer/director Pietro Germi, whose untimely death in 1974 at the age of 60, leaves the film to be taken over by another maestro of the Commedia all&apos;Italiana, Mario Monicelli. The film was a whopping box-office success, which subsequently would spawn two sequels, Monicelli would be back in the saddle with ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 (1982) and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 3 (1985) would be outsourced to Nanni Loy. \n\nA double-bill of these two Monicelli&apos;s vehicles, set in Florence, MY FRIENDS has a quartet core of middle-aged men: Count Lello Mascetti (Tognhzzi), a down-and-out ex-nobleman who has squandered all his fortunes, can only slum it in a tiny basement with his suicide-driven wife Alice (Vukotic) and their daughter, which doesn&apos;t dissuade him from being smitten with an underage student Titti (Dionisio), who has a predilection for girls over men; the second one is Giorgio Perozzi (Noiret), a journalist separated from his wife Laura (Goodwin) and is irreconcilably at adds with his prim adult son; then there is Rambaldo Melandri (Moschin), a bachelor architect, determined to find his perfect half and lastly is Guido Necchi (Del Prete), married with Carmen (Tamantini) and they own a bar which serves as their haunt. \n\nLife is anything but optimistic, Pietro Germi and co.&apos;s script conscientiously draws the milieu from reality, in both Mascetti and Perozzi&apos;s cases, one might easily finds company in distress and self- abandonment, but, not these four, feeding on their staunch friendship, the fold never relinquish their idiosyncratic practical jokes and escapades, mostly ingenious and borderline harmless, counting their classic passengers-slapping when a train departs and Mascetti&apos;s trademark &quot;supercazzola&quot; gibberish. And following Melandri&apos;s tireless pursuit of a married woman, Donatella (Karlatos), an embodiment of Madonna with psychological hiccups, a fifth member, Professor Sassaroli (Celi) is introduced, a renowned surgeon and the husband of Donatella, who is perversely liberal about the affair and is more than happy to not stand in their way if they are really made for each other, and of course, they are not, but Sassaroli is here to stay. \n\nOne of their most detailed skits involves a penny-pinching pensioner Righi (Blier), who is hustled into believing that the quartet belongs to a mafia mob, with Sassaroli as their boss, dangled by the profitable income, Righi buckles down to join in their &quot;dangerous&quot; line-of-work, and their adventure culminates in a self-organized gangster melee, which leaves Righi in chagrin, utterly side-splitting thanks to Blier&apos;s bang-up po-faced bearing. The coda of MY FRIENDS deflects to a more sombre streak - a heart attack does Peruzzi in, all happens in a sudden but no grim sorrow is allowed to percolate, his friends keep their comic esprit de corps alive, even death cannot take it away. \n\nALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 comes 7 years later, the story continues after Peruzzi&apos;s abrupt departure, the original cast returns (significantly older) except Del Prete, who is replaced by a more prosaic- looking Renzo Montagnani as Necchi, only the latter is not endowed with Del Prete&apos;s dashing and devil-may-care panache. \n\nThe part 2 doesn&apos;t structurally pigeonhole itself as a strict sequel, owing to the huge pull of Noiret&apos;s Perozzi, there are abundant flashbacks charting Perozzi and Mascetti&apos;s past stories, which take place earlier than those in the first one, while without ghettoizing Sassaroli out of the picture (the original four becomes a quintet), it conspicuously creates some anachronism for viewers with fresh memory of the first installment. Gallantly interpolating the flood of Arno in 1966, the story manages to expound on Perozzi&apos;s marriage disintegration and take a taunting spin on Melandri&apos;s another devoted courtship to a voluptuous but God-fearing young girl Noemi (Giordano).\n\nContriving an act of pulling Pisa tower back in perpendicular, gate-crushing a singing contest with a risqué song a cappella in the presence of cardinals, a chirpy caper involving a Spanish contortionist (Da Silva), their shticks never disappoint, meanwhile Mascetti has his own familial problem when his slow-witted daughter is impregnated by an unknown rapist and decides to become an unwed mother. Finally, a guest performance from Paolo Stoppa as Savino, a Shylock to whom Mascetti is indebted, he would fall prey into the quartet&apos;s pranks (includes a scatological one which sublimely tips the scale), and undergo several &quot;invisible&quot; operations to square off Mascetti&apos;s debts. Similarly, another heart attack befalls on one of the main characters near the finish, but this time, to a lesser extent, Tognazzi, Moschin, Noiret and Celi are all sterling comedians, but it is Tognazzi who stands out in his more sympathetic nobleman-in-distress mould. \n\nInscribing their marks as quintessential pieces of Commedia all&apos;Italiana, both films are salacious, amoral and pathologically funny, although the second one only logically contends to take a leaf from its predecessor&apos;s book. But essentially they are not connived as far-fetched escapist fares with a shamelessly patronizing smugness, their gypsyish antics are genuinely devised to imbue a positive vibe out of their quotidian misfortunes, despite that they can never hit the right note of the gender politics, yet, what do you expect from a buddy movie?",

      "reviewBody": "Battle Circus (1953) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nMGM drama about a MASH unit in Korea and a doctor (Humphrey Bogart) who falls for a new nurse (June Allyson). This is a pretty strange film that didn&apos;t quite work with me and I think a lot of that is due to the rather poor screenplay that never knows what it&apos;s trying to be. It starts off as a war drama then moves into a romantic comedy and then at the end tries to turn into something else. The moods of the film are constantly changing to the point where you don&apos;t know what or how you&apos;re suppose to be feeling. Bogart was an interesting choice for the role here because he&apos;s having to put on the charm from scene one until the end. Many have found his performance bad here but I thought he handled it pretty well. The sweet talk stuff doesn&apos;t sound right coming from someone like Bogart but that&apos;s why I found it charming. Allyson isn&apos;t nearly as strong in her role but she&apos;s adorable enough. Bogart and her do a nice job together, although I had a hard time believing he&apos;d actually fall so hard for her. I&apos;ve read several comments that have attacked the film and Bogart&apos;s character because he&apos;s pretty much sexually harassing the woman throughout the movie. Even when she wants nothing to do with him he still uses his power as a doctor to touch her and so on. I personally didn&apos;t take this stuff that serious as I don&apos;t think it was meant to be seen as any sort of harassment. In the end, the film doesn&apos;t work and turns out to be one of the legendary star&apos;s lesser films."

I didn&apos;t watch the entire film, i mostly listened to it. But that parts that I did watch were boring at first, then when I looked at it dramatically, they were amazing. even the simplist movements. I loved the style that the director filmed it visually and the time sequences.\n\nI agree with the user that said that it showed how hopeless the children were. It shows the power of anyone with a motive and a gun. It&apos;s frightening to me. I&apos;m in school right now and a bit scared. Anyone could be walking around with guns on them ready to shoot the school. If you&apos;ve seen one of the Michael moore documentaries with the kid that has many guns hidden in his clothing, then you know how many weapons one can carry.\n\nThis movie opened my eyes though I wish it hadn&apos;t. It&apos;s frightening what can go on at any moment."

      "reviewBody": "In what may be the most remarkable live action film to come out of the Disney studios during the 80&apos;s or even the 70&apos;s for that matter, I find the treatment it has received from it&apos;s own studio appalling.  The best thing I can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds.  Considering all the costume jewelry Disney released in the aforementioned decades, you would think they would have more respect for this gem.\n\nI&apos;m sure parents who took their children to see Natty Gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children.  It is a very dark realistic film which takes place during the Great Depression.  This is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.\n\n  When Natty&apos;s father Sol(Ray Wise) is offered a job in a logging camp in Washington, he is only given a few hours to come to a decision, either take the job and leave Natty behind, or stay in Chicago with Natty and hopefully find work elsewhere.  At first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the Chicago streets.  In a truly remarkable scene, we see as Sol does, the faces of all those who have lost hope and been beaten down in despair.  It is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and Sol accepts the work in Seattle. Sol is forced to leave Natty in the care of a boarding house owner Connie(Lainie Kazan). After Natty overhears Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, she decides not to wait for her father to send for her, and begins an arduous journey across country to find him.\n\nIf ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it&apos;s this one. Early in the film we are given the harsh reality of depression era Chicago. Director Jeremy Kagan does not spare us from the details.  We watch as men stand hopelessly and helplessly praying and hoping for work.  There is a scene where a destitute family are evicted from their home.  Later, as Sol is heading to Washington in the bus, we see another family on the road with their meager belongings strapped to their car as they head west, their car no longer operable.  As Natty walks through the market place vendors sell what meager belongings they have just to get buy.  When Natty runs away we see her fishing for food out of a trash can for a morsel to consume.  Later, as Natty travels westward, there is beautifully photographed scenery of forests and mountains, but Director Kagan astutely reminds us of the bleakness of the depression with many scenes of the struggle in rural America, ranging from a scene of a farmer and his much pregnant wife plowing a field, to scenes of orphaned and abandoned children left to be wards of the state.   This is not your Daddy&apos;s Disney, kids.  Dick Bush&apos;s cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in Chicago and in the farm towns of America, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation.  \n\nWhen Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails.  Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well. Harry may be young, but Cusack gives him the edge of a man aged beyond his years.  It is an uncanny performance.\n\nSalenger, as Natty, is more than just a teenage actress. Her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last.  It is the key that holds this film together and if it had been put into less capable hands the film would surely not have succeeded as well.  Although her film career since Natty Gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of Natty Gann. This is a journey for the ages, and one you will not soon forget. Unfortunately.......\n\nI don&apos;t make it a habit to comment on the DVD release of films, but in this case I&apos;ll make an exception.  The transfer of this wonderful film is appalling.  It&apos;s bad enough when a film that shouts &quot;wide screen&quot; is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever seen.  It gives new meaning to the word grainy.  At times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your VCR remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a DVD.  There are signs of the film&apos;s age running rampant throughout and no visible effort to clean it up digitally or otherwise.  I&apos;m not one to believe every film should come with a boatload of extras, and have no problem if a studio wants to give us just the film, but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor picture quality of this DVD.  This movie is a gem, and for the Disney studios to tarnish it and treat it in this unconscionable manner, saddens me terribly.  What is more frustrating is the fact that Disney can do quality video releases, so just a decent film to DVD wide screen transfer would not have been a lot to ask for.  They should be ashamed of what they have done to this fine fine film.\n\nMy Grade: Journey of Natty Gann-A\n\n DVD transfer - F",

It has all the goofiness you&apos;d expect and a whole lot of charm -- not to mention all the musical numbers brilliantly remade a few decades later in &quot;Singing in the Rain,&quot; which presumably takes place in the same studio at the same time. In fact, if you love &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; and understand the spirit of that film, you&apos;ll love this film. This film was made to be a lighthearted extravaganza, and as other commentators have noted, it probably won Best Picture by wowing everyone with its astonishing special effect (they sing! they dance! they speak!). Reminds one of other films that have done the same (the whole boat sinks!). The interplay between the two sisters at the beginning is a little, shall we say, peculiar -- also fascinating. Not for film snobs, but a fun look at the past."

The film could not produce smiles or laughs. The only good thing was the dogs&apos; relationship to each other. Bad for children and for adults. If one were to make a movie about space dogs, then it should rather be on the dog&apos;s wild adventures in space that could pique the imagination a bit. Instead they had to run around on the ground. It was as if they were trying to get everything in the movie, surroundings, environment, emotions, relationships, development, 3d, society and space. The result was a too superficial movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The Cold Hour takes several cliché&apos; horror film tropes, combines them in entirely unexpected ways, adds brilliant acting and great cinematography and ends with a purely science fictional image that will live in my mind for a really long time. This is a well put-together ensemble piece. I&apos;d tracked it down, having been encouraged by the largely positive IMDb reviews, but mainly because of the Silke (Hornillos Klein) Rule: &quot;Buy Anything She is In&quot; that dates back to Julio Medem&apos;s wonderful, Philip K. Dickian, Tierra. Purely from the perspective of The Silke Rule, this film could almost have been seen as a disappointment since, although her character Maria is top billed, all of the characters are extremely well balanced and no one is really the lead. Every part is so well written and so well acted, however, that the viewer comes out ahead. In fact, the primary PoV is 8 year old Jesús, played by Omar Muñoz, and he is wonderful, despite my normal antipathy towards child actors. I can&apos;t, alas, say much more without revealing too much.\n\nIf you&apos;ve read the other reviews, you already know that the primary situation appears to be similar to 28 days, et al. (This MAY actually be correct - if you prefer clear, pat explanations from a film, rather than have it ask as may questions as it answers, leaving you with a delicious sense of cognitive dissonance, then go watch something else). However, I&apos;ve never seen that ultra-standard plot trope handled THIS way, or combined with THAT. Run, don&apos;t walk, to get La Hora Fría if you admire and enjoy originality, a continual sense of surprise, and a refusal on the part of the creators to spell everything out; if, like me, you prefer leaving the experience of a film with a deep sense of unease and the feeling that you have a lot of thinking to do especially about what that final shot meant. Your mind will have something to mull over for a long, long time.",

      "reviewBody": "I think this is a very underrated little horror film even among Roger Corman&apos;s own directorial output. This stems, perhaps, from the fact that Ray Milland steps in for Vincent Price here, making it the odd one out among the series of Corman&apos;s Poe adaptations.\n\nRay Milland must have seemed a rather offbeat choice at the time given his reputation of being one of Hollywood&apos;s most charming and debonair leading man. In hindsight, however, he gives the role of the paranoid and cataleptic Guy Correll a wounded vulnerability which Vincent Price would have had trouble in bringing out (without resorting to camp). This is evident when one compares two similar roles played by Price in PIT AND THE PENDULUM (1961), in which he overdid the fainting bit, and his later, admirably subdued performance in THE TOMB OF LIGEIA (1964). To his credit, Milland - who was at his best in such light but sophisticated comedies as EASY LIVING (1939), ARISE, MY LOVE (1940), THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR (1942) and KITTY (1945) - did not consider such roles as being beneath him and consequently gave them his all. As a matter of fact, he considered his subsequent role for Corman, that of Dr. James Xavier in X  THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES (1963), to be his second best after his Oscar-winning turn for Billy Wilder in THE LOST WEEKEND (1945)! I sure would like to get a chance to see Ray Milland in his three other notable &apos;horror&apos; films: THE UNINVITED (1944), ALIAS NICK BEAL (1949) and (directing himself) PANIC IN YEAR ZERO (1962).\n\nAs for the film itself, I admit that having just watched PIT AND THE PENDULUM, PREMATURE BURIAL and (fairly recently) HOUSE OF USHER (1960) in quick succession, the repetition in the story-lines (catalepsy and premature entombment), not to mention in the art direction (recycled sets), does tend to get rather tiresome. Nevertheless, PREMATURE BURIAL, while perhaps not among Corman&apos;s best work, is engaging enough to repay repeated viewings (this has been my third time round)."

Worst of all, it doesn&apos;t leave you with any sense of accomplishment or insight.\n\nIt works, however, if you can relate to this movie as an adult who has ever gone through a period of your life where you just wanted to go back to a simpler time.\n\nI was able to relate in particular because like Leigh in the movie I actually went back to being a lifeguard in my 20s after graduating from college and not really knowing what to do with myself. And like Leigh, things didn&apos;t really work out entirely as I planned them to. Was it a good move? I&apos;m a happy I did it? Did I learn anything from it? Hard to say really.\n\nSimilarly you&apos;re not going to find a lot of definitive answers in this movie as to whether the heroine makes choices that are right or wrong. But if you&apos;ve had a similar experience - you&apos;ll feel like she&apos;s a friend.",

      "reviewBody": "Rope is one of the finer films that Hitchcock made.  Philosophy, sociology and psychology are contained in equal parts.  The plot is simple, the characters are complex and Hitchcock&apos;s treatment of the Leopold and Loeb parallel quite deft.  The final soliloquy from Jimmy Stewart&apos;s character, Rupert, is not only one of the finest examples of Stewart&apos;s acting abilities but also of film-making.\n\nOn the subject of filmmaking - Hitchcock filmed this in as much of a single take as possible.  I believe there are only five edits in the whole thing. I can wholeheartedly tell you that it was no gimmick on Hitchcock&apos;s part. The play&apos;s plot requires that a certain amount of tension be maintained. Tracking shots are used for this purpose and quite well in my opinion. Timing, position and prop movements alone are to force us to stand in awe of a logistical challenge.  All the actors are played superbly.  The dialogue is natural and flowing.  The finest bit of timing involves a swinging kitchen door, the rope, and the fear of discovery.\n\nIn short, this is a fine film that cannot disappoint.  Highly recommended and will be well worth your time."

It is indeed about the antecedents to 9/11, and bravo to Spielberg for taking it on, but not somewhere in Afghanistan, but at its genesis, the squalor of Palestine. \n\nSpielberg&apos;s film is an essay on revenge and how hopeless and self-defeating that ancient temptation is. It&apos;s brave of Spielberg to say it to us now; brave, too, to paint the avenging Israelis as somewhere below the Angels. Let&apos;s be candid: There are harsh sentiments expressed here, by some Israeli characters, that the Evangelical Lobby simply doesn&apos;t want aired. \n\nSpielberg&apos;s handling of the Bana character is masterful. Noteworthy is how uncompromising it is: this is a man whose identity has collapsed. It&apos;s entirely right that his Israeli handler should refuse the Sabbath-meal invitation at the end, realizing that the bonds of the older religion (and pre-Zionist identity) are shattered and meaningless.\n\nSpielberg might have improved this product (some of the dialogues are horribly wooden). But that&apos;s not important. That a mainstream US film should go where this film goes is significant. This is a major-minor event in Spielberg&apos;s long and luminous career.",

The film was endearing and carried a great moral, without being preachy.  The comedy in the film works, the drama works, and neither is too much or too corny.  The characters are well developed and the audience clearly identifies with the protagonist, 11-year-old Elizabeth.  The crowd  actually broke out in cheers when the mean older brother finally gets his - something I haven&apos;t experienced in a movie in years.  I especially enjoyed seeing Vicky Haughton again after her fabulous performance in Whale Rider.  I highly recommend this film for everyone...yes even men without kids.  The screening was followed by a Q&amp;A with writer/director Mark Gordon.  He is traveling the country, screening the movie, and asked that we spread the word, which I am by posting this notice.  I wouldn&apos;t bother doing this merely on the request of the filmmaker, but the movie spoke for itself.  I made a mental note to post a great review as soon as the ending credits started.\n\nI&apos;ve been racking my brain trying to remember the movie this one reminded me and I finally thought of it.  The movie is like a perfected version of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.  The comedy is similarly good, but the message this movie sends, and the quality of the filmmaking goes well beyond.\n\nAnyway, take your kids and enjoy!"

      "name": "Looks every bit gorgeous; but with poorly developed story and characters, as well as loose direction, &apos;Mural&apos; is ultimately as interesting as watching paint dry",
      "reviewBody": "We can tell you this much about Gordon Chan after watching almost twenty years of his films- the guy is an action man, and despite his attempts at dabbling in other genres, it is his action movies like Jet Li&apos;s &apos;Fist of Legend&apos;, Jackie Chan&apos;s &apos;Thunderbolt&apos; and the Michael Wong SDU films &apos;Final Option&apos;, &apos;First Option&apos; and &apos;Option Zero&apos; that have truly been outstanding. We say this also because &apos;Mural&apos; is Gordon&apos;s attempt at a fantasy romance, and like his other non-action genre forays, it is ultimately disappointing.\n\nIn all fairness, this is not the first time that he has tried his hand at something similar. Gordon was also at the helm of 2008&apos;s surprise hit &apos;Painted Skin&apos;, adapted as well from a Liaozhai story by author Pu Songling, and it was the success of that earlier movie (whose Chinese title bears remarkable resemblance both written and pronounced) which led to the genesis of &apos;Mural&apos;. But whereas that movie had a strong lead action star in Donnie Yen and therefore could boast some decent action sequences, &apos;Mural&apos; has Mainland actor Deng Chao in the lead, and let&apos;s just say that he is no Donnie Yen. \n\nDeng plays the righteous young scholar Zhu Xiaolian who lands up in the Land of Ten Thousand Blossoms after getting distracted en route to his imperial exams by a mural depicting some beautiful women. Needless to say, Xiaolian will find love- and so too will some of the women in the kingdom who have been taught by their evil Fairy Godmother (Yan Ni) that men are all scumbags and love is strictly forbidden. But despite the complications that follow, Deng&apos;s role as the virtuous idealist fighting for his right to love is essentially dull and simplistic, not helped by the actor&apos;s straightforward delivery. \n\nThe same could be said of his other two male companions- the timorous servant Hou Xia (played by a whiny and annoying Baobeier), and the mountain bandit Meng Longtan (Collin Chou) whom Xiaolian and Hou Xia were in pursuit of right before ending up in the temple with the titular painting. Both these supporting characters are given little development in the story- Hou Xia gets to show his caring side by taking in a woman rejected by Meng as his wife, while Meng has a change of heart when he sees Xiaolian&apos;s sacrificial love- and the same can be said of the bevy of Chinese actresses each contributing nothing more than their looks as the other fairies in the Land.\n\nThe fault lies with the slackly written story credited to Frankie Tam, Maria Wong, Lau Ho-Leung and Gordon Chan (the latter two also behind &apos;Painted Skin&apos;). The first half of the movie fumbles with little direction, with the writers and director Chan content on letting the characters wander about CGI-ed vistas, leaving the second half struggling for some dramatic focus on the love story between Xiaolian and Shaoyao (played by Deng&apos;s wife in real life Sun Li). But with too much time spent on Zhu&apos;s apparent obsession with another fairy- the soft-spoken and honest Mudan (Taiwanese TV presenter Liu Yang playing against type)- and his quest to rescue her at the hands of the Queen, even the romance between Xiaolian and Shaoyao never quite convinces.\n\nThat the intended love story lacks any genuine emotion is also because Deng Chao and Sun Li share little on-screen chemistry. Sun Li plays her character icy and distant, and the consequence is that we end up rooting for Xiaolian and Mudan- instead of Shaoyao- to get together. The other couplings also don&apos;t have much emotional heft, so what should have been a touching supernatural fantasy romance ends up bland and uninspiring. More unforgivable is the miscasting of Collin Chou, the action star best known for playing &apos;The Matrix&apos;s&apos; Seraph out of place in a romantic movie.\n\nDitto for fellow action maestro Andy On (think the baddie in &apos;True Legend&apos;), who has a bit part as the Queen&apos;s bodyguard with obvious affections for Shaoyao. Not only is his role sorely underdeveloped (the film hints at a love triangle between him, Xiaolian and Shaoyao but never quite gets there), he and Collin get short shrift in the poorly choreographed, wire-ful action sequences that would have ended up as outtakes in their other action films. There is also plenty of CGI, and while they are impressive, it&apos;s perplexing why a film with perfectly good martial arts stars would waste them while trying to better their Hollywood counterparts in the visual effects department.\n\nBut yes- we&apos;ll be fair to praise the team behind the CG graphics of the movie, which is probably one of the best ever done for a China-Hong Kong movie. Deserving of praise too are Cyrus Ho&apos;s beautiful set design and Bobo Ng&apos;s lavish colourful costumes- pity then that their efforts are wasted on a story that could have done with more plotting and a film that should have been done with tighter direction. Coming after the disastrous &apos;King of Fighters&apos;, &apos;Mural&apos; once again finds the talented Gordon Chan out of his league- and fans of his earlier action movies should probably steer clear of this, since it will only make you long for the kind of films he used to make. \n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n"

      "reviewBody": "I was looking for a bit of trivia about this film and made the mistake of reading the reviews here. My jaw dropped when I saw the overwhelming opinion that this movie is worthless because it&apos;s too slow. Has everyone been too brain-deadened by recent Hollywood thrill rides to appreciate a patiently unfolding story? The Terminal Man is very creepy, very scary, and is acted with amazing skill by even the smallest of bit players. Each one of the doctors involved in the experiment, for example, carries his or her own personal baggage, and it&apos;s that baggage which clouds their reason and makes true progress impossible. The message of the film seems to be that no matter how advanced science becomes, people will still be people, and our petty prides and jealousies will tear down every accomplishment. That&apos;s the brilliance of this movie; it takes a broad sci-fi theme yet reduces it to its most unpredictable element: the personalities of the persons involved. There are so many amazing scenes in this film where a line or two of casual conversation reveals so much about the power games being played between the speakers. On the outside, these scientists are titans of technology; on the inside, they&apos;re closer to the befuddled old men of the comedy &quot;BALL OF FIRE&quot;. The only one who thinks with heart as well as head is the Joan Hackett character, and the clash between her and the good &apos;ol boys of science is both profound and heartbreaking.\n\nI urge anyone with an IQ larger than their shoe size to ignore the negative comments and give this film a chance. Viewed with an open mind and a little patience, this movie becomes quite an exiting experience. It&apos;s one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films of all time, and has never gotten its due respect. It&apos;s the kind of film we could use more of, and the fact it&apos;s considered boring by today&apos;s audiences is very sad proof of the dumbing-down effect of Hollywood clap-trap. We&apos;re used to movies that ask you to set back while you&apos;re force-fed the story. The Terminal Man requires that you watch what&apos;s happening, listen to what&apos;s being said, and think about what&apos;s between the lines. If you can&apos;t do that, stick with Vin Diesel films."

The movie suffers sometimes from the inexperienced hand of a first-time director, the lack of the epic budget it needed, and the poor acting of Inés Sastre but it is not a bad movie, not at all. It&apos;s an extremely entertaining film that uses its modest resources with great care to give us a dignified, sincere, notably balanced and very emotional document of the terrible experience of the Cuban people. Don&apos;t believe the extremely biased reviews of The New York Times, The New Yorker, and other media. Go and see it. Music lovers will enjoy a splendid mix of popular and classical Cuban music, and a great original score which will make a nice CD.",

      "name": "Delightful silent comedy about Hollywood from King Vidor.",
      "reviewBody": "Another superb production from King Vidor (The Big Parade, The Crowd, The Citadel, The Champ, War and Peace, Northwest Passage, Our Daily Bread). Vidor&apos;s movies are always well directed (the way the camera tells the story can not be faulted), but sometimes the performances are not good (in Our Daily Bread, for example), or the movie as a whole is not good. But this is one of Vidor&apos;s really great ones. Remembered as one of the only occasions Marion Davies was allowed to play comedy by sugar-daddy and executive producer William Randolph Hearst (a.k.a Citizen Kane), also known as her best movie. She plays comedy wonderfully - which makes it a shame that Hearst thought that to be a &quot;serious actress&quot; meant costume dramas.\n\nWhich is actually what this movie is about. It has so many elements of Davies&apos; own story, also told in rather comic-book fashion through Susan Alexander in Citizen Kane. Here, Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) is brought to Hollywood by her fat, seemingly rich, hick father, in order to become a serious movie actress. She gets signed by a certain studio, without knowing they are a comedy studio similar to Mack Sennet&apos;s pie-throwing studio, and sort of falls into getting known as a comic actress, as well as falling in love with a kind clown named Billy Boone (William Haines). As in Vidor&apos; The Citadel, she starts off doing the ideal thing (having fun and playing comedy), and gets seduced from this path by others. She is signed by the &quot;High Arts&quot; studio, where she is encouraged to act hoity-toity and associate with the &quot;Hollywood elite,&quot; thereby ignoring all her old friends, including Billy Boone.\n\nShow People is a really great comedy - really fun, really well made, well acted, written, and has the delightful value of featuring cameos from many silent legends including Chaplin, Fairbanks, Gilbert, cowboy William S Hart and others. Cameo value is also added by Vidor himself, who pokes fun at himself as a director of war movies when he appears doing just that in the final sequence, and as a director of &quot;high art.&quot; At one point Peggy and Billy are at the movies having just seen their latest movie, which is to be followed by Vidor&apos;s production &quot;Bardley&apos;s the Magnificent&quot; (a real Vidor film from 2 years before). Peggy wants to stay and watch it, and Billy says in not so many words: what would you want to watch such pretensious rubbish for?",

      "reviewBody": "This programme, with the English title &quot;Pearl Harbour - Who Fired First?&quot; was broadcast on the History Channel in the UK between 0000-0100 on Saturday 15 March 2008.\n\nThe programme&apos;s central theme was the claim that the duty destroyer in Hawaiian waters at dawn on Sunday 7 September 1941, the USS Ward, had fired on, and sunk, a midget submarine - a claim that was not believed, and certainly not proved, until recent years.\n\nThe Japanese sent five midget submarines, as well as the hundreds of carrier-launched naval aircraft, to attack the US Fleet at Pearl Harbour (Pearl Harbor). The midget submarines, launched from the deck of a larger submarine, were an early form of kamikaze (they had insufficient fuel for a return journey).\n\nOne was found washed up on a beach in the islands in December 1941. The other four were not found at the time but, as this film showed in the last fifteen minutes of footage, one of them has now been found by underwater researchers and it is clear that she was sunk through gunfire, thus proving the story of the sailors of USS Ward.\n\nThe film has interviews with veterans from the US and Japan, as well as clips of interviews with historians of the period. There is good footage of various aspects of the attack on Pearl Harbour, as well as an overview of the reasons for Japan&apos;s decision to wage war.\n\nThis is a true story of Pearl Harbour and will be of interest to anyone with a serious interest in the subject. Perhaps it should have been a bonus film on the DVD of the feature film Pearl Harbor (2001).",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is an early, forgotten example of Germany trying to make more ambitious art house films in the post war period that only produced light comedies, genre films and so called Heimatfilms (rural life love stories). This is the first movie in what would later be called &quot;New German Cinema&quot; with much more successful directors like Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Edgar Reitz or Alexander Kluge. It was released just three month after the »Oberhausener Manifest«, the declaration that Germany will now make more ambitious films and the Father&apos;s cinema is dead.\n\n&quot;Das Brot der frühen Jahre&quot; is an adaption Heinrich Böll&apos;s novella of the same name, about young washing machine repairman Walter Fendrich. The privation of the post war years has made him a hungry and cold, only interest is having enough to not hunger. Even in the present where, because of his job, he is a prosperous sought-after person. When he is asked to help student Hedwig Muller from his village to settle in the city, he start to consider if another life, if love is possible.\n\nThe pretty obvious model for &quot;Das Brot der frühen Jahre&quot; are the European art films from the likes of Alain Resnais or Michelangelo Antonioni. It features the same disjointed, unconventional narrative techniques with an emphasis on the images. Those images by cinematographer Wolf Wirth are the best thing about this movie and are on par with what they tried to archive here. The structure and narration are not. Herbert Vesely tries to lay »Nouveau roman« style a mosaic of memories, reactions, internal dialogues and dialog fragments that are sadly only a pale imitation of his role models and seem a bit forced and repetitive. Main actor is Christian Doermer, who germans will know as Horst Buchholz&apos;s young brother in »Die Halbstarken« (Teenage Wolfpack), he does an okay job as Walter Fendrich.\n\nThe film premiered at the 1962 Cannes Film festival, because director Vesely was understandably more interested in the opinion of french film critics than german ones. Those panned the film, let&apos;s not forget Antonioni&apos;s »L&apos;eclisse« ran at the same festival and does this style so much better. Upon returning home it did receive the German Film Award but was soon forgotten. To this day not available on DVD or BluRay. It took decades for Vesely to make a film again and all of those where panned by german critics.\n\nSo, not a great film, but interesting one, that is beautiful to look at.",

We all now well know the views held on homosexuality by Hitler&apos;s socialist party which was coming into power during the time this movie was made. The entire film foreshadowed many of the things that would happen to people who were not seen as desirable in the eyes of the German government. One part especially, where the students and teachers were forbidden to have contact with Manuela, spoke of the public shunning of Jews and other so-called undesirables who were forbidden contact with other people. Of the three movies that Leontine Sagan directed this was the only one made in Germany. Given the fact that Sagan was of Jewish ancestry and the main theme of this movie was of love between women, it&apos;s not hard to see why her career in Germany was short lived.",

I also got the sense that the cast have great chemistry with each other. All the Max Pinlig films are good, however this is definitely the peak of the trilogy. Please do yourself a favor and give it a watch. If you are a teenager you have to see it with your parents.

      "reviewBody": "I first saw &quot;Funny Lady&quot; in 1979, when it was in heavy rotation on Showtime. At the time I loved it. Not a surprise: I was 12, in the early stages of my Barbra Streisand obsession and it was the first one of her movies I had ever seen. When it appeared on TCM recently I decided to take another look now that more than 30 years have passed, my Streisand obsession has cooled and I&apos;ve since seen &quot;Funny Girl,&quot; as well as everything else in the Streisand filmography save &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (you have to draw the line somewhere). I still enjoyed it, but I saw it for what it was: a contractual obligation.\n\nStreisand didn&apos;t want to make the movie — reportedly only agreeing to it when threatened with a lawsuit — and it shows in her performance, the star often appearing annoyed and impatient with the proceedings. But then, who could blame her? The story, loosely based on Fanny Brice&apos;s marriage to Billy Rose, isn&apos;t fully developed here, lazily told and clumsily directed by Herbert Ross, with montages filling in the cracks between a few dramatic moments and musical numbers. In fact, &quot;Funny Lady&quot; at times plays like one of those vapid vehicles Hollywood sticks singers in just to cash in on his/her popularity, like &quot;Burlesque,&quot; to cite a recent (and much worse) example. James Caan, as Rose, is good but he and Streisand never quite click, as if the stars were filmed in separate sound stages and spliced together in the editing room. Roddy McDowell flits at the periphery in the thankless role of Fanny&apos;s gay friend/assistant; Omar Sharif reprises his role as Nicky Arnstein in what&apos;s little more than an extended cameo, his character now a money grubbing cad; and Ben Vereen is in one musical number and quickly dismissed (the rest of his role landed on the cutting room floor).\n\nI was also struck by how thrown-together the movie looked, with sets and costumes looking like castoffs from &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; (the &quot;Great Day&quot; musical number in particular could just as easily have been part of Cher&apos;s Vegas performances in the &apos;70s). And how about that final scene, set more than a decade later, with Streisand in a horrible helmet of gray hair and Caan&apos;s hair and mustache sprayed white, yet neither star looking a day older than 35.\n\nAnd yet Streisand can still enthrall. I loved her musical numbers, particularly her bitter rendition of &quot;How Lucky Can You Get,&quot; the ballad &quot;If I Love Again,&quot; and the &quot;Don&apos;t Rain on My Parade&quot;-wannabe, &quot;Let&apos;s Hear it for Me.&quot; Barbra even has some good dramatic moments, particularly a somber scene where Fanny and Rose discuss their relationship after she&apos;s catches him in bed with the star of his aquatic revue, Eleanor Holm. &quot;Funny Lady&quot; is less a sequel to &quot;Funny Girl&quot; than a star vehicle. Luckily, Streisand has enough power to drive it, even though this star vehicle doesn&apos;t have much under the hood.",

      "reviewBody": "In the fall of 2010, I spent a short time on the set of an independent film called &quot;The Boarder,&quot; which was being shot in rural Nebraska. And one thing that I did learn while mingling amongst the technicians and actors was that even in something as aesthetically-driven as a motion picture, and with something passionate as a subject matter, it is still entirely possible for things to sour up and become impersonal. Movie-making is not easy, and the stress, I&apos;m afraid, can wear out the artistic drive in some of us, especially if it&apos;s an early endeavor. That very well may have been the case, I&apos;m afraid to say, with Adrian Vitoria&apos;s &quot;Age of Heroes.&quot;\n\nAgain, it&apos;s hard to imagine a film based on a true story to be passionless and impersonal, but that is the case here. &quot;Age of Heroes&quot; is loosely based on a World War II British commando unit&apos;s mission to garner Germany intelligence. The particular mission was drawn up by Ian Fleming, who would later go on to write the James Bond novel series. So a story about men who risked and gave their lives, even in a shoestring budget film like this, is hard to imagine as soulless. But it is.\n\nThe way this movie is filmed, acted, scored, and executed, it&apos;s as if the filmmakers simply pulled the story out of a box full of potential stories and decided to roll along with it. Because it was their job, not because they particularly wanted to. Filming the battle scenes in this movie must have been very difficult, and unfortunately, the stress the directors and technicians had on them is apparent. It can be felt, and as a result, the scenes, meant to be white-hot, have a sort of staged, phony feeling to them.\n\nThere are worthy actors in the movie, headed by Sean Bean, but not one of them as a real part to act. What little personality they have is drawn straight out of previous war pictures. The key example is a tough commando sergeant, played with zest by William Houston; really just a pale imitation of the much-more-impressive gunnery sergeant from Stanley Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; back in 1987.\n\nIf the film can be redeemed, it is in that it does not appear to aim particularly high. It doesn&apos;t have a big goal, so it doesn&apos;t accomplish much, and the failure isn&apos;t quite as compounding as it otherwise might have been. And a brisk 94 minutes, &quot;Age of Heroes&quot; was already over by the time I was really starting to grow bored.",

The acting is predictably predictable, but still fun. Aside from Crawford, the other characters include a ravishing Barbera Carrera as the gorgeous Russian spy Wilkins falls for, and Oliver Reed as her &quot;old fling&quot;.  If for no other reason than to see a pre-&quot;Phantom&quot; Crawford in an outrageous role, this movie is worth at least a look."

      "reviewBody": "Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam is directed by Robert Siodmak and written by Will Berthold (article) and Werner Jörg Lüddecke. It stars Claus Holm, Annemarie Düringer, Mario Adorf, Hannes Messemer, Carl Lange and Werner Peters. Music is by Siegfried Franz and cinematography by Georg Krause.\n\nA serial killer is terrorising Hamburg, Germany, during World War II. When the local police struggle to catch him, the Gestapo are brought in to crack the case.\n\nThe basis for the story is that of real life serial killer Bruno Lüdke, here played by Adorf. Yet this is only a side-bar to the actuality of Siodmak&apos;s film, for it&apos;s a clinical deconstruction of Nazi Germany at the time, a look at the final throes of that regime. It shows how the corrupt powers would do anything to not make their government look bad, with orders even coming from Adolf himself! It&apos;s all very fascinating and potent, and well performed. There&apos;s some nice visual touches via the night sequences, though you reasonably expect to have more from Siodmak, a fine purveyor of expressionism and noir chiaroscuro. There&apos;s some contrivances and a couple of badly staged action sequences, but this remains a tough political drama with mystery shadings. 8/10",

In truth, I&apos;m always shocked it was made at all. It&apos;s subject matter beyond the pale of even the low-life studio execs who make the big decisions. The most important and amazing consideration is it was intended as mainstream release. Its not a Troma shclock job. Its a very well made, extremely well written film about a very naughty topic. Consider it a blooper, an accident, if you will, but its great. Quick synopsis, a middle aged dude messes around and falls in love with his best friends 18 year old daughter. And its not exactly tastefully told. There&apos;s a ton of gratuitous nudity which is what really dooms it, and makes it just the sort of oddity and pariah people so love to hate. I&apos;m old now, but when i fell in love with it I was like 19 so wipe the perverted sanctimonious smirk off of your face! I like good comedy and well made on location vacation pics, that inspire me to travel. So it&apos;s the Peters-Gelbart script and the wonderful scenery that have won it a place in my cold heart. Ok, ok, topless 18 year old girls are a decided bonus.",

The &quot;special effects&quot; were anything but - the space ships looked clunky and seemed to have enormous interiors - and the steam valves look like those you&apos;d find in any present-day boiler room!

There is no character development like in the first installment, however the story is more complicated and it takes more effort to explain it.\n\nThe First movie, concentrates on a BOPE squad, and the drug dealers it fights. Elite Squad 2 shows a bigger picture. It shows the politicians and Defense system mechanism that operates the squad, and the purposes it is used for. Instead of police corruption we see here murderers in uniform.\n\nThere are some flaws in the plot, and it slightly falls in comparison with the first one, however, overall it&apos;s very impressive.\n\nI would recommend seeing The first installment before."

They even end up in yet another car chase with bad guys, what are the odds? The only difference is that neither of the cars ends up in a swimming pool this time around, making the scene about a hundred times less awesome. The son isn&apos;t spying on female tennis players anymore, now he&apos;s turned to basketball. And then some crooks catch him and want to beat him up, just like in you&apos;ve guessed it, the first one. There are some new jokes that work, but mostly the makers really just relied on the audience having low expectations and wanting more of the same. Which I guess isn&apos;t a particularly dumb move. If you liked the first one you&apos;ll like the sequel too, because it involves the same elements (crude jokes, action scenes, Tatjana Simic naked), but overall it seems rather phoned in.",

It&apos;s superior to the current family movies in a number of reasons; lovely color, the realism of a vet&apos;s life, delightful Scots Highlands locations, a fine dramatic structure bolstered by that underrated actor Patrick Macgoohan and by a pretty, startlingly black-eyed starlet named Susan Hampshire (the two represent science and faith, respectively, and they come together with an ease you wish these two opponents would share today). But the film is mostly about the tragedy of losing a cat, and the childish, unkillable hope that one day they&apos;ll return. The sequence of cat heaven, ruled by the Goddess Bast, is reminiscent of the best of Michael Powell, explicitly referencing Powell&apos;s A Matter of Life and Death. The excellent animation is done by the pioneer of the cartoon industry Ub Iweks. A family movie in the day when kids were tougher, it was memorably broadcast on Disney&apos;s Wonderful World of Color on TV. I Expect wracking sobs in the scene where a rain- soaked Thomasina comes to the window. Jeez, I&apos;m tearing up right now, just thinking about it.",

Like many others it is a Spanish-Italian co-production but unlike most, it is primarily an Iberian rather than a spaghetti production. Whatever the case, it sports a plot-line that can be found in many Italian westerns from the time seeing as it is essentially a revenge-themed story featuring a mysterious loner with superb weapon skills and with a comic Mexican bandit thrown in for good measure. So you could say that it isn&apos;t a film with a massive amount of originality. But I actually found this one to be clearly above average for this kind of thing. Its Spanish leanings came through by way of slightly less typical music and its feel was a little lighter overall. But it also has a very satisfying and pleasingly unpredictable ending which rounded things off rather well. The cast as a whole wasn&apos;t very familiar to me mostly, aside from Eduardo Fajardo who was the chief villain, he also played a very similar role in Sergio Corbucci&apos;s highly influential earlier spaghetti western, Django (1966). On the whole, this is one is well worth seeking out, especially if you wish to expand your knowledge of the Paella western sub-genre.",

I can usually find some small redeeming quality that makes say &quot;hey, I&apos;ve seen worse&quot;.\n\nBad acting, horrible screenplay and the cheesy &quot;shot with an iPhone&quot; look really made this one of the worst things I&apos;ve ever seen and it had no redeeming value at all.\n\nAs mentioned in the header, the movie equivalent of sugar free Haribo Gummies.

      "reviewBody": "It starts with a scene &quot;borrowed&quot; from the American television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Chen Hung-Lieh is the student earning his branded forearms by carrying the cauldron. He states he has followed the rules and now can leave. The master tells him he cannot leave because even though he trained for nine years he is evil. (It seems the master saw this problem coming for a long time, could have fixed it, but did nothing. Oh well, if this made sense there wouldn&apos;t be a movie to watch. The other option is something is missing in the English dubbing. I&apos;ll go with that excuse/explanation.) Cut to the small tea house. The jerks harass the happy couple. The heroes wait until somebody dies then step forward. The jerk is killed and his brother, the leader of the bad guys, swears revenge. Chen Hung-Lieh returns to the movie at about 20 minutes in and slaughters an entire family just to make sure the audience did not forget who the bad guy really is. Chiang Pin also appears as a disappointment to his father. The drama escalates with a love triangle between him and two sisters. My copy is English dubbed and not by the &quot;A list&quot; of dubbers. This makes a big difference. Dr. Craig D. Reid in his book &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Martial Arts Movies of the 1970s&quot; describes the experience of working to dub these movies into English. I always consider that before I do any complaining about the dubbing, count to ten, and move on politely. The video quality is comparable to VHS resolution. The screen dimensions simulate but are not really widescreen. The worst part of this video process is that the picture seems acceptable but when the action starts the pixellation also starts. I don&apos;t know anything more about this other than to complain about it. So many of these movies all look alike yet there is always the hope of watching some kind of special moment. This movie has that at about the one hour ten minute mark. The hero pushes a boat (the kind you see for a typical river crossing) and with the wire work he becomes a propeller and the boat becomes airborne. It is totally off the hook but I bet you will rewind it and watch it more than once! I loved it! I give this movie a small recommendation exclusively for fans of martial arts movies of the golden age from 1967 to 1984 and rate it just a tad above average for the year and genre.",

Normally with these kinds of plots the guy after wooing his dream girl chooses the best friend with the whole brains over beauty scenario, and it usually annoys me but this time so the best friend is played by JLH so it&apos;s really a win-win situation for Brad. So in short I really liked this movie especially with the comedic plot if your looking for like a serious movie this isn&apos;t for you, but if you like just want to hang out and watch a teen comedy with some over the top humor(yet still funny) this movie is a great choice.",

You have guys in Chimp suits. You have Roddy. You have Kim Hunter from the first flick. It&apos;s great.\n\nMy chief memory/image of the flick is seeing them, the trio of apes, being given the Star treatment, getting outta a limousine in front of a crowded city street, etc. That is very much a part of the flick. It was made in &apos;71, and yeah it really, really looks it-but ya gotta like it. William Windom as da Prez is pretty cool too, def. a knockoff of hostile Nixon in places I would say.\n\nThis sets up the next two fine, though its both better than them and better than #2 in the run also. I think you can do worse than to sit through this.......\n\n**1/2 outta ****"

I can&apos;t wait till it&apos;s on again to tape it.  While following the format of a light, romantic comedy, this movie takes a close look at some of the details of food and its place in society.  It follows the career of an American would-be master chef from seeing why he is dishonorably discharged from the navy to life in his family&apos;s pizza parlor to the chance to go to France and study under a French &quot;multi-star&quot; chef.  The comedy comes from a good natured mockery of the various pomposities of the chefs, sous-chefs, food critics, tax inspectors, doctors, etc.  I thought the plot was quite elaborate, and I liked all the little elements of the movie that gave it the complex flavor of a good pot a feu -- the fight at the market, the dance lessons by the middle eastern kitchen cleaner, the tantric yoga sessions, etc.  Even the restaurant&apos;s little white panel truck, which you see all over the place in France (they even use them up in the vineyards).  I read the few reviews that this movie received, and I think the film is grossly under-rated.  There are only a few minor dubbing problems, which I barely noticed.  The acting is uniformly good, and you&apos;re left with a great feeling, and the urge to go out to eat at a good French restaurant right away!  I would urge people to find the movie and watch it -- even though it apparently is not available in any format except German pal videotape. Check it out on WE."

      "reviewBody": "Before you decide whether to watch &quot;Boiler Room&quot; you need to decide if you are willing to watch a movie with the F-bomb being dropped 323420854 times. It is an excellent film...but if you are offended by cursing, look elsewhere.\n\nThe story is about Seth, a young man with little in the way of conscience. Instead of working hard the normal and expected way, Seth wants to cut corners. So while his peers go to college, he skips classes and opens a casino in his house...and makes a ton of money. However, Seth&apos;s hard-as-nails father is naturally disappointed in him...and makes that obvious. Wanting to make something of himself and impress his dad, Seth goes to work for a trading company. But this is not exactly the Wall Street variety firm but instead their attitude is say and do ANYTHING to make the sale...anything. They&apos;re obviously a sleazy outfit but just how sleazy is something Seth has to discover for himself...and even with Seth is a bit appalled by this...but he loves all the money!\n\nThe film is coarse and crass--and this is appropriate for the 20- somethings that star in the film. They are, by and large, guys with no souls and are motivated by greed and self-indulgence. The overall film is much like &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; and &quot;Wall Street&quot; merged into one...and targeted to a slightly younger audience. Well made and hard to see without being impressed. However, I am very surprised that after writing and directing such a fine film that Ben Younger STILL is mostly making short films and his feature career hasn&apos;t taken off. I&apos;d sure love to know why...",

With what I could recall from reading the original novel (after seeing the modern version), I found this cinematic version infinately better and denser in character exposition than the 1999 version.  In this 1963 version, the ending stayed closer to what happened in the novel and that was the definitive moment of The Haunting.  I can&apos;t say much for the modern version, other than it was an effects film.\n\nWhat I found original in this 1963 version is that there were some clever uses of lensing effects to heighten the strangeness of Hill House.  By  adjusting the props in the sets so that they are off by a few degrees, it helps to unsettle the viewer. \n\nI&apos;m hoping for a dvd release so that I can own both versions of the film. In the meantime, read the novel.  There were a few details left out."

It&apos;s an early version (but not the earliest) of &quot;You&apos;ve Got Mail&quot;. It&apos;s not really a musical, just merely a movie that just happen to have some songs in it. The songs are nothing spectacular like you would expect when you hear the word &apos;musical&apos;. So, if you don&apos;t like musical movies this movie might still be very well worth your time as well.\n\nDon&apos;t let the year it was made in scare you of. This is a movie that doesn&apos;t ever get outdated, mainly thanks to its fun and easy to watch, kind of atmosphere.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Nice slower and somewhat uncommon pursuit... and the way things develop are not patterned which means it has a unique and lovely pace. I found this film to be most interesting. Thankfully not another mindless shoot em up. I thought this film would suck at first, but *wow* I wound up getting wrapped up and being entertained, this is why we have cinema... nice treasure... good job! I have hopes nobody dissects this film. When the entire movie unfolds I experienced many unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. The characters are entirely human and have either honor or not... passion or not... forgiveness or not. Wound up loving the White Horse, the Indian, Sheen... even the damned desert was great.

      "reviewBody": "This story mostly revolves around a boy called, actually &quot;boy&quot; throughout the film. His parents are not happy, with his mom Lin trying to leave the son and his father (the boy&apos;s parents are not legally married) in the beginning of the film. Once she does, it is up to his father Sheng (well played by Aaron Kwok) to take care of the boy. He is a hopeless gambler, always in debt and they leave their town in China for a better chance at sustaining themselves. The film is straightforward in its telling, moving at a semi-slow pace. The film is also atmospheric at times, with the cinematography at times superb. The story in and of itself is not immediate, variations of it have been done before, but its well filmed. The reason for the grade not being higher is its lack of synergy with the characters. You may or may not care for them as the film progresses, but you don&apos;t relate to them. I suppose this is a slice of life in which the point may be that it&apos;s hard to rise above your station in life without making an honest attempt at change. That being said, this film reminds me somewhat of Wong Kar-Wai&apos;s films, it shares in those films a simple approach to a deceptively simple story. Its a good film, but not a masterpiece. It is, however, worth watching.",

The story of the unhappy and depressive crown prince Rudolf has been filmed several times, but never in such a fascinating and deeply morbid way. Rudolf Prack&apos;s performance is probably the best of his whole career, Christiane Hörbiger&apos;s debut is moving but not too sweet (in fact she is playing much harsher and more realistic a part that would have been tailor-made for young Romy Schneider). Lil Dagover, the &quot;Grand Dame&quot; of German cinema delivers a convincing portrait of the &quot;old&quot; empress Elisabeth (Sissi), trying to get away from her husband as often as possible and leaving her son to desperation and loneliness. The way Jugert uses color is remarkable and completely different from other German or Austrian films of that period. Everything is dark and gloomy and the coloured walls, curtains and tapestries seem to be as overripe and decaying as the whole house of Habsburg. Don&apos;t miss the gloomy beginning with the burials of Rudolph and his young mistress which sets the atmosphere for the rest of the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Bobby Cooper is on his way to pay off his gambling debt to a Las Vegas loan shark.  However when his car breaks down he has to wait in a small town until it is fixed.  Unwittingly he is meets a beautiful woman and her husband, who offers him money to kill her.  With the odds stacking up against Bobby he finds himself drawn deeper into greed, theft and murder.\n\nThis was a step away from political dramas and conspiracy thrillers for Oliver Stone, here he takes a standard film-noir plot and gives it his own touch.  The plot is pure noir - full of shady characters, femme fatales, double crosses and murder, but it is compelling right till the end.  It&apos;s thrilling to see Bobby become trapped in the town of Superior by a series of events (some coincidental, some deliberate) and unable to get away from the inevitable.\n\nBut what Stone does makes it even better.  He films the whole thing in a style similar to that of Natural Born Killers, except not as graphic.  He uses different film stocks, he cuts in different shots of characters while they voice over - the overall effect adds to the tension and the feeling of excitement.  However he also makes good use of the wide landscape and uses long panoramic shots - this isn&apos;t a pop video director!  Another great touch is the music - it&apos;s not moody like most noirs but instead mirrors the bright desert by being upbeat and unusual, the overall effect being a very quirky feeling.\n\nThe cast are roundly excellent and a great list of names.  Sean Penn is totally believable as someone who tries to avoid the unavoidable and you do feel like he&apos;s trapped.  Lopez has not been better - she is every inch the sultry femme fatale.  Nolte is creepy as her husband, and does well mixing his gruff exterior with deeper guilt.  Powers Booth, Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes are all good in minor but still important characters.  Pleasant surprises exist in the rest of the cast with Jon Voight, Laurie Metcalf and Liv Tyler making cameos - although in the case of Tyler I found it more distracting than the others (she appears in the background as if the film is saying &quot;look - it&apos;s Liv Tyler&quot;.\n\nOverall an excellent criminally-ignored film with a great cast and the touch of a great director."

Nicholas Cage remains a most accessible and plausible character especially in roles like this, where a clever fellow discerns a golden path to riches and sells his soul during the flawed journey.\n\nIn the IMDB trivia, it is interesting this movie was never funded by US sources, probably because the truth hits a little too close to home, and makes people uncomfortable. As the movie ironically points out, the biggest arms suppliers on the planet are also permanent members of the UN security council.\n\nBack to the movie itself. Since it is based on real lords of war and warlords, it&apos;s coldly terrifying to see how easy the means for mass murder have been made available across the world. As many have noted, it is far easier to kill from a distance than from up close, giving the killers a false sense of morality and deniability.\n\nThis movie has aged very well - the insidious arms trade it highlights is as active and lethal today as it was for the last 100 years. As a beloved game series Fallout points out, &quot;War. War never changes.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Stanley Kubrick&apos;s final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It&apos;s no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren&apos;t merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford&apos;s sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film&apos;s center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters&apos; trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick&apos;s favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it&apos;s inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man&apos;s dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick&apos;s contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick&apos;s final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick&apos;s more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that &apos;Observancy is a dying art&apos; and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it&apos;s easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick&apos;s musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick&apos;s Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick&apos;s films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.\n\nSydney Pollock&apos;s Ziegler argues, during his amazing final monologue, that the Masonic orgies are practiced by society&apos;s elite which excludes Bill. Bill spends the duration of the film&apos;s first half attempting to engage in infidelity after his wife reveals that she was willing to choose one night with a naval officer over their future. Naturally, this enrages Bill and he spends the night attempting to fulfill his personal need to subjugate his feelings of impotence, sexual and otherwise. Even in the very beginning, when Bill walks with two models, his short stature implicitly denotes his lack of power. Bill is convinced that he has been subjected to a life of domesticity and his wife is responsible; he vows to reaffirm his masculinity. Kubrick paints long shots of New York at midnight which is designed to inspire the viewer with dread. Almost every single beautiful shot capturing the very essence of soft, warm colors in the beginning soon descends into the dark and strong colors that reflect the very dream-state many describe when they watch this film. Yet, to me, it evokes a foreboding death-like state which suggests impending doom. \n\nBill&apos;s quest for reaffirmation of his masculinity only renders him emasculated when he enters a Masonic orgy and is rendered socially powerless by a group of the masked elite. Bill&apos;s journey neither leads him towards enlightenment nor satisfaction but humiliation and understanding that he has been domesticated by the higher classes. Ironically, his quest for sexual empowerment only led him to the understanding of social domesticity; Bill is not as influential or elite as he had initially anticipated. Not unlike the elite&apos;s perception of women; they use the high-class prostitutes as objects valued for their material value which reflects their perception of the masses that are responsible for their success. As in the beginning, when Ziegler needs Bill to revive a dying woman who almost overdoses on a combination of cocaine and heroin, Ziegler values Bill for his medical expertise which prevented trouble with the law rather than his personality. Kubrick&apos;s film argues that we live in ignorance of others perceptions of us and this is the ultimate existential fear of Harford; the elite have seen Harford unmasked, vulnerable and exposed. Pollock says &apos;If you knew who was there, you wouldn&apos;t sleep so well.&apos; Kubrick has finally exposed man for who he really is; vulnerable and ignorant of the mysterious forces which govern him. The final and most playfully complex of cinema&apos;s closing lines concludes that Bill and Alice Harford have learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. They refuse to acknowledge their social impotence and would prefer for their eyes to remain wide shut, ignorant to the mysterious forces that govern them. On a more optimistic note, however, perhaps Bill&apos;s odyssey only made him aware of his vulnerability, and Kubrick evokes this through the dark imagery that recreates the sense of subjective paranoia that Bill is experiencing. Bill realizes what ultimately matters: love and family, as opposed to the power which he initially craved but only realized he was at the mercy of others&apos; application of such social power. I&apos;m open to many interpretations of this film, because Kubrick wanted the audience&apos;s eyes to remain wide open soon after they finished experiencing this masterpiece.",
