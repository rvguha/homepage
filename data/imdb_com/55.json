However, Ecco is highly entertaining in its variety of rituals from different cultures all over the world. I had to Google the reindeer thing, and it&apos;s actually true (or once was before it was outlawed). There&apos;s also some reasonably tame but historically accurate presentations of burlesque dancing. This isn&apos;t the sort of documentary that you could share with the whole family, because of the adult content and also because with mondo cinema it&apos;s unclear what is real and what is exaggerated or staged. But this one&apos;s fun!",

The 1st episode with the enchanting Elke Sommer is lovely and touching and if there is an actress with a sweeter smile than Ms. Sommer&apos;s, I don&apos;t know who it is. \n\n The 2nd one about a love-starved husband trying to get his wife&apos;s attention while she reads or talks on the phone is a crack-up.  Nino Mandredi (husband) is brilliant with his comic timing and frustration and the gorgeous Virna Lisi is stunning as always.\n\nThe 3rd one with the lovely Monica Vitti runs out of steam but Monica Vitti was a wonderful presence in foreign films of the 1960&apos;s.\n\nThe 4th with the curvaceous and sexy Gina Lollobrigida (with either blonde or red hair) is helped immeasurably by the bovine presence of Akim Tamiroff. None of these episodes are classic, but I spent a pleasant 2 hours watching them.  These &quot;teasing&quot; &quot;sex&quot; comedies have a life of their own, although I wish Elke Sommer hadn&apos;t been dubbed.  Oh well!  A 5 out of 10.",

Be prepared to think, and revel in one woman&apos;s amazing ability to constantly provoke us to examine and re-examine our human condition. Ulysse itself uses one particular photo the director took back in 1954 to re-examine both the time, subject(s), and meaning of that photo. What sounds like it could be a dry intellectual enterprise is treated with great care and love by Agnès Varda. What in less assured hands would seem pedantic turns into the revelatory. Anyone who can take the still image and breathe life into it deserves her ranking as one of the major film-makers in world cinema today or any day.",

It&apos;s not a bad movie, especially if you enjoy Ms. Tapping&apos;s work.  My roomate commented that &quot;they needed a bigger budget&quot; and I agree - some of the effects were a little cheap.  Considering, however, that the actors are not HUGE stars and that it seems to be a lower budget film, it was very interesting.  The premise about a black hole was fascinating to me (though my roomate, the astrophysics major, seems to think it sounds a little unsound - she hasn&apos;t watched it, though) and it was fun to watch Ms. Tapping in another role.  Granted, it seemed like a reincarnation of Sam Carter from Stargate - still beautiful and brainy but without the guns and aliens - but all in all it was interesting to see and worth the money I paid to rent the DVD.  The Void reminded me of an extended episode of Andromeda/Stargate placed in an alternate universe without the aliens.  Or the stargate.  Or a lot of guns.  But the same &quot;feel&quot; to the show.  Sounds odd, I know.  I won&apos;t list The Void as one of my top five movies but I will say that it was very entertaining and a great study break."

Despite the bright new consumer society of the 1950&apos;s the ghosts of the immediate Nazi past just won&apos;t go away. Lots of delicious subtleties to look out for: the policeman giving directions to the police station starts to say &apos;Adolf Hilter Platz&apos; but just stops himself in time and the quotation from the Horst Wesel Lied in the soundtrack when the Prosecutor enters the court building. The comedy mainly stems from the Prosecutor&apos;s frantic attempts to suppress any evidence of his Nazi past. Roses for the Prosecuter must have trod on many toes at the time. Definitely worth watching today - like all good satire this is also a very funny film.",

Perhaps the budget caused the director to pinch things. \n\nI did like the homage to The Godfather with the scene following where the grocery bag falls to the pavement. Nice touch.\n\nThere could have been so much more, but the movie felt hollow. The actual heist itself seemed to me almost an afterthought. Such a pity, because the drama could really have been built there step by step, scene by scene. I kept waiting for the payoff. Frankly, I was confused at which player took the bullet until the denouement. The last third of the movie was muddy, or perhaps &apos;smoky&apos;.\n\nI really wish that I could rank this movie higher than I did, but that&apos;s show biz, I guess.",

Hollywood product, with intentions that seem sincere, adapted from a Pearl Buck novel and starring...Katharine Hepburn? Actually, Kate is not flossy or &quot;regal&quot; here; she&apos;s nobody&apos;s fool and probably knows she&apos;s miscast, but her Asian make-up is commendable and she tries (not in vain) to find a character. In support, Walter Huston and Aline MacMahon, as Hepburn&apos;s Old World in-laws, are excellent. The movie has beautiful cinematography and absorbing passages, but its length is self-defeating and there are some howlers in the script and in much of the casting. Not a hit at the box-office, but by this time people were so used to Hepburn&apos;s hit-or-miss choices that it didn&apos;t hurt her. *** from ****",

      "name": "An okay film made a lot more enjoyable due to DeForrest Kelley&apos;s psycho performance.",
      "reviewBody": "I have been on an A.C. Lyles kick recently--seeing about a dozen of his movies in the last week. This producer was known for making low-budget westerns in the 1960s that feature actors who were well past their prime. In other words, old guys--VERY old guys. Sometimes this didn&apos;t work very well (such as during fight scenes between VERY aged actors) but generally I like the films, as the actors, though out of fashion, still have it in most cases. And, interestingly, Lyles used many of the same actors in many of his films--and Richard Arlen in apparently ALL of them! This film stars Rory Calhoun and also features the likes of Lon Chaney, DeForrest Kelley, John Russell (all frequent Lyles performers), Gene Evans, Corinne Calvet, Johnny Mack Brown, and Red Barry. Brown, Kelley and Barry both were once big names in TV and B-westerns and it&apos;s nice to see them here.\n\nThe film begins with Jim Walker (Calhoun) and Bill Gibson (Arthur Hunnicutt) being attacked by Apache warriors. They manage to fight their way out and discover among the Indian dead souvenirs the Apache took of recent attacks on the US Cavalry. They soon meet up with some soldiers (led by Arlen) and inform them of what they found. Well, oddly, no one in town seems to believe them--thinking Walker and Gibson are over-blowing the problem. And so, the local stage decides to go anyway--even with the possibility of crazed Indians waiting to attack. Oddly, Walker and Gibson agree to go along on the stage to help protect the passengers. Unfortunately, a super-crazy hired gun (Kelley) is on board--and he&apos;s a born trouble-maker. You just KNOW that sooner or later, he and Walker are going to have it out once and for all. However, it becomes a lot more interesting when the gunman, his friend and his boss suddenly take everyone hostage. Now, the folks might not need to worry about the Apache. What&apos;s next? See the film and find out yourself.\n\nIn many ways, this film seems a bit like a reworking of the film &quot;Stagecoach&quot;. It is NOT a remake--it just has a LOT of similarities--such as the &apos;hooker with a heart of gold&apos; (Calvet) and the embezzler. Because of this, there&apos;s not a lot of originality here, though it was made more enjoyable due to Kelley&apos;s VERY florid performance. While not quite as enjoyable, Chaney was also quite good as a grizzled old coot. But, if the you watch the film, understand it is NOT high art! There are lots of sloppy problems with it--more than you&apos;d usually find in a Lyles film. For example, there is a scene where Evans and Calhoun have a fist-fight--and it&apos;s VERY obvious they&apos;re using stunt-men. Heck, while Evans is balding, his stuntman has a full head of hair. Also, there is a HUGE rainstorm in the film--huge. And yet, the next day, the ground is completely dry--and I am talking about dusty dry! Obviously the director, R.G. Springsteen, was no genius.\n\nWorth seeing if you love the genre or Lyles&apos; productions, though this is not an especially great western.",

      "reviewBody": "The melodrama of which Stahl was one of the masters throughout the  thirties had muted,probably because the importance of the film noir in  the following decade.&quot;Leave her to heaven&apos; is as much a film noir as a  melodrama.What&apos;s particularly puzzling is the color.  Like some Lang ,HItchcock or Tourneur works (&quot;secret beyond the door&quot;  &quot;spellbound&quot; or &quot;cat people&quot;,for instance) ,this is par excellence a  Freudian movie.The heroine has never solved her Oedipus complex :she  has always been in love with her father -dig the scene when Gene  Tierney rides her horse as she throws her father&apos;s ashes away.  The love she could not make with her father ,she will make it through a  third party: a husband who resembles her dad.  This could be fine.She loves her husband to the exclusion of all others  .But there are others ,and they are all living threats.So these  intruders will be enemies.The scene when Tierney sees her family coming  through binoculars can be compared to an attack of Indians or bandits  when the hero is alone in a remote fort in an adventure film ,as  Bertrand Tavernier pointed out in &quot;50 ans de cinéma américain&quot;.  Had the heroine preserved her intimacy -and how stupid her husband was  not to have understood that!-,maybe nothing would have happened.THe  color,which might seem irrelevant in a film noir ,is actually necessary  because &quot;back of the moon&quot; ,the island in the middle of the lake is a  paradise ,soon to become a lost paradise,then a living hell.  A probably never better Gene Tierney outshines every other member of  the cast ,which is first-rate though.Little by little,we see her become  a monster ,and the actress&apos;s performance is so convincing (along with a  superb script from which a lot of today&apos;s writers could draw  inspiration) that it gives her horrible crimes an implacable logic.Like  in a Greek tragedy.  &quot;Leave her to heaven &quot; is by no means &quot;romantic trash&quot; .It&apos;s the  crowning of Stahl &apos;s career in which he transcends both melodrama and  film noir."

When I researched James&apos; life and first watched his biography, he has a personality that quickly eliminated the doubts I had, especially about war photography. I think it&apos;s important for viewers to have positive thoughts about him, as he is open minded and doesn&apos;t shy away from questioning himself on many issues and even criticizes the moral dimensions of different people who do what he does.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s difficult to watch all the evil that war brings, we should congratulate the viewers who try to remain calm. The documentary also invites the audience to question humanity, good and evil at length. Watching the story of James, an important journalist who hopes that good and morality will one day prevail over evil, will add very positive things to you. In addition, the community of people who call themselves photographers and journalists but don&apos;t see this as anything other than making a profit from their job should also watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "Many of the German Krimi movies in the Edgar Wallace collection that I&apos;ve seen thus far are enjoyable, for sure, but also excessively complex and featuring a climax that is both too grotesque and made less impactful by the many plot-twists that came before already. With that in mind, I can honestly state that &quot;Der Hexer&quot; is the best and most effective Krimi of the whole collection! The plot is simple, relatively straightforward, and steadily builds up to a fantastic climax. And the climax truly is fantastic, I assure you, with a dazzling revelation and an even more dazzling surprise ending.\n\nFollowing the murder of his sister, a wanted criminal known as The Magician is expected by Scotland Yard to pop up in London and extract vengeance on the murderers. Inspector Higgens must even accept the help of the now retired but former Scotland Yard top-agent Warren, and meanwhile also uncover the reason by who and why The Magician&apos;s sister got murdered in the first place. The lame humor (as usual provided by Siegfried Schürenberg and Eddi Arent) is luckily kept to a minimum and replaced by good red herrings and feminine beauty. As the tense climax approaches, there&apos;s a joyous gimmick where the screen turns black and displays the question: &quot;do YOU already know who The Magician is?&quot;. I loved it. Reminded me of William Castle, in fact.",

For horrors with relatively low budgets, the way to go is definitely suspense over special effects. With Phobia 2, none of the stories had any level of suspense close to the first&apos;s. The first segment was boring, the second was unoriginal, as was the third (zombies!) but it was still kinda cool, the fourth was kinda messy, and the last story was... fun, actually, since it was humorous and had a couple of twists in it. \n\nI&apos;ll give the movie a marginal thumbs-up based on the third and last stories.",

      "reviewBody": "I Walk Alone is directed by Byron Haskin and adapted to screenplay by Charles Schnee, Robert Smith and John Bright from the play written by Theodore Reeves. It stars Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Lizabeth Scott and Wendell Corey. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by Leo Tover.\n\nFrankie Madison (Lancaster) returns to New York after 14 years in prison. Noll Turner (Douglas), Frankie&apos;s former partner in bootlegging, is now a wealthy nightclub manager, and Frankie is expecting him to honor a verbal &apos;50:50&apos; agreement they made when he was caught and Noll got away...\n\nThis is perfect noir foil for the three main stars, Lancaster is all macho mismanagement and edgy, Douglas is suave, cunning and intense, while Scott smoulders and portrays her conflicted character with believable confusion and an earnest yearning for worth.\n\nThe story intrigues mainly through Frankie being a man out of his time, after serving 14 years in prison, he comes out to find the underworld he once knew has changed considerably. Yet he wants what is his and will put himself through the mangler in the old day way to get what he thinks he rightly deserves. Kay Lawrence (Scott) isn&apos;t a femme fatale, she just borders the type by default until the truth will out and the story arc folds inwards (love the way Tover lights her scenes).\n\nDouglas revels in being a villain, and the Noll Turner character gives him the chance to smarm, charm and trample on anyone who could affect his monetary gains. And so it is left to Corey as Dave to round out the key affecting perfs. He&apos;s the man closest to Frankie, but as a milquetoast type of lawyer, he has, while Frankie was in prison, helped legally cover the financial angles for Noll Turner. All characters are entering noirville and it makes for a satisfying experience for fans of such. 7/10",

To see it reviewed as a comedy is so far removed from my memories of this film, that it makes me want to see it again.

      "reviewBody": "Juggernaut is a well done action / disaster thriller which combines some good performances with great direction and scripting. An extortionist calling himself Juggernaut has planted several bombs aboard the ocean liner Britannic and is threatening to sink the liner in heavy seas if he is not paid off. The film follows an official from the cruise company, a naval bomb defuser, and London police officials as they attempt to prevent a catastrophe.\n\nWhat sets Juggernaut apart from a thousand other &apos;mad bomber&apos; films is that to a large extent it approaches the threat from an official, even technical perspective. Rather than a maverick cop chasing the psychopath around the ship, we get highly suspenseful scenes of professionals trying to defuse bombs. The film plays up the difficulty of defusing a booby-trapped bomb, taking it beyond the film cliché of simply cutting the right wire. The heroes have to get through a variety of hidden snares within the devices before they even get to the wires. Indeed, the sub-plot involving the cruise official serves to remind us that this is not just a &apos;technical exercise,&apos; that there really are lives at stake.\n\nFurthermore, the film does not succumb to the temptation to overplay its villain or make him a flamboyant maniac. Despite his code name serving as the title of the film, Juggernaut does not figure that prominently in the plot. When he does turn up, the performance is quite understated, particularly when compared to the head of the bomb squad. (Only Richard Harris would think that downing a bottle of scotch is good preparation for defusing a bomb.) Indeed, one can argue that the bombs themselves serve as the primary antagonist of the film with their fiendish designs.\n\nThe acting in the film is quite good overall, even if the characters aren&apos;t always that well fleshed out. Richard Harris does a good job as the film&apos;s overall protagonist, lending him a sense of mordant humor that keeps him from becoming a stale action hero. Omar Sharif also does a good job as the ship&apos;s captain, even though his character is largely one note.\n\nJuggernaut does have some weak points. At times, the investigation back in London is given short shrift, so that it is difficult to follow. Furthermore, there are one or two scenes contrived for dramatic effect that take away from the film&apos;s realism. In particular, one scene where a young child gets access to a restricted area of the ship strains credibility. Still, the film definitely stands as a minor classic in its genre.",

      "reviewBody": "Comedic series usually falter down after the third opus, when even the most forgiving audience can&apos;t overlook the enormity of a half-assed script and the lousiness of half-baked gags. \n\nBut every golden rule has an exception and &quot;The Troops of St. Tropez&quot; series is the perfect illustration that the antidote to these detestable screen symptoms has only only ingredient: star-power. Louis de Funès was a living audience-drainer. After the 1964 hit, the team could adapt to the craziest formulas, they were fishes out of water in New York City, they got married, they were set apart and reunited, they even fought Aliens and each time, the film never attracted less than four million viewers. Neither did &quot;The Troops and the Troopettes&quot; despite challenging every notion of bad taste and dated humor.\n\nMaybe it was time for the series to end. Maybe the sight of a frail-looking De Funès was an indirect reminder of the living thunderbolt he used to be. Maybe watching him trying to hold his grimaces and gesticulations was like watching the Lemmon of &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; while reminiscing &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;. Maybe a seventh opus would have put a deathblow on his winning streak. But the actor died three months after the release, reputation unsoiled and legacy ensured by millions of viewers and trillions of laughs. His death was a sad time for French cinema but came at a good timing because the torch was being passed to a new breed of humor, screwball Pierre Richard under Veber&apos;s sophisticated direction or biting satire with the Splendid Troop. The days of glory were over and a crisis-stricken France generated a more mature audience craving for some social commentary behind the jokes.\n\nEven Jean Girault (who died during the filming of &quot;Troopettes&quot;) and De Funès felt the change of wind and made a different movie with &quot;The Cabbage Soup&quot;, a film that showed the loneliness of isolated farmers and the effects of modernity in rural France. Looking up my &quot;Cabbage Soup&quot; review, I said it was the penultimate movie of the old-time partners and their ultimate classic if we forgive the final &quot;Gendarmes&quot; movie in 1982. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t say &quot;forget&quot; or &quot;dismiss&quot; but I suspect I&apos;ll be in a minority if I say that the ultimate de Funès&apos; movie wasn&apos;t the ultimate outrage many fans claim it to be... I concede that some parts can be outrageously bad but outrageously and uninterestingly are two separate words and in-between, there is a realm of enjoyment that prompted me to wear my &apos;devil&apos;s advocate&apos; coat. Sure it is a turkey but I would say, a turkey... à l&apos;orange!\n\nAddressing the elitist section of movie fans, cinematic purists or the cohort of cinephiles drooling over anything stamped &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot;, I say, yes, your honor, &quot;The Troops and the Troopettes&quot; is a never-ending series of outdated jokes, over-the-top tantrums and cringe-worthy exploitations of women that make Benny Hill look like Monty Python, not to mention some unnecessary racist jokes... yet there wasn&apos;t one second in the film where I was bored, which I guess is a basic accomplishment for a comedy. The first &quot;Troops&quot; movies had their slowest moments and their share of lame gags but they were never as daring and bold as the last onzq... and I&apos;ve got to admire a movie that pushes the level of bad taste up to eleven, if it doesn&apos;t make you laugh, it finds a way to impress you. What&apos;s more impressive is that the film manages to be driven by a plot, crazy-nun driving but driving nonetheless. \n\nFour new recruits who all seemed to come up from Givenchy ads, and naturally catch the eye of our six gendarmes, one has a double effect because of her ethnicity as it seems that our old Frenchies aren&apos;t accustomed to the sight of an African woman. Now, ethnic gags were hit-or-miss with De Funès, it was a disaster in &quot;The Tattoo&quot; but hilarious in &quot;The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob&quot;. The references to Macumba&apos;s origins are so redundant it stops being funny but the film insists so much that it ends up ridiculing the Troops, not the woman, the film even uses the beginning of a racial slur as if it really highlighted some old colonial bigotry, it&apos;s not as subtle as in a Tarantino movie, but it&apos;s so outrageous it becomes inoffensive. We forgive them, they&apos;re just out-of-touch old guys, De Funès, Galabru, Jacques François, even the youngest ones (Guy Grosso and Michel Modo) can&apos;t hide their white hair and balding sideline while Patrick Préjean and Maurice Risch provides the &apos;young&apos; touch... which isn&apos;t saying much.\n\nWhat&apos;s more to forgive? Well, the plot is an improbable salad made of James-Bond like situations and stunts, improvised choreographies, cartoon gags, vaudeville hysteria with a Claude Gensac more excitable than ever and Grand Guignol histrionic mimics where it seems that Galabru waited for the final film to have the upper vocal timber on Cruchot. The whole thing is insane, indigestible, noisy but it has a few sweet and tender moments. And amidst that brouhaha, something happened I didn&apos;t expect, it opened my eye on the notion of &quot;over-the-top&quot; and made me accept that there comes a moment where comedy needs to stop being too subtle and just implode its ugly irreverent side to the face of the earth. \n\nInterestingly, the very actors who dethroned De Funès would play in similar over-the-top movies in the 90s, but in 1982, they wanted their idol to star with them in their movie &quot;Gramps is in the Resistance&quot; but fate decided otherwise, Galabru played the &quot;Gramps&quot; part and the film was dedicated to his long-time partner. But one can&apos;t watch &quot;Troopettes&quot; with bitter eyes for the role that made him a star was the perfect swan song for Louis de Funès. In a way, the film is about a bunch of &quot;gramps&quot; who are resisting... the march of modernity through one last musical march across St Tropez.",

Just when you think it&apos;s about to slow down and become a normal movie, it veers in a whole other, even crazier (and arguably funnier) direction than you could have ever hoped for.  With brilliant performances by Peter Falk, Alan Arkin, and Richard Libertini (who has one of the film&apos;s best lines: &quot;These are the best security men in the world.  They used to work for J.C. Penney&quot;), this is a must see for any fan of true film comedy."

      "reviewBody": "Adapted with director Bogdanovich by Larry McMurtry from his own novel, this film remains true to its source.  A modern adaptation would no doubt have adopted the voice-over approach of narrative, but here each scene is played out from a more objective point of view. The book consists of a series of events played out over a protracted period of time, with McMurtry&apos;s sparse but effective prose acting as a bridging device between scenes. The translation to the screen loses these links, giving the film a slightly episodic feel which runs counter to modern Hollywood film making practice. This is no bad thing, and in every other aspect the film follows the book almost literally, but watching it now does highlight the difference between the formulaic approach we are now accustomed to, with mise en scene, plot turning points and climaxes crudely and obviously spelt out, as opposed to that of Hollywood&apos;s final golden age, where the director was given more of a free reign to stamp his own identity on the film, and audiences were more receptive to different styles. Here the spirit of the novel is captured perfectly; that of the desperation and claustrophobia of small town life, where generation after generation undergo the same rites of passage, living out the same lives of frustration and unrealised dreams. The films strength is that it never forces us to identify with any one character, evenly distributing the amount of screen time over the different generations and, almost like a fly on the wall documentary (though heavily stylised in its powerfully expressive monochrome cinematography). Coupled with some sturdy performances from all of the members of the cast, and some memorable images, The Last Picture&apos; comes across as an enchanting, evocative and accessible portrayal of a lifestyle most of us have never and will never experience. Now surely this is what the art of cinema is all about?"

      "reviewBody": "Now I remember when Scenes From A Mall first came out, it got absolutely atrocious reviews.  I wasn&apos;t old enough to see it then, but I loved the idea of a movie with two of my comedy heroes, Woody Allen and Bette Midler.  In fact, I had almost forgotten about this movie until I read a review of the newest Woody Allen movie, &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; in which the reviewer said that Allen hadn&apos;t had as good chemistry as he had with Tracey Ullman with another actress since Scenes From A Mall.  So I went out and found the movie, and the reviewer was definitely correct.  The two stars have masterful chemistry, although it&apos;s almost ridiculous to believe Woody Allen and Bette Midler would be together, but then again isn&apos;t that it in most of his movies.  I mean does anyone believe he could have gone to bed with Mira Sorvino, Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis, Elisabeth Shue, I mean even Judy Davis is a big stretch.  Well whatever.  The problem I had with the movie is that it is more like an absurdist play than a real movie.  This married couple go to the mall on their anniversary and both reveal they have had affairs.  The film is believable except for the wild and sudden reactions that Bette Midler&apos;s character has to Allen&apos;s revelations.  She knees him in the groin and screams at him.  Now nobody enjoys Bette Midler&apos;s antics more than I do (think the phone call scene in Ruthless People) but I just didn&apos;t buy it.  It was like Bette Midler was dying to have moments of big ballsy comedy inserted into a more serious film.  Then of course they make up, which isn&apos;t very believable either, nor is it funny.  Then she reveals her affair and Allen overreacts. At this point I was like in disbelief that anyone would expect us to swallow such a hackneyed and predictable reaction and story set up.  Of course they&apos;re more fighting, and an annoying mime (hello? they stole it from tootsie) and lots of garish on again off again reactions.  Gee I wonder what happens at the end? It&apos;s not a hard one to predict folks.  It was perfectly enjoyable though, but when you think about it in your head you realize it&apos;s really not such a with it piece of work. The movie reminded me of Midler&apos;s more recent film &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; where she again overreacts with big screaming fights that are supposed to be hysterical.  The couple in that movie also go do an on again off again thing with lots of screaming in between.  Like I said, they&apos;re both enjoyable and Midler radiates charm but why does she keep saying yes to this terrible s**t?  She&apos;s a good actress, and she should be doing better comedy&apos;s not this terrible lowbrow material, (hello Drowning Mona was beyond embarrasing, its already the worst film of the year).  All in all, scenes from a mall is worth it for the great chemistry between the two stars and its pretty cute. But why anyone would think that we would enjoy seeing Woody Allen in a ponytail is beyond me."

      "name": "L&apos;Africain - De Broca&apos;s journey to Africa without a filmmaking map",
      "reviewBody": "Philippe de Broca was a filmmaker known for his lavish adventure films, from &quot;Cartouche&quot;, to &quot;Le magnifique&quot;. His 1983 film, &quot;l&apos;Africain&quot;, is also one such movie, but fails to amaze, due to its weak plot and script.\n\n&quot;L&apos;Africain&apos;s&quot; story revolves around a travel agent (Catherine Deneuve), who goes to Africa hoping to relax after months of stressful work in France. There, she meets her husband (Philippe Noiret), and the two decide to protect the local elephant populations from the poachers with the help of a British conservationist (Jacques François).\n\nReleased the same year as another film recounting the antics of a travel agent, the comedy &quot;Banzaï&quot;, with Coluche, &quot;l&apos;Africain&quot; offers a resoundingly different view to the same profession. Deneuve&apos;s character is always stressed, but respects the natives in the places she visits. She is a universalist, believing that everyone should protect the animals, so for her, discriminations don&apos;t help in accomplishing her goal. Coluche, on the other hand, interpreted his travel agent hero with brashness and a bit of vulgarity, him being a racist traditional Frenchman who hates communicating with strangers. Since his only goal is to get married, he has no moral obligation to respect anyone, and so he doesn&apos;t.\n\nInteresting to note is the historical setting in which de Broca&apos;s film was released. In 1983, the environmentalist movement had resurged, and &quot;l&apos;Africain&quot; could be interpreted as one of many works with environmentalistic character that were released in France that and the next year. There was even an animated series, &quot;Bibifoc&quot;, showing the adventures of a young seal and its two human friends, who were fighting the evil hunters in the Antarctica. If &quot;Bibifoc&quot; made many empathize with the seals&apos; cruel fate, then &quot;l&apos;Africain&quot; tried to convince people to do so for the elephants&apos; one. That it didn&apos;t succeed owes more to its weaknesses movie-wise.\n\nFirst of all, the direction is extremely slow-paced, with de Broca spending most of the film showing the viewers the reunion of Deneuve and Noiret. When the last sequence arrives, where the real action takes place, the viewers have lost their interest for the film, and - in my case, at least - pay no attention to what happens.\n\nWhen the performances are concerned, they were disappointing. Deneuve and Noiret don&apos;t make for a convincing couple, and their scenes together seem extremely artificial. Jacques François is quite embarrassing to watch when playing a British man, since he employs the all-too-common in French films technique of speaking French with a heavy (fake) British accent. His confrontation with the couple is generally very toned-down and doesn&apos;t hold one&apos;s interest for long.\n\nWhilst the cinematography is satisfactory, emphasizing the wonderful landscape of Africa, its combination with such weak plot and acting don&apos;t do it any justice.\n\nAll in all, &quot;L&apos;Africain&quot; is a film with an admirable concept, that is badly-executed and thus loses all of its charm. Instead of sitting through it, I would suggest taking a look at the other French environmentalist classic, &quot;Bibifoc&quot;, which, for all its innocence and childishness, still retains some degree of sweetness.\n\nAnd, of course, one of the catchiest credits of a French series;\n\nBibi- Bibi - Bibi- Bibifoc,\n\nDans l&apos;Antarctique, t&apos;es roi des phoques...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Alias John Preston&quot; has elements that would make for an exceptional film, however, I don&apos;t heartily recommend it because the story is very rushed and comes in at just over one hour.\n\nJohn Preston (Christopher Lee) is a real force of nature! He arrives at an English town and in the mood to buy and soon has gathered a small fortune. This appears to be because he&apos;s driven, supremely confident in himself and has few scruples. He also is disdainful of personal problems and psychiatrists...thinking they are for the weak and that he&apos;s above that sort of thing. In light of this, it seems VERY strange that he suddenly begins seeing a psychiatrist, and he&apos;s really, really nervous. Again and again, he talks about dreams that haunt him and the once supremely confident man seems on the edge of insanity. What&apos;s next?\n\nThis story is good and Lee is fine as the brooding sociopath. But the story goes by too quickly...especially towards the end. This manages to take a lot away from the interesting idea for the story. Worth seeing but it easily could have been much better.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are thinking this may be a disaster movie such as the (1972) The Poseidon Adventure, (1974) The Towering Inferno, and/or (1997) The Titanic, you would be wrong. The V.I.P.s is a soap opera that outlines four (4) vignettes that take place at a London airport that has these interesting passengers grounded unexpectedly as follows:\n\n1. Love Triangle  Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and Louis Jourdan are the three (3) figures with Richard Burton being the wealthy tycoon who ignores his wife Elizabeth Taylor so she falls &quot;out of love&quot; with Richard and into the charming hands by default of the addicted gambler and male gigolo Louis Jourdan with the end of their respective relationships being delivered via the exchange of two (2) letters.\n\n2. Save my corporation Rod Taylor and Maggie Smith are in a desperate battle to save Rod&apos;s tractor manufacturing corporation from an imminent takeover bid. Maggie who plays Rod&apos;s able executive assistant though is more interested in saving Rod&apos;s heart than his bank account.\n\n3. Save my estate Margaret Rutherford (best known for her role as Agatha Christie&apos;s female sleuth Miss Jane Marple) is attempting to board her flight from London to Florida to take a meaningless job in an effort to save her families estate and especially her gaudy and outdated castle.\n\n4. Save my film production company Orson Welles and his latest film star Elsa Martinelli seem to have nothing going for them but smoke and mirrors as the famed film director and wannabe film star respectively. So Orson has to be out of London and in Switzerland to avoid the taxman, but since their flight is delayed he and his accountant come up with an alternative plan once again to save his film production company.\n\nAlthough this will never be a film classic the all star cast will keep you interested in their separate stories and more importantly how their stories end. I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 rating. No harm, no foul.",

      "reviewBody": "This is something special. &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; is a truly remarkable movie experience. A stunning and unique movie with this fantastic feeling and the feeling of being something &quot;out-of-this-world&quot;. The finest fantasy movie of all time. A timeless and nostalgic classic.\n\nThe rich production is notorious in so many ways: the gorgeous settings and landscapes/sceneries; the amazing special effects, visual effects and blue-screen effects; the magic; the spectacular combination of sounds, which impress even more if heard loud; the music...\n\nAnother major strength is the wonderful soundtrack, work of Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger, with that genial synthpop orientation. It&apos;s so 80&apos;s and I very much welcome that. The songs are all beautiful. Another great song is Limahl&apos;s &quot;Never Ending Story&quot;, as well as the two lovely Tami Stronach&apos;s singles &quot;Fairy Queen&quot; and &quot;Riding on a Rainbow&quot;. It&apos;s impressing how she sings so well.\n\nThe movie is thrilling, very involving, exciting, great fun, contains lots of adventure, danger, strong suspense, darkness, drama, strong emotions, fantastic and strange creatures, interesting and well developed characters and a great cast.\n\nThere are strange and fantastic creatures such as the Racing Snail, the creepy Gmork, Morla the ancient one, the friendly Rockbiter (a gentle giant), the Sleepy Bat and Falkor the luckdragon. I like Falkor very much: he&apos;s so big, so cool, so fluffy, so cute and so friendly. He also has a great sense of humor and his dog-like appearance makes him irresistible.\n\nOther interesting characters are the somewhat rude Nighthob, Teeny Weeny, the hilariously typically grumpy old man Mr. Koreander, the eccentric and amusing gnomes Engywook and Urgl, Cairon and especially Atreyu (and his horse Artax), Bastian and the Childlike Empress. Atreyu, Bastian and the Childlike Empress are all terrific kids. Atreyu is a different kind of hero: a true hero child, which is unusual and amazing. Bastian himself is another hero child.\n\nThe movie is promising since the very beginning, with those stunning, dazzling and colorful clouds, which bring it a magical touch. The beauty of the Ivory Tower palace, the golden of the Sphinxes and the blue of the Southern Oracle are also magical details about this movie, among many others. On the other hand, the storm called &quot;The Nothing&quot; is spectacular but slightly creepy. Nevertheless, it is another precious help to give magic and beauty to the film. Not to mention details like the sky full of stars and no clouds and when the sky has clouds...\n\nIt&apos;s amazing how one gets involved into the story. While watching the movie, one can feel deeply involved in the story as much as Bastian does. It&apos;s impossible to ignore it because it captures one&apos;s attention and heart. Also, one can&apos;t help but get deeply involved in Atreyu&apos;s quest and everything he confronts to save Fantasia, including his emotions and despair.\n\nThe actors are all wonderful. Barret Oliver is amazing as the shy and imaginative Bastian, Noah Hathaway is awesome in the role of the young warrior Atreyu and Tami Stronach is terrific as the Childlike Empress. Her role is minor but very relevant and significant. She really looked like a little princess by portraying the Childlike Empress. It&apos;s kinda surprising that this was her only movie role ever. Noah Hathaway... that long hair really fitted very well on him and his character Atreyu resembles an Indian, but only a little bit.\n\n&quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; is more than one of the greatest movies from the 80&apos;s. It is one of the best, most beautiful, magical and distinguish movies ever. A fine movie with a very good message as well. I can positively say that Mr. Wolfgang Petersen knew what he was doing. This is his masterpiece.\n\nThe movie is a German production filmed in English with mostly American and English actors. The majority of the film takes place in Germany. And it was officially launched under its original title, &quot;Die Unendliche Geschichte&quot;, despite being filmed in English. By the way, I was born in 1984 and I&apos;m very proud that this movie is from that year. After all, it&apos;s a movie that I love.\n\nThis should definitely be on Top 250.",

      "reviewBody": "Story about a teenager who accidentally kicks the bucket, but only to return as a zombie like teenager. Thirst for blood and need for human flesh included. Throw in some lovey dovey side-plot crap and you basically have Boy Eats Girl.\n\nThe flick most importantly, isn&apos;t that bad. It&apos;s actually kinda entertaining. With a decent amount of grue and silly Irish teen humor, it ain&apos;t that bad.\n\nBut the flick just wasn&apos;t that memorable. With alright gore, alright acting, and alright ideas being presented, it just doesn&apos;t grab you like a comedy or a horror should. It wasn&apos;t truly funny or scary. It&apos;s basically a rehash of everything you&apos;ve probably seen before in the Zom/Com/Rom sub-genre.\n\nI can tell you one thing, there was a female character in this flick, that desperately needed to get naked. But she did not. She played the bitchy slut, and showed off her cleav throughout. I guess the makers thought they were making a flick that didn&apos;t need it. Wrong. Note to all horror film-makers everywhere: If you&apos;re gonna have a slutty chick in a movie (with big tits in this case), have her show some damn skin. Only good can come from this.\n\nBoys Eats Girl is a pretty damn average RomZomCom flick that was entertaining based solely on the amount of blood it spilled. But where it matters, like in the laugh and chills department, it just didn&apos;t get it done. Though it is recommendable, it has a &quot;teen movie&quot; charm, uses a slightly different approach to zombie flicks and, yep, the blood.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the early 2k on cable tv.\n\nRevisited it recently.\n\nThis is the nineteenth in the Bond series and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.\n\nIn this one Bond is assigned to protect an oil tycoon&apos;s daughter who had previously been held for ransom by an ex KGB turned terrorist. During this assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.\n\nThis one has an amazing pre credit scene (not the lousy window jump sequence). The boat chase sequence is amazeballs.\n\nThe villain, Reynard, is truly sinister n Carlyle did a fine job but his character ain&apos;t developed well.\n\nThe story ain&apos;t engrossing n none of the henchmen is memorable.\n\nThis time Bond faces Reynard who is hell bent on causing chaos n destruction.\n\nBond faces many henchmen, Gabor, Mr. Bullion, etc. But the most noteworthy is the attractive cigar girl (Giulietta da Vinci).\n\nBond gets to cool off with Serena Scott Thomas, Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau.\n\nSome info on Reynard: His real name was Victor Zokas n his childhood was particularly traumatic as he was raised in poverty.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, he ran away from home and joined the Soviet Army. Due to his vicious nature n brutal methods, he was given a place in the KGB. Due to his cunning and effectively discrete ways, he got the nickname, &quot;Renard The Fox&quot;.\n\nAft his expulsion from the KGB due to his evident mental instability, Zokas took &quot;Renard&quot; alias and became one of the world&apos;s most feared terrorists.\n\nIt was 009 who shot Reynard in the head n although a doctor was able to save Renard&apos;s life, he was unable to extract the bullet from his patient&apos;s skull. Due to its retention within his brain matter, Reynard lost most of his senses and pain was never felt by him.\n\nThis allowed him to push himself much further than the ordinary human limits.",

Both begin to blend from the start of the story. Alison Elliott is by far terrific. At times, Alison Elliott resembles a young Jodie Foster as she plays this innocent, yet troubled youngster as she tries to start fresh with a new life in a new town. At times, the story takes on a biblical tale of forgiveness and loving thy neighbor. A perfect movie about respect and acceptance, The Spitfire Grill takes on a life of its own as the story builds and builds with more secrets. A nice ending that brings everything together and answers all the questions. Alison Elliott is great.",

I also enjoyed the several hot sex scenes.  (Face it.  Isn&apos;t this one reason that Sex and The City is so popular.)\n\nThis really was the kind of movie that a man a woman watch right before they have sex.  This isn&apos;t a bad thing.\n\nThis movie was supposed to be wierd in the first place.  The confessions to a horny priest, the shooting, the voices yammering in her head where designed to be quirky.  Rather than analyse the heck out of the movie, I just let it be what it was.\n\nI have heard that this is an ultra low budget film.  Yet, the quality of the shooting seems very good.\n\nI also liked the fact that Julie David didn&apos;t go for some super smooth skinned beauty to play the part.  She looked like a real woman and therefore, was irresistable.\n\nRomantic comedies of today tend to be mindless and cute and sappy anyways. So the ending of the film was status quo.\n\nI recommend it."

It has bodily fluids being the main &quot;attraction&quot; (no pun intended). Now you could discuss how that makes sense and if this is even something that can be depicted in a movie.\n\nWell it can - but it choses to do so in a very vivid and as I already wrote explicit way. Even more so, for those who have an issue with it: there is a lot of homoerotic intercourse and other stuff happening. I&apos;m not a particular fan of any of that, but I understand what the movie is trying to do.\n\nThe theme itself is interesting and intriguing - but the movie is not really exploring ... well it seems quite focused on the sex. No pun intended - with bodily fluids, not just semen is meant. Women squirt liquid too and then there is the ... well I can&apos;t describe it other than just write it: Pee.\n\nThis may all sound disgusting to you and that is more than fair. Cumming on people (sometimes on their faces) is not meant to be enticing either - though I guess it is seen as waste. Not sure if the movie is trying to make a connection about that and some religious thing about self pleasure and the &quot;waste&quot; of sperm ... it didn&apos;t feel like it was making a point in that direction but maybe I missed it.\n\nAnyway the theme is decent - the way it is made, this won&apos;t win many viewers over I assume ... this is meant to shock the viewers .. although even in that it may fail since many may be used to movies trying to shock them ... up to you (no pun intended) - not that this will make a social statement that I am aware of.",

      "reviewBody": "I wonder what Freudians would think of the relationship between Laurent (Benoit Ferreux) and Clara Chevalier (Lea Massari), son and mother, who for half the film are basically on their own as the son gets treatment for a heart ailment. Maybe it&apos;s hard to think anything about this, or to put such an easy label as &apos;oedipal&apos; on this whole psychological criss-cross. But what&apos;s hard to deny is how much liveliness is in possibly Louis Malle&apos;s best film (that I&apos;ve seen yet at any rate). It&apos;s a tale of innocence lost, but then again in a family where it&apos;s not a high commodity anyway. Laurent is surrounded by older brothers who get him into parties with alcohol, and even to a brothel where he awkwardly loses his virginity. He also is a choirboy, does excellently in school, has an intellectual side that runs deep, and goes to confess his sins (from time to time) for the priest. But then there&apos;s something about his Mother, when he sees her get into a car he doesn&apos;t recognize or rides off with someone mysterious, that ignites his confused flame of first-hitting-puberty sexual jealousy. And it all leads up to Bastille day.\n\nMurmur of the Heart is not a picture really bent on anything with a solid plot, as it&apos;s more concerned with the kind of European &apos;character study&apos; (not that there isn&apos;t a story there to look at it). I read Ebert&apos;s review and he mentioned that the picture is more about the mother than the son. I could see where that viewpoint comes from, but I have to think that it&apos;s more about both of them, and while I watched it (as opposed to now thinking about it once its ended) it seemed more concerned with the son and perpetually through his point of view. He doesn&apos;t totally understand why his mother feels the way she does, and why she runs off to her other man, torn between leaving her gynecologist husband for him. But Malle makes it seem torn between each side when Laurent is left at the hotel while Clara is away for two days. His confusion leads him into a kind of disarray that&apos;s been hinted at before, and its made all the more clear in the tension- very underneath their games and witty remarks- that builds up.\n\nBut even with such an idea for the film, it is never really ugly or trashy. If anything, Malle does the best thing possible by making such a taboo subject realistic around the situation of family and the period. It&apos;s really wonderful seeing how Malle directs the smaller scenes, the bits that a director usually wouldn&apos;t bother with for emotional sake, or the little bits of dialog that do go on in the real world that don&apos;t necessarily have to do much with the rest of the story (one of those is when Laurent is getting washed down with a hose at the medical clinic, and the woman washing him goes on a long tangent of talk, not conversationally, just to hear herself talk). It could be tricky dealing with such mundane aspects of life such as brothers hanging out and goofing off, but there&apos;s layers of masculinity that get thrown in the mix (what are we to make of when the boys measure &apos;themselves&apos; with a ruler, much to the angry housekeeper&apos;s dismay, or when Laurent tries out her mothers make-up I wondered).\n\nAll the while Malle bases these characters in an entirely plausible environment and with a cast that works very well. Massari is almost TOO alluring a woman to be anyone&apos;s mother, least of which the headstrong and vulnerable Laurent, but this works to show what her frame of mind must be too, as she gets as much attention (in a different way of course) as Laurent does from the teenage girls. The actor playing Laurent is a first-timer here ala Leaud in 400 Blows, but I even got a Bresson feeling from him, of there being a lot of emotions buried underneath his usually calm and poised expression, the kind that can be felt even with just the slightest hints. He&apos;s perfect for the kind of kid who&apos;s still a bit much in his own desires and wants to see what may happen from all of this in the long term. But the psychological implications are left even more to chance by the ending, which is one of the best moments Malle has ever directed as the family all laughs together. Not to forget to mention another big plus, the film is filled with one of the best jazz soundtracks ever put together (including Parker, Bechet, Gillespie among others), and an exquisite use of period and very tasteful way about the more &apos;graphic&apos; parts of the film. Murmur of the Heart shows in tragic-comic detail the sophistication and lewd sides of the French, and draws a lot to ponder about a boy&apos;s crossover in that rotten period of 14-15 years old and of a woman who has the same mixture of unstable emotions and child-like ideals of her own blood that pull the two into what happens. In totally unconventional terms, it&apos;s &apos;magnifique&apos;. A+",

Eventually, he is returned to his English family, but finds the readjustment difficult, particularly as they do not have the same respect for nature as the American natives.\n\n&quot;Blauvogel&quot; is in German and the version I saw had no subtitles, although I found it easy to follow and quite engrossing.",

Definitely an entertaining film, and one that any over-the-top action movie junkie will surely add to their collection.",

      "reviewBody": "QUADROPHENIA is a cult classic movie that explores the life and loves of a Mod living in Britain in the 1960s. The lead character is played by Phil Daniels, a familiar face from British television, and he gives an exemplary performance as an awkward but likable youth struggling to grow up and make it in the adult world.\n\nProduced by The Who, QUADROPHENIA offers as its backdrop a portrait of 1960s era Brighton and the like, where battles between the Mods and Rockers are just around the corner and a great soundtrack generally accompanies the action. I&apos;ll be the first to admit I&apos;m not a huge fan of this era - I missed it by a long shot - but this likable drama paints a solid picture of the times.\n\nIt&apos;s also remarkable as a &quot;before they were famous&quot; movie, featuring performances from the likes of Ray Winstone, Timothy Spall, Leslie Ash, Phil Davis, Michael Elphick, even Sting before they hit the big time. Barely a minute or two goes by without a familiar face, and it&apos;s fair to say that everyone is putting plenty of effort into their performances. It&apos;s this level of enthusiasm all round which has led to QUADROPHENIA&apos;s well-deserved cult status.",

Mysterious atmosphere, very good acting and editing and very much violence and blood for a german movie! But no film is perfect!

Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don&apos;t go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you&apos;ll enjoy it as much as I did.",

The cast (like Egri Csillagok) consists of many actors famous in Hungary; the story is classic. A young man seeks revenge for his father&apos;s death by the sword of a Turk, and gets even more: that Turk&apos;s very expensive property, much of it gold, as well as his daughter, and finds that he needs to defend both against a group of bandits. Like Egri Csillagok, this is a good movie about what&apos;s really important in life and does not have a one-dimensional view of Turks like many other Hungarian movies do.",

      "reviewBody": "For sure, the Christ of Il vangelo secondo Matteo is the most exceptional one ever to be depicted in cinema - a brilliant poetic fiction which brings it back to the pure level of words and gestures and displays the amazement and enthusiasm of the view of a privileged witness such as St. Matthew. A hard, implacable Christ, gentle to children and furious at salesmen, vehement against hypocrites, scribes and humbugs, unrelenting in his faith. He preaches the most difficult revolution given, the inner revolution of behaviour and its resulting decisions. The people that he is confronted with are sort of an Eisenstein&apos;ian choir of faces in closeups with absent-minded or bright looks and ambiguous smiles of those who don&apos;t really understand. In this regard, it&apos;s actually a Pasolini&apos;an choir of a mute mob witnessing happenings they feel subordinate to, a choir of anonymous figures, who suffer but not fight and who still dedicate themselves to a hope which becomes more and more unreachable.\n\nJesus and his 12 followers are a group of involved young men, who champion for revolutionary concerns. The youth and inexperience of the actors gives a fascinating sense of the fragility of the Christian movement itself in its very beginnings. The iconic-like closeups are a reminiscent of medieval, religious pictures whereas Enrique Irazoqui, who plays Jesus, seems like as if he descended right from a El Greco painting with his thin figure and slim, long face. The music from Bach and Mozart, as well as Blues recordings conveys additional meaning: The cry of revolt and the demand to be heard and received by the people and its authorities. It becomes utterly touching when the film dissolves into melancholy and passion by the power of Bach&apos;s classical music chorus and the blues.\n\nThe cinematography is remarkable and takes in many scenes the position of a third person telling the story. The intensely textual and dramaturgic reference to the biblical model, the amateurish performances of the actors and the waive of any pathos gives the film a strong naturalistic nuance. Jesus is less the son of god, but more an ideological fighter who gives radical speeches. But, Pasolini does not demystify the figure of Christ, nor does he question the set dogmas of the official church. He rather accentuates the social facets of Jesus&apos; life and work and gives it an unforeseen political smack"

I sat there for 90 mins and I found the film very funny and quite moving. The way everyone keeps asking Atsushi, &quot;So how do you like Iceland?&quot; or the characters he runs into. Some of them include Laura, a woman who likes to &quot;collect&quot; funerals or American tourists Jack and Jill, who bicker all the time because they disagree on taking a vacation to Iceland. Atsushi first finds this trip as a burden because he was looking forward to going to Hawaii to play golf. Instead, he has to go to Iceland to perform a ritual by the river where his parents drowned. Then, throughout this journey he learns more about himself. He finds some of the strangest people you will meet...a cab driver performing a strange ritual, a girl who restarts his car with a sonic scream, and my favorites, the Islandic Cowboys. When he finally gets his mission accomplished of performing the ritual, he learns that sometimes a journey can take you places that aren&apos;t on any map. That is so true. I wanted this movie so bad that I finally received it from Amazon today. It is still as great as when I saw it a year ago. Check this out because it is brilliant.",

      "reviewBody": "The best issue about this movie, other than, of course, the aesthetic perfection, is its absolute fidelity to Conrad&apos;s short novel. I think this is very good in the movie because the book is so good, and it would have made no sense try to change it in the least way, as it often happens when movies come out of books (for example, Kubrick always made his films somehow look different from the books they are taken from, and I should say often improved them, but in many other cases it&apos;s true the opposite). It&apos;s noteworthy saying that in another, more popular, Ridley Scott&apos;s movie such as Blade Runner, always derived from a novel, important changes have been made from the original story ( in that case, all the part about the &apos;empathy&apos; religion doesn&apos;t appear in the movie, and I think it was a good choice to omit it). But &apos; The Duelists&apos; had to stick to the book! The point about the Duelists is all about the rich simplicity of its being a movie: Ridley Scott just takes the story as it is, and it&apos;s a damn good one, and he tells it to us in the best possible way, with an incredible attention to the graphical details (the duel scenes are just one better than the other), and an amazing use of the camera (the boxing scene, the horse riding duel). Now, going back to the story, in less than 100 pages, Conrad managed in explaining everything about the great illusion of Napoleon&apos;s empire, without the emperor ever appearing in it. It&apos;s incredible how he managed making the ever lasting duel between the two officials a great metaphor of that age, still keeping the two characters real and alive. The movie gives you all this. Watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "A grotesque oddity, Cronenberg&apos;s 2nd feature, Crimes of the Future, evokes the same sense of transcendent magnetism as films like Eraserhead and 2001. The story unfolds like a series of connected dreams, ones which emerge from the edge of consciousness.\n\nThe narrative plottings and concerns are not unlike those that exist in other Cronenberg films. However, their unfolding feels so much looser and uninhibited, creating a similar sensation as removing rocks from your shoes, causing it to almost float along. I love this type of avant-garde cinema that feels like it can do anything at any point in time.\n\nBeauty products designed by the deranged and ideological dermatologist Anton Rouge have lead to human mutation on such a cataclysmic scale that the entire population of sexually mature women has been eradicated. Rouge has since disappeared or perhaps died, and the film follows a languid disciple of his, Adrian Tripod.\n\nTripod is long and gaunt. A vampiric black coat coiled tightly around him creates a stark counterpoint to his pasty, white skin. It&apos;s his internal musings that serve as the only spoken words in the film. Shot without synchronized sound, Cronenberg extracts all dialogue while focusing exclusively on a shearing combination of indefinable noises which work somewhat like a score.\n\nSterile, geometric spaces encompass the characters&apos; surroundings. They feature rational modern architecture full of straight lines and intersecting right angles. These austere and formal geometric patterns are not only inherent in the architecture but also constructed as obscure props, most noticeably during the film&apos;s introduction of its pedophilic cult where a dark void-like space is illuminated only from large, glowing monolithic rectangles.\n\nCronenberg creates a strong counterpoint between the composed and simplistic architectural geometry and the abstraction of mutation and intellectual perversion. In doing so, he sets up an evolutionary hierarchy where humanity, as we know it, sits in the middle between individuals who are undergoing a &quot;psychic relapse&quot; due to &quot;intense genetic pressure&quot; (basically these people are losing evolved human attributes like feet and have begun growing fins and flippers instead) and amoral, paraphilic entities who have moved beyond human emotions and ethics.\n\nThis is Cronenberg at his most experimental. Crimes of the Future certainly is not an easy watch, but I found it to be engaging. I see the film&apos;s intentional opaqueness as one of its strongest attributes, because it becomes so otherworldly. That being said, I can also understand how it could be perceived as a frustrating and unapproachable method of filmmaking.",

It is a shining example of the dubbed sci-fi/horror, Euro-trash spectaculars that were produced on a massive scale in the 70s and early 1980s before Europe turned its backs on cheap entertainment and focused on making dreary art-house fare. In my opinion, Contamination is a reminder of all that was great about this, now virtually extinct, film-making phenomenon.\n\nContamination is generally regarded as the embarrassing bastard child of Ridley Scott&apos;s &quot;Alien&quot;. While the film does shamelessly steal certain elements from Scott&apos;s masterpiece, it is by no means a boring copy. The plot is so twisted and demented, not to mention ludicrous and ridiculous, that it transcends its &quot;borrowed&quot; elements and becomes something almost entirely unique and wonderful. For example, whereas Alien takes place on a deserted spacecraft, Contamination begins on a deserted boat, then moves to New York City, makes a detour via Mars and ends up in a Colombian coffee factory! \n\nIn addition to the utterly preposterous storyline, the joys of Contamination are manifold. There is the wonderful 80s synth score, some of the most atrocious acting committed to film, side-splitting dialogue, fantastically ancient cutting-edge technology (the science lab is a marvel of 70s/80s set design), fabulous euro-effects (among them glowing, musical alien eggs, exploding rats and better yet, exploding people) and then there is the Cyclops.\n\nI could probably write a novel just on the glorious Cyclops. What a wonder of latex and wire! The film is worth viewing just for this magnificent creature, with its big, glowing eye and vile snout. This kind of craptastic special effect died a painful death with the introduction of CGI, and movies have been all the worse for it.\n\nForget the pretentious rubbish clogging up IMDb&apos;s top 250 and watch this stunning opus instead. I can not recommend this highly enough."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; is another example of how sequels usually fail to deliver with the same amount of impact and force as the original first movie did.\n\nThe story in &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; is fairly mediocre, nothing out of the ordinary, and it does sort of come off as it being an attempt to make soup from the broth they used to make &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. The story doesn&apos;t really offer much to the Silent Hill universe, except for a few bits and pieces of information.\n\nWhat make this movie worth watching was the mood throughout the movie, and the special effects. As with the first movie, then they really managed to create a spooky setting and a place where you don&apos;t want to be caught out in the open when the darkness comes. It was genuinely a disturbing place, which worked out really well for the movie.\n\nAnd the creatures found in the mysterious town of Silent Hill were also nicely made, just as in the first movie. Personally, I do enjoy these type of movies with grotesque creatures that you get to see up close and personal, and it is especially enjoyable when you get to see them in proper lighting, and not in perpetual darkness as many horror movies tend to do. The variety and design of the monstrous creatures in &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; were great, and they alone make the movie worthwhile watching.\n\nAnd that leads us to the acting, and the people on the cast list. The acting was not doing the movie any justice at all, and it was mediocre at best. Which just goes to prove that &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; is the type of movie you watch for the effects and not for the acting or the people in the movie.\n\n&quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; doesn&apos;t reach its predecessor in any way, but given the effects, the mood, the atmosphere and the creatures, then it is well worth watching if you are into these type of supernatural horror movies.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll tell you why I love Found Footage (FF) horrors over the normal horrors. First, in a normal horror film (like conjuring etc), you basically are an audience to whatever happens in the film. However, in a FF horror, you feel you are actually with the team ( or rather I would say you are in that situation) experiencing the horrors which makes it more realistic. Second, though horrors are imaginary stuff, FF styled horrors tend to meet imagination with realism. FF horrors are not for everyone. The shaky camera work might not impress all but I personally find it very realistic as you feel you are actually watching some real life footages rather than a film shot on sets. If you are new to FF horror, remember that shaky camera work is a characteristic and that the horror doesn&apos;t kick in immediately.\n\nNow coming to this film, Bollywood till date has made many horror films but has rarely ventured into this area of horror, the FF horror. Horror is almost dead in bollywood and makers are trying to revive it every year by following the same old path of those 3rd person veiw horrors (like raaz, 1920 etc). Noone till date has tried to make a new FF horror which i feel is a genuinely interesting way of presenting a horror film.\n\nQUESTION MARK tries to imitate the cult FF horror &quot;Blair witch project &quot; and it succeeds to a great extent. It follows the conventional FF horror path --&gt; the first 35 mins are spent just showing what the group is doing and the remaining part involves the beginning of the sinister activities in the bungalow and as the film reaches the climax, things tend to become ugly.\n\nJust like blair witch project, this film too has no visible ghosts so it heavily relies on creepy sounds and loud jumpscare noises to scare you. It works well! The tension that builds up to the jumpscares are good. Camera work towards the end gets super shaky but then it&apos;s OK, it&apos;s a characteristic of FF films to depict the person holding the camera is freaking out. Mind you , in a FF horror, you would always find the camera man with camera on no matter what happens and it is a characteristic. Overall, this film scores pretty well in the tension build up and horror sections.\n\nWhat I didn&apos;t like is --&gt; 1. It tends to drag towards the end. The editing of this film is not very crisp. Even at just 82 mins, I started telling &quot; ok we had enough, now stop!&quot; but no, it takes its own sweet time to end. 2. There is a a possession scene. Many might find it scary, many might find it hilarious. I found it to be the latter. It&apos;s way too overdone! 3. Night vision camera being used inside the bungalow at night I mean cmon , there are lights in that house, why don&apos;t you use them? Just to show it&apos;s night time, the camera man uses night vision even inside the bungalow.\n\nOverall, I would say this a good attempt by Bollywood in the FF horror category although there are many foreign FF horrors that are much better than this (like Grave Encounters, BLAIRwitch project, REC, Hell House etc). As I said, very few, maybe 3-5 films have been made in thus category in Bollywood and I would love to see more . But then FF horrors really need good makers , I mean, really talented ones as FF horrors can go horribly wrong and cringy if not treated well. Thankfully, QUESTION MARK is not one of them.",

The first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing new. It&apos;s a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive. The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup effects aren&apos;t as good either, with Marv&apos;s jaw easily twice the size of the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories don&apos;t flow well together. The Dwight story is lame. The Johnny story is pointless. The Nancy story is impossible to take seriously, especially the ghost parts. Sadly, this movie is boring, listless, and disjointed. It&apos;s a movie that didn&apos;t need to be made. Still, it&apos;s always nice to see Eva Green naked. That&apos;s something that never gets old.",

      "reviewBody": "First, let me say, I LOVE sports movies--any sport, even if I&apos;m not a fan. Pro, College, High School--even &quot;The Sandlot&quot; (a GREAT movie, by the way). Having lived in the Bay Area during &quot;The Streak,&quot; and seeing the previews a few times, I was REALLY looking forward to seeing this film and went with a pocketful of Kleenex.\n\nI am beginning to wonder if filmmakers put TOO much of the good stuff in their trailers. There weren&apos;t many other big moments in this movie that I hadn&apos;t seen in the weeks prior. It&apos;s a GREAT story, but just a good movie. I don&apos;t agree with some others that it&apos;s &quot;too preachy.&quot; This is a Catholic High School, where kids are required to take religion classes. They aren&apos;t always about scripture, but about morals and ethics and leading a good life (regardless of your religion or no religion). Without this element, I don&apos;t think Coach Lad would have been as successful as he was. (And yeah, he probably &quot;recruited&quot; a bit, too).\n\nThe football scenes were very well done and exciting--not sure how much creative license was given there to create the nail biting finishes. I just felt the family dynamics and the player comraderie could have been delved into a little more deeply. Why tease us with bits and pieces and then not follow through? I also enjoy, at the end of such &quot;real life&quot; movies, to find out &quot;where are they now?&quot; It would have been nice to see what some of boys-who-became-men-through-football are up to now. \n\nOut of curiosity, I did a bit more research and found that 2 of the main character/players were composites, which bothered me not because of the creative process, but because the most unlikable kid in the film is black. It bothered me when I watched the film, but I thought, OK, that&apos;s a real person. But it isn&apos;t. We don&apos;t need Hollywood to fuel racial bigotry.\n\nSo go see it--you&apos;ll come out of the theater a little bit better of a person. It&apos;s no &quot;Brian&apos;s Song&quot; or &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; but it&apos;s not The Bad News Bears&quot; either.",

      "reviewBody": "The documentary portrays Letizia Battaglia, a chain-smoking woman from Palermo who has been a professional photographer most of her life. She has specialized to photographing mafia victims and mafioso&apos;s but she also photographs girls &quot;because of the little girl inside her&quot;. To photograph countless grotesque sights of murdered people you need something to balance that - &quot;shooting&quot; innocent girls couldn&apos;t be further from that. (sorry for the bad pun!)\n\nShe has also been active to her hometown politics where corruption has always been high. (then again whole Italy isn&apos;t a known for being corruption-free country) She pats her own back for managing to introduce a local law for preservation and restoration of century-old buildings and churches in the city when they were going to be demolished. And I agree with her: I&apos;m not a church-goer but judging from the photography I envy the citizens of Palermo for having those picturesque and grand buildings. We really have nothing like that where I come from.\n\nTo the poster of the earlier comment: the lady is 70 but she still photographs and her mind is still fully working. The documentary wasn&apos;t that touching nor did I find any intentions for such film-making. It only gave insight how she has dedicated her life for something important in the society and how she has left her mark on the world."

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s nothing quite like these &quot;maciste&quot; style films from the early 60&apos;s; they have a unique charm to them. Great sword &amp; sandals adventure, featuring a muscle bound hero, often a name from Greek Mythology. Ursus was the son of Hercules, and his name means bear; appropriate since that&apos;s how strong he is. Ed Fury plays our hero with all the humanity and heroism required. Ursus has weaknesses and is mortal (unlike his Mt. Olympis ancestry) but he can whup the bad guys just fine, thank you.\n\nIn addition to the muscular lead, some other familiar but always appealing sword and sandal elements are here. The women are insanely beautiful, and their flowing dresses and magic hair styles supplement this. The blind servant girl is very sympathetically and believably played by pretty Maria Merlo, best in the cast. She captures many difficult emotions; her facial expressions in the Ursus vs. animal death match are spot on. Raven haired knockout Moira Orfei, who appeared in several of these films, plays the kidnapped betrothed of Ursus; whom he sets out to rescue. Along the way, the son of Herc encounters cults, a femme-fatale queen, and an evil empire that needs to be overthrown. Every sub-plot works, and contributes to the story.\n\nFor a low budget film, this one surprises. There are a few editing goofs (most notably in the soundtrack music), but the translation dubbing is remarkably well done. A few bits of dialogue are awkward, but yet again it&apos;s in a charming fashion that you can&apos;t help but love. The &quot;You filthy murderers!&quot; exclamation is perfect, and sets off one of the best mass-mayhem battle scenes ever.\n\nOne of the very best of these Italian and Spanish made mythological adventure movies. Very re-watchable stuff.",

I have to say that many people are completely wrong when they think that el Alfredo&apos;s parents are homosexual. You have to be aware that Spanish language is quite genuine when talking about curses. The fact that Alfredo&apos;s father calls his friend &quot;maricón&quot; (literary, &quot;faggot&quot;) does not imply AT ALL that he is actually homosexual, it&apos;s only a very informal way of addressing a friend, you have to be aware that it is a very different culture. When I read that someone wrote that he found very strange that Alfredo&apos;s parents were homosexual, it called my attention and I wanted to double check that, because I really know Spanish culture and society and you can be sure that that is not normal there in Spain so far. Well, I just wanted to point that out. Thank you very much."

      "reviewBody": "Afterwards the horrible death of some adolescents and her niece Tomoko , the journalist named Reiko begins to investigate rumors about a videotape that causes the strange murders . As she discovers that whenever a teenager spontaneously dies with a horrifying look on his face after hearing a supposedly killing videotape and one time the phone rings ,telling he had only one week to live . The TV reporter shows up to investigate these deeds . Reiko is helped by his ex-husband and later they face a race to save their lives from spooky creature . Reiko tries to get the bottom of mystery and discovers the secrets of life of Sadako and her father . Besides mysterious events are happening at home her husband and both of them are caught up by ominous Sadako.\n\nBased on original Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki , it was a real success in the Asian cinemas and all around the world . This horror film provides great load of screams, grisly killings and creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the Sadako appearing . The picture is a sleek production with average budget by approx 1.200.000 dollars , and packs genuine chills , suspense, tension , and shocks , it&apos;s a terror-thriller very exciting . The film is paced with intelligent edition, special use of color and slick utilization of shock images . This frightening movie displays thrills , chills , hard-edged drama and ghastly images . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan . The movie has some special effects describing series of weird and otherworldly happenings and a magnificent make-up specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead . Eerie musical score and tenebrous cinematography with the TV surrealist images filmed in 35 mm and in super 8 style . The motion picture is professionally directed by Hideo Nakata in similar style to Takashi Shimzu movies . Nakata is an expert on horror cinema with eerie phantoms of pale complexion and long hair and directed its following ¨Ringu 2 (1999)¨ ; furthermore he directed US version ¨Ring 2¨ with Naomi Watts. Of course ¨The Ring¨ followed its American version directed by Gore Verbinski whose argument copies exactly the Japan original movie without surprises.",

Besides the fact that it has no plot, and that Joe Nameth is a mediocre actor at best; it is a western set to &quot;modern&quot; 1970&apos;s music. Very strange. No wonder it was listed as &quot;To Be Announced&quot; in the paper. My mom and I first saw this in the mid-1970&apos;s and even back then, we joked that the name of the film should be &quot;Joe Nameth Goes to Mexico to Get Laid&quot;. That is basically the entire plot. Joe was a great football player and some people thought he was handsome, but that does not necessarily mean the man can act. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie, unless you are curious just to see how bad a movie can be.",

I never play video games, do not like 8-bit music, do not particularly like any kind of animation, and have watched virtually no anime. I actually walked into the movie at Sundance about 10 minutes late and had a hard time getting to my seat because of the visual and audio onslaught coming at me from the screen. I was completely confused for about 3/4 of the movie yet I could not stop watching. The plot was developed almost entirely outside the realm of dialog and I suggest you read about the story before you begin watching.\n\nWhat I love about this film is that it makes you think. As much as I disliked (pretty much hated) parts of it, I was completely drawn in. It really made me re-evaluate why I watch movies and what I get from them. Sundance was a great forum for this film because it definitely is an INDIE film. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend seeing this film if you want something different than anything you have ever seen. *Give it a chance - it is really something that needs to be watched in its entirety before judgment is made*. Even if you hate the movie, it is still worth watching if you like to expand your perception of what film is. I walked away from this movie with a much greater appreciation for different kinds of art and the amount of work that went into blending all the mediums used.",

      "name": "Found footage&apos;s finest so far - an intense cop thriller that feels real",
      "reviewBody": "If I were to pitch you a movie about two police officers who are partners on patrol in South Central Los Angeles, one of your first inclinations might be &quot;not another buddy copy comedy.&quot; While &quot;End of Watch&quot; is often funny, the newest film from &quot;Training Day&quot; writer David Ayer, is no comedy.\n\nAyer, who spent a lot of time in South Central, takes the found footage approach to his latest film featuring the LAPD in the spirit of modern trends and perhaps the show &quot;Cops.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s hard to tell if Ayer&apos;s exaggerating, but a lot of dangerous stuff happens to Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) despite being beat cops. So much so that they get involved with the wrong Mexican gang, and their attempts to go above and beyond to protect and serve put them in the line of fire.\n\nGyllenhaal and Pena have incredible chemistry as two cops who are best friends as well as partners. They epitomize the modern &quot;bromance&quot; in a number of ways, joking around, giving each other a hard time, offering love/dating advice with hyper-masculine sarcasm, etc. Ayer takes time to show these men out of their blues frequently to humanize them in a critical way. On the job, they are often cocky, proud and reckless, pushing the line of appropriate police behavior and protocol. They jump back and forth between making laudable, responsible choices and borderline police brutality.\n\nThe portrait that this paints of law enforcement feels so much more authentic than we&apos;re normally treated to in cop films and police procedurals on television. They are heroes and good, honorable men, but that doesn&apos;t make them beacons of morality. No matter how much you believe in the quickly escalating plot of &quot;End of Watch,&quot; there&apos;s no disagreement to be had over the authenticity of the characters and the environment they operate in. \n\nAlthough we do get independent &quot;episodes&quot; in which Taylor and Zavala respond to calls and find more than they bargained for, there&apos;s a through-line involving a powerful Mexican drug cartel and the gang that enforces it. Ayer glamorizes these thugs a little bit, but it makes them formidable villains in the story. As things come to a boil, the realism of the film really unravels in favor of a more compelling, heart-pounding finale.\n\nAyer takes certain liberties with the found footage style as well. The premise involves Taylor filming everything for a school project or something. He has a hand-held camera but also cameras positioned in the squad car, and ones that clip onto their uniforms. The gangs also carry cameras around to film their violent escapades. At times, however, we can&apos;t tell who is supposed to be holding the camera — like when Taylor starts making out with his girlfriend, Janet (Anna Kendrick). Neither is holding the camera, so that&apos;s a bit strange.\n\nStill, that filmmaking style does more good than harm to the film. Say what you will about the found footage trend, but this is an appropriate example that really works. The extra layer of realism and authenticity that the technique gives to a film really goes miles in favor of &quot;End of Watch.&quot; \n\nHumor is an unexpected benefit of this film as well. Michael Pena has failed to be funny in films including &quot;Tower Heist&quot; and &quot;30 Minutes or Less,&quot; but he succeeds in territory that blends it with the dramatic in this very organic way. It would be impressive if most of the dialogue in this film, at least between him and Gyllenhaal, weren&apos;t improvised given how natural it flows. \n\nIt sounds like a stretch to consider this one of the better acted films of the year, but Gyllenhaal and Pena should&apos;ve been considered for awards contention. The nature of found footage detracts from what we tend to associate with/look for in an Oscar-worthy performance. We expect authenticity from found footage and only comment when it goes poorly, not when it&apos;s done exceptionally well. Having seen enough films made in the found footage style, no other two actors have done better in this genre.\n\n&quot;End of Watch&quot; offers an intense look at the life of L.A.&apos;s finest and a harrowing portrait of life in the barrios and gang-ridden parts of L.A. Although exaggerated at crucial points, it shows what can happen when officers try and step out of their clearance level. At the least, it&apos;s one of the best films found footage has given us to date.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",

      "reviewBody": "Pre-Coder about a rotten young woman (Sidney Fox), who&apos;s so spoiled and selfish she doesn&apos;t care who she steps on, including her own family. It&apos;s an unremarkable melodrama about an unlikable character that I wouldn&apos;t even have bothered watching were it not for the fact that this is the film debut of Bette Davis. Bette plays Fox&apos;s homely but kind sister who&apos;s in love with Fox&apos;s boyfriend. When Fox dumps him for another man, it opens a door for the beau to look at Bette in a different light. \n\nIt&apos;s an unimpressive debut for Bette, showing none of her later acting talent or personality. For her part, Sidney Fox does a fine job playing the worst kind of brat. Also featuring Humphrey Bogart in one of his earliest roles, playing -- you guessed it -- a bad guy. The scene stealer of the picture is child actor David Durand as Fox and Davis&apos; younger brother. He freely speaks his mind and has all of the movie&apos;s decent lines. The rest of the cast includes ZaSu Pitts, Bert Roach, Slim Summerville, Conrad Nagel, and Charles Winninger. Worth a look for Bette and Bogie completists or anyone who digs these old timey morality plays.",

Sure the violence is over the top, the plot only adequate, the sentimentalism a little thick.  The actions scenes are filmed with such, I dare say beauty, that no Hollywood &apos;by the numbers&apos; action film can possibly compete.  While this film is not for the squeamish or those offended by excessive and rather graphic violence, if you are in any way a fan of action films - you mush see this movie (and many other John Woo directed films during his Hong Kong days, i.e. Hardboiled, A Better Tomorrow, etc).",

      "reviewBody": "(spoiler alert) Not that I actually think I&apos;m going to reveal anything this time around, but this is my first review in awhile and I&apos;ve just discovered that IMDb insists that you put a warning up here.\n\nOf all the movies I&apos;ve seen, of all the films that I love, this would seem to be the one that&apos;s most misunderstood on here.\n\nFor some reason a lot of people (even Stephen Baldwin, one of the stars in the thing who&apos;s since gotten religion, and is now disavowing the film) think this is some kind of soft-porn film. It isn&apos;t, not at all.\n\nSo half the people, the ones that wanted it to be a porn film, are disappointed, and the other half, without even having bothered seeing the film, say that it&apos;s immoral.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a porn film at all. It&apos;s about friendship. It&apos;s one of the most on-the-mark movies about friendship that I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nIs there sex involved? Yes, of course. In case you&apos;ve never noticed, we (and every other critter on the planet) are sexual beings, it&apos;s an urge in all of us.\n\nAnd if anyone would actually watch the film and just pay attention, it isn&apos;t all about overcoming inhibitions and setting free your desires; by the end of the film it becomes apparent that there are prices to be paid. (Well, I guess that was a spoiler, of sorts. But what&apos;s with this &quot;spoiler&quot; thing, anyway? There isn&apos;t a film book in the world that discusses, say, &quot;Psycho&quot; without giving away the ending! Since when has it become so important to not say anything about the movie? Hell, &quot;Threesome&quot; is about two guys and a girl...&quot;SHHH!!! You&apos;re spoiling it for me!&quot; LOL) Anyway, it has a very witty yet believable script and wonderful performances by all the actors (including, I must add, one of the most erotic scenes I&apos;ve ever seen in my life, the one in the library. This might not be porn, but Lara was hot as hell back then!) And, by the end (if you&apos;re paying attention, and not assuming or hoping that it was a porn film) you&apos;re left on this terribly moving bittersweet note. Times change, people move on.\n\nThis was a wonderful movie (if misunderstood), much better than its immediate rival that came out around the same time, &quot;Reality Bites.&quot; In the end, the thing that the film is truly about is how ephemeral things can be. It can&apos;t show you, vividly, how things can fall apart, it can&apos;t make you feel for them or what will happen to and between them without spending the first 80 or so minutes putting them together. After all of that, you realize the tragedy and frailty of friendships and loves.\n\nAnd, in the end, that is truly what the movie is about.\n\nAnd, in the end, that&apos;s what life is all about."

      "name": "Offbeat Maria Bava horror picture full of eerie appearing , grisly killings and vivid imagery .",
      "reviewBody": "Outlandish , sick Mario Bava terror flick , it contains thrills, chills, gory effects, scary happenings and high body-count . A young man called Peter (Antonio Cantafora or Michael Coby) goes back to Austria , there he is greeted by his uncle , Karl Hummel (Massimo Girotti), who invites him to stay at his house . After that , both of them visiting the castle of a murderous ancestor , he was the Baron Otto Van Kleist (Joseph Cotten , though at the beginning Vincent Price was approached to play him but he turned down) , a sadistic Baron who was cursed to a horrible death by a witch whom the Baron had burned at the stake . Shortly after , Peter befriends Eva (Elke Sommer) , a history scholar , both of whom go to the eerie castle and read aloud an ancient incantation inside the bell tower . It accidentally brings his dead relative back to life and searching for new victims . Later on , the impressive castle is offered in auction being bought by the cripple Alfred Becker (Joseph Cotten) and then things go wrong when appearing the horrible Baron while continuing his murderous tortures . The movie advert contains sympathetic gimmicks : ¨Special notice : The management disclaims any responsibility for patrons who suffer (A) apopletic strokes , (B) hemorrahages , (C), or (D) Fainting spells during the shockingly gruesome scenes in this film¨. Your Blood Will Run Cold and BoxOffice Hot when &quot;BAR0N BLOOD&quot; comes to town! Positively the most horrifying film ever made...He sought the ultimate in Human Agony ... with instruments of Torture ghastly beyond belief!\n\nThrilling Italian horror with Mario Bava typical characteristics displaying chills , shocks , violence and torture . Nice terror movie revolving around a haunted castle plot with plenty of murders , eerie appearance by a preternatural being , creepy torture and ghastly events . Set at a ghastly castle where happens scabrous and horrifying events . In spite of a few escenarios and its medium budget the picture is decent , thanks to the adequate filmmaking , stunning cinematography taking great use of lights and shades as well as camera positioning to complement appropriate horror set pieces . This Italian production has Joseph Cotten as a baron who lures his victims at his foreboding castle in order to go on a criminal spree , his makeup was created by the subsequently very popular Carlo Rambaldi , ¨ET&apos;s creator¨. Stars the unknown actor Antonio Cantafora who used to use pseudonym Michael Coby , starring some lousy Spaghetti Western . And the gorgeous Elke Sommer shining in her strident mini-shorts , here she became a Scream Queen along with ¨Lisa and the Devil¨ also directed by Mario Bava . This is an acceptable and passable terror film , but no extraordinary ; in fact , Mario Bava directed much better other terror classics . Although packing some good shock images , this Baron Blood doesn&apos;t live to its source material .\n\nIt packs a colorful cinematography by Antonio Rinaldi as director of photography and Mario Bava himself , though uncredited , shot between september and noviembre 1971 in Burg Kreuzenstein , Austria , at a fairy-tale fortress , near valley of Danube . As well as frightening and suspenseful musical score by Stelvio Cippriani , though the American version was composed by Lex Baxter . The picture was professionally directed by Mario Bava in his usual style , but it has some flaws and gaps . Bava uses his ordinary visual tricks, sustaining interest enough through the fantastic and well-designed scenarios and when there shows up the creepy and scarred Baron who definitively steals the show . Bava was an expert on terror movies, such as : &quot;I vampiri&quot; codirected by Riccardo Freda , &quot;Black Sunday&quot; with horror myth Barbara Steele, &quot;The Whip and the Body&quot; with Christopher Lee, &quot;The girl who knew too much&quot; considered to be the first Giallo, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; with Boris Karloff, &quot;Planet of Vampires&quot; with Barry Sullivan , &quot;Kill baby kill&quot; , &quot;Hatchet for the honeymoon&quot; , &quot;5 dolls for an August Moon&quot; , &quot;Torture of chamber of baron blood&quot; with &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot; with Telly Savalas and his last one &quot;Schock&quot; . Though Bava also made other genres as Peplum : &quot;Hercules in the haunted world&quot; , sex comedy : &quot;Four times that night&quot;, Viking movie : &quot;Knives of the avenger&quot; and Oriental fantasy : &quot;The wonders of Aladdin&quot; . The picture will appeal to terror genre buffs. Rating 6.5/10.",

One is sending men to shoot the workers in the other camp. It is getting ugly. There are so many injuries that the foreman (a sort of Nelson Eddy kind of guy) gets in touch with the owner (who happens to be a rich flapper, engaged to a surgeon). She goes to the camp with her fiancé. He will do the doctoring while she assesses the situation. There is no reason for her to be there other than to advance the plot and get her to fall in love with the handsome foreman. At some point, the guy (who acts before thinking) finds that the opposing camp is about to dam up the river and ruin their business. After a confrontation with a couple of lumberjacks, he is knocked unconscious and thrown in a ravine. He is later found by the surgeon who is put in a position of using wolf blood to save his life. Of course, he now begins to act wolf-like. Some say this was the first werewolf movie. There are some fun moments, but, over all, it is just quite moronic.",

      "reviewBody": "Autobiographies can be the worst or the best of things. Either a boring exercise in conceit and self-absorption or a fascinating self-exploration by a person of value.\n\nWell, the Agnes of &apos;Les plages d&apos;Agnès&apos; being Agnès Varda there is no need to worry. She undoubtedly belongs to the second category.\n\nIt goes without saying that to fully appreciate this wonderful film you have to be a minimum acquainted with Varda&apos;s oeuvre. But a minimum is enough, for it does not take long before the lady starts captivating you, not by boasting about all the masterpieces she made, but by creating a new kind of story-telling right before your eyes.\n\nOne thing I am pretty sure of is that there is no other film, autobiographical or not, that looks like &quot;Les plages d&apos;Agnès&quot;.\n\nOf course there is no question that Varda&apos;s life is rich and worth telling: she worked for and with great artists, she was married to one of the most original French directors ever (Jacques Demy), she covered the fledgling Chinese and Cuban revolutions, fought in favor of feminism when it was not yet fashionable to do so. The real issue for the director was in fact to find HOW to talk about herself. Well after viewing &quot;Les Plages d&apos;Agnès&quot;, I can tell her (and I am far from being the only one to think so): &quot;You did it brilliantly, Agnès&quot;.\n\nIndeed Agnès Varda is not content to go through the motions of the standard autobiographical movie: talking face to the camera or in voice over, interviewing witnesses of her life and illustrating her words with significant clips. She does that of course but she knows how to enrich the material through a lot original finds: the mirrors on the beaches,her walking backwards to show she goes back in time, the circus artists on the beach, recreating her Cine Tamaris production office on a fake beach in Rue Daguerre, her sailing a boat from Sete to Paris as an allegory of the evolution of her career, etc. etc. Agnès Varda never rests on her laurels throughout. Quite the contrary: she creates, invents, tries out new things sequence after sequence. In the film she calls herself &apos;une petite vieille&apos; (a short old lady) but I suspect she says so out of vanity because she does not look old at all. Actually, she has retained all the freshness, all the spontaneity of the young lady she once was. \n\nDon&apos;t refrain from seeing this film even if it does not appeal to you in the first place. When the end credits roll you will probably - just like I did - utter with a sigh: &quot;Is it already the end?&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "One perverse individual can exploit his freedom by using it to encroach on someone else&apos;s.  That is the problem with a society which cherishes personal liberty.  The community has the dilemma of deciding whose freedom it ought to protect.  At what point should the state intervene?\n\n    Today, modern democracies have anti-harrassment laws which carry criminal penalties, and there is also the civil remedy of an injunction with power of arrest, but back in the early 1960&apos;s a man who chose to make a nuisance of himself enjoyed wide latitude.  It was difficult for the law to step in without infringing his civil and constitutional rights.\n\n    Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) is a small-town attorney in the south-eastern United States.  He has a lovely family and a nice home, and is well thought of by neighbours and colleagues alike.  This American idyll is destroyed when a newly-released convict shows up, intent on harrassing Bowden.  Some years back, the lawyer had appeared as a witness at this man&apos;s trial, and the convict bears an irrational grudge.\n\n    Max Cady is one of the cinema&apos;s great villains.  Mitchum is irresistible as the heavy-eyed smart alec seething with sexual energy.  Cady&apos;s sharp but warped intelligence is disturbing to behold (the way he obtains Bowden&apos;s vacation address is chillingly impressive).  He begins to show up wherever Bowden goes, an ominous sarcastic presence to which no objection can be made, so long as he stays within the law.  Cady&apos;s salient traits are placed before us right from the start of the film.  He is completely callous (ignoring the girl who drops her books on the stairs) and a nasty sexual predator (picking up the waitress in the bowling alley).\n\n    &quot;Cape Fear&quot; is a taut, absorbing thriller.  Mitchum&apos;s charisma fills the screen, and the dark eerie look (by Director of Photography Sam Leavitt) compounds the feeling of menace.  The incidental music is excellent.\n\n    However, the film has some implausible ingredients.  Why would a woman who has just been sexually degraded, and is clearly traumatised, be handed over by the police to the care of a private eye?  (Charlie Sievers the gumshoe is played by Telly Savalas - with hair!)  Would a criminal attorney really - no matter what the provocation - hire waterfront thugs to beat up a stalker?  How come Sam&apos;s gun is still effective after being immersed in the river?  Why doesn&apos;t Nancy&apos;s phone work?  It is preposterous to suggest that Cady would waste time on the elaborate feint towards Peggy instead of pursuing his real victim.  And how can it be that Cady can defeat three ruffians single-handed, overwhelm a police bodyguard with ease, yet fail to defeat Sam, even when armed with a stick?\n\nVerdict - Allowing for the improbabilities, this is a well-made thriller with a magnificent performance by Mitchum."

The acting is horrific, and the dialogue does not even come close to being believable. I might love Lada, but she doesn&apos;t deserve any serious Oscar consideration. I know that there are also a lot of people out there that love Carol Speed; well, she&apos;s not any good either in this, in terms of acting ability and skill. But regardless of the terrible acting and poor dialogue, the worst thing about &quot;Savage!&quot; is the repetition of far too many ridiculous scenes with guns! It is just unreal for anyone to take these scenes seriously! It&apos;s as if the director grabbed a handful of B-movie actors and a large amount minority bystanders from the street, dumped a thousand guns on top of them, and shouted &quot;Run!&quot;. Within a matter of seconds, Lada Edmund Jr. and Carol Speed go from cheesy night-club dancers to machine-gun toting guerrilla women! If you watch &quot;Savage!&quot;, at some point in the middle of it you&apos;ll find yourself asking, &quot;Whoa, did I just miss about 15 minutes here?&quot;.\n\nLastly, I shall mention that there is one nice bonus to &quot;Savage!&quot;. You do get a scene of Lada and Carol swimming without their tops on. The ONLY reason for this scene to be in this movie was to show boobs! It has NOTHING to do with anything else in the movie. This is so blatantly obvious, that it hurts. But if you think Lada is cute, and you&apos;ve always wondered what &quot;The Girl in the Cage&quot; looked like beneath her shirt, then you won&apos;t be disappointed by the topless scene in &quot;Savage!&quot;. Like I said before, I LOVE LADA EDMUND JR.!!"

It doesn&apos;t accentuate as much as distract. When there is a master thespian like Robert De Niro, all the extra fireworks just take the focus away from the real show. And Wesley Snipes isn&apos;t likable enough. A less stereotypical selfish black athlete may help. His scenes with his agent Manny (John Leguizamo) are annoying and tiresome. This could have been a creepy character study like the iconic &apos;Taxi Driver&apos;. But it never allows De Niro any peace and quiet to do his work properly.",

      "reviewBody": "Titus Muller loves dogs, but as a postman he gets little love in return. Still, he has a lovely wife and lots of red haired offspring. When all of them get invited to see their auntie Anna in Italy, they travel there by bicycle. It soon becomes clear that wealthy old Anna has invited no less than 132 members of the Muller family to her enormous mansion to find out which one of them is best suited to look after her dog. All of them line up in a degrading line so this nasty Queen Elizabeth II lookalike can dismiss them one by one. I bet you can guess which family she picks, or else the movie would be over pretty soon.\n\nWhen they finally sign the contract, the soundtrack score blazes like some kind of biblical epic. Obviously money is holy to these people. The dog sets it&apos;s paw print and the family moves into the mansion. Some time later, and for no good reason at all, the old bankers sing a song for Titus, and after this Dick van Dyke routine Heinz Ruhmann gets to do his Chaplin imitation once again when he stumbles home drunk. \n\nNow a national hero, women start throwing themselves at Titus feet but he remains true to his Kaninchen (as he calls his wife). Unfortunately, when one of their own little Opie&apos;s accuses him of infidelity, his &apos;bunny&apos; sides with the kid. Actually, the dog is the frisky one in this family: after a romp in a haystack with another canine (thankfully only implied), this spoiled rich pup goes home, closes the door behind him (!) and leaves another knocked up girlfriend standing on the porch. \n\nA depressed Titus gets drunk again (but less amusingly so) and wakes up next to Miss Belle, the cabaret star. From there on it is all downhill for Herr Muller, because the usual message in these comedies of inheritance is: a simple hard working life is better than a stack full of money. The exception is if you use your wealth for one good deed early on in the picture, then everything will turn out alright. \n\n3 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "One of those uber nineties movies that critiqued the media and tried to be edgy. These movies look somewhat ridiculous today. (Though the Chase with Charlie Sheen at least managed to be funny). Part of the problem is that the underlying philosophy is a value free world weariness which when put on film comes across as spoiled, stupid, and self indulgent laziness. And since movies are essentially THEE dominant form of media, criticizing media&apos;s omnipresence or vanity comes across as blithely self deluded. That said the cast does the best with what they have.... which generally rounds out to putting as much emphasis on their turn to curse as possible. The plot..... if it can be called that makes very very little sense if you stop to think about for more than half a second. The central event of movie is never so much explained as much as it brought back in choppy flashbacks in order to remind the audience about why were following these characters. Better time could be spent watching a smarter film on the topic. I suggest Network.\n\nAll that being said, I can&apos;t completely hate a movie with this great of a soundtrack. The fact that almost a minute of screen time is given over to the band Gwar makes it at least retain some value. I&apos;ve also noticed that music from the 50&apos;s - 70&apos;s is thrown into movies at all different times. But the only time you hear 90s music is in 90&apos;s era movies. It&apos;s almost as though Gen X in their nihilism forgot to leave any lasting mark on culture.",

At an early age he suffered severe electrical burns and lost most of his left hand. He mirrored the young mans determination in the movie figuring out how to do all of the Little Britches and JR. Rodeo events and continuing to High School, College and CPRA rodeos. He did very well through his years in rodeo including NLBRA world champion and a full ride college scholarship in roping and steer wrestling. He also excelled in football , basketball, and track. This movie had a deep impact on his success in life, in rodeo and other sports.\n\nGranted the acting was not the best but the message conveyed makes it a winner.",

      "reviewBody": "Three teenagers are sitting in front of a TV, enjoying their large helpings of pork sausage and bacon. Suddenly they hear a door opening and immediately start cleaning up all of the dishes and unsuccessfully try to get rid of the fumes of grilled bacon and sausages that billowed through the whole house. This is, of course, not depicting the normal life of three teenagers, but taken from the film &quot;East Is East&quot; by Damien O&apos;Donnell. It deals with the story of a family in England in the 1970s with a Pakistani father (multi-facetted enacted by Om Puri) who still believes in his Pakistani traditions and his Muslim religion and an English mother (great performance by Linda Bassett) who tries to give her seven children as much freedom as all of their &quot;fully English&quot; friends enjoy. This movie was labeled as a Comedy both in theaters and on DVD or VHS, but anybody looking for light-hearted entertainment fitting for a Saturday night will be hugely disappointed. This movie is out to teach the viewer about how difficult it is to get two very different cultures to not only co-exist peacefully next to each other, but to merge them to create a new one. The script by Ayub Khan-Din, who also wrote the book and the stage version of this movie, does have its funny moments, and the whole cast, including the children, is in for some good laughs. But the more intense moments are those where the viewer has to deal with outbursts of domestic violence or things like arranged marriages that seem so far away and cruel to Westerners. The cast shows its brilliance in those intimate moments. Even though the script might sometimes appear to be too ambitious  there are just too many characters all developing in a very distinct manner and all crucial to the movie  the movie can be recommended to anyone who is not looking for a standard comedy and is willing to have his views on life challenged.",

I am looking forward to the Australian release with English subtitles, so I can pick up some things I missed due to my lack of knowledge of Hindi.I am also anticipating finding Ben and Jerry&apos;s dark Belgian chocolate ice cream somewhere here.

      "reviewBody": "What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again. Making a Chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin, and Walter Connolly among others.\n\nPerhaps it&apos;s partly because the story was written by a westerner, Pearl Buck who got a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than any other person. Not the political struggles of China, but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately later on, Pearl Buck became an apologist for the Kuomintang China of Chiang Kai-Shek in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth.\n\nIn The Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked the difference, Ustinov said China was very big and very full and Australia was very big and very empty. That&apos;s what you see in The Good Earth, China very big and very full of people, more than she can deal with at times.\n\nThe Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave. The woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have, drought, famine, revolution, and a climatic locust plague.\n\nLuise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for portraying O-Lan. She may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player Oscar performance with the least amount of dialog. Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions, her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan&apos;s Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.\n\nMuni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field, bears and raises the kids, does the housework. When Muni becomes a man of property he takes a Chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief. Still Rainer stoically bears it all. Still Muni is not a bad man and it&apos;s a tribute to the film and his acting and Buck&apos;s writing that you don&apos;t hate him and the culture gap is bridged. \n\nWe&apos;ve got a group of oriental players now who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I&apos;m surprised The Good Earth of all films has not been remade at this point. I&apos;ll bet the Chinese government would even let some American company do it on an actual location.\n\nTill then we&apos;ve got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.",

Broomfield has filmed some fascinating subjects and a taboo topic, but seems to have learned very little himself.\n\nHe still plays on his own ignorance to illicit a sort of repulsion from his audiences.  People in the know will recognize the misrepresentation, those who are not will be effectively manipulated.  The film is never about understanding or demystifying fetishes and the people who are into them. The subjects of the film try to push Broomfield in that direction.  But his repulsion and lack of respect for his subjects comes through in the end.\n\nNevertheless, the subjects of the film have won out despite the director and make for compelling viewing.  For a better, more personalized examination of the S&amp;M scene, check out Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan Supermasochist.",

      "reviewBody": "Hwal / The Bow is a very rich movie for those interested in Buddhism however in cinematic terms there are some fairly substantial and overt structural problems with the movie. For example the film starts with a jolt of clumsy expositional dialogue (this is where characters have a very forced conversation that reveals the back story of the movie). Motifs are over-repeated (shooting of arrows) and non-sourced / non-diegetic music is layered on every time the old man starts to play his bow, all the worse because it is fairly saccharine.\n\nThose with a yen for Buddhist films are however living on food parcels and so the film&apos;s flaws may be overlooked in kindness to the healing the film provides and the thoughts it provokes.\n\nThe plot of the movie concerns an old man who lives out on the sea on a fishing boat. He provides divination services and also a platform for line fishing. Customers sit on pastel-coloured sofas and ease away the day. He has spent a decade bringing up a young foundling girl and intends the unnatural act of marrying her when she reaches age.\n\nTo me one of the key points of Buddhism is that if you are angry with the world, there are two ways to proceed, change the world or change your attitude to it, the latter is the more likely to work. Another idea would be to be like the smooth stone in a river, over which the world flows softly, rather than the jagged cause of turbulence. Dukkha (a catch-all concept of suffering that has no direct translation to English) is minimised by the changing of the self. One facet of dukkha is viparinama-dukkha, which concerns the pain of unmet expectations and the pain caused by the impermanence of happiness. The old man in the movie suffers from this and has to learn to deal with it.\n\nI found myself accepting unpalatable truths about my life watching this movie and salvaged a couple of evenings of calm from it. I would recommend it to those seeking to do likewise. One point to raise is that Kim is not averse to animal cruelty in his movies, in this one a chicken receives several deliberate blows from a character.\n\nOthers have pointed to the entire movie being composed of symbols, this is a particularly beautiful alternative way of looking at the movie, although it amounts to much the same take home in the end.\n\nThis is to my friend Mollie.",

Thus this is a film that looks cheap throughout, and which becomes boring not long after you start watching. This is because the whole movie is padded out with flashbacks to explore the characters of the three people trapped in the lift, flashbacks which add little except to increase the running time.\n\nCast-wise, the film is in firm hands with the presence of Aidan Gillen (GAME OF THRONES), but sadly the actors can&apos;t do a lot with what are relatively one dimensional characters. There&apos;s violence here but very little suspense, and the dark cinematography fails to make much of the setting or indeed to bring out the claustrophobia inherent in the situation. For a better trapped-in-a-lift movie, check out ELEVATOR.",

      "reviewBody": "Some may remember Kenneth Anger taking this lush film&apos;s title and gender-bending it a bit to give his Frances Farmer chapter in &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; its tabloid tone, but this is truly a great movie (outside of the fact that it features not one, but two Tinseltown beauties who, in Anger&apos;s salacious words &quot;drank at the well of madness&quot;) ... Farmer, after a string of uneven pictures, is relegated to a supporting role here, but actually fares better than leading lady Gene Tierney because 1) her role is far more complex and 2) her on-screen chemistry with star Tyrone Power is much more palpable. Perhaps the saddest thing about &quot;Son of Fury&quot; is the knowledge that despite the now recurrent difficulties being reported from the set, Farmer had caught herself a break and maybe a chance to finally ride out Paramount&apos;s punishment -- starting in 1938, of course, with the aptly-named (and perfectly awful) &quot;Ride A Crooked Mile&quot;. But as we all know, the road got bumpier, the turns sharper and the potholes unavoidable ... To see Farmer surrounded not only by the likes of such A-list talent as Power and Tierney, but a stellar George Sanders and very young Roddy McDowell is to get a glimpse of what might have been. To read accounts of Farmer being tricked into watching this film years later while incarcerated in an insane asylum, if indeed true, is unforgivable ... Watch &quot;Son of Fury&quot; for everything the Golden Age of Hollywood purported to be -- solid, if not overly- spectacular, entertainment. It may not be the last film of Farmer&apos;s short-lived career, but it is our last look at this fine young actress at her peak -- as stunning and mythic as she was years earlier in &quot;Come And Get It&quot; -- but now with an undeniable sadness melting from within.",

The story has potential but it&apos;s not all that interesting, the characters are meh though the rivalry between Santa (Joe Alaskey) and Dingle (Tom Kenny) is somewhat entertaining.\n\nThe animation isn&apos;t the worst but it certainly looks cheap. The textures look rubbery which&apos;s strange when they have to emote in some way like smile. It goes without saying but this&apos;s a movie you can definitely skip. It&apos;s got nothing for kids or adults so it fails to entertain in both departments.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for so bad it&apos;s good than this might be for you. If not, definitely cross it off your wish list.",

Had to admit that before watching it I was a bit skeptical, I thought it would be just one of those boring hyper-romantic films but....\n\nFinally when I got the chance to watch it I was breathtaken! This film is simply a masterpiece of a time that, unfortunately, is long gone. A time where love could last a lifetime and still be beautiful at the end of life. How many of those films are made today in this hasty divorce filled time? Not many I&apos;d say!\n\nIt was such a beautiful experience to watch this film and in a strange way it made me also sad. Mainly because today&apos;s world isn&apos;t like that anymore for how many people can stay in love and care for eachother after 50 years? The theme of everlasting love, knowing eachothers habits through a whole life is really something very very special. \n\nThe roles as the elderly couple were also played with such an honesty that it was amazing and the music plus the landscape and the actual calmness of the film makes it into a film that won&apos;t ever be forgotten; at least it shouldn&apos;t be!\n\nOf course it&apos;s romantic but it&apos;s also realistic and that&apos;s what makes it different from other socalled romantic films. There&apos;s a catch in it and there&apos;s something to think about too!\n\nThe beauty of these two old people and their relationship is something I believe many people will envy. Having been together for half a century and still being so much in love as the film shows. \n\nA film that ought to be seen by people who still dare to believe in lifelong love and for those who don&apos;t - forget about it then you&apos;ll just waste your time or think &quot;jee, that&apos;s ridiculous&quot;..."

Rhona Mitra is his mother, who only learns about this when the werewolves descend on their little town.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing original in this story, but both the male and female actors are gorgeous and the fight scenes are good, especially an early gunbattle involving a tough revolver wielding grandmother. The production, however is lacking and looks more like an episode of the week than a big screen flick. The music is even worse.\n\nEven with the tiniest amount of scrutiny, the plot has big holes and at one point you will be yelling at your screen about how a group of people can be so dumb. But in the end its mildly satisfying....and did I mention everyone looks amazing.",

Lewis  and real devotees of bad movies will mention Bill Rebane but no one, I mean NO ONE talks about Coleman Francis.  Even among bad film afficionados he is a forgotten man.  Could his movies be THAT bad? Well actually . . .YES! THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS is a movie people remember to-day because it was Tor Johnson&apos;s last theatrical film.  This movie is the sort of thing drive-in owners lived for.  Swedish Tor Johnson, former wrestling superheavyweight champion (in 1935) plays a Russian rocket scientist named Joseph Javorsky.  He has defected to America to answer the question of how a flag has been mysteriously planted on the moon.  Of course we never find out; in fact that potentially world shaking bit of information is forgotten about 10 minutes into the movie.  Tor is chased by a couple of KGB agents into the desert.  Notice how these 2 young, healthy guys run and run and run but cannot catch up to the 400lb ex-wrestler.  Also notice how they shoot at him from all of 10 meters away and miss!  They are all on a nuclear test site but nobody seems to care about that, until the bomb goes off of course. The atom bomb vaporises the 2 bad guys but Tor survives . . .sort of, and mutates into the mad &quot;beast&quot; whom 2 cops spend the rest of the movie tracking down. This picture is also memorable because it is silent.  Yes, silent!  The soundtrack was either lost or accidentally erased depending on who you talk to (I have heard the same story about THE CREEPING TERROR, 1965) and a narrator tells us what the characters are saying and in some cases even what they are thinking! Is this a classic?  Gadzooks no.  Is it fun?  You bet!  It is on video from several sources.  Back in 1960 you could have seen this at the drive-in on a double bill with the ultra rare Japanese science fiction thriller SECRET OF THE TELEGIAN.  Hmmmm.  If I had been around back then that would deffinitely been worth 35cents of my money. Okay now let&apos;s talk about that other forgotten director, Joe Mascelli who did THE ATOMIC BRAIN (1965)."

      "reviewBody": "Francois Truffaut was a film critic for the magazine Cahiers du cinéma. He was disenchanted with what he saw as a lack of originality and honesty in contemporary cinema. He developed the theory of the auteur in cinema - an idiosyncratic force such as his hero Hitchcock rather than a &apos;civil servant of the cinema&apos;.\n\nHis motivation for entering the cinema was to make films which he, and others like him, wanted to see and which then didn&apos;t exist. Cinema with breadth and imagination, which took risks and broke rules. The zest and vitality of his vision is still evident so many years on.\n\nAfter his impeccable full -length debut, Les Quatre Cents Coups (aka The 400 Blows), which was a slice of life / coming of age tale, Truffaut took a completely different subject matter for this second feature. The source novel is &apos;Down There&apos;, typical US pulp fiction by the little known David Goodis. Its a tale of crime set in seedy locations with a graceless linear plot. Obviously its the way the filmmakers use this source that makes Tirez Sur Le Pianiste the film it is.\n\nCharles Aznavour, a mainstream celebrity in France, is the bizarre but perfect choice for the lead role of Charlie Kohler. His passive, indifferent demeanour makes him an anti-hero of a different kind to Cagney or Brando - one who is ineffective in either solving or preventing crime. This minor cinematic tradition I see as continuing with John Klute in Klute (1971), Marlowe in The Long Goodbye (1973), reaching its comical apex with The Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998).\n\nNot, in fact, that Charlie has to solve any crimes. He is simply out to save his skin - and those of his brothers. His life is in danger throughout the film yet he is more preoccupied with whether or not he should take the arm of the attractive waitress Lena (Marie Dubois) from the dive where he plays the piano, as he walks her home in a scene that is a perfect marriage of its imagery and internal monologue. It is this kind of juxtaposition of themes (threat to life and romantic shyness) which makes this film such compelling and unpredictable viewing.\n\nThe film opens with a charming conversation about the secrets of a happy marriage, spoken by a character we never see again who simply runs into Charlie&apos;s brother Chico (Albert Rémy) - who is the catalyst for the &apos;plot&apos;. The throwaway conversations are really more important to the creative spirit of the film than any of the plot&apos;s major concerns. This trend continues with the characters of Ernest and Momo, the pursuing heavies. Though evidently dangerous men, they speak tangentially on a range of subjects (mostly women, though) which cannot help but remind a modern audience of Tarantino&apos;s hit men in Pulp Fiction. Indeed much of what I said about Truffaut - how he was compelled to make rule-changing cinema that he and others wanted to see - could of course equally be applied to Tarantino.\n\nThe centrepiece of the film goes back to Charlie&apos; past where he was a classical concert pianist. This beautiful vignette explains to us why Charlie is in the pits now. Nicole Berger as Thérèse Saroyan, Charlie&apos;s wife absolutely owns this part of the film. This section also features the celebrated and beautiful sequence where the camera chooses to follow a female violinist from the door of an apartment and out into the courtyard. Why? Just for the sake of artistic freedom, it seems.\n\nAs well as Aznavour and Berger, the casting is uniformly perfect. Claude Mansard and Daniel Boulanger as the waffling heavies, Marie Dubois as the sweet, maternal young waitress Léna, Michèle Mercier as a tart with a heart with a body to die for (bringing the total of female &apos;leads&apos; to three!), Serge Davri and Catherine Lutz as Charlie&apos;s antagonistic and ultimately tragic employers. The obscure threesome (the latter two brothers have their only major film roles here) of Albert Rémy, Jean-Jacques Aslanian and the young Richard Kanayan are brilliantly effective as Charlie&apos;s brothers, all of whom display varying degrees of the criminal element - the &apos;curse&apos; of Charlie and his family. Early on in the film there is also a terrifically amusing song (complete with karaoke-style lyrics) performed by Boby Lapointe, a real-life Parisian entertainer.\n\nFor all its wealth of ideas, though, this is generally not a pacey movie. Its pace is as laidback as Charlie himself at times. But with patience this will reward the audience with all kinds of unexpected delights.",

      "reviewBody": "I read the reviews on-site and many off-site before watching this and saw they were very polarized, so I even went through some European reviews, which treated it quite a bit nicer but which were also pretty polarized. I did notice that, as of this writing, 20% of the people voting here on IMDb gave it a 10, which is significantly higher than even George Clooney&apos;s latest film, &quot;The American&quot; received, although it has a somewhat higher overall score. The major complaint I read amongst all the reviews was about the ongoing narration but, I thought, it&apos;s only a dollar rental and if it&apos;s too intrusive I can always watch something else. So, I decided to give it a spin.\n\nImagine you are watching a young man in a room, alone with the open casket of his mother, who had just passed away from cancer. He&apos;s thinking that the wig the undertaker put on her, to hide her hair loss from the therapy, was unbecoming. He would rather see her for the last time as she really was at the end of her days, bald-headed. This is an important thought of his, which sets up a subsequent scene that would otherwise be totally inexplicable.\n\nHow can a film-maker express this thought? By introducing someone into the room with which the young man can have a conversation about this? No, that destroys the solitude of the moment. By having him speak this thought aloud to his mother&apos;s remains? Not very likely. By creating a completely new scene where someone is present and then create an artifice to have a conversation about it? No, that adds unnecessary complexity and bulk to wade through, confusing the storyline.\n\nWhat Schumacher does is to use a narrator to give the viewer a short-cut directly into the minds of his characters at times - many times. This makes the film somewhat more like a visual book than a movie. It wouldn&apos;t do for most movies but it was effective here. (I got a good chuckle from the vapidity of the last thought of Sara&apos;s that we are exposed to.) It is a different approach but I, for one, enjoyed it. I most probably would not of enjoyed the book this film is based on, as I don&apos;t think there was enough plot substance here to make an enjoyable book for me but I do think there was sufficient substance for a film. 6.5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the second Argentine Noir film I see this year (along with &quot;The Mudboy&quot;) but I think this film has been completely overrated, that leaves much to desired, argumentative but also artistically.\n\nThe film is basically what we all know form a Noir film: a depressed and decadent detective which nevertheless shows great aptitude for the work; the lady in troubles, rich and mysterious that always seems to be hiding more than what she says, the always loyal and always more optimistic companion and of course &quot;The Mafia,&quot; but what I say! If even the junior assistant who handled the car and reveals the photographs appears, well I have seen this on every film of this kind, no surprises here nor will be ahead in the movie. But then the rest of the film is a lot of confusion and turns of the plot quite clumsy, as, for example, the main character that is shown to us as a very Shrewd men and suddenly becomes nothing else but a clueless fool.\n\nI believe, however, that the worst sin is perhaps not to take the chance to portray Argentine society in those troubled years, with all that money spent in all those cars an costumes. \n\nThe end is really surprising, but not because we do not expect that kind of end but, I think, because it is surprising that all ends there.\n\nI think the movie tries to show how facts from the standpoint of the main character no matter if the doubts are clear or not.\n\nBut leaves you with more questions than answers and the impression that the film bite more of what could chew and in the end you keep specking what it is never going to come.\n\nBest luck next time for Darin, which by the way gave a good performance but at times it felt into the confusion of his character, Peretti was relatively well in his semi-comic sidekick, but Julieta Diaz steals the screen with a character very much in his step, no vulnerable blonds but a center-minded passionate Brunette.",

Maybe that&apos;s too high a bar for anyone, but writer-director Malgorzata Szumowska and her team don&apos;t even qualify. The plot of &quot;33 Scenes&quot; is dramatic enough: Julia loses her mother, her father, and her high-flying career prospects all over the course of what seems like a few weeks. But the more drama she takes on, the less you care. Is it because it&apos;s hard to sympathize with a spoiled brat in the first place? Or is it because the movie takes forever to get to the point? My inclination is to blame it on dubbing director Mina Kindl, who was in charge of the German version I have seen. The voice-over is entirely lifeless (and partly out of sync), especially Julia&apos;s. It sounds like it was recorded in a basement studio, with the actors reading from the original script, without even looking at the screen. There simply is no connection between image and sound. I sat through it, but it felt like watching a silent film and listening to an unrelated talking book in parallel. I&apos;m wondering what the Polish version is like. As it stands, avoid.",

When I visited the country of my parents 3 years ago (from Havana to Pinar Del Rio trips), I was overcome with a deep sadness as to how pitiful the international media has covered the plight of Cubans on the island. Finally! This movie captures it all too well and so realistically, so accurately, so heroically! \n\nIt&apos;s about time! \n\nRegardless of how one feels about Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton and the changes the US has made on Cuba&apos;s refugee policies, the people of Cuba live in absolute misery. No other 3rd world country in the Western Hemisphere has so much misery as Cuba. Economic poverty is not Cuba&apos;s worst problem. Misery is! Everywhere I went people on the island of Cuba lived in misery, fear, mistrust, suspicion, a basic ethos are missing, a will to live is gone, anxiety, depression, loneliness, desperateness and more. \n\nIf you want to understand the situation in Cuba as it is today, watch this film. \n\nPity that Hollywood films in America don&apos;t report the truth as it is, without getting bogged down on their stupid political self-righteous statements from their comfortable palatial Hollywood homes.\n\nWatch this movie. It&apos;s great!",

      "reviewBody": "This film by Maurice Pialat is included as a special feature on the DVD for &quot;Naked Childhood&quot;--another Pialat film. Unlike &quot;Naked Childhood&quot;, this one is a short film and a documentary. It&apos;s about the hopelessness of life in the Parisian suburbs. The grayness of life and the monotony of existence are emphasized in the film&apos;s narration and images. &quot;L&apos;amour Exists&quot; appears to be a film pushing for social change--in support of the socialist or perhaps communist view for the future of the nation. However, and here&apos;s the interesting part, if you cut out a few clips (such as the wretched huts a few lived in that are shown in a very brief part of the film), I could imagine the same film being shown with POSITIVE and happy narration--talking about how good life in the &apos;burbs is! It&apos;s all in the perspective and the one in this film is decidedly negative in order to make its point. A well made film but one you should not watch if you&apos;re feeling depressed--it will only make it worse!",

The cast does try, but Stockard Channing is the only cast member that actually rises above the material, she is the only one you care about at all, and Mary Stuart Masterson is pretty good. It isn&apos;t a complete disaster, there are some interesting scenes between the cliché&apos;s. It could of used a little more trimming as well, it overlong at an hour and 52 minutes, and there are definitely a few obvious scenes that should have been edited out.",

      "reviewBody": "The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show &quot;Monk&quot; has become.\n\nCrowe&apos;s character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as &quot;Monk,&quot; but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don&apos;t take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain&apos;t so. (One example: in real life, Nash&apos;s wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)\n\nThe first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn&apos;t have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I&apos;m not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005&apos;s &quot;Cinderella Man.&quot;\n\nFor those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven&apos;t seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash&apos;s actions from the beginning.",

      "reviewBody": "THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) \n\nThe 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.\n\nHow do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami&apos;s awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.\n\nBoth the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a &quot;true story,&quot; and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.\n\nThe actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.\n\nThe big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family&apos;s three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.\n\nNo one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami&apos;s effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn&apos;t try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.\n\nThe Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.\n\nRay Lahey",

CID is a crime-suspense movie and the Hollywood influence is showing. The movie is also remembered for songs like &quot;Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan&quot; featuring Johny Walker. The songs is about the city of Bombay and its crooked life. Other hits include &quot;Kahin Pe Nigahen Kahin Pe Nishana&quot; &quot;Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya&quot; &quot;Bujh Mera Kya Naam Re Nadi Kinare Gaam Re&quot;.\n\nThe hugely successful movie will always be remembered as Dev Anand&apos;s greatest hits. I recommend it to any fan of Dev Anand or anyone interested in the history of Bollywood. Khosla went on to direct some more hits for the Navketan banner. Including Kalaa Pani and Bambai Ka Babu.\n\n8/10 for the movie&apos;s Historical Significance in Bollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "I was only little when i first rented Prehysteria on video way back in the early 90&apos;s &amp; this little cute fantasy comedy has stayed in my movie loving mind since then.\n\nI&apos;m 38 now &amp; just revisited this old school gem &amp; was so surprised by how well it holds up today. It&apos;s 2023 now &amp; this relatively low-budget family B-movie that went direct-to-video is as good and as much fun as anything that&apos;s come out lately. There&apos;s a magic to those old flicks we grew up watching &amp; loving, there&apos;s no CGI, just old fashioned practical effects &amp; puppetry &amp; awesome stop-motion. Legendary B-movie producer &amp; director Charles Band was behind this movie &amp; many other&apos;s i grew up watching such as Puppet Master 1&amp;2, Troll, Ghoulies Trilogy, Demonic Toys, Robot Jox, Dolls &amp; Prehysteria. Charles Band had that awesome Full Moon features label that released tons of fun, fantasy &amp; horror B-movies direct-to-video in my local Blockbuster. Prehysteria is a fun little light-hearted family Comedy that&apos;s full of fantasy &amp; awesome miniature Dinosaurs. This gem has plenty of heart &amp; that 90&apos;s innocence that&apos;s lost today. Not only is Prehysteria a nice bit of Nostalgia entertainment it&apos;s also a lovely piece of Escapism to a much better time.\n\nA typical all American father &amp; his two kids, a lonely young boy (the kid from Schwarzenegger&apos;s Last Action Hero) &amp; his rebellious teenage sister live in a secluded farmhouse (like in Critters) &amp; accidentally bring home a bunch of magical ancient Dinosaurs eggs. The magical eggs are from an expedition from an ancient underground tomb in an ancient jungle &amp; taken by a collector of rare oddities. The collector &amp; stealer of the eggs is played by the underrated &amp; hilarious Full Moon Films regular STEPHEN LEE.\n\nStephen Lee was a funny likeable comic actor that i grew up watching in greats like Dolls &amp; Robocop 2 &amp; Ghoulies Go To College, he was a comic genius similar to the likes of Dan Aykroyd or James Belushi or John Candy, but never made it as big. Stephen Lee is the sort-of villain of this family gem, he&apos;s all about the money that these mini mutant Dinosaurs can get him &amp; he&apos;s a hilariously silly character &amp; a joy to watch as he wants those dinos back from the family. Of course the family love the little creatures &amp; want to protect them from Stephen Lees greedy collector Rico Sarno.\n\nCharles Band directed this gem from his family entertainment sub-label MoonBeam Entertainment.\n\nThe fx are wonderful &amp; take you right back the fun &amp; fantasy of being a kid with a wondering imagination.\n\nIt was so nice revisiting this feel good flick &amp; remembering why i loved it so much as a kid. It was a hit of home video &amp; i loved it.\n\nAlso the movie has a lovely playful music score by Charles Band&apos;s brother Richard, the guy is great &amp; scored most of the Classic&apos;s from Full Moon Films like Demonic Toys &amp; Puppet Master &amp; Dolls for an example.\n\nAll in all Prehysteria is a lovely, sweet light-hearted family adventure that&apos;s full of fantasy &amp; fun.",

Khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!).\n\nAlso, the Tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures , any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie would stand testament to that statement.\n\nNow Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is a great movie!",

      "reviewBody": "I started watching this movie because it sounded like it involved something about a train accident. It does, but that&apos;s not what this movie is about. What got me is the sad clip of the train engineer&apos;s wife looking at her mastectomy in the mirror - couldn&apos;t stop watching after that. The story is both tragic and uplifting - but most of all it&apos;s compelling to watch once you get started.\n\nStorywise, it starts out with a mother who commits suicide by placing her car in front of an approaching train. The train engineer makes a judgment call to hit the car instead of risking a sudden stop. Eventually, her son finds his way into the lives of the engineer and his terminally ill wife... and the story progresses from there.\n\nThe story itself is unusual and that made it a somewhat novel experience. The acting is amazing - esp. by Marcia Gay Harden (the ill wife). It&apos;s definitely a show worth watching if you&apos;re looking for a well-done drama.",

      "reviewBody": "In a small mountain village in France, they are not going to ring the church bells until the return of a relic, the Green Glove. Suddenly the bells start to ring, and when they investigate, they find a dead man, and the relic in its old place. We then drop back a few years....\n\nOh, why bother? It&apos;s a typical Hitchcock plot, with the Green Glove the Maguffin which everyone wants, Glenn Ford and Geraldine Brooks the plucky Americans whom we&apos;re supposed to root for, and George Macready the bad guy. True, it&apos;s not Hitchcock directing, but it is Charles Bennett doing the writing, which is probably why he lifted the pub scene from THE 39 STEPS. It&apos;s not plagiarism when you steal from yourself. It&apos;s just lazy.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say this is a bad movie. Director Rudolph Maté, having spent 28 years being a fine cinematographer, always made his movies visually interesting, and the big pursuit up the mountain that leads into the finish is very impressive. It does go on too long, with a slow start, and Ford doesn&apos;t impress me in this role. To be honest, he rarely impresses me in any role, but the audiences of the era seemed to like him, so it&apos;s obviously just me. Miss Brooks gives it her all, and Macready is creepy, as he could be.",

      "name": "Attacking the Stalinist era one man at a time...",
      "reviewBody": "After the death of Stalin, folks in the Soviet Union were allowed to express their feelings towards his reign of terror...at least to a point. However, the government also was concerned that these complaints might lead to complaints about the current system--and this is probably why &quot;Repentance&quot; was banned for several years after it was filmed. It does attack the Stalinist era and mentality--but apparently those in power at the time weren&apos;t willing to allow such a film to be released.\n\n&quot;Repentance&quot; is a very surreal sort of film--one which has many story elements that seem dreamy and unreal while the rest of it is quite literal. While there were purges, seeing the 20th century purges carried out by knights in armor, a living statue of Justice and many other story elements are dream-like and strange. This is not really a complaint--just an observation. The film looks almost like Dalí or Buñuel added a few touches here and there...just a few.\n\nThe story begins in the present day. The beloved mayor of a Georgian town, Varlem, has died and folks come to his funeral to pay their respects. However, several times after the funeral, the body of this man has been taken from the crypt and placed in his yard! After the third time, they catch the woman responsible and she is taken into custody. At the hearing, she openly admits having done it and tells a story of long ago--when Varlem first became mayor. At that time, he made a name for himself persecuting the innocent--and the story is about how this impacted the woman personally.\n\nFollowing her long tale, the story goes to the present day. The hypocrisy and evil of Valem&apos;s friends are examined as well--including one case about a man who struggles between Atheism and Christianity. Under Christianity, he SHOULD feel guilt--and he ultimately gets to meet the Devil (this is pretty weird...and clever). Other folks all begin to confront their own part in Varlem&apos;s reign of terror.\n\nInstead of this film directly attacking Stalinism, it clearly attacks these tactics on a smaller scale. And, I am sure it was not unintentional that Varlem looked much like a bloated Hitler! A very strange but daring film. While today it might be seen as very tame, back in the mid-1980s it must have caused the filmmakers a lot of problems--and potentially prison. Quite clever but quite slow and strange. Well worth seeing--especially if you lived through this era.",

      "reviewBody": "As far as story and content goes this owes more than a little to The  Last Emperor (1987), which is not surprising since Director Kaige Chen  was a member of the cast of that film and no doubt was influenced by  its success. But stylistically, and especially as the film was directed  and cut, &quot;Farewell, My Concubine&quot; is original and stands alone. If The  Last Emperor was a Western movie about the Chinese political experience  in the Twentieth Century, then Farewell, My Concubine is a Chinese  movie, influenced by the West, about that same experience. While the  former focused on the emperor and those around him, &quot;Farewell...&quot;  focuses on two actors of the Beijing opera.   Admittedly, &quot;Farewell...&quot; is long (I saw the 157-minute version) and  sometimes strays from it intent, but gains and maintains power and  keeps our interest mainly because everything is presented in a  starkly-lit, intensely focused manner. The epic-like story itself is  good if a little pedestrian at times. The lavish and stunning sets in  opulent color and design, are just fascinating to view. Everything from  the extras in the crowds to the porcelain for tea is carefully chosen  and presented. Particularly striking are the traditional costumes and  makeup, shown to advantage through the fine camera work. But what makes  the film is the glimpse we get of the world of the Beijing opera and  its traditions. From the Dickensian boy&apos;s school for the actors to the  intrigues with patrons and the political powers that be, there&apos;s the  sense of a world beyond our experience.  The acting was also excellent. The beautiful Gong Li, who played Duan&apos;s  wife was captivating as she displayed a wide range of emotion. Leslie  Cheung as Dieyi, &quot;the concubine,&quot; and Fengyi Zhang as Duan, &quot;the king,&quot;  were also excellent. The boys who played the actors as children,  especially the actor who played Douzi, were first rate.",

      "reviewBody": "The evil Fu Manchu continues his endless quest for world domination but first; he has developed a plan to eliminate his arch-enemies (of which Scotland Yard&apos;s Nayland Smith is top priority). So our oriental master-criminal has kidnapped 10 of the most beautiful women on the planet and stuffed their bodies with the world&apos;s deadliest poison. Their orders are to seduce the enemies and kill them with &quot;the kiss of death&quot;. His fiendish plan almost succeeds but Smith survives the assault and goes after Fu Manchu, who shelters in the jungles of South America. The premise of this sequel sounds promising enough but, don&apos;t be fooled, it&apos;s a terribly boring and unexciting film. There are so many things wrong with this production I don&apos;t even properly know where to start. For starters, the screenplay introduces way too many characters and actually none of them are worth mentioning. There&apos;s no tension and there&apos;s a total lack of gore and sleaze, as well (considering Jess Franco signed for the direction, I was at least hoping for this). There are a lot of battle sequences but they&apos;re painfully tame and tedious. Franco makes no use of the great jungle-location at all and the editing is lousy. Judging by his emotionless performance, Christopher Lee wasn&apos;t interesting in repeating the Fu Manchu role for the fourth time at all. Jess Franco also directs on automatic pilot, meaning without the slightest bit of passion or motivation. For him this was just another easy-money job in between some euro-trash cinema highlights like &quot;99 Women&quot; and &quot;Marquis de Sade: Justine&quot;. The absolute best Fu Manchu film remains the 1932 &quot;Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (starring Boris Karloff), although Don Sharp&apos;s efforts &quot;the Face of.&quot; and &quot;The Brides of &quot; are pretty good as well. There&apos;s absolutely nothing to recommend about this one, so avoid unless you&apos;re a perfectionist...or really REALLY bored.",

Observed on a level that can only be described as stark realism, a true departure from Suo&apos;s august social comedies and a distinct legal procedural going by its narrative trajectory of showing the inciting incident, investigation and to the courtroom in its various stages of due process  Teppei Kaneko (Ryo Kase) is accused of molesting a schoolgirl on his way to a job interview, subsequently coerced by weary detectives to accept the charge and pay the fine instead of pursuing vindication  a system that Suo notes as the reason for Japan&apos;s almost perfect conviction rate and institutionalised prejudice against the accused.",

This film was much better than I thought it would be - think this is the first time I have seen a flash back film done well where there is much jumping between 2 time periods - 1945 and 1975. I do like my WWII films especially when there good and this has a great duel story line and is a real thriller that unfolds before your eyes in the two time periods. You sort of can&apos;t help but play detective yourself as you watch the film connecting the dots as they unfold in front of you. Great acting and a great script. Just a shame there is like an over dubbing - think it&apos;s there translating the German spoken in the film to Polish as it&apos;s a Polish film - don&apos;t notice this with the Russian in the film - maybe most Poles know Russian? Any way that aside I would recommend this if you like war films especially World War II period ones.",

But the leads are hilarious as they try to navigate the script and dialogue. A bit off kilter considering it&apos;s predecessors. But it is a comedy of sorts. It&apos;s definitely up there with a guilty pleasures viewing that you don&apos;t want to admit you like. Watch for a good laugh."

      "reviewBody": "I have to admit that I had some reserves about this movie before watching it. Although my mother told me this is one of her favorite war movies ever (yes I know, it may sound a bit strange, but we have the same taste for war movies), I also saw a rather bad score on IMDb (about 6.6 at the time). Well, now that I&apos;ve seen it, I can only say that this movie will be in my top 5 of war movies. This movie shows war the way it actually is: dirty, deadly, tragic,... and with plenty of losers, but no winners. In this movie you won&apos;t find any glorification of fake patriotism or dying for a good cause that only politicians in their ivory towers seem to know. No, this movie shows the war in its purest and most horrifying form.\n\nIt brings us the story of Rolf Steiner, a veteran hardened by the war, who leads his men through every battle and dangerous situation, but who also takes care that they will survive the madness. Than a Prussian officer, who volunteered to leave the quiet, battle-free world of France for the real action in Russia, joins his fighting group. The man thinks of only one thing: to get an iron cross as fast as possible, so his family can be proud and shouldn&apos;t see him as a disgrace to their military tradition. This leads to a lot of problems between the two of course and gradually the tension cumulates until it explodes... \n\nI don&apos;t know if the story is based on true facts, but the movie certainly gives a good idea of what the war at the Eastern Front was like, especially after the Germans had suffered a major loss in Stalingrad. They had to retread, but had to take care that they didn&apos;t get overwhelmed by the Soviet troops when doing so; a lot of the man had lost faith in victory; no prisoners were taken, but were shot at the spot; optimism had made place for cynicism ... It all feels very real and believable.\n\nAnd the feeling of realism can also be found in the way of filming. Some might say Peckinpah experimented too much with slow-motion, hand-held camera&apos;s,... but personally I believe it only gives an extra dimension to this movie, giving it that extra touch that makes it different from so many mediocre Hollywood productions. I really liked the way he followed the action closely, making you feel like you are part of it yourself, but what really sparked my interest was the contrast between the child&apos;s voice singing a &quot;happy&quot; song and the images of the horrors of the war at the beginning and the end of the movie. That really made shivers go down my spine.\n\nIf I thought about anti-war movies, I always used to name the World War I classic &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (the 1930 version as well as the remake from 1979), but from now on I&apos;ll have to add one extra movie: Cross of Iron. If you are a fan of realistic (anti-)war movies, than this is a movie you shouldn&apos;t miss. I give it a 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Oddly enough I haven&apos;t seen &quot;Prison On Fire&quot; (aka &quot;Gam yuk fung wan&quot;) from 1987 before now in 2020. I happened to get the chance to sit down and watch parts I and II, and being a big fan of the Hong Kong cinema, of course I did so.\n\nAnd the fact that it had Chow Yun Fat and Tony Ka Fai Leung on the cast list, of course helped sweeten the deal.\n\nWhile writer Yin Nam and director Ringo Lam definitely were on to something unique with &quot;Prison On Fire&quot;, it just felt that the movie was lacking that particular something to make it truly outstanding. Perhaps it was the fact that the storyline felt a bit too scripted and predictable, or because oddly enough not a single police officer in the prison facility had a firearm.\n\n&quot;Prison On Fire&quot; is a good prison movie, but it just feels like director Ringo Lam was cushioning the movie a bit, not making it fully as rough and gritty as it deserved to be.\n\nAside from Chow Yun Fat and Tony Ka Fai Leung, the movie does have a good cast ensemble of actors to help bring the movie to life on the screen.\n\nThis is definitely an enjoyable movie and one that is well-worth the time to sit down and watch. My rating of &quot;Prison On Fire&quot; is a six out of ten stars. I was genuinely entertained by what transpired on the screen.",

Walking Tall however isn&apos;t that bad and it&apos;s one of the better remakes out there. Dwayne Johnson is solid as the lead and proves to be a talented actor while bringing some of his wresting experience to the movie during the action/fight sequences. Johnson turns in a good performance of a man who returns home to find it overrun by crime and corruption, which drives him to become sheriff in order to put an end to it. The rest of the cast including Johnny Knoxville, Neal McDonough, and Ashley Scott are okay in their roles but (except for maybe Knoxville) they&apos;re not given much to do. The movie felt short and rushed with an 86 minute running time. Some of the fight sequences especially the one near the end between Johnson and McDonough go over the top. Johnson&apos;s performance however and the action sequences make this movie worth seeing at least once. Overall despite its flaws Walking Tall is decent remake one of the better ones with intense action, fist fights, some humor, and good performances by the cast.",

Forcing a marriage is not only not relatable for America (Mia&apos;s country of origin), but also not exciting to watch Anne Hatheway reject guys and have to settle. And all the while they ignore the obvious solution.\n\nThere is a lot of fun with the idea of a American princess just having fun with a lot of resources, and touching bits with her using her power for good.\n\nSadly, again, the movie doesn&apos;t feel like it does anything special, despite all the &quot;pizazz&quot; they layer on.\n\nAgain, it&apos;s good, but it is weaker than the original, and unless you have the background of that movie, you&apos;re not missing anything by skipping this one.",

But there&apos;s the question: why does everything seem so perfect? The answer lies in the firm&apos;s unseemly other side. And they&apos;re not just going to let Mitch blow their cover.\n\nSydney Pollack pulled off everything perfectly here. It&apos;s sort of like an Ira Levin novel how everything plays out. You may be suspicious of everything after seeing this movie. Above all, it shows that Tom Cruise can actually do a good job when he tries. Also starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, David Strathairn and Gary Busey.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to believe that this was the first movie adaptation of a John Grisham novel.",

      "reviewBody": "While I was scrolling through the different titles available this weekend, I chanced upon &quot;Larry Crowne&quot;. Looked it up on IMDb; not so good - an average of 5/10. Scroll down further and voilà! Written by Tom Hanks himself, gotta see it. And I&apos;m glad I did.\n\nFirst, let me get the &apos;acting&apos; part out of the way - It&apos;s good. Not mind-blowing, but most certainly good enough to be worth the US$9 weekend price of a movie ticket here in Singapore. The actors were good enough that I felt connected, and that&apos;s as good as it ever has to be.\n\nAs for the plot - nothing jaw-droppingly complicated and twisted, but then again neither was Forest Gump. And what a big success that movie proved to be. Don&apos;t expect character development to blow you away, but it did, at the very least, impress me.\n\nOf course, if you walk into the theater expecting &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; or &quot;Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; humor, you would most definitely be sorely disappointed. Some others have criticized the film, saying that it had &quot;cheap laughs&quot; at best. Now that isn&apos;t necessarily true, because it all depends on what your expectations are.\n\nSo hear this - Larry Crowne isn&apos;t an all-out-LOL-fest, it&apos;s a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle, clever, and thoughtful humor.\n\nIn my opinion, this film was an excellent cross-section representation of the sandwiched American Middle-class - too rich to qualify for welfare, too poor to save any money. Most people (outside the United States) wouldn&apos;t know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren&apos;t crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.\n\nHollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.\n\nAll things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there&apos;s much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you&apos;d most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.\n\nOne final thing - I&apos;ve never written a review for any movie before, ever. But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.\n\nCheers.",

The story of this film seems so realistic; lives of 3 twenty something Korean girls who are searching for love.  It seems that these women are so obsessed with sex, but aren&apos;t we all do?  In my opinion, this film portrays the inherent side of most modern Asian women, the side that they only share with their closest female friends, or even with themselves only.  They went through loneliness, confusion on how to express their sexual desire, and last of all, finding what they want from life.  I don&apos;t know, but I felt that the script writer is smart enough to make this piece of film so explicit yet not so overdone that it still feels very real.  Big applause to all the actors, they dare to act, and they did it to the level that many professional hollywood actors might be put into shame.  Great movie for those who are in the mood for some real-life sexual aspect of women.  Sex and the City for Korean, I think.",

Edward Woodward&apos;s love/hate relationship (enfasis on the hate) with David comes across excelently. Richard Gere does an adequate job. I can&apos;t stand his style on most films that I have seen him but here he is just fine. The Jonathan character is heroic and handsome, while the actor who portrays the prophet Nathan does as best a job as anyone could do. Some minor problems/irritations, the location of Jerusalem should have been a more scenic and lush one, not desert-like. Jerusalem might be semi-desert today but 3,000 years ago it was a beautiful land flowing with milk and honey. Highlights include David&apos;s dance before the Ark of the Covenant, the battle scene versus the Phillistines where King Saul is killed with his sons (Mel Gibson must have seen it) is Braveheart light, but realistic nonetheless. There are many more, I just wish it could have been longer due to them skipping a whole part of his later life all the way up to his deathbed. One of the better Biblical adaptations nonetheless.",

      "reviewBody": "Like BEYOND TOMORROW (1940; see my comments to that film), this is another little-known Yuletide flick which has been saved from public domain, colorized and retitled on its Fox DVD; in fact, not only was this originally shot in black-and-white but was named THE GREAT RUPERT after the amiable puppet of a kilt-wearing dancing squirrel who helps to realize the impoverished protagonists&apos; recurring Christmas wish. In fact, Rupert proved to be the first creature animated for a feature-length film by famed sci-fi producer George Pal and is also notable as one of big-nosed multi-talented entertainer Jimmy Durante&apos;s best film vehicles.\n\nThe story starts with down-and-out animal trainer Jimmy Conlin being evicted from his ramshackle apartment by miserly landlord Frank Orth but Conlin&apos;s squirrel soon returns to Conlin&apos;s old hide which is already occupied by the equally penniless acrobatic trio, the Amendolas played by Durante, Queenie Smith and Terry Moore. Predictably enough, Orth&apos;s ne&apos;r-do-well musician son Tom Drake falls for Moore but is soon driven to distraction by the unwarranted attention the latter is receiving from visiting Broadway agent Don Beddoe looking to re-engage Conlin for his act. Meanwhile, Rupert himself is getting annoyed with Mr. Orth&apos;s storing his weekly stash of cash in his wooden house...\n\nAlthough George Pal&apos;s puppet effects are nicely enough done, &quot;Schnozzle&quot; Durante is practically the whole show here and, typically, he has a couple of numbers featuring his eccentric singing-and-piano-playing style. Actor/director Irving Pichel  who, apparently, also appears in the film as a &quot;puzzled pedestrian&quot;  hands the light material quite competently which makes this unassuming concoction a gently pleasing alternative to the usual Christmas fare.",

      "name": "Surprisingly absorbing",
      "reviewBody": "I found this experimental film absorbing, even funny (intentionally) in one spot. The concept is very simple. A series of locked off shots where a train, not visible at first, enters frame, goes all the way through, and leaves frame. What makes it interesting is Benning&apos;s wide range of compositions and framings, from extremely wide and distant, to having the train right on top of us, along with the wide range of settings, from snow covered, to desert, to crossing bridges over water. The variations between the trains themselves are fascinating as well, so by the end this becomes a study of the nature of perception as much as anything. \n\nBenning also adds context over a few of the images by adding audio clips from the past; Eisenhower&apos;s famed military-industrial complex speech, a snatch of &apos;This land is your land&apos;. While some have understandably criticized these sound bites as too intrusive and too on the nose, to me, in such a strange context they worked wonders, opening my mind up to the films&apos; possible bigger meanings; trains as an instrument of imperialism, as a symbol of destruction of the environment, as a great equalizer that made long distance travel possible for the masses. \n\nPlus, lets face it, trains are simply cool to look at. Something about their power, size, history makes them almost mythological presences in themselves."

This should not come as a surprise to anyone, as sequels very rarely are as good as the original (though some select few do tend to be better).\n\nWe still had awesome kicks, a humor that was a bit more crude, and we had way more explosions in this one (not surprising, given the villains are bombers). But we do not get to see as much glass break, and I think the overall destruction is never quite as high. How do you top the destruction of an entire village from part one?",

      "reviewBody": "Though he&apos;s not credited, this film seems to be based on a story by Edogawa Rampo, which has previously been adapted in the anthology film Rampo Noir. This film transports the story to the WWII era. Keigo Kasuya returns home from the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1940 a quadruple amputee - no arms, no legs - without the ability to speak. His wife (Shinobu Terajima) is reviled, but soon falls back into her position as loyal spouse. The film examines the patriotic fervor of the times - Kasuya is declared a &quot;war god&quot; and is worshiped by the locals. Privately, the couple&apos;s life is Hell. A power struggle arises between them, and Terajima - who before the war was a victim of abuse by her husband - realizes she has power that she didn&apos;t have before. The political aspects of the film are the most interesting part. The focus on sex - which was the main focus of Rampo&apos;s story - gets a tad boring after a while. Both leads are fantastic, particularly Terajima, who obviously has a lot more to do. The film could stand to look better - it was filmed digitally and transferred to film, and is very murky. All in all, it&apos;s quite good.",

Russell Crowe is a force of nature, and all the other actors from Paul Bettany to Billy Boyd give wonderful performances. I especially enjoyed the details of life at sea, though most would call them boring. The day after my 5-day rental, I had to run to the nearest shop and buy the DVD, and have since re-watched it endlessly. I&apos;ve never seen a more beautifully adapted, filmed and acted movie.

      "reviewBody": "Just finished watching this excellent movie. It&apos;s based on a true story, so there won&apos;t be any spoilers here. It&apos;s the story of Jessica Watsonl who&apos;s always dreamed of sailing around the world by herself. She&apos;s on a quest to be the younger person to do so.\n\nAs you&apos;d expect, she certainly has her share of obstacles. But she shows the true grit needed to complete such an adventure. The film goes from her at sea, to flashbacks of her growing up and all the things that led to this amazing adventure.\n\nI thought the acting was absolutely spot on. The photography and special effects were tremendous as well. And it&apos;s full of breathtaking action scenes that make you feel you&apos;re on board with her. There&apos;s one absolutely gorgeous scene when she&apos;s caught in a dead-air zone. She stares at the night sky just full of stars with the David Bowie&apos;s &quot;Star Man&quot; quietly playing. It&apos;s quite haunting.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a great film the whole family will enjoy, don&apos;t miss this one! But be sure to have some tissues handy. There are a couple of emotional scenes where even this jaded film reviewer puddled up a bit.",

      "reviewBody": "The follow-up to 1954&apos;s excellent Musashi Miyamoto, Duel at Ichijoji Temple picks up the story several years later, as an exiled orphan-turned-swordsman gains notoriety via a bloody tour of fatal duels. His reputation precedes him in returning to his hometown, where old rivals of both a violent and intimate nature await. This is a film about personal growth - specifically that of the samurai himself, who struggles to learn the key concepts of what his new life actually entails and where the rift lies between honor and reverence. We&apos;re never quite sure if Musashi takes this lesson to heart, particularly since he&apos;s so keen to maintain an impenetrable outer facade in almost every situation. It&apos;s a tricky role for period veteran Toshiro Mifune, who struggles with the more nuanced, flatter aspects of the character. In the previous episode, with the fires of young-adulthood to toy with, he excelled. Here, faced with the malaise of mid-life and the accompanying questions of his own being, his performance is far less sublime. The plot, cramped with too many faces and several seemingly-pointless subplots, does him no favors in dancing around the issues and repeating itself on more than one occasion. This could have been an excellent one-act show, and the final half-hour could still stand alone as precisely that. It lacks the gumption of its predecessor, however, and too often cuts away just as the action is getting good.",

I was surprised that german money flow in this dutch production, because moviefoundations in germany support a lot of crap, just my opinion. People who like to go deeper, ask questions for himself, perhaps heard something of mk ultra &amp; stuff like that, will have a solid maked movie, would give smthng between 7 - 8, but think this movie needs a little push in rating.

      "reviewBody": "Hate to say it guys, but I liked this one better.  One was good, but this one is so silly, so comical at times, that I just loved it.  If you&apos;re unfamiliar with the format, there are 3 short stories featured here.  Up first is a wooden indian that adorns the front of a general store, coming to life to kill the goons who gunned down his owners.  Holt McCallany is very strong as the foul mouthed leader of the gang.  And the way he gets his...hoo boy.  Number two has a man-eating oil slick(?) snacking on teens on a wooden raft.  And most people are right when they say it looks like a big hefty bag.  And a moment that will have you rolling, and that will give teenage boys ideas and have men remembering fondly when they may have done it, is where the surviving guy takes a peek under the surviving girls sweater.  Good to see where this dudes priorities are; two of his friends are dead, he&apos;s nearly been killed, and he decides its a good time to look at boobies.  I loved it.  But my absolute favorite of both Creepshow films is the hitchhiker story.  It&apos;s so hysterically unrealistic that it still makes me laugh all these years later.  With Lois Chiles mind-losing dialogue, and the dead guys constant &quot;thanks for the ride, lady!&quot; I can&apos;t imagine a funnier, more exciting short story than that.  In a perfect world Tom Wright, who played the hitchhiker, wouldda been nominated for an Oscar. Also a high five to the campy look of the film, with all three films set in the middle of nowhere, one at sea, one (mostly) in the woods.  A lot of fun I say, though most hated this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Shot in Costa Rica in 1988, &apos;El Dorado&apos; is one of a rare breed, a Spanish film about its own role in America in the 16th century. However, this film doesn&apos;t tell a story of glory and conquest, but one of failure and slow descent into madness.\n\nThe story is about an expedition down the Orinoco river in 1560, undertaken by Spanish soldiers with the aim of finding the famed land of El Dorado, where gold is supposedly plentiful. I suppose that it is not a spoiler to say that the place doesn&apos;t exist and that what the expeditioners find is something completely different.\n\nThe film is 142 minutes long, and not exactly action-packed, so a prospective viewer should realise that the leisurely pace is meant to reflect the utter boredom provoked by the long and uneventful days in the journey, but these &apos;dead&apos; days, as in many expeditions, are punctuated by moments of high intensity and tension in which the travellers will have to react to the challenges thrown at them by the jungle... or by themselves. In this sense the film is a study on how to face (or not) insurmountable obstacles in extreme conditions, in particular when greed, pride and lust are thrown into the mix.\n\nThe filming on location does half the job for the film-makers. The river and the jungle are like one additional character, and one can feel the stuffy Old-worlders slowly stewing under their heavy shirts and armour as the days pass. I find a bit of fault with the way Lope de Aguirre, the main character, is played. The film goes for understated menace from a quietly unscrupulous man, which ends up adding to the slowness of the film. Of course, that&apos;s the director&apos;s choice, but I feel that a bit of energy and feeling of danger coming from the villain of the piece would have been welcome.\n\nAll in all, it&apos;s an effort that meant a lot for Spanish cinema in the 1980s, having been filmed only four years before the 5th centenary of the discovery of America and just a decade into full democracy after the Franco dictatorship. But it if has to be enjoyed, one must come with &apos;Apocalypto&apos; Mode firmly shut off.",

Maria joins the group and unites the Republican troops against the General Franco army ; later on , she eventually goes to the front of Aragon . The women&apos;s group takes on the problems of battling not only the nationalists, but also factions on the left seeking to impose a more traditional military structure . Then occurs confrontation between FAI, CNT , AIT , anarchists followers of the leader Durruti (who gave name to the Column Durruti , here well played by Hector Colome), regular troops of the Republican government, Stalinists and Troskists.\n\nThis interesting historical story is a passionate retelling and a touching warlike drama . The film originated an intense discussion in Spain about its principal theme , the Spanish Civil War . ¨Libertarias¨ results to be other of the innumerable stories to deal with dramatic deeds regarding the Civil War background . A familiar theme about the global horrors of a fratricide war , impossible to forget to our cinema . &quot;Libertarias¨, adapted by the same director from a story by Román Gubern and José Luis Guarner whom is dedicated the movie . Vicente Aranda also writes the script and being filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thought-provoking issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement .The main problem has to face &quot;Libertarias&quot;, beyond not being able to avoid falling into the politic pamphlet is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging, which eventually become monotonous over two hours and some of footage . This is a Spanish big budget production and obtained much success in the box-office . Excellent female cast forming a powerful human group of women and giving excellent interpretations . Very good support cast playing revolutionary women and men such as Blanca Apilánez as Aura , Laura Mañá as Concha , Loles León as Charo , Jorge Sanz as Obrero Hijo , José Sancho as Obrero padre , Antonio Iranzo , Antonio Dechent, Enrique Villen , among others . Perceptible , sensitive as well as evocative musical score by Jose Nieto . Including a spotless pictorial cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine , Pedro Almodovar&apos;s usual, he carries out a photography with juicy atmosphere , being filmed in Madrid, and Vic, Barcelona, Catalonia . Jose Luis Alcaine is deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameraman with a long artistic career .Furthermore , a willingness , almost perfect of the elements of each shot , every sequence, every space .\n\nThe motion picture was lavishly produced by the great producer Andres Vicente Gomez , being well directed by veteran filmmaker Vicente Aranda . He directed a series of award-winning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best Spanish filmmakers . Vicente is an expert on literary adaptations , he has been working from the 60s with ¨Fata Morgana¨ , Las Crueles¨ and ¨Novia Ensangrentada¨ . His greatest successes were intense dramas with plenty of sex such as ¨Amantes¨, ¨Pasion Turca¨ , ¨Si Dicen que Cai¨ , ¨Intruso¨ , ¨Tiempo de Silencio¨ , ¨Carmen¨ , and specially the historical story titled ¨Juana La Loca¨.",

It&apos;s beautifully shot, well-acted, and a powerful story of hope vs. Despair. Apparently, a popular hit in Britain, it doesn&apos;t seem to have made much of a mark in the U.

      "reviewBody": "The Boys From Syracuse (1940 Universal) starring Alan Jones and Martha Raye is a great classic black and white musical comedy movie, but it disappeared. Why?\n\nThe only copy of this movie presently (February 2011) available for sale by WWW.Amazon.Com on DVD costs $134, and that&apos;s too much for any sensible (and impoverished) person to pay.\n\nThe movie is currently (February 2011) sold through Amazon.Com by &quot;Suzie Quik&quot; of California.\n\nToo bad.\n\nI saw this wonderful movie on television when I was a little boy in the 1950&apos;s, and remember every great moment of it. The music (Rodgers and Hart) and the acting are all breathtaking.\n\nBut the movie &quot;slipped between the cracks,&quot; and is largely forgotten in the present age when &quot;classics&quot; are listed many places, but never include this classic.\n\nThat is also true of Wake Up And Live (1937 Fox) starring Alice Faye, Jack Hailey, and Walter Winchell, another great movie almost never listed and discussed when &quot;great movies&quot; are ranked and publicized.\n\nThe movie is currently (February 2011) sold through Amazon.Com by &quot;Suzie Quik&quot; of California. It is presently for sale at the whopping price of $135.99, two bucks more than The Boys From Syracuse (1940 Universal) starring Alan Jones and Martha Raye.\n\nIt may be that people operating the &quot;Suzie Quik&quot; movie sales service specialize in hard to get movies sold at huge prices. By any measure, $134. and $136 are huge prices, even for rich people.\n\nHopefully this will change.\n\nThe days of &quot;cheap good movies&quot; may be coming to an end, and all this could be a signal about that.\n\nIt is well to remember that the history of movies includes a vast number of creations, some of which were and are dazzling, but unknown and largely unavailable to the general public, and even to those few who do know about the &quot;unavailable, unpublicized classic movies.&quot; \n\n-------------\n\nWritten by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

      "reviewBody": "I had mixed expectations when I was going in to see Dear John. I had never really given any thought about how good or bad it might be, because it was a night out with friends and I was unconcerned at the moment. Eventually, we started to watch the movie. At first, it was just dull. I mean, I know it was trying to build up the characters and establish a good story line, but I was a tad bit uninterested, just because the characters were so plain at the time. Though it does set up things rather well, it lacks in any really high appeal from the moment it comes on the screen, if that makes sense.\n\nAnyway, on to the rest of the movie. Though there were times when I was very interested, it just overall was nothing special. The performances by each individual actor were extremely questionable. For instance, Channing Tatum was unable to display any real sense of emotion except for maybe two scenes in the entire movie, and Amanda Seyfried seemed like it was just too big of a role for her to play. While they both didn&apos;t do so hot separately, I have to say the chemistry between them when they were on set together was believable, intense and undeniably noteworthy; Certainly the best thing about the movie, in my opinion.\n\nI do give Dear John a decent and satisfactory rating for it really strived to be a poignant and strong film, even though it fell a little short, and I was moved at times by the feelings Channing and Amanda expressed into their characters, though all together their performances were eh. It was interesting and entertaining, and I enjoyed it... lightly. With all that said, it again falls short of being rewatchable with it&apos;s extreme dullness throughout and lack of powerful, independent, likable performances. Not anything special, but certainly not anything bad, and I recommend you don&apos;t watch it with high expectations, because you&apos;ll be very disappointed, but if you&apos;re not an extreme critic and you&apos;re just looking to blow some time, or are extremely hard up for Channing Tatum shirtless, you can and will enjoy this in some way.",

In this day of hardcore, it is hard to imagine that this was the &quot;hardcore&quot; of its day. Beautiful cinematography, beautiful locales and sun-drenched bodies offer a sleepy, idyllic look at an alternate reality. It should be remembered that in those times the idea of the naked form and sin WERE synonymous, therefore, Davee Decker would have been regarded as a lowlife to many for being photographed in the nude. To my mind that makes her a bit of a hero! What makes it more interesting to me is the fact that she looked like the typical young housewife of that era, the lady next door that you would have borrowed a cup of sugar from. A fun little cult film, not to be taken too seriously, I&apos;m really curious to find out if she is still alive and what made her do nudie movies when it was taboo at that time.",

Yes, that&apos;s pretty much all there is as far as &quot;plot&quot; goes but this is still a fairly interesting and entertaining film from this period. The most interesting thing here is the hand tinted coloring, which actually adds quite a bit to the film. Not only does it give us a &quot;color&quot; movie but the quality of the coloring is actually top-notch. This hand tinted coloring is something that Guy was using quite a bit of during this period and there&apos;s no question that the work is so much better than what American audiences were seeing in their country&apos;s color films."

      "reviewBody": "Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfolds (1995) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nDecent take-off on ATTACK OF THE 50FT WOMAN from cult director Fred Olen Ray. This time out centerfold Angel Grace (J.J. North) decides to take a special potion hoping that it will give her the edge over two other woman as they are trying to win Playmate of the Year. The potion certainly gives her a boost as it turns her into the title character. With a title like this and knowing that it&apos;s coming from Fred Olen Ray, one really shouldn&apos;t be expecting any sort of classic but if you&apos;re just wanting some cheap laughs and plenty of breasts then this here is just for you. I was really surprised to see that the movie&apos;s actually a lot better than one might expect. I thought there were some fun performances, the director keeps things moving fairly well and even the special effects are good. Again, we&apos;re not talking &quot;classic&quot; level here but for a &quot;B&quot; movie this isn&apos;t too bad. I thought North was extremely cute in the lead role and of course her willingness to get nude was a major plus. The supporting cast includes Russ Tamblyn, Tommy Kirk, Michelle Bauer as well as a cameo from Forrest J. Ackerman and SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE II favorite Peter Spellos. There&apos;s obviously not much of a &quot;story&quot; to talk about but instead of story there&apos;s just pretty much non-stop nudity with the three centerfolds constantly getting naked, which is the main reason for this movie to exist. It&apos;s worth noting that with a film like this you&apos;re wanting &quot;giant&quot; nudity and it is here. I was surprised at how well done the special effects were. They&apos;re not Oscar-worthy but they&apos;re certainly much better than what we see in ATTACK FOK THE 50FT WOMAN. At just 84-minutes the film goes by at a pretty good pace so fans of this type of stuff should at least be mildly entertained."

One scene in the movie has Zappa gathering cast and crew together to deliver some bad news: &quot;the movie&apos;s got a plot.&quot;  You&apos;d never be able to tell this from watching it.  Other than a conglomeration of truly weird sexual activities, that is.  If you go buy the album, you will find that nearly all of the film&apos;s dialogue is on the disc: it won&apos;t make any more sense, whether you hear the disc or watch the film. Promise."

      "reviewBody": "A LONG WEEKEND IN PEST AND BUDA is an uneven if occasionally striking movie. However, beyond that, it is a challenging exercise for some of us long term movie goers.\n\nMakk and his stars were the hot tickets on the film festival circuit in the Fifties - not that we got to see all that much of their work - HOUSE UNDER THE ROCKS, MERRY GO ROUND, Sunday ROMANCE. We occasionally glimpsed them subsequently or, more likely, heard about them.It however comes as a surprise to realise they are still active and have been working solidly over the half century during which we lost track.\n\nThis is what the viewing pivots on, whether intentionally or not. Black and white images from MERRY GO ROUND among other films of the early period are used to simulate Törõcsik and Darvas&apos; romance in the old Communist days. The plot outlines their characters&apos; subsequent lives, with him having moved to Switzerland, after being thrown into jail for the support he gave his first mentor, who he found running the state oil industry from the prison, because he was the only one capable of organizing such a capitalist enterprise.\n\nTurns out Mari shopped him to something called the AVO (no, not apprehended violence order)and hit the sack with the police agent on the case. Now she&apos;s in a terminal ward and wants to see him before she dies - and wait! There&apos;s more.\n\nWhether this is the intended effect, it plays remarkably well with the outside audience as the mix of recognition and fiction rings in their memories with an awareness of the country&apos;s history.\n\nThe city and surroundings of Budapest, which Darvas sees again, add resonance. On top of this, several other elements have been piled less successfully. The chaotic society he encounters, venal medical staff, trigger happy policemen, lawless graffiti covered streets and barmen who demand his watch when he presents a credit card, is not all than convincing and that the sub-plot with Nagy-Kálózy doesn&apos;t really play, is probably not the fault of the actress. Törõcsik on the other hand has developed immense presence as an actress. Her final face cream scene alone is a formidable piece of acting.\n\nMore than anything else, you leave this film wondering about the three figure total of films these people have run up without us having access to them."

      "reviewBody": "I have the 1975 paperback version of Lepke in my possession, and there are some scenes and characters in the book that never appeared in the movie.\n\nThe book opens with Lepke&apos;s body being brought out of Sing Sing on a sheet-covered stretcher.  After the prison guards put his body in a truck and take it away, the novel then goes to the beginning chapter of Lepke&apos;s life.\n\nIt is the summer of 1912 in Brooklyn.  We meet Lepke and all his associates as teenagers.  The book mentions that Lepke was born on February 12, 1897. Lepke&apos;s father died suddenly and his mother claims that Lepke &quot;was the death of him&quot;.\n\nAfter Lepke commits his first robbery at a shoestore, he&apos;s sentenced to his first prison term at Sing Sing.  He gets raped by a convict named Al, and gets beaten up by a convict mob for informing on him.\n\nIn 1922, Lepke gets released from prison and goes back to live in his family&apos;s old apartment.  His mother has moved away to Colorado, and we don&apos;t know where his sister is.\n\nLepke goes to work for a gangster named Augie Orgen.  After some disagreemnts with Augie, Lepke guns him down in front of a nightclub.  He&apos;s quick to also bump off the eyewitnesses to the killing.  He has his henchmen run down the club&apos;s doorman with their car, and has Augie&apos;s girlfriend and a real-life gangster named Legs Diamond killed with ice-pick stabbings.  In real life, Diamond was gunned down by members of a rival gang.\n\nLepke makes friends with Lucky Luciano and Albert Anastasia, but soon things go downhill between them.  They try to take over the garment industry, which is Lepke&apos;s territory, by exploding a bomb in a clothing warehouse.  For a short while they form a union, which is threatened by crusading prosecutor Thomas Dewey.  Dutch Schultz says they should kill Dewey before he gets enough evidence on him.  Lepke refuses Schultz permission to carry out the hit, and Schultz angrily storms out of the meeting, saying he will do it himself.  Apparently this is what led to the murder of Schultz and several of his henchmen at a restaurant in 1935.\n\nSoon Lepke moves up from garments and into the business of illegal gambling. He opens up a slot machine joint, but Anastasia wants control of it, so he has Gino, one of his hoods, plant a bomb in one of the slot machines.  A drunken man pulls the lever and the whole place goes kaboom.  This starts another war between the Jewish and Italian gangs.\n\nLepke retaliates by having his men gun Gino down.  In the movie, Gino was killed (or injured) by a bomb planted in his dish of spaghetti.  Then Lepke gets into the drugs business, which makes Dewey start a crusade to bring him to justice.  After Lepke is briefly detained and released by the FBI, he discovers that a shopkeeper named Joe Rosen squealed on him.  Lepke has him bumped off, which only intensifies Dewey&apos;s crusade.\n\nLepke goes on the run for several years, and he finally turns himself in after striking a deal between himself and J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nHe is eventually convicted on all counts, including murder, and is sentenced to the electric chair.\n\nLepke is a great movie with a great cast, especially Tony Curtis (in the title role) and Milton Berle (as Lepke&apos;s father-in-law).  Curtis and Berle both give excellent dramatic performances.\n\nRating:  ****"

And so, until he meets a wise and worldly cat, he flounders--unable to figure out how he got there or how to get back to the little girl he loves.\n\nThis is not the deepest story I have ever seen for a computer animated movie, but it was quite charming and fun--something that many other family movies could emulate. In fact, compared to previous Disney-produced CGI movies (other than those from the separate Pixar unit), BOLT is a significant improvement--both in story and in animation quality. If you don&apos;t believe this, just try watching CHICKEN LITTLE some time--it lacks the charm and universal appeal of BOLT. In other words, CHICKEN LITTLE was purely for very little kids--adults would mostly be bored by the film. MEET THE ROBINSONS was a bit of an improvement, but with BOLT I could finally enjoy the movie along with my kids.\n\nFun, well-animated and different. While not exactly a must-see, this is a very good film.",

I love movies, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking.\n\nThis is one of the few movies that I have seen on the small screen (originally seeing it air on AMC, I believe, and then on the DVD I just watched) that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. That little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.\n\nJack Lemmon&apos;s performance is a fine one, and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow. I felt so much empathy of Lemmon, who&apos;s character Jack Godell, only wanted people to listen to his warning.\n\nBut what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. Apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension, because none is needed. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence it drives the point home.\n\n I use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. But for The China Syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. The characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.\n\nI highly recommend this movie, it is one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won&apos;t be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you might not want to give this one a go.",

Jet Li has certainly done better films than this, but Hitman is worth a watch simply because it is quite different from all the rest."

      "reviewBody": "In 1942, in Warsaw, a Polish prostitute is murdered in a sadistic way. Major Grau (Omar Sharif), a man from German Intelligence that believes in justice, is in charge of the investigation. An eyewitness saw a German general leaving the building after a scream of the victim. A further investigation shows that three generals do not have any alibi for that night: General Tanz (Peter O&apos;Toole), Maj. Gen. Klus Kahlenberge (Donald Pleasance) and General von Seidlitz-Gabler (Charles Gray). They three avoid a direct contact with Major Grau and become potential suspects. As far as Major Grau gets close to them, he is promoted and sent to Paris.\n\nIn 1944, in Paris, this quartet is reunited and Major Grau continues his investigation. Meanwhile, a plan for killing Hitler is plotted by his high command; a romance between Ulrike von Seydlitz-Gabler (Joanna Pettet) and Lance Cpl. Kurt Hartmann (Tom Courtenay) is happening and Insp. Morand (Phillipe Noiret) is helping Major Grau in his investigation.\n\n The story ends in 1965, in Hamburg, with another similar crime.\n\nThe first time I watched this film, I was a teenager and I recall that I left the movie theater very impressed. Two days ago, a friend of mine saw this movie again and sent me an e-mail. I decided to watch it again, on VHS, since it has not been released on DVD in Brazil. This movie is really an excellent and very underrated European super production, having a spectacular international cast. Peter O&apos;Toole and Omar Sharif, from &apos;Lawrence of Arabia&apos;, have another outstanding performance working together, highlighting the role of Peter O&apos;Toole as a deranged man. It is amazing how Omar Sharif was a great actor in the 1960&apos;s. The story has war, mystery, crime, romance, drama and thriller, in right doses. Further, the character of Omar Sharif, as an ethic man who believes and pursues justice, no matter the price, is exciting. The reconstitution of the period is also fantastic, specially the scene of the madness of General Tanz in a block of Warsaw, when he burns and destroys many buildings. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;A Noite Dos Generais&apos; (&apos;The Night of the Generals&apos;)\n\nNote: On 23 Aug 2020, I saw this film again.",

      "reviewBody": "I just watched this last night.  I watched it back-to-back with &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot; and while it pales in comparison to that classic, I must say that I really dug it.  It&apos;s a pretty standard b-movie (what was I expecting?), but there are some things that help elevate it a bit.  For one thing, Rod Steiger is in it.  The guy plays a complete prick in almost everyting I see him in, and this is certainly no exception.  I didn&apos;t necessarily find him scary, but he was annoying and obnoxious as hell. Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to reach through the screen and knock that horrible grimace off his face.  However, he was almost moving towards the end and I took his role to be a parody of man&apos;s interpretation of religion.  Not that this is a deep or serious film by any means, but that part did strike a chord with me.  \n\nThe story starts with a group of six, (one of which is a former mental patient) heading off on a camping trip.  When they are forced to land their plane on a small island, one stays behind, while the others decide to look for signs of life.  They soon find an old house.  Thinking that the place is deserted, the group walks in and makes themselves at home.  About ten-minutes later, Ma and Pa come home to find the youngsters dancing and playing.  At first, Ma and Pa seem like the old fashioned, hospitable couple, but trouble starts when one of the girls doesn&apos;t finish her plate and Pa nearly has a stroke when another girl lights a cigarrete.   Despite these atrocities,  Ma and Pa are still hospitable enough to let them stay the night.  Pa says he has a friend coming with a boat who may be able to help them.  Another ruckus arises when the group heads off to bed.  Pa makes it clear that if they are not &quot;hitched&quot;, the boys are to sleep with the boys and the girls with the girls.  This is turning out to be a fun trip, indeed.\n\nPretty soon, the girls meet Fanny.  Fanny is Ma and Pa&apos;s daughter who is anticipating her 12th birthday.  But that&apos;s kinda strange considering that Fanny looks to be around 50.  We are then introduced to Fanny&apos;s brother Woody (played to perfection by Michael J. Pollard) and Teddy (some annoying fat guy).  They aren&apos;t much younger than Fanny but are on the same maturity level.  It&apos;s all down-hill from here folks.  Pretty soon, kids start getting picked off (in true slasher fashion) one by one and it becomes clear that Pa&apos;s friend is not coming because Pa has no friends.  Some of the deaths are pretty inventive (the swingset death is a riot) but it becomes pretty tiresome.  This all goes on until there is only one left.  Who? You guessed it.  The mental patient.  She may just be a little too smart for Ma and Pa to handle.   \n\nAll in all, this is a bad movie with an awful reputation.  The performances are way over-the-top (thanks to Steiger) and the film has this really grainy look to it.  However, there is a dark atmosphere that gives the whole thing this creepy feeling.  At times, it is even a little scary.  Fanny gave me the creeps.  The best performance of the bunch was Michael J. Pollard.  He had very little to work with, but the few speaking lines he has (when he&apos;s not running around, laughing like a maniac) are well done and wholly believable.  \n\nOn my scale of a 1-10, I give it a 7.  It is a pretty original treatment of a tried and true formula and although it does draw from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  it really worked for me.  If you enjoy this movie,  you&apos;re likely to enjoy Rob Zombie&apos;s &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;  due out pretty soon, now. Michael J. Pollard plays a similar character, from what I hear."

Aniston is still another version of Rachael Green just more bored and depressed here. She does put on a great southern accent though, and outdoes herself in the wardrobe department, donning ugly sweaters and unflattering mom jeans throughout.\n\nThe movie is plugged as a comedy but honestly its fairly depressing, just kinda miserable and cheerless throughout following &apos;Justine&apos; a frustrated 30 year old wife and grocery store cashier who is bored, depressed, stuck in a dead end job and married to a stoner (John C. Reilly). Her life changes when she begins an affair with a co-worker, (Jake Gyllenhaal). The story didn&apos;t at all go where I was expecting it to, entering some very dark areas.\n\nGyllenhaal does a great job here, he is young, intense and crazy. I also enjoyed John C. Reilly, as the husband, he&apos;s always the &quot;nice guy&quot; and is here too. Zooey Deschanel&apos;s character was very funny and probably the only ray of light in this. Lots of decent acting from sub characters though including John Carroll Lynch as the manager of the Retail Rodeo grocery store -which is where much of this movie takes place, the boredom and mundaneness was well represented there.\n\nA bit of a surprise hit for me. 7/5/15",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Der Rat der Götter&quot; (&quot;Council of the Gods&quot;) is based, at least in part, on the book &quot;I.G. Farben&quot; by American author, Richard Sasuly--who based it on testimony during the Nuremberg trials. However, considering that the film was a joint Soviet and East German effort, I wonder how closely the film sticks to the facts--especially since the focus of the film is often on the evils of corporations and the goodness of labor unions and the communist party in Germany. Obviously the West Germans and Americans weren&apos;t interested in making such a film, as the Cold War was in full swing. And, obviously the Soviets and East Germans wanted to make the capitalist systems look bad. So what is the real truth here? I have no idea--but it does make for a compelling film--whether or not it&apos;s accurate or if the facts have been twisted to make the anti-capitalist point. One example of such manipulation was as showing actual footage of a chance explosion at the BASF plant and saying it was of the Farben plant--which did not explode. The next ten minutes was a diatribe against capitalism--and a relatively shallow one at that. Also, the film saying the company in question was pro-Hitler was unfair because they actually contributed to MANY political groups--not just the Nazis. Still, considering the East Germans based this on finding of American investigators makes me think the basic plot is accurate.\n\nI noticed that one reviewer felt the film was dull. I didn&apos;t find it that dull but could understand their sentiments. It&apos;s a film that is rather talky much of the time and most of the action consists of just a few pieces of stock footage from WWII scattered here and there. However, I found the movie fascinating because anti-Western propaganda films are rarely seen in the US and it was a rare glimpse into the Soviet Bloc world. Plus, the film did have a compelling message about internationalists and corporations profiting from and loving war. Sure, it twisted a few facts here and there--but it did heighten the suspense and added to the impact. And it did get its message across well.\n\nBy the way, there is a short documentary in which the film maker talks about the film. He stands by the accuracy of the film overall but admits some &apos;artistic license&apos; was used as well.",

The script is full of nice ideas, and is well-written. I especially like the reason for closing down the school; on a sign it says: &quot;School closed cause of laziness&quot;. There are some nice visual ideas too, like the royal bed that in jiffy can be turned into the throne. Good direction and pacing (better directed than the average children&apos;s film; direction by Otto Meyer: who he?). The very appropriate sugar sweet Agfa-colors, delightful sets, fine music by (again) Norbert Schultze including a nice song about living in Schlaraffenland, and children and grown-up cast showing they enjoyed doing this one, add to the joy.\n\nBy the way,  you might get hungry watching this one, so you better have some snacks at hand.",

The acting, film and effects are good and are on par with any well made modern flick. On a 1-10, I&apos;d give it a 7 (I think more could have been done with the story or plot) but and 8 for subject matter and originality. The movie reminds me of the Guillermo del Toro movie Cronos. The ancient mechanical horror theme is very similar. The protangonists too are very flawed and the box brings their own demons to the surface. It doesn&apos;t scare me or really creep me out but it was entertaining and wasn&apos;t predictable.\n\nI&apos;ve seen tons of bad horror movies. I&apos;ll probably watch this movie aqain down the road at some point. I can&apos;t say that for many. I even purchased a copy of it.",

      "reviewBody": "On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles&apos; classic &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.\n\nReleased in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of &quot;Rosebud&quot;-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane&apos;s death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Welles&apos; film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; will always stand the test of time.\n\nHowever, the story of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; remains cold and distant. I didn&apos;t instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like &quot;Casablanca&quot; or &quot;The Third Man&quot; or even more recently, &quot;There Will Be Blood.&quot; Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane&apos;s second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane&apos;s snow covered childhood). There&apos;s a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would&apos;ve come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.\n\nIs it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today&apos;s cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It&apos;s some very nice ballyhoo indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "Critics generally compare &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; unfavorably to &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot;   As usual, the critics are wrong.\n\n&quot;Navarone&quot; has many virtues, but too much talk and high-mindedness slow down the story.   Anthonys Quayle and Quinn are wonderful, but Gregory Peck comes off as more of an Oxford don than a world-renowned mountaineer and David Niven, playing surely the oldest corporal in the British forces,.proves an insufferable bore.  &quot;Eagles&quot;, on the other hand, dispenses with the moralizing claptrap and serves up non-stop action.  Although it&apos;s running time is approximately the same as &quot;Navarone&apos;s&quot;, it never seems as long and you never feel the characters are trying to make a point, except with their machine pistols.  \n\nOf course &quot;Eagles&quot; greatest strong points are Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.  By 1968 Burton had eschewed the serious parts for the big money and the critics crucified him for selling out.  Well, in this case I&apos;m glad he did since he&apos;s superb as team leader Major Smith.  Burton projects an aura of invincible self-confidence.  He&apos;s rather reserved much of the time, but you never doubt his engagement.  This is a man who simply won&apos;t be defeated.  Peck&apos;s stuffy, diffident performance in &quot;Navarone&quot; pales by comparison.  And Eastwood, though hardly Burton&apos;s equal as an actor, is Dirty Harry in boot camp - his Schaffer will kill you sooner than look at you, and it doesn&apos;t hurt that he looks great too.\n\n&quot;Eagles&quot; also has a better villain than anyone in &quot;Navarone&quot;, superior scenery, and a far superior score.   Ron Goodwin&apos;s theme has been etched in my mind for over 30 years, but I can&apos;t remember a note from &quot;Navarone&apos;s.&quot;\n\nPerhaps the greatest World War Two adventure film of all time.  Less realistic than a James Bond movie, but outstanding escapist entertainment."

      "reviewBody": "Things I love about this film:\n\n\n* Louise Brooks gives an extraordinary performance, as unaffected and natural as any I&apos;ve ever seen. She&apos;s seductive, but has such a buoyant simplicity about her, and it&apos;s not the simplicity or innocence of a girl as in other screen stars who channel this as part of their allure, she&apos;s more like an elemental force of nature.\n\n\n\n* The scene in act three when she&apos;s backstage with the newspaper publisher (Fritz Kortner) who has decided to end their affair and marry someone else is one example of this. She&apos;s refused to go onstage for them, and while arguing, turns her back to him and eventually lies down, the metallic strap of her outfit making a large thin Y on her otherwise bare back. We can just feel his desire to kiss the back of her neck, and after some tussling around, soon he is kissing her. It&apos;s at this moment that his son (Francis Lederer) and fiancée (Daisy D&apos;Ora) walk in, and the look that Brooks gives them is just mind-blowing. I cannot imagine better acting; she&apos;s defiant and yet bemused, passionate and yet detached.\n\n\n\n* Another great example is in act four, when the son tells her he can&apos;t live without her. Her eyes are captured so perfectly by Pabst, who adds a sparkle in their reflection which is almost demonic, and yet she has such tenderness as puts his head in her lap.\n\n\n\n* On the surface it may seem to be a morality tale, but it&apos;s not with the way Pabst directed it, and this includes the wise casting of Brooks over Marlene Dietrich (who was apparently literally in Pabst&apos;s office when Brooks finally agreed to take the part). Lulu, Brooks&apos;s character, is never judged for pursuing pleasure. During her trial it&apos;s the prosecutor who likens her to Pandora, but the comparison is hollow, and we don&apos;t really believe it. The sexuality of the character is so natural it&apos;s presented as a sort of purity, which is a very rare thing in films of the period (or any period).\n\n\n\n* By contrast, it&apos;s the male characters who are portrayed as evil, and it&apos;s because their pleasures are all tainted by exploitation, greed, or violence. There&apos;s the hypocrisy of Kortner&apos;s character who carries on with Brooks but tells his son, she&apos;s not the kind of girl one marries, and then later asks her to kill herself. Her first &apos;patron&apos;, an old man (Carl Goetz) who likely took advantage of her when she was a child, and who has no moral qualms about her prostituting herself late in the movie. The son, who starts off pure (so much so that Brooks comments &quot;Alwa is my best friend, the only one who never wants anything from me. Or do you want nothing from me because you don&apos;t love me?&quot;), but who we later see addicted to gambling, despondent, and not defending her. The trapeze artist (Krafft-Raschig) who blackmails her, and in one scene leans over her ominously with a giant alligator appearing over his head, mounted to the wall in the background. Another acquaintance who tries to sell her to a creepy Egyptian brothel owner, claiming that he&apos;s &quot;looking out for her&quot; because the authorities won&apos;t think of searching for her in Cairo. And then of course the final man she encounters, who initially is so stunned and touched by her kindness that he shows her real tenderness, though ultimately he can&apos;t control himself. It&apos;s all pretty damning, and more an indictment of the male of the species.\n\n\n\n* Pabst has lots of great moments too, getting the most out of this story and telling it in a pretty creative way. The scene of the Kortner confronting Brooks on their wedding day when he finds her old patrons and his son playing around with her has the camera drifting ever so slightly in and out of focus, just as we can imagine him reeling from all of his emotions. The accidental shooting, with that beautiful work of art we see first on the left at a dramatic angle, and then in the background. And lastly, the handling of Brooks in that scene at the end, starting with her flashing that radiant smile with a sparkle in her eyes on the way up to her room, then later gazing at the candle with her chin on her hand and looking upward, and finally a remarkable restrained murder scene with just her hand falling away. It&apos;s brilliant, and Pabst continuing on with this to see the celebration of Christmas and people singing &apos;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&apos; really adds contrast and heightens pathos. The feeling conveyed is not one of well, she deserved it for her wantonness, it&apos;s sadness that such a pure creature has been so abused and snuffed out.\n\n\n\n* The openness of the lesbian character (Alice Roberts) is refreshing, and in keeping with the lack of moral judgment present in the film. As an aside, from reading &apos;Lulu in Hollywood&apos;, my understanding is that Roberts refused to look at Brooks with the requisite lust, and Pabst had to shoot her looking at him and then cut that in. Regardless, Roberts and Pabst were breaking new ground here.\n\n\n\n* Lastly, aside from the great acting, Brooks is simply iconic in this film. Her short bob and bangs look had considerable influence at the time, and according to TCM&apos;s Ben Mankiewicz, was also studied and leveraged by Liza Minelli for Cabaret (1972). She&apos;s also very stylish in her wedding dress, at the trial in widow&apos;s garb, as well as when her hair is not in bangs to disguise herself while on the run.\n\n\nGreat actress, great film.",

Madhavan&apos;s performance was excellent and totally a different role. All the actors did a wonderful job. Zombies are really too scary. From the beginning to end it was very thrilling and exciting. Once again animation was fantastic I really had a great terrifying scary experience.Thanks for a good Zombies movie. Night of the living dead darkest dawn (2015).",

      "reviewBody": "Also known as Man With A Million, The Million Pound Note is based on a short story by Mark Twain called &quot;The Million Pound Bank Note&quot;. It&apos;s directed by Ronald Neame {The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie/The Poseidon Adventure } and stars Gregory Peck {To Kill A Mockingbird/Cape Fear}, Ronald Squire, Joyce Grenfell, Jane Griffiths &amp; Reginald Beckwith .\n\nIt&apos;s Edwardian England and American seaman Henry Adams ( Peck) is stranded and down on his luck. That is until he becomes embroiled in an unusual wager between two wealthy, eccentric brothers, Oliver (Ronald Squire) and Roderick Montpelier (Wilfrid Hyde-White). Giving him an envelope, they tell him that it contains some money but that he must not open it till 14.00. Thinking they are crack pots he goes along with it anyway, and much to his amazement the envelope contains a one million pound note (£1,000,000). It transpires that Oliver believes that the mere existence of the note will enable Adams to obtain whatever he needs without spending a penny, while Roderick contends that it would actually have to be spent for it to be of any use. Hence the bet is on and a promise of a job for Henry if he can go for a month without breaking into the note.\n\nChirpy yet astutely cynical is The Million Pound Note. The laughs come courtesy of the ridiculous way that people react to money and those that have plenty of it. As Henry {a wonderfully cast Peck} moves from penniless bum to upstanding wealthy gentleman, without spending anything, the moral of the story is blatantly obvious. Very much a forerunner to the Eddie Murphy starrer Trading Places in 1983, it also has similarities with Twain&apos;s own The Prince And The Pauper, themes that always produce interesting results as regards the human condition. There&apos;s the obligatory romance angle in the piece, which thankfully doesn&apos;t cloy the picture at all, and Neame has an array of interesting characters from which to keep the story zippy {watch out for a delightful turn from Reginald Beckwith as Rock}. A real safe recommendation this one, across the board it works well, both as a comedy, and as a wry observation. 7/10",

Mrs. Parker overdresses Randy for the cold weather. The Old Man yells &apos;It&apos;s a clinker!&apos; fights the furnace, and gets a leg lamp. And, of course, Flick gets his tongue stuck to something.\n\nYou may think I&apos;m talking about A Christmas Story, but sadly this is also the description for the completely unnecessary sequel, A Christmas Story 2. Clearly, there is no attempt made here to capture the magic of the original, only a blatant attempt to cash in on its success by recycling all its funny moments and adding tired family movie formulas. At one point, Ralphie blurts out what I&apos;m sure the entire audience is already thinking, &quot;Oh no! Not again!&quot; It could easily have been the tag line for the movie posters.\n\nDespite all this, A Christmas Story 2 is certainly not as bad as it could have been, considering the current family movie genre&apos;s obsession with vomit and flatulence. If you&apos;re just feeling a bit nostalgic for A Christmas Story, A Summer Story and Ollie Hopnoodle&apos;s Haven of Bliss are far better sequels with fresh material, though they, too, pale in comparison to the original classic.",

Benigni stars as a loser who works for a mannequin company who unwittingly becomes caught up with the authorities who believe that he is the titled character, a man who has been raping and murdering women all over the city. Naturally, Benigni is not the guy they are after but all the strange coincidences make him appear to be the criminal. Undercover beauty Nicoletta Braschi (Benigni&apos;s real-life wife) tries to trap Benigni by enticing him in the most creative ways. The film is great fun, but it is very adult-oriented with sexual situations and innuendos galore. Overall &quot;The Monster&quot; is a really great film and Benigni fans will love it more than most others. Plot resolution late hurts the film, but not enough to keep it from being very successful overall. 4 stars out of 5."

Julien Guiomar does the perfect portrait of the enemy of mister Duchemin. and the hilarious situations are the ideal package for the illustration of conflict between tradition and new technology. a film about food and about joy of life. memorable scenes and great challenges to food industry from our days. that detail does it great. and, sure, the talent of a great actor who creates not exactly characters but universes."

      "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you&apos;re not able to take a John Woo&apos;s best adrenaline HK classic action sequel flick , ignore this review, as well. We&apos;ll both be better off.\n\nA Better Tomorrow II (1987) is an adrenaline action sequel flick the best one of the two from John Woo. I know that the first one is an action classic for many of the people and they always going for the first one, but my favorite flick is this sequel. I know that The Godfather (1972) is my favorite film in the series but from John Woo&apos;s A Better Tomorrow is actually A Better Tomorrow II my favorite John Woo film. I love this movie to death, the acting is wonderful, believable and very realistic and Chow Yun-Fat which is my favorite actor gives one of his best convincing performances I have ever seen as Mark Gor&apos;s twin brother Ken. Not only he but everyone of the cast gives a wonderful performances on a screen which I love it.\n\nPlot: Restaurant owner Ken Gor, twin brother of Mark Gor, teams up with police detective Kit and his struggling ex-con brother Ho to avenge his old friend&apos;s daughter&apos;s death by a Triad gang.\n\nWhat I love about this movie is: Chow Yun-Fat does not die in this movie he acted wonderful his different character Ken. Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung are back as the brothers from the first film which I am not sure but I have saw a lot of actors from The Killer in this movie. This movie was also filmed in New York which you can see Twin Towers from the distance before it was destroyed in 9/11 terrorist attack. John Woo made one of his best action debut and making a perfect shots with the camera of this film. I admitted I am not a the biggest fan of the first and the third movie but this one surprised me which I loved it. In my opinion this film is better than the original. Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung&apos;s characters Ho and Kit are actually more well written than they were in the first. I hated it how Kit was treating his older brother beating him in the rain, treating him like a peace of garbage I hated that. In this film we see Kit&apos;s love and compassion toward his older brother Lung. Both of their characters were well written.\n\nThis film is about a counterfeit dollars that are produced in the business and a new boss from Ho took over Lung Sei&apos;s business while framing Lung for a triad gang member&apos;s boss murder which he did not committed in which Lung had to flee to America New York, but his daughter was killed. The plot is about a revenge: Lung Sei (Dean Shek), Ho (Ti Lung) and Ken (Chow Yun-fat) are taking revenge against new triad boss Ko Ying-pui (Kwan Shan) and his group of army killers. Lung Sei want&apos;s revenge for the murder of his daughter Peggy (Regina Kent), Ho want&apos;s revenge for Kit&apos;s (Leslie Cheung) murder and Ken want&apos;s revenge for his restaurant in New York that has been destroyed. That is the film about. It has a lot of action and kick ass scenes and it also has a human emotional portrayal from the actors.\n\nI love the action sequences in New York from Ken (Chow Yun-Fat) in the hotel a group of assassins comes to kill Ken and Lung Sei (Dean Shek) Which Ken (Chow Yun-Fat) uses shotgun Franchi SPAS-12 and kills several mafia gangsters in the hotel New York. He fires several rounds with two Berettas 92F on a gangsters than flees while he fires another round with another gun on an assassins car. The final showdown and the last stand off with two Berettas between Ken (Chow Yun-Fat) and Chong (Lung Ming-yan) the firing scene was outstanding performed I have ever seen. John Woo tried that scene in Hard Boiled but he didn&apos;t want to copied his own work so he change it. Ti Lung uses a samurai sword and he kills bunch of gangsters. The trio of friends uses a lot of guns and grandees while killing a bunch of gangsters. The final showdown for me was spectacular.\n\nOverall: This flick get&apos;s a perfect 10 by me. Chow Yun-Fat and Leslie Cheung&apos;s screen time was beautiful shot, well written and acted perfectly. Theme score from the first movie was also beautiful, the action scenes where incredible. They don&apos;t make action movies like this one today. This flick is far way better than John Woo&apos;s Once A Thief. With Hard Target, Broken Arrow, Hard Boiled, Paycheck and The Killer would be a Better Tomorrow II my sixth John Woo favorite film that I love to death.\n\nA Better Tomorrow 2 is a 1987 Hong Kong action film written and directed by John Woo. A follow-up to its popular predecessor, A Better Tomorrow, the film stars returning cast members Chow Yun-fat, Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung alongside new cast member Dean Shek. The film was released in Hong Kong on 17 December 1987.\n\n10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Cinema City Film Workshop Distributed by Golden Princess Film Production Starring: Dean Shek, Chow Yun-fat, Ti Lung, Leslie Cheung, Emily Chu, Kwan Shan, Kenneth Tsang, Shing Fui-On, Lam Chung, Ng Man-tat, Peter Wang, Lung Ming-yan, Louis Roth, Regina Kent Director: John Woo Producer: Tsui Hark Screenplay: John Woo, Tsui Hark Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 45 Mins.

Milla Jovovich escapes and she&apos;s helped by an action woman (Sienna Guillory) and a soldier (Oded Feher) and a journalist(Sandrine Holt). They have to confront several Zombies starving of meat and a nasty and evil Corporation chief.\n\nThe film begins as ¨Omega man¨ movie , as a city without people , totally uninhabited . After that , Milla Jovovich will find a motley group at a church where she&apos;ll fight against weird creatures and later with Zombies that a mutant virus has transformed into flesh eating . It&apos;s a good horror film , made in fast moving and is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining . From the beginning until the end the action pace is nonstop . In the picture there are action, terror, suspense , creepy atmosphere and a little bit of gore . The motion picture takes parts of ¨Alien¨ and ¨Dawn of the dead¨ and of course : ¨Resident Evil I¨ . Special effects ,FX , are first rate, they have been made by make-up and computer generator.\n\nThe film is based on a popular video game and obtained a lot of success such as the first part . The yarn will appeal to terror, gore and video games fans. Rating : 6,5/10 . Above average .",

      "name": "Very disappointing",
      "reviewBody": "I should first admit that I saw this film about a week after watching the &quot;Ice Worlds&quot; episode of the BBC&apos;s Planet Earth series, and perhaps that set the bar a fair measure higher than usual and contributed to my negative response to &quot;The White Planet&quot;.\n\nBut never before have I experienced such disappointment with a nature documentary, and never before have I been able to pinpoint precisely what I didn&apos;t like about a film (of any genre).\n\nFirstly: the actual photography. The film&apos;s promotional material implores you to see this film on &quot;as big a screen as possible&quot;. If the footage was of the quality deserving cinematic projection, then I would agree. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not. From what I can gather, the film is a patchy collage of the work of &quot;the world&apos;s greatest polar nature filmmakers&quot; - and it shows. Some parts were better than others, but on the whole, the images were grainy, soft, and certainly not as impressive as one would expect from a genre which is fundamentally based on its photography.\n\nSecondly: the editing. No attempt was made to edit narrative sequences together. It&apos;s as if they&apos;ve just picked a whole bunch of shots, and crudely slapped them together with no sense of constructive order. The film jumps from animal to animal (without actually identifying what each is, but that&apos;s a narration gripe), without providing any context for the behaviour we are witnessing on screen and therefore rendering most shots fairly meaningless. Oh yes, there&apos;s an angry looking polar bear running across the ice - but what is it running from? Or running to? Why is it running at all? Never mind, here are some of those fluorescent jellyfish and other deep sea creatures.\n\nThirdly: the narration. To be fair, it was not so much a problem with the voice or presentation style of the narrator, as with the sporadic, shallow and sometimes pretentious script. The constant reference to polar bears as &quot;Lords of the Ice Planet&quot;, Beluga whales as &quot;Sea Canaries of the White Planet&quot; (and their &apos;mysterious concert song still that still holds many secrets and mystery&apos;)... it all grew a bit tiresome. I also thought that one of the basic purposes of the narration in a film on the weird and wonderful creatures of the far corners of the globe would be to tell you what they are. Polar bears and seals are pretty obvious, but very little information was provided on exactly what other animals we were seeing on screen, or even exactly where we were seeing them (Canada? Alaska? Where???).\n\nFinally: the sound track. It was god awful. Fair enough if they didn&apos;t have the money to invest in scoring a symphony orchestra to compliment the vision, but silence would have been better than the mismatched yodelling/chanting/drum beating/interpretive dance type tracks which in no way tied in with the vision on screen. It sounded like they picked a world music compilation CD out of the discount bin and randomly placed tracks along the timeline with complete disregard for the images they were accompanying. Also, I am convinced that they recorded the sound of a child licking a lollipop to use for any scene where a newborn animal (caribou, polar bear, anything) was being licked by its mother.\n\n...maybe all a little harsh, and I really don&apos;t like to be so critical, but I have never been so sure of the reasons for my dislike of a film.",

He finds a box with something in it and hides it quickly. He is noticed, and the greedy islanders quickly come to think it holds gold. They try to get the location out of him.\n\nJean Epstein&apos;s movie is a silent movie, shot wild (without sound) on the Île d&apos;Hoedic, with the islanders playing the roles. Their dialogue, music and a few sound effects were added in production. It&apos;s supposed to be based on a local legend, and the sea and shore and menhirs and buildings become characters in their own right. It is clearly a documentary, but not of the modern kind. It&apos;s clearly based on the work of Robert Flaherty, who went to exotic locations and built stories around the people he found there.\n\nWhether the source was Epstein or Flaherty or both -- they were revered film makers in their day -- the influence split in two. Directors like Michael Powell would take their cameras to exotic locations and build stories in works like THE EDGE OF THE WORLD and I KNOW WHERE I&apos;M GOING. Others, like Robert Bresson, also influenced by the Russian Academicians&apos; &quot;Theory of Types&quot; would abandon trained actors, and use local individuals, sometimes even animals such as donkeys, in their movies.",

      "reviewBody": "A team of international scientists and engineers attempts to build a tunnel under the ocean.\n\nThe story was written by the amazing Curt Siodmak, based on the 1913 novel &quot;Der Tunnel&quot; by Bernhard Kellermann. Interestingly, &quot;Der Tunnel&quot; had already been filmed three times before, once as a German silent, &quot;Der Tunnel&quot; (1915), and then as two sound films &quot;Der Tunnel&quot; (German) and &quot;Le Tunnel&quot; (French), both released in 1933, and both directed by Curtis Bernhardt. The British version today remains the only one easily available.\n\nSuggestions for such a structure actually go back to Michel Verne, son of Jules Verne, who wrote about it in 1888 in a story entitled &quot;Un Express de l&apos;avenir&quot; (An Express of the Future). This story was published in English in Strand Magazine in 1895. As recently as the 1960s, the idea was again proposed, but then using vacuum tubes rather than more traditional modes of transport.\n\nAs for the film, it is worth seeing, if for no other reason than to get a feel for British science fiction in the 1930s. This approach seems much different than the boomin science fiction of the 1950s.",

Hereafter is not quite among Eastwood&apos;s best, but I personally loved it and consider it one of the most underrated movies of 2010-2011. It is beautifully filmed and edited, and Eastwood once again shows what a great director he is. And also as a composer too, Eastwood writes the music here also and with the guitar and piano rhythms it is quite simple but very understated and effective, I found it more memorable than Changeling. The script is thoughtful as well and the characters are interesting enough. I have often heard and seen criticisms of Hereafter being too slow or the story being too ambiguous. I can understand, but I found the slow pace worked, this is a very quiet and reflective film, the pace conveyed this very well. The story is ambiguous, but complex, thought-provoking and moving also. Matt Damon is superb, as is Cecile De France. Bryce Dallas Howard also excels in one of her better performances. Overall, a great movie if not for all perhaps. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Not much about the Resistance, and not much about the films about the Resistance.\n\nIf you are going to talk about a director&apos;s style, don&apos;t just talk. Show us some examples. Instead, we learn the name of Melville&apos;s cat. (Not kidding.)\n\nWe learn something about his character. We learn about his relationship with the directors of the French New Wave. We learn what directors from Germany and Hong Kong think about his work. However, we don&apos;t see any of it.\n\nAny talking head film--including this one--will work well on the small screen. (In this case, this movie was made for TV.) Code Name Melville has a strong 7.6 IMDb rating. I didn&apos;t think that it was even close to that, and rated it 6.",

The two leads are OK, but the rest of the cast just hams it up in a most embarrasing way, the script is really lumpy, the editing perfectly awful, and the direction nowhere near as good as the directors previous efforts (which include Romeo and Juliet and The Taming of the Shrew). Some people may find it good on a so bad its good level. Others beware. My rating: 3 out of 10. (because the title song is excellent)"

      "reviewBody": "It was foolish of me to think that the Italian film industry wouldn&apos;t have a go at the old disaster genre, and here it its: the Italian version of Airport. Kind of.\n\nEvil businessmen are wishing to destroy the Concorde by sabotaging it and causing it to be decommissioned. Using evil henchmen Venantino Venantini and Ottavia Dell&apos;Aqua, they bring one aircraft down in the Antilles. It&apos;s a shame that air hostess Mimsy Farmer survived though, because she could blow the whole conspiracy wide open. It&apos;s kind of a mixed blessing that the henchmen get a hold of her, because although they already know about the conspiracy, they always start blackmailing the evil businessmen. Where&apos;s the loyalty these days in avational espionage?\n\nJournalist James Franciscus gets involved when his wife phones him from the Antilles and annoyingly doesn&apos;t tell him anything over the phone, which is rather selfish because by the time he flies there from New York she&apos;s dead and he&apos;s not got a clue what she&apos;s on about. Luckily he&apos;s got a guardian angel looking out for him, because Venantino and Ottavia reckon they&apos;d be better off minus a nosy journalist.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of scuba diving looking for sunken Concordes and amazingly Mimsy nearly escapes the ship she&apos;s being held on just as James was passing by. By the time this all happens you&apos;ll be wondering when the disaster element is going to arrive - it does eventually, involving another plane piloted by Van Johnson. The same device that took down the first concorde is on board this one, but only Mimsy Farmer and her amnesia can save everyone on board...\n\nWhen not murdering animals for a laugh, Ruggero Deodato can actually produce a good film, or at least an mildly entertaining one like this. There&apos;s a whole load of shenanigans going down between James trying to convince the authorities of the conspiracy and people trying to kill him, but those looking for Deodato gore will be let down, save for the bit where a diver is shot in the face and about ten gallons of blood pours out. Van Johnson does well as the stressed out pilot and you can&apos;t beat a bit of Joseph Cotton being evil, so that&apos;s not so bad either.\n\nWhat&apos;s good for a laugh are some of the effects - the emergency cars at the end of the film are clearly toys, and so are several shots of the concorde itself. I&apos;m no expert in disaster films but as a quick time waster it was okay. Dakar from Zombie Flesh Eaters gets his head run over by a boat.",

Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack (although he was more than 20 years older than her) were the dream-pair of the German Heimatfilm since this movie.She plays a girl from the black forest,who falls in love with a painter,and after some entanglement they find together at a national festival where everybody is happy,sings songs and wears historical black forest costumes. Today,Heimatfilme are just scorned. But it wasn&apos;t that bad at all...you have to accept your movie-past.Those movies were simple,but they spoke to the hearts of the people:the producers knew what the people wanted!

His efforts to find a willing bride results in ridicule, a car wreck, etc. He finally puts an ad in the paper, telling the circumstances, and asking for the applying bride to meet him at the church. At least a thousand women ranging from fat, small, young, old, beautiful, downright misshapen arrive at the church. Well, the same exact thing happens in this movie &quot;The Bachelor&quot; (though inflation has turned $7 Million into $100 million), only I gotta say the Keaton version is still the original and unsurpassed (and unsurpassable) masterpiece. I actually couldn&apos;t believe they named it &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, it&apos;s a very boring title."

The so-called professional critics who obviously miss that point do not deserve their cushy jobs. The action is unbelievable, non-stop, breathless, and requires a total suspension of disbelief. The critics that have a problem with that should remember one thing. This is a movie based on a cartoon that&apos;s sole purpose was to sell a set of toys to 5-12 year old boys. Nothing more. Expecting &quot;War and Peace&quot; from this source material shows a lack of insight and intelligence from most of the reviews that I have read. If you like action films, you will enjoy this one. If you want angst-ridden characters stopping every five minutes to discuss their feelings... pull the stick out and move along to a sappy low-budget romance; this isn&apos;t your kind of film.",

      "reviewBody": "If you like art-house sci-fi films, then this J.G. Ballard adaptation is definitely worth checking out. As a Ballard fan I started watching this with low expectations but found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe story is set in a dystopian future, in which human populations are dwindling fast because almost all babies become mutants and are thus either aborted or post-natally disposed of. It&apos;s Sci-Fi, but refreshingly devoid of techno-gadgetry. The plot&apos;s theme has a hint of Eraserhead (Ballard&apos;s story was published a year before David Lynch&apos;s film was released), whereas stylistically it resembles Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s Alphaville and Weekend, or perhaps Fassbinder&apos;s World on a Wire. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this film to the average fan of space opera.\n\nThe film was made on a low budget and the plot and style were kept simple. But in my opinion this only works to the film&apos;s advantage. Ballard&apos;s work deals a lot with the impact of visual culture, for fetishistic and ritualistic purposes rather than any commercial motive. Personally I associate this aspect with the raw look of a low-tech production, rather than with glamorous, Hollywood-style cinematography. That&apos;s why I find &quot;Aparelho Voador a Baixa Altitude&quot; truer to the Ballardian world than David Cronenberg&apos;s Crash.\n\nThe film makes good use of the strong source material. The director is very familiar with Ballard&apos;s work (she interviewed the writer 16 years prior to making this film) and she intuitively knows how to visualize his world. There&apos;s plenty of beautiful Ballardian architecture for instance.\n\nIt&apos;s a little strange at first to watch a Ballard adaptation in Portuguese, but this does not detract from the film. There are even one or two comedic moments. The acting is overall quite decent, if I&apos;m not mistaken the main actress won a Portuguese Golden Globe.",

I taught the song to my children and grandchildren, but until recent years there was no way to get a copy of the movie.\n\nI thought I wanted the Jeannette MacDonald version because of her beautiful voice, but it was back ordered and only this one was available--lucky for me. It seems to be everyone&apos;s favorite of the three.\n\nThe wedding scene is a masterpiece--understated and heartbreaking, but I&apos;m finally able to handle it. It&apos;s that very last scene that gets me every time. Best kind of tears, though: the kind you&apos;re &quot;smiling through&quot;.\n\nNorma Shearer, like Irene Dunne, is not only beautiful to look at but irresistibly likable.",

In a typical film, you might picture the presentation of the movie working in a number of ways, but in &quot;Paper Moon,&quot; it will forever seem like it could only have been done this way...on location, in black and white, and photographed like moving Andrew Wyeth shots of Americana.\n\nTatum O&apos; Neal is terrific and justifiably won an Oscar for her part, but Ryan is wonderful as well....funny in that exasperated manner that Bud Abbott is, and the quality goes right down to the smallest bit player in the cast. \n\nA perfect film would have great acting, great visuals and utilization of music, a superb story and lines that have you repeating them for years. Welcome to &quot;Paper Moon.&quot; I can&apos;t recommend this blend of comedy and drama enough. A modern classic.",

After about two years of keeping it under a table leg to stop the wobble, I finally watched it. Now, it wasn&apos;t the best movie I&apos;ve seen but it sure kept me entertained. Stereotypical, yes.. Lame, absolutely.. but it was so damn funny. The 80&apos;s style car chase, the way Jay Leno seemed to forget that he&apos;d been shot in the leg, the cheesey ending... brilliant! It was fun, it was action packed and it brought a tear to my eye.My favourite part would have to have been Tony and the guy from Karate Kid sitting in the kitchen getting sloshed. If you come across this gem in the video store or if it&apos;s coming on tele, don&apos;t pass up the opportunity to watch it. As long as your expectations aren&apos;t too high, you&apos;ll love Collision Course."

Wreather all living in a house trying to stay sober. The producer, Allentown&apos;s celebrity DJ Chris Line, wants nothing but to have them fall off the wagon.\n\nRobert Romanus, most known for his character of Damone in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, is the Den Father with 8 years sober. I loved him in this role! \n\nBobcat Goldthwait does the drunken narration. Evil Jared Hasselholf (Bloodhound Gang) is the Evil Pimp Santa. Rake Yohn &amp; Ryan Dunn of MTV&apos;s Jackass fame play the drug dealers bringing good tidings of coke, weed and speed. Newcomers, Charles Moffitt (Tweak) and Brian Walsh (Ryan) are convincing in their roles and add a special baked and fried flavor to the film.\n\nThe music is great. The laughs are plenty. The reality is there. A great film. I highly recommend it!",

I do. He has a unique world view and holds a special place in the world of &quot;fantastique&quot; cinema that is indisputable.\n\nStill, I find his films a little boring.\n\nCase in point THE LIVING DEAD GIRL springs from a simple and fascinating concept of a dead woman, who must drink blood to survive, returning to a château to be with an old friend.\n\nAs fascinating as the concept is, Rollin doesn&apos;t do a whole lot with it. He serves up plenty of atmosphere, imbues his material with a subtle eroticism and draws a superb performance from the beautiful Francoise Blanchard. What else do you want? you may ask. I&apos;m not sure. I wanted more to happen, I guess. I wanted Rollin to jettison the boring bits and replace them with his signature set pieces.\n\nIt&apos;s been described as &quot;savage&quot;, an adjective I wouldn&apos;t use myself. It&apos;s also been described as &quot;dreamy&quot;. For the most part that&apos;s true. My frustration is with the film&apos;s uneven tone. Why couldn&apos;t it remain &quot;dreamy&quot; right through? You do need patience and a little forgiveness to enjoy Rollin.\n\nI still wouldn&apos;t miss anything he&apos;s done. He&apos;s one of us.",

I realize there&apos;s a &quot;debate&quot; about it being improv. or not - but it doesn&apos;t matter.  There is more honesty in this film (racial and otherwise) than in many others with far higher budgets.  I was mesmerized thru the whole thing.  New York in the early 60&apos;s is a sight to behold, but it&apos;s only the perfect backdrop to this film.  It&apos;s the kind of art that you realize can only be done once.  And this was it. The scenes at the MET with the Henry Moore sculptures and others underscored this for me. The movie was made once. The &quot;score&quot; was perfection. There can be no sequel, thank God.  This is why film is considered an art form."

This R rated cut is wonderfully goofy and gory and it&apos;s a perfect example of something so bad that it&apos;s good. It can be a little much at times but it mostly works. It also stars a very young Paul Walker and a career best Denise Richard&apos;s which is kinda scary, lol. All in all it&apos;s a fun, goofy mess that just works.",

While it goes into detail on some of the feuds more than others it still remains informative. I found it became a bit boring in some parts but that&apos;s really only because they were talking about rappers which I didn&apos;t know about or aren&apos;t interested in. The documentary has plenty of unseen and rare footage concerning each Beef which is good and also interesting interviews with some of the rappers and people involved. \n\nIt does go a bit overboard on some feuds and I began to loose interest in them, even if they were concerning my favourite rappers, but it makes up for it with the more interesting parts and information on beefs that I hadn&apos;t heard of.\n\nI thought the best parts were those covering the beefs between Kool Moe Bee and Busy Bee, Boogie Down Productions and MC Shan and feuds concerning NWA because they were informative, interesting and didn&apos;t go on for too long. \n\nOverall it is a good documentary and even though there are some dull bits, Beef is still a must see for any Hip Hop fan"

But the movie in its original full unrated version contains two or three of the most erotic soft core lesbian scenes ever. The women are strong but very good looking (this was shot before any silicon stuff came to pollute nudity). The camera work is of course excellent (director Terence Young). The first memorable scene consists of a topless oil wrestling fight to decide who the next queen will be. There is also a long savage nude fight with the same competitors which ends with cute kissing. This probably the only mainstream movie to picture women wrestling with a strong erotic overtone.",

      "reviewBody": "Without a doubt, Meryl Streep delivers the Greatest Performance By An Actress EVER - period.\n\nThe performance is totally naked, where you can almost feel her sorrow come right out of the screen. For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this movie, you never once feel as though Streep is going over-the-top. That says alot for someone who spends just about half of the time in her scenes with a tear in her eye. Everything about her performance just seems so effortless and natural. This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly, or English with a very convincing Polish accent.\n\nThe fact that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are not completely lost in this movie says alot for their performances. Kline himself delivers a great performance of a man suffering from delusions and bi-polar syndrome. It is one of his greatest performances as well. Peter MacNicol plays the role of a character who pales in comparison to the other characters. MacNicol has the somewhat undesirable task of having to play the character who carries the least amount of baggage. He therefore might be overlooked, when viewing at the movie as a whole. However, MacNicol does a great job with the character, not trying to make more out of it than it is supposed to be. His role is very important to this movie.\n\nBut the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep just digs down deep here - delivering lines that just put a chill down your spine.",

The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense &quot;writing&quot;... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.

When I rented this movie initially I thought that it was going to be one of those low budget action films with awful special effects, terrible dialogue, terrible plot and gratuitous nudity (like the highlander movies).  I was dead wrong.\n\n Scanners III is a wonderfully cerebral film, chock full of allusions and references to American folklore, popular science fiction novels of the past century (i.e. 1984 and just about everything by Michael Chricton), Huey Lewis and The News song lyrics (I&apos;ve got a brand new drug) and the religion and philosophy of the Algonquin Indians.  What an analytical treat!!\n\nAs the iconography in this film suggests, American culture is dominated by the media, the pharmecutical companies, and cheap dares we do to impress girls on Saturday nights.  We are soulless zombies, only acting on impulses that have been passed down to us by our parents.  If we only used our heads (as Alex Monet does in this film (monet is an obvious reference to the french impressionistic artist...there are many more delicious reference-goodies in this gem!)), we could overcome the social and mental chains that are hindering us from developing as a society.\n\n The film is beckoning us to cast away homburg hats and black suits of the nineteen forties for more casual clothing, eschew hot concentual sex with busty mental-hospital nurses for passionate lovemaking with loved ones, to send christianity and all of western society to the junkyard and take up Tibetan Buddhism, the only religion that has the capability to give one enough strength to overcome one&apos;s weaknesses.  In no way is this film just another sequel to David Cronenberg&apos;s far inferior film Scanners.  This is a treatise on how to live life successfully.  I urge you to watch it immediately."

      "reviewBody": "Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Apr 2007 in Australia Summer 04 was the first of about 5 German films I will see in the 10 day festival in Melbourne. http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm\n\nMost festivals one film will be the standout. With 2 down and 3 or 4 to go I think this is the one.\n\nReally enjoyed all the main performances, namely Martina Gedeck as a late 30&apos;s, early 40&apos;s woman, the very handsome mid 30s Bill (Robert Seeliger) and the stunning looking Svea Lohde who plays a 12 year old girl in this movie but whose character in some ways is more mature, self assured and worldly. With the relaxed moral views of the parents in this movie and the early sexual maturity portrayed here and accepted by the parents especially the Dad it&apos;s hard to say whether she&apos;s Lolita-like or not. Development wise she looks the age of the character and yet her outlook is more like someone in their later teens. I consider myself very liberal but on age of consent issues this freedom could raise an eyebrow or two. I&apos;ve never really understood fully the concept of complete personal freedom. Of course here in Australia the age of consent is still 16. In Europe perhaps it&apos;s lower?\n\nBut very nice locations, interesting story, the gentle pace of summer, some sizzling sex scenes and the way the movie pans out in the finish. A very satisfying film that shows a clean pair of heels to most French films that are very good at this genre. Put it this way, Martina&apos;s character could have been played by Charlotte Rampling if this was a French movie and Charlotte was about 40 at the time. But this is to take nothing away from Martina&apos;s performance.\n\nI&apos;ll be looking for more work from these main actors. And I wonder how the other Australian reviewer managed to review this movie back in 2006. Especially how or where he got to see the movie or obtain the DVD. Perhaps the Melbourne 2006 Film Festival. Must keep my eye out for any German entries in this in the Jul 2007 one.",

Pierce (who made The Ledgend of Boggy Creek in 1972), this film being his best!\n\nIt&apos;s 1946, in the small town of Texarkana, Texas-Arkansas a hooded murderer is terrorizing the community and making the local law enforcement desperate.\n\nBased upon the real events that surrounded one of America&apos;s most baffling serial killers, this solidly made film is a compelling and generally under exposed fore-runner of the slasher genre. Director Pierce gives this film a nicely authentic feel of the era as well as a great atmosphere of dread. The movies strongest scenes are the re-enactments of the murders, which are effectively heart-pounding! Among the memorable moments is a creepy &apos;murder-by-trombone&apos; and an intense stalking sequence with a bloodied Dawn Wells. Along with these thrilling bits comes some mild comic relief with the local police that thankfully don&apos;t hamper the proceedings. The moody music score is also a good touch. \n\nThe cast does well, veteran actor Ben Johnson is good as a criminal specialist, as is Andrew Prine as a local deputy. Director Pierce himself appears as a bumbling police officer.\n\nAn entertaining thriller from its shocking opening to its haunting conclusion, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a B movie winner.\n\n*** 1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "4 Oscars on his shelf and a great legacy as comedian and filmmaker that goes for more than five decades Woody Allen doesn&apos;t need to prove his geniality to anyone. Talented director, actor, writer and very creative, and at times surrounded by some controversial but still a genius. Barbara Kopple&apos;s documentary &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot; brings us a little more closer to the man who has a very enthusiastic passion for jazz, playing the clarinet with his jazz band, reason why he never attended the Academy Awards (he only went in 2002 to make a tribute to New York) or any other awards show.\n\nFollowing Woody along with Soon-Yi, we have the pleasure to watch the director of classics like &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot; on a tour in Europe doing what he likes the most, playing music, showing his skills with the clarinet (and he&apos;s a good player by the way) entertaining audiences with the old New Orleans jazz (and boy, he got some really big crowds to his shows, treated like a rock star).\n\nMore than just the tour, this is an intimate portrait of Woody Allen, his life and his work, his views on music and films, his relation with Soon-Yi, and even a family breakfast with Woody&apos;s parents. There&apos;s plenty of space and time to enjoy his hobby and watch the man making jokes all the time, at times a little depressed or a little bit cranky but never being snob or arrogant as some of his written interviews tend to sound. Some shocking revelations such as the fact of Soon-Yi watched all of Woody&apos;s films except &quot;Annie Hall&quot;; or when Woody discussed about getting a Life Achievement Award by the DGA when Fellini never got one, he (and us) can&apos;t understand that.\n\nGreater than all that is his jokes whatever the occasion, talking about the people he sees on the way (&quot;They won&apos;t pay ten cents to see one of my movies, but passing in a gondola, they love it.&quot;) or talking to Soon-Yi about the concierge of the luxury hotel they stayed in. It&apos;s delightful to see when he talks about the films that failed at box-office in America but are a huge hit all over Europe (&quot;Interiors&quot;, &quot;Another Woman&quot;, and others). And if you pay attention to his opinions you&apos;ll see that most of them will be referred in his future films e.g. When he says about suffering of chronic dissatisfaction. He quoted that in &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcleona&quot;. Or the way he richly describes Paris, place where he would make the film that gave his 4th Oscar this year, &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;. It&apos;s all there!\n\nEntertainment and reality at its best, &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot; allows us to know a little better about the creator of cinematic masterpieces, presenting the man in a different way than we&apos;re used to see (ok, he&apos;s less neurotic than the characters he play). Have fun! 10/10.",

Fortunately, I was wrong...it was MUCH better than I&apos;d expected.\n\nLike the second film, this one begins with some flashback scenes. It also, like the second one, shows that the ending you THOUGHT you saw isn&apos;t exactly what happened...and somehow Reggie survived in order to keep fighting The Tall Man. However, Mike IS gone...and he only appears in the film as more of a guest star. And, surprisingly, the dead Jody (Mike&apos;s brother) manages to appear in this one!! Considering the second film featured &apos;Faux Mike&apos; (another actor playing this part), having the real Mike and Jody, even in small parts, was welcome. However, what REALLY was welcome were the two new players--Tim and Rocky. They were, by far, the best thing about this film. So naturally, they do NOT appear in the next two movies in the franchise!!\n\nBasically, this film is much like the first two--with Reggie driving about the country fighting zombies, orbs and the like. This time, however, he&apos;s got some strange helpers...a tough-as-nails lady and a child who is like Kevin from Home Alone if he was merged with Rambo!!! Oddly, another helper is a &apos;nice&apos; orb containing Jody...why manages to help them here and there!\n\nThe bottom line is that there is a lot of new addition to the film-- needed new additions in order to keep it from getting stale. And, combined with a little bit of Mike and Jody, it makes this one a winner. You just have to see Tim, the little boy, in action...what an unlikely and cool super-hero!!",

      "reviewBody": "In the annals of Indian cinema, the year 1961 saw the emergence of a veritable gem in the form of &quot;Jagadeka Veeruni Katha,&quot; a Telugu-language fantasy swashbuckler film meticulously crafted by the visionary K. V. Reddy.\n\nThe narrative unfolds as a tapestry of greatness, interwoven with mesmerising narration, a meticulously constructed screenplay, and dialogues that resonate with perfection. The film&apos;s magnetic allure lies not only in its grandeur but in the seamless fusion of storytelling elements that transport the audience into a fantastical realm.\n\nThe ensemble cast, adorned with exceptional talent, brings forth a performance worthy of acclaim.

      "reviewBody": "THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig with! On the surface, a &quot;leave your brain in the cloakroom&quot; sci-fi yarn, you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.\n\nSet on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing&apos;s changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth &quot;element&quot; of unknown origin.\n\nDear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with &quot;The Dark Side&quot; and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line &quot;summary quote&quot; above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it&apos;s amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.\n\nThe comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of &quot;will love save the day?&quot; as if it wasn&apos;t always going to???\n\nSo, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that&apos;s what you&apos;ll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn&apos;t fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you&apos;d be wasting your time anyway, it wasn&apos;t MADE for you!"

      "reviewBody": "A student doing an essay on her boarding school&apos;s dark past, where three students where killed and the murderer was found dead in the lake over 100 years ago. Discovers a horrifically dark secret behind these murders and that off a recent suicide. The problem is that secret can have some big consequences on that of a respected student and his father who provides beneficial benefits to the school. While, Sarah is digging further into this mystery there&apos;s a killer on the loose knocking off people. During the hundredth anniversary of the murders a party is organised, but this night is when Sarah comes face to face with the killer.\n\nWhen I got to the ending credits I thought what a big waste of time I spent on this very lukewarm Swedish slasher. Other than the freely defined camera-work and glaringly grand location, nothing else hugely appeals or breaks any new ground. Simply it looks great, there&apos;s no denying that, but its has to have more then strong polished visuals to back it up with because it doesn&apos;t go anywhere that we haven&apos;t been before and the tangled up story aimlessly plods about. If you going make a slasher with a plot structure that we&apos;ve seen over and over again, you might as well go out of your way to provide the big draw cards, instead it decided to wimp out and come up with a rather mercifully plain offering. The story is very familiar that it&apos;s just simply worn out in its supposed twists and it doesn&apos;t provide much in a way of suspense, so hopefully you would ask for some blood and T&amp;A then, well sorry it cops out on those factors too.\n\nSo what does it have going for it then! Well, actually the haunting opening scene with its pulsating score (that crops up at times) makes a better impression than it deserves. The performances are fine, if a little glum, although the characters are your standard stereotypes waiting for their chance to be killed off. Like I said the film&apos;s features are attractively glossed up. But in the things that mainly count in these films, all of that falls vapid. Please! Just add something in once in a while to make me sit up and pay notice in this drawn out fodder, because nothing, that is NOTHING (ah other then camera-work and location setting) is formidable and remotely enticing about what&apos;s happening. The deaths are incredibly lacklustre with most of it happening off the screen and when we did see one all we get was a puddle of blood in the most basic knockoff. Where was the atmosphere? Sadly with the countryside location and that of gloomy boarding school that has many poorly lit rooms, there was nothing generated to get your skin crawling and that&apos;s a sorely missed opportunity.\n\nThe screenplay is handled in a wilted manner and the script tediously strings along its muddled back-story and the coincidences that make headway are all a bit too convenient. When things start to unravel you can&apos;t stop thinking of why didn&apos;t this come sooner, as pointless scenes cement themselves and the whole mystery becomes increasingly ragged with bits and pieces from other slasher flicks that aren&apos;t hard to pick up on. When it came to the sudden climax.. it had me thinking &quot;was that it&quot;!? Also the final scene was a bit puzzling in what it was trying to accomplish with the suggestion. The concept could&apos;ve used some blatant energy to help with the stalk and slash moments too. Hence you know you&apos;re in for a jagged time when the murder scenes are even more boring than what&apos;s happening in between them.\n\nThe film&apos;s production is well made and it might be a highly unoriginal slasher, but what killed it for me was that is was so dead flat and tame in its execution that it just moulders away without much of a spark.",

There is one scene where bargain video horror tapes are discussed (3 for 69 cents!) and a bunch of non-existent silly titles are mentioned including &quot;Klaus Kinski&apos;s Bloopers&quot;. Ok, there is very little violence and most of movie follows the story of a middle aged man and the zany people he deals with while refurbishing the theater. There is a long audition where all sorts of lousy musical acts try out and we hear &quot;next!&quot; a lot. A running joke involves the bad color scheme our hero&apos;s girl friend chose for the theater. The Phantom narrates, which is odd, since he is nasty at the end. There really are no villains in this film, you know everyone is going to go home happy except for some bums and a midget plumber. Oh yeah, I did love the 50&apos;s scenes that started off the movie."

      "reviewBody": "...and though the movie was awarded two prices,it&apos;s never screened on TV.\n\nFrançois Reichenbach was a specialist in documentaries :he made a lot about America ,but also portraits of Orson Welles and Serge Gainsbourg.\n\n&quot;Un Coeur Gros Comme Ca &quot; is a semi-documentary ,candid camera shooting ,&quot;and the persons do not know where and when they are filmed &quot;;that&apos;s what the lines claim in the cast and credits.It seems only partially true.\n\nAbdulaye Faye,23 ,is a young black man from Senegal.While working in a factory ,he is training for a boxing match.\n\nHe is an endearing guy, a bit naive,but,as the title reads ,he&apos;s really big-hearted .\n\nWe follow him through the streets of Paris ...\n\n1)France: &quot;Here ,white people are afraid of black guys;in my country ,it&apos;s the other way about;besides ,White people have dirty houses ;in Dakar ,our houses are white&quot; \n\n2)Women :his ideal woman is Michele Morgan who has a cameo in the film :&quot;should you meet her, talk about her legs,not about her thighs &quot;,says a compassionate fellow traveler ,or tell her &quot; T&apos;As De Beaux Yeux Tu Sais&quot; . He meets a Japanese girl and they go boating but their relationship comes to a sudden end:she&apos;s married . There are women on the streets ,and ,as Paul Simon would sing &quot;he does declare he took some comfort there&quot; but he quickly adds: &quot;it&apos;s better to be married&quot;.\n\n3)Religion :Abdulaye is a true believer,he puts his trust in God ;he gambles on God,more like, a little like philosopher Pascal. But there&apos;s a very long sequence in a fortune-teller&apos;s house whose fortune cookie predictions can be summed up as &quot;when there&apos;s a will,there&apos;s a way&quot;.Her strange methods consist of ink-blood tests ,like in psychiatry ,as well as tarots.\n\n4)Boxing: as Abdulaye has no diplomas ,he is an unskilled worker and to become a champion is his wildest dream;he tells his hopes in voice over ,or to a blind masseur . The movie ends with two boxing matches ;the first one is particularly interesting:we never see the fighters ,but the reactions on the audience&apos;s faces -we catch a glimpse of Jean- Paul Belmondo ,who attends the championship.\n\nIt is by no means Nouvelle Vague stuff:it&apos;s the story of a young man who has to struggle to do his walk of life,he &apos;s got no time to contemplate his navel or to aimlessly wander on the streets of Paris.\n\nLike this? Try this ....\n\n&quot;L&apos;Air De Paris&quot; ,Marcel Carné ,1954"

      "reviewBody": "DOCTOR X is one of those heartbreaking films to watch for a fan of old horror movies, because it has so many wonderful things going for it yet just narrowly misses the mark of being really good due to a liability or two which could have been avoided. As is so often the case with early &apos;30s fright films like this, the need was felt to add a &quot;funnyman&quot; to the proceedings to perhaps give audiences of the day a chance to laugh along with being scared. The culprit in this case is Lee Tracy, who plays a typical golden age newspaper reporter who snoops around and gets his nose tangled into everyone&apos;s business.\n\nThe &quot;business&quot; at hand is a string of killings in New York regarding a fiend who strangles people and then apparently cannibalizes them. Dr. Xavier (the always enjoyable Lionel Atwill) heads a group of doctors who are all suspects up for scrutiny, and though we have to deal with the frequent lapses into silliness from Mr. Tracy, this old chestnut is interesting and gripping a fair amount of its running time. Director Michael Curtiz does a fine job of visually entertaining us with strange angles, quick closeups and flashy set designs. An added delight is the early use of two-strip color that gives the film a rather eerie dimension with its muted greens. Fay Wray (KING KONG) steps into another early horror picture here, but really doesn&apos;t have much to do and isn&apos;t of much use to the story. There&apos;s a completely out of place beach scene with Wray and Tracy that will leave you wondering who thought it shouldn&apos;t be left on the cutting room floor (perhaps it was an excuse to get a pantie shot of Fay as she sunbathes under her big beach umbrella).\n\nThe film&apos;s strongest moment comes in a revelation sequence late in the movie where we finally get to see who the crazed murderer is, and it&apos;s still chilling even now to watch him go through his insane routine. You&apos;re bound to have the words &quot;synthetic flesh&quot; etched into your subconscious for a long time after seeing DOCTOR X, and if there&apos;s one thing you&apos;ll remember, this will be it. **1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "A bed ridden, paraplegic NYC detective, Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), teams up with a rookie cop named Amelia (Angelina Jolie) to try and catch a serial killer, in this dark, moody atmospheric thriller from Director Phillip Noyce. This is a fine thriller.\n\nFrom the get-go viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose, and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition, the killer uses dark, subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness, together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.\n\nBut, the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important back-story from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue and/or a brief added scene near the film&apos;s beginning. Even so, good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings, so that the killer&apos;s identity is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe film&apos;s cinematography, production design, and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast; she pouts her way through the film looking like she&apos;s bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot, with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah, capable Ed O&apos;Neill, and reliable Michael Rooker.\n\nThe crime scenes tended unfortunately to be in-your-face grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.\n\nFor dark, moody serial killer films set in NYC, I prefer &quot;Sea Of Love&quot; (1989). Nevertheless, &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense, its fine cinematography, and its generally high level of acting. Be advised, however, that the film&apos;s finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place, neat and tidy."

      "reviewBody": "Rating:  ***1/2\n\nReview:  I know I&apos;ve seen this more than 100 times, and chances are I&apos;ll see it a 1000 more times until I die.  One of the most underrated films of the 1980s, this film not only marked the second directorial effort by Rob Reiner (THE PRINCESS BRIDE, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...), but also the starring debut of John Cusack, one of my all-time favorite actors (even if he wasn&apos;t, I&apos;d still feel the same way about this film).  Even after 15 years, this film remains fresh, funny and wonderfully romantic, with a tenderness and innocence that&apos;s missing in so many teen films.  It still offends me how so many teen films put it out today (with CAN&apos;T HARDLY WAIT leading the pack) could become hits with their target audiences and films like this are left on the video shelf being forgotten.  Their excuse may be simply that &quot;it&apos;s old,&quot; but considering how cliched teen films are today, I can&apos;t believe they are smart enough to realize that.   It&apos;s a shame that THE SURE THING hasn&apos;t recieved the DVD treatment, so that it could be re-discovered by today&apos;s audiences. THE SURE THING stars Cusack as Walter &quot;Gib&quot; Gibson a guy who loves junk food, beer, and life in general but feels lost for the first time in his life in terms of love when he completes high school.  While having a beer with his best friend Lance (Anthony Edwards), he recalls all the women he&apos;s been with and how&apos;s he&apos;s changed.  We now find out that they are about to depart to seperate colleges:  Lance is going to California, and Gib is going to an Ivy League school up in the Northeast.  Gib discovers that college is not all it&apos;s cracked up to be, and soon starts to flunk English. This is when we meet Alison Bradbury (Daphne Zuniga) a straight-A, education committed young woman who is too uptight, to say the least.\n\nGib tries, but fails, to win Allison and finds himself back to Square One when he gets a call from Lance.   Since Christmas is coming soon, Lance invites Gib to travel cross country to spend the holidays with him. Gib declines, until Lance mentions that there is a &quot;very special person...who loves sex&quot; who would very much like to meet him.  After seeing a picture of this &quot;sure thing&quot; that Lance sends him, he immediately makes plans to travel to California.  He soon realizes that he&apos;s not travelling alone, but with Alison, who&apos;s also journeying to CA to see her boyfriend (calling him uptight would be much too kind). The majority of the films shows them on the road trying to get to California, though they soon learn not only tolerate but also respect each other, and soon their goals become dimmer, but not forgotten.  There are so many wonderful moments on this little trip!  Instead of using cliches, director Reiner likes to poke fun at them like in a near-rape scene where Gib becomes a real actor, or when Alison is learning to shotgun beer (one of Gib&apos;s favorite hobbies) and finally discovering the last thing you&apos;d expect to be sticking out a car window while driving by. Finally, when they both arrive in California, Alison learns of Gib&apos;s reason for coming and the climactic scene is at a dorm party where unions are forged, words are passed and feelings are finally looked at by the two main characters.  The film&apos;s final sequence is quite unusual and different, which is all the more reason for you to forget the film&apos;s only negative element. That element that THE SURE THING seems to get attacked by is predictablity, though most people shouldn&apos;t care, considering how charming and funny the film is.  Sure, you know that Gib and Alison are going to end up together but the trip to that point is something to a grab a seat for. Writers Steven Bloom and Jonathan Roberts make every character real and believable and manage to give nearly every one of them an unforgettable line.  Saying just one of those lines would spoil a lot for the person who hasn&apos;t watched this movie yet.  All I&apos;m saying is, if there is a film that shouldn&apos;t be missed it is this one, because like a lot of critics said &quot;It&apos;s a genuinely special love story.&quot;"

Movies exist to enjoy people anyways, and that&apos;s what this movie does for probably a lot of teen girls.\n\nI would only recommend this movie to girls aged 12-16 maybe.

      "reviewBody": "This is the classic version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a family falls into supernatural terror . The story starts with a grisly mass murder ; years later , a family moves to Long Island where is purchased a Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . Longtime ago, there occurred a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . And now a possessed father (James Brolin) is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat the kiddies . The wife (Margot Kidder) begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of killings . Meantime ,the father is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . While , an exorcist priest (a hysteric Rod Steiger who steals the show as scene-chewing ) tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the father and attack the family .\n\nThe film contains restless terror and great loads of gore and blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the usual ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , wall ooze icky stuff, flies swarm manifest as attackers, and doors suddenly slam , among others . It is produced with acceptable budget by Samuel Z Arkoff (AIP)and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . It&apos;s actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved big success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds. The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Fred Koenekamp and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy, stupid sequels directed by Damiano Damiani , Richard Fleischer ,Sandor Stern ( screenwriter of Amityville), Anthony Hitchcock.. And the bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds (James Brolin role ) , Melissa George ( Margot Kidder character) and Philip Baker Hall (Rod Steiger), though this is a new take on from previous film, it&apos;s one of the highest earning horror movie of the last years and like the¨ Amityville ¨ original became a box office biggie . Rating : Aceeptable and passable .",

      "reviewBody": "Dolphin Tale is about as obvious and by-the-numbers as you could possibly imagine from any inspirational animal film. If you saw a trailer, read the synopsis, or even made a rough guess based on the title, I&apos;m betting you could come pretty close to guessing what this movie delivers. It&apos;s the kind of script that I could see a screenwriter inventing even if an actual tail-less dolphin didn&apos;t exist as the basis for their story. The most interesting element of Dolphin Tale is definitely the fact that Winter is a real dolphin and has actually dealt with the problems dramatized in this movie. Of course, the movie wants to focus on a character who can talk, so instead the plot is more about a young boy who wants to help save this injured dolphin. It&apos;s the &quot;Free Willy&quot; formula, and apparently it works for most people because this was a box office success. But the sad truth is that basically every detail of this film is a fabrication used to make a Hollywood story out of a unique animal that could be inspiring on her own.\n\nOnce I forced myself to ignore the discrepancy between reality and Dolphin Tale, I was able to get some enjoyment from it. It&apos;s hard not to be affected by the tug on your heartstrings when a movie is about a struggling boy who finally finds passion in his life. And, of course, that impact is increased by the fact that a crippled dolphin is part of that story. While most of this movie was overflowing with cliché, I did appreciate that it avoided going straight down every obvious pathway. There was one particular event that I expected from early on in the film, and I was surprised the movie never went there. Probably the most annoying aspect of Dolphin Tale is the trope of the aquarium running low on funds and needing to find a way to stay open. It was one additional layer of conflict that the movie didn&apos;t require. I can appreciate Dolphin Tale for what it is, and could even recommend it for family entertainment, but I also wish I could just watch a documentary about how Winter was truly saved.",

      "reviewBody": "H.L. Mencken wrote: &quot;What begins as a guess--or, perhaps, not infrequently, as a downright and deliberate lie--ends as a fact and is embalmed in the history books.&quot; Interviewing all the major players in the HIV-AIDS debate over the past 25 years--orthodox and dissidents alike--and filmed and edited with superb production values, this first documentary by Brent Leung explores the genesis of a bad guess, and quite possibly a deliberate lie. It reveals anomalies from the single pathogen theory of AIDS, which look more and more like evidence against a rush-to-judgment in 1984 (appropriate year), when the Reagan Administration embraced and politicized junk science in an effort to quiet criticism of its &quot;insensitivity&quot; to gay men. Of course, we gay men immediately embraced the single pathogen theory also, because it made AIDS &quot;everybody&apos;s disease,&quot; and shoved under the carpet all the questions about the immuno-suppressive nature of: (1) unprecedented exchange of old pathogens in incestuous urban gay enclaves; (2) unprecedented ingestion of toxins in the form of both legal and illegal drugs, which fueled the party lifestyle of the sexual revolution; and (3) the condition in which gay men found ourselves as a hated minority as the religious right reared its ugly head. What Brent Leung&apos;s film really does is to scream: &quot;Let&apos;s take another look at this junk science theory!&quot; Yes, the orthodox get some of their quotes taken slightly out of context--the limitations of a 90-minute film covering a huge amount of ground--but when you put them in context, they present an even worse case for their conclusion that a mysterious little retroviral bug is the single cause of multi-factorial immune deficiency. (Just take a look at the YouTube full interview with Montagnier, in which he says our own natural immune systems can rid us of the mysterious HIV within just a few weeks--completely undermining the &quot;once-you-get-it-you-always-have-it orthodoxy.) Many of us have researched and written on this subject (my own writing can be found at www.terrymichael.net, &quot;Special Report on HIV-AIDS&quot; linked at my home page), but our words have been confined to the internet. Leung&apos;s film brings to a theater near you the serious debate the HIV-AIDS Industrial Complex has denied us for 25 years. See it, and be amazed that most of what you thought about HIV-AIDS is, as Mencken would say, a downright and deliberate lie, by an establishment that increasingly resembles a religious cult, more than it practices rational science.",

While it was slow in patches there were some genuinely funny black comedic moments - pitch black!  The plot is simple Richard Shorkinghorn is struggling to find funding for his &quot;fountain of youth&quot; project and insanely wealthy Grace Michael, Heather Mitchell, comes forward as a prospective svengali.  Unknown to Richard his ex-fiance and co-worker Kate, Frances O&apos;Connor, is also seeking the same backing for a remarkably similar project and Grace invites the two up to her country home for them to sell their idea to her. Godfrey User, Geoffrey Rush, and Grace&apos;s husband joins in the frivolity of the weekend and the story moves from there.  The mere idea that Godfrey, the Federal Treasurer and later Prime Minister, is a satanic worshipper is reason alone to see this film (and not entirely surprising). Excellently played by all given the patchy nature of the film and I felt that it was probably helped by the continuous ads on the TV.",

      "reviewBody": "Where to begin. For starters Graham Greene. You know he understood the devastation Europe had gone through. You just can&apos;t make a film like this without it. That&apos;s what The Third Man is about - the devastation of Europe and how that affected people, both morally and physically.\n\nHolly Martins, the main character, is who&apos;s eyes we see the post-war world through as he uncovers the mystery of the death of his friend Harry.\n\nBack to Graham Greene - He wrote the novella. He writes about human misery as well as anyone. And there was no shortage of misery and lack of morals in post-war Vienna. He&apos;s also a master of conflict, both external and internal, which is where I&apos;m going here. His characters struggle with their own souls to the point of anguish. Loss is another thing he nails.\n\nThere are a few more reasons this is the best movie ever made. The next is the editing. The chase scene at the end gets all the love but-this is going to be hard to articulate but the editing is so innovative I have to try-unlike most editors who edit based on sound and dialogue, this movie is kind of reverse. It&apos;s almost like the rhythm of the scene is dictating when to cut. It&apos;s a &quot;feel&quot; thing established either within a scene or the entire movie or both. It really has to be experienced, not just written about.\n\nThe next reason is the grandiosity of the visuals. It&apos;s unbelievable how grand everything is. This totally falls in line with Orson Welles noir style and the German expressionism that influenced this film. Carol Reed&apos;s choice of lenses throughout the film are perfect. Space is played with perfectly. This falls in line with my next reason, which is the noir style that is done so well. The mood is established and kept throughout, employing the noir and the expressionist style.\n\nAnd lastly, this movie didn&apos;t just defy convention, it obliterated it - the visuals, the sounds, the story, the locations, the style, the score (which consisted of one musical instrument), and the people; the way Carol Reed presented their despair. I&apos;m preaching to the choir. I know you know.",

It is neatly packaged and represents, in my opinion, one of the very best of the B-Western genre. Buck plays a wandering cowboy whose best friend is an older gent named Ranny Williams. Ranny is played by Frank Rice who turns in a top notch performance, especially when he tells Buck that he is tired of wandering from one outfit to another, and when he reminisces about his old friend right before he goes off to town and is shot in the back.\n\nAnother great scene is when Buck comes to Shadow Ranch just as the townspeople are burying Ranny. Buck silently rides by the graveside service and removes his hat as he passes by in respect, not knowing it is his old friend they are burying.\n\nThe rest of the film deals with Buck taking up the fight for his old pal and the female owner of Shadow Ranch.\n\nThis is a special movie.",

      "name": "A treasure among other comedies because of its wit and charm.",
      "reviewBody": "Woody Allen&apos;s films are generally treasured among other comedies because of their wit and charm. Many critics would agree, though, that Allen&apos;s earlier films were among his best. One of those movies was a lighthearted film called `Sleeper,&apos; which starred a younger version of Allen and a younger, but always beautiful Diane Keaton. Although `Sleeper&apos; leaves a person in stitches from laughter, its one flaw is that it lacks an ending. But don&apos;t let that stop you from seeing this comedy classic. In the end, who cares where it goes because it&apos;s just flat out funny. \t`Sleeper&apos; is the story of Miles Monroe (Allen), who is cryogenically frozen in 1973 after having a procedure in a hospital. He is awoken nearly 200 years later by a group of scientists who want Monroe to help them defeat the leader of their society, as America&apos;s future consists of a totalitarian state. While on his adventure through this futuristic world, Monroe meets a beautiful woman named Luna Schlosser (Keaton) who he begins to have a love interest in. The two team up to try to oust their tyrannical government and bring about freedom and prosperity. \t`Sleeper&apos; was hysterical from beginning to end. The very opening scene shows Monroe covered in tin foil-clearly scientists in 1973 found new and amazing uses for this wonderful kitchen product. As soon as Monroe awakens, he is disoriented, smiling aimlessly into space and walking backwards and into people. \tAllen&apos;s comical blend of intellect and charm shows up soon after. The futuristic society is comprised of people who have no historical references for the events of the past 200 years, as their leader has undoubtedly outlawed certain forms of knowledge that could lead to rebellion. They use Monroe to fill in the historical gaps by showing him pictures of famous twentieth century individuals, such as Joseph Stalin. Monroe provides his own synopsis of their contributions to the world in his own clever way, as he does also for former President Nixon. \tAllen&apos;s writing, direction and performance were hilarious. Rarely do we see writing as clever and sidesplitting in today&apos;s comedies. The only other comic director today that could even compare to Allen would be Christopher Guest, whose mockumentary films such as `Best In Show,&apos; and the recent `A Mighty Wind,&apos; have a real source of comedy. Most present comedies are trivial, filled with rehashed jokes that depend more on toilet humor than any form of real wittiness. \tThe film&apos;s only problem is that after an hour and a half, it doesn&apos;t seem to know what to do with itself. It ends on a clever note about love with the protagonists somehow managing to save themselves, but not really the day. They realize that perhaps the only thing worth fighting for, in the end is love. \tAll in all, `Sleeper&apos; was a very funny farce on science fiction stories, and it cemented Allen&apos;s ability to be an engaging and funny in his films. ***",

      "reviewBody": "Humberto Solas&apos;s &quot;Un hombre de exito&quot; (&quot;A Successful Man&quot; in English) portrays three decades in the life of an affluent Cuban. The movie starts in 1932, during the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. Our protagonist always looks for ways to benefit from the socio-political status quo over the years, while his brother never ceases protesting. But the triumph of the revolution in 1959 throws things into flux.\n\nI admit that I may be the only person who interpreted a similarity to a Bugs Bunny cartoon (especially given the circumstances of the scene). In a scene set in 1937, some people are holding a party praising Nazi Germany&apos;s support of Franco&apos;s forces in Spain. So, they put on a performance of Wagner&apos;s opera. The music is the same that got used in Chuck Jones&apos;s &quot;What&apos;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (needless to say, here they don&apos;t use Bugs Bunny&apos;s and Elmer Fudd&apos;s lyrics).\n\nLike I said, that&apos;s a very loose interpretation, and possibly inappropriate due to the portrayal of a Nazi-Falangist party. I just come up with all sorts of unusual connections. As for the movie itself, I thought that it constituted a good look at the eras depicted, although it helps to know Cuba&apos;s history.

Her attempts to forget about her past are not as satisfactory as she wished they would be after she meets the person she had shot 10 years ago. What I found interesting is that the man who failed miserably in his life because of the accident, tries to put all the fault for that on the woman and when he finally has the chance to meet her again he believes he can solve all his problems only by accusing her for what had happened. The realization of the fact that there&apos;s nothing that can be done now, gives a sad tone to this very &quot;down-to-earth&quot; movie. The contrast between the idealist woman that spent most of her youth in prison and the nihilist professor and the close look that this movie takes on how historical events can affect an individuals&apos; life are the two main reasons I would suggest this film."

Those dark years of Brazilian history are not supposed to be fun. It was certainly not boring either. For those who admire different cultures it is a great movie and a great introduction to contemporary Brazilian history. It starts with Girl from Ipanema and lots of images of a country that was enjoying itself in the years before the military coup. Leila Diniz, Bossa Nova, all was allowed before the military coup in 1964 and hence compose the first scenes of the movie. Characters are based on real participants of the kidnapping and Fernando Gabeira (Paulo) is still engaged in politics in Brazil. It&apos;s also worth noting that Fernanda Montenegro (Dona Margarida) and Fernanda Torres (andreia/Maria) (mother and daugther in real life) are both in this movie. It&apos;s a great piece for those who are willing to learn a little bit more about an amazing country that is Brazil."

Klaudia Kovacs has combined actual footage of the days of revolution (amazing that it was taken) that is really extraordinary. People tell their own stories about a cause that most of us don&apos;t know about and make you wonder if you would have half the courage that the Hungarians had to face a military machine. This movie is so well done. Courage, honor and politics collide in a wonderful film. Bring tissue. Stories of sacrifice, torture and loss are real, but you leave this film with gratitude for freedom and inspiration, too.",

That aside, essentially this is a riotous Bruce Lee vehicle, kicking out trademarks and smashing up all evil in the process. The plot (Lee&apos;s sifu poisoned by Japanese school in turn-of-the-century Shanghai) is a valid excuse to string a great line-up of fight sequences together, and what great action this is: Bruce pounds the lights out of a dojo full of evil Japs using only fists, feet and nunchakus, and the duel with Baker (Lee&apos;s real-life personal bodyguard) near the movie&apos;s end is sheer entertainment typified. Though based on factual events, the subject matter is vastly exaggerated. Nevertheless, as kung fu theatre goes, Fist of Fury is an immensely satisfying experience, and stands as probably Lee&apos;s best Hong Kong work."

      "reviewBody": "First time writer/director Randolph Scott brings us this soft-core romp take off on the Angelina Jolie-helmed &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise. The &apos;plot&apos; as it were has Cara Loft (the hard-bodied and sexy Lauren Hays) on a mission to find three sacred artifacts scattered around the globe for the mysterious Dr. Scrotus. Because of some supremely atrocious dubbing, I recommend that you watch this with the mute on. It won&apos;t detract at all from the numerous lesbian couplings the film graces us with and your ears will thank you. This is a fairly solid soft-core film there will never win any awards, but gets the job done none the less. Plus it&apos;s STILL better than either of the (thus far) two Hollywood &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; films.\n\nMy Grade: C+ \n\nSpecial Edition DVD Extras: A trailer for &quot;the Girl Next Door&quot; plays at the start of the DVD, it CAN&apos;T be skipped over; Behind the scenes featurette; gallery of production shots; a promo trailer for this film; &amp; trailers for &quot;On-Line&quot;, &quot;Gory Gory Hellelujah&quot;, &quot;Wasabi Tuna&quot;, and &quot;Always Say Goodbye&quot;",

He does an amazing job &amp; this film was completely overlooked by just about everyone. Granted the plot is nothing to write home about, but neither is &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumbers&quot; but that isn&apos;t why it is remembered. It&apos;s for all the hilarity that ensues just as this one does. I&apos;m hoping that someday people will realize just how funny Michael Keaton can be in film &amp; that he wasn&apos;t just BATMAN! A new generation will soon come to see everything that is classically done &amp; some filmmaker will stick Mr. Keaton in another comedic role so that they can see just how well he can shine as a comedian. Here&apos;s hoping it&apos;s soon too! So if you liked &quot;Old School, Napoleon Dynamite, &amp; yes even &quot;The Hangover&quot; (though it&apos;s far less dirty) then this is right up your alley.",

The movie has just enough supernatural to it to be weird and freaky, and the acting, while not terribly good, isn&apos;t horrible. I think they showed the monster a little too early, but that&apos;s just me.\n\nWe were terrified. Neither of us would go anywhere in my house without the lights on, and certainly not alone!

He went on to star opposite Barbra Streisand in the film &quot;Yentl,&quot; and to act in many other movies including another favorite of mine, &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot;  He&apos;s appeared in numerous Broadway productions and also played for years in the TV series &quot;Chicago Hope.&quot;\n\nThe other actor to watch for is Debra Winger who plays &quot;Melanie.&quot;  She went on to roles in &quot;Urban Cowboy,&quot; &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman,&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment,&quot; and is a three-time Oscar nominee.\n\nAs a reporter, I got to interview Winger when &quot;Cannery Row&quot; was released and asked her about her memories of &quot;French Postcards.&quot;  She said she was not happy about the way the film turned out because &quot;Melanie&quot; apparently played a much larger role in the original script as shot.  She felt too much of her work was left on the cutting room floor during editing, and that her major character had been relegated to a lesser role.  Judging from what&apos;s happened since, she was probably right.\n\nAfter &quot;French Postcards,&quot; Willard Huyck went on to direct the bombs &quot;Best Defense,&quot; and &quot;Howard the Duck.&quot;",

They steal a jeep and set off on an adventurous journey, back to their roots, back to where they were and are children of nature as the authorities are on the look out to bring them back to the retirement home. Glad the film didn&apos;t take the Bertrand Blier&apos;s Going Places (1974) approach in the writing. Imagine the public reaction, especially the Church!!\n\nTraditionally, older films have a heavy feel of &quot;over acting&quot; to help get the point across with irritating soundtrack or forced lines to tug the heartstrings but this film was spot on is a fantastic as everything comes together in a beautiful all the way through the powerful final scene as surreal scene featuring Bruno Ganz.\n\nThe film touches on the effect of urbanization and the real life that is seized from mother and the relationship between Thorgeir &amp; Stella is shot in an extremely beautiful way. The story, music, cinematography, direction and, I hazard to say, a near perfect performances combine to make for a compelling film. I would recommend to watch this and would make a perfect double bill along with Waking Ned Devine (1998).",

      "name": "Mediocre Spaghetti Western with a great Spaghetti star , George Hilton , and dealing with  usual vengeance",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;To Hell and Back&quot; is an average Western being proceeded in Spaghetti style more than American . It&apos;s a disconcerting film with all the ingredients as action , brawls , crossfire , hot pursuits , the typical confrontation between good guys against bad guys and resulting to be entertaining but in low quality . Including violent shoot&apos;em up , tortures as well as brawls and fights with plenty of bounds , leaps and kick-ass . Fast-draw Johnny King (George Hilton) , a brave gunfighter , sets out to revenge the death of his mentor and friend , after he has been killed for his land by the three Ward Brothers . As the tough gunslinger called King arrives in a little town , he seeks justice and vengeance and becomes involved in an intrigue that deals with several murders . King is detained accused for killing and he is locked in prison where he meets Meredith ; both of whom escape and subsequently to carry out a bank robbery . The rebellious drifter King helped by his partner Meredith (as Paul Stevensor Paolo Gozlino) attempt to find out the real culprit on the Pastor Steve&apos;s (Pietro Tordi) murder . Then , a new sheriff is appointed and there occurs a string of killings , shootouts and gun-plays . After causing some trouble for the Wards (Paul Muller , Gerard Herter) , Johnny faces a new opponent , his outlaw friend , Meredith . Meanwhile , King saves the beautiful damsel in distress called Liz (Claudie Lange) and falls for her . At the end , it happens the predictable gun-down between king and enemies in Sergio Leone style . \n\nAn exciting western that packs a story full of violence , amazing close-ups , thrills , fights , killings , horse pursuits , middling realization , ordinary zooms , and so-so interpretations abound and at the final happens the ultimate moving confrontation . The picture starts in comical and ironical style , in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer&apos;s similar ways , including the ordinary punches , kick-asses , and slaps ; however , a bit later on , it changes and turns into a violent and dark yarn . Acceptable action sequences with rousing gun-play , spectacular shootouts , poor scenarios and glimmer go riding throughout mountains and cliffs from Almeria , Spain . The picture allows for periods of humor and comic relief , and calm in which to establish characters punctuated by viscerally exciting bursts of action . It stars the Spaghetti thespian Goerge Hilton who was born on July 16, 1934 in Montevideo, Uruguay as Jorge Hill Acosta y Lara and was the first actor to battle wits as a Police Inspector against Sadistik in the photo novels as the intrepid Inspector Grant . He starred several Giallos as ¨Day of the maniac¨, ¨The next victim¨, ¨The scorpion&apos;s tail¨ , ¨Blade the ripper¨ and , especially Spaghetti as ¨Guns for dollars¨, ¨Bullet for Sandoval¨ , ¨Dead for a dollar¨, ¨The ruthless four¨, ¨Sartana&apos;s here trade your pistol for a coffin¨ , and ¨Any gun can play¨. His pal turns out to be Paolo Gozlino or Paul Stevens who also performed a lot of Pasta western . Co-stars Claudie Lange and brief appearance Krista Nell , two Eurotrash actress , usual in sexy comedies . Other secondaries and familiar faces from Spaghetti Western are the followings : Carlo Gaddi , Paul Muller , Goffredo Unger and Gerard Herter , of course. \n\nAtmospheric cinematography by Antonio Borghesi in Eastmancolor , Cromoscope , being necessary a perfect remastering because of the film-copy is washed-out. Shot on location in Almeria , Spain , as usual , and in Elios and Cinecitta studios . Good musical score Composed by Nico Fidenco , including catching songs at the beginning and ending sung by Edda Dell&apos;Orso and Orchestra conducted by Gianni Dell&apos;Orso and Choir conducted by Nora Orlandi . This ¨Uno di più all&apos;inferno&quot; (original title) or &quot;Full House for the Devil&quot; ¨(USA title) or &quot;One More to Hell&quot; was regularly directed by Giovanni Fago under pseudonym Sidney Lean . He directed all kinds of genres as a crime flick titled &quot;Kidnap&quot; , Drama as &quot;On the Beach Beyond the Pier&quot; and Spaghetti as ¨O&apos; Cangaceiro¨ and ¨Per 100.000 Dollari T&apos;Ammazzo¨ .",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the previews for Marley and Me, I thought, ugh, another desperate attempt by Jennifer Aniston to resuscitate her career. I used to be a huge Aniston fan back in the &quot;Friends&quot; days, but it&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve seen any of her movies. And as for Owen Wilson, he always seemed like a goof who rode on the wave of his older brother&apos;s success. This movie proved me wrong on both counts.\n\nMarley and Me is about a dog, definitely, but it&apos;s just as much about a man (John Grogan, played by Wilson), his wife (Jenny, played by Aniston), and his growing family. The film follows John from his wedding night to the peak of his journalism career a dozen years later, years that are chronicled in his weekly columns for a Florida newspaper. Marley, the lovable but horribly destructive yellow lab, enters his life as a puppy, in an attempt to prepare him and his wife for future children. The dog, as expected, tears apart the house, makes wild escapes, humps the dog trainer, and lovably terrorizes other people. But the film effectively intersperses those episodes with tender, sincere moments of human/dog bonding. Marley is there to comfort Jenny when her husband cannot, adjusts to the children as they grow older, and intrudes on the family&apos;s most private moments. He is a constant, and at times, annoying presence, but Marley underscores the emotional tone of the film without dominating it.\n\nSimilarly, both Wilson and Aniston deliver understated performances that convey the ups-and-downs of any marriage. While it is the bond between John and Marley that the film explores most deeply, Jenny provides the link between dog, family, and children. In the end, she realizes what Marley has become, and what he has always been, to the two of them. The film&apos;s overall tone - light, humorous, but at times very real - builds up to an ending that is surprisingly moving. \n\nMarley and Me is a tender-hearted, easy-going film that will appeal to any dog-lover. But it will also, I think, appeal to anyone who can look back on his or her life and trace a common thread through each passing year. A beloved pet, like Marley, has that unique capability. I wish I could thank my own dog for that. But, as one of the children in the movie tearfully says, I&apos;m sure he already knows.",

      "reviewBody": "THE GAUCHO was made two years after Vittorio Gassman&apos;s collaboration with Dino Risi in IL SORPASSO (THE EASY LIFE), perhaps their best of many films together.  Although not as strong as the earlier film, this is a movie of substantial merit and deserves to be much better known. Gassman plays Mario Ravicchio, a financially-strapped press agent who accompanies an Italian production company on its trip to Buenos Aires to present a film at a festival there.  He spends much of his time, when not seducing women, trying to accumulate some money, whether by gambling or attempting to finagle capital from expatriate Italian Marucchelli (Amedeo Nazzari), now a rich industrialist in Argentina. He gets friendship, nice words, but no money. Mario tries to tap another former friend from Rome, Stefano, but the guy turns out to be more impoverished than he is.  The man is played by comic actor Nino Manfredi (of BREAD AND CHOCOLATE fame) in a short but magnificently acted supporting role as a down-and-out emigrant who has given up hope of success.  The first encounter between Manfredi and Gassman with the exuberant exchange of affection between old friends is a treasure to behold.  Italian actress Silvana Pampanini does a nice turn as an over-the-hills actress trying to marry a well-off Argentine who has been courting her for some time. Mario returns to Italy disillusioned but not without that saving `gioia di vivere&apos; that characterizes him throughout this likable film with its many little rewards for the viewer. Ettore Scola, who later directed Gassman in DOWN AND DIRTY, lent his hand to the screenplay."

      "reviewBody": "No Blood No Tears, the second feature by Corean action auteur, Ryu Seung Wan, isn&apos;t so much an action picture, but more of a pulp noir/caper movie like a number of the films of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThe story itself features a rather large cast of characters, but our protagonists are two women, one with an abusive ex-boxer boyfriend turned criminal and the other an ex-con turned taxi-driver who owes some gangsters some money. A somewhat complicated scheme is hatched by multiple parties to steal money from an illegal dog-fighting event and it appears as though multiple gangs are involved, as well as the police, some wannabe criminals. Once the scheme begins, all the parties go for the bag of money and multiple double crosses are revealed, along with fists flying, feet running and a whole lot of people getting beaten up and/or killed. All of which is clear, even if it&apos;s a little chaotic at times.\n\nHumor is present in the film, more in the form of irony or just people (or the audience) reacting to the madness that&apos;s occurring, but it&apos;s not a comedy. The action is stylish and some of the choices in direction, including some crazy tracking over surprisingly long choreographed fight sequences, can be surprising both in effectiveness and audacity. The art direction is also notable, the film being drenched in dark tones, perfectly setting the atmosphere.\n\nI think all thesps do a good job with the increasingly deranged boyfriend being the most surprising of all as his character changes. It&apos;s not an easy film to watch due to the heaping of physical non-glorified violence, so those that can&apos;t take such images should generally stay away. Also, if you don&apos;t pay attention or try to do something else while watching this film, you might lose track of what&apos;s going on due to the expansiveness of the cast. And things do get quite chaotic when multiple groups are encountering each other (and also quite amusing as well, in a maddening &quot;can it really get any crazier?&quot; kind of way).\n\nFans of crime/heist movies with a little grit and humor, like those of the aforementioned directors will find a lot to like here. I personally enjoyed the insanity, the comedy, some kick ass violence, but I did wish it would&apos;ve relented just a little on some of the pummeling that happened. It sometimes just got brutal to watch such an unfair match-up. But overall, I enjoyed this energized, entertaining, funny sequence of increasingly crazy events. 8/10.",

It leads the viewer along a plot line that looks ho-hum and standard for any thriller but then, when you least expect it, it takes you on a ride you never saw coming. Much of the acting is just a little &quot;over the top&quot; which is typical in a lot of Asian horror films, but the lead actress, newcomer Pataratida Pacharawirapong was as believable, beautiful, and emotional as any actress in any horror film I&apos;ve ever seen from any country. From the cinematography, I found myself also wishing to re-visit Southeast Asia and check it out more thoroughly. There were no shots of Bangkok&apos;s crowded, dirty streets or sex outlets (which are what you&apos;ll see in 99% of the films shot in Thailand) but there were a lot of culturally interesting shots. Overall, this film is a must-see for any horror fan.",

Dieter is arrested by the peasants, tortured and sent to a prisoner camp, where he meets five other mentally ill prisoners. He becomes close to Duane (Steve Zahn) and organizes an escape plan; however, the unstable Gene (Jeremy Davies) opposes to Dieter&apos;s plan. When they discover that there is no more food due to the constant American bombings in the area and their guards intend to kill them, Dieter sets his plan in motion. However, an unexpected betrayal split the group and Dieter and Duane find that the jungle is their actual prison.\n\n&quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; is a good drama of war, with great performances of Christian Bale and Steve Zahn. Jeremy Davies has his customary role of an insecure and unstable guy. The story shows the spirit of a soldier and his struggle for surviving in a totally hostile environment. The poor and suffered peasants that had their lands, homes and families bombed are naive and do not have military training; therefore the storyline of Dieter&apos;s amazing escape is credible. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Sobrevivente&quot; (&quot;The Survivor&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "My interest in this film has very little to do with the fact that as a boy I read the book &apos;By Rocket into Planetary Space&apos; written in 1929 by the rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, Transsylvania. Or with the fact that I studied as a minor subject astronomy. But I bring with me some interest in the history and culture of the Middle East, which seems to be one prerequisite to like this work. Alike the Oberth effect which can be used in &apos;a maneuver in which a spacecraft falls into a gravitational well and then uses its engines to further accelerate as it is falling, thereby achieving additional speed&apos;.\n\nWhile the first two thirds are purely commented documentary, the film gains immensely in traction towards the end when phantasy overtakes in the form of a retrofuturistic anymated cartoon. A lot to be regreted. Not to have followed this story.",

Newton steals the show with his characterization of the famous pirate, yet does so without distracting one from the story.\n\nA half century has not robbed this film of any of its charm; it remains one of the great pirate films of all time.

      "reviewBody": "Extreme Prejudice moves and unfolds just a like a Swiss watch, a well oiled and violent action movie that you can tell&quot; even though he only has a story by credit, is through and through a John Milius yarn. Walter Hills direct clear, muscular action, and a hell of a lot of fun to experience, but what I like the most is just how completely this is a modern western, and decidedly a character-based one at that. Nick Nolte has almost the same tough Grimace expression through the whole thing, but that&apos;s fine because then that gives plenty of space for Powers Boothe, Clancy Brown, Michael Ironside, Rip Torn, William Forsythe and everybody else to work there grizzly magic if that is what it can be called on the screen.\n\nIn particular Powers Boothe is a delightful antagonist, like others sweating at times like its going out of style but making it part of his menace, and at one key point snorting enough coke to make Scarface blush. As soon as you see him and Nolte together you know this is going to be whenever they reappear a great meaty &quot;I&apos;m gonna emotionally and probably physically kick your ass&quot; scene.\n\nOne could say we&apos;ve seen a lot of this before, matter of fact it&apos;s deep down a &quot;I got to hold up my Man code&quot; story, down to the love intetest (Maria Conchita, who thankfully is cast well and she gives a very good performance), and at its best feels like Son of Peckinpah, in particular with that climax. I&apos;m at saying this movie reinvent the wheel, but the direction is always precise and exciting and the interplay and dialogue is sharp and occasionally very funny or just the right tone of humorous attitude and one-liners for this kind of mercenary, Western heights movie, and by the very end it almost feels like Milius and Hill are giving us the origin story of the modern Mexican cartel haha. It&apos;s a good one.\n\nAlso one last thing, did it feel like the climax of this movie is almost like John Milius was finally getting to do the climax of Apocalypse Now, now only if Willard and Kurtz knew and even were friends going back? Just a musing.",

      "reviewBody": "Waqt (1965) : Brief Review -\n\nYash Chopra reinitiated the &quot;lost and found&quot; formula with an unknown and unintentional anthology. There is a great quote from Charlie Chaplin&apos;s masterpiece &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952): &quot;Time is the best author. It always writes the perfect ending.&quot; Yash Chopra&apos;s Waqt is the cinematic explanation of that quote. By the 60s, the lost and found formula had become old in Bollywood, so the novelty factor wasn&apos;t there. Yash Ji realized that and decided to extend the same formula with glitter, glamour, and ensemble cast. Waqt is such a lavish and glamorous film for family melodrama. It begins with a large-scale scene in Lala Kedarnath&apos;s family as he celebrates the birthdays of his three sons (on the same day). Ravi and Manna Dey&apos;s evergreen number, &quot;Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen,&quot; sets the mood for a royal family drama, and then tragedy strikes. Suddenly, that royal film turns into a poor people&apos;s drama. It again catches up with the glittering world when the boys grow up, and the narrative forms an unintentional anthology. There are 4 stories running simultaneously, and all are interlinked with each other unknowingly. That seemed like a perfect Bollywood masala classic. Waqt then shifted gears in the last hour and brought thrilling elements like murder and courtroom drama to it, and then ended a 3-hour drama with a happy ending. Yash Chopra brings an ensemble cast that guarantees a sure-shot box office hit, and they all fit in their roles. Except for that one evergreen song in the beginning, no other songs hit the chords. They are shot very beautifully, though. After directing back-to-back social films like Dhool Ka Phool (1959) and Dharmaputra (1961), Yash Chopra finally decided to try his hands at a commercial blockbuster, and he delivered a much bigger hit than those two films. He couldn&apos;t surpass the quality, though, and it&apos;s a fact. Overall, a very gorgeous drama with many masaledar scenes.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

Julin Jean who plays the stripper &quot;Cherry&quot; is very believable and delivers a wonderful performance. You will also enjoy Allen Hackley as &quot;Bull&quot; as well as the rest of the cast who are definitely talented superstars.\n\nThe professional filming and special effects are top notch. The music arrangements are done well throughout, never overpowering. This movie is riveting and at times humorous with plenty of power packed action. Very enjoyable from beginning to end. You will not be disappointed! So grab the popcorn. Prepare to enjoy yourself and be totally entertained!"

A teenage girl&apos;s, (Kerri Green), father, who is also a senator, hires Charlie Sheen, (who brings along friend, Alan Ruck, for the ride), to drive her cross-country to be institutionalized for anger management issues. Much chaos ensues on the road! Touching at times, comical at others, I definitely encourage you to check this movie out, especially if you&apos;re a big fan of 80&apos;s films. Young Charlie Sheen and Alan Ruck&apos;s performances are quite enjoyable, as well as Kerri Green&apos;s. If you&apos;re a Charlie Sheen or Alan Ruck fan, then check this movie out! Great piece of 80&apos;s film nostalgia!",

A very good noir film that should get more play and recognition.\n\nThe dark atmosphere,the craziness of the music and the partying in the background all the time as the story unfolds. Maybe I had a leg up reading the book almost first. It&apos;s very rare when I think a movie based on a book is just as good as the book. I felt sympathy for Robert Montgomery&apos;s character. All the time thinking he was going to lose to the cheats. He had his own principals and stuck to them.\n\nCan&apos;t say enough.\n\nGood movie.",

Admit it, if You think of pig-face ,it&apos;s Brian&apos;s. Debrah Farentino is beautiful and well casted. Story is entertaining and suspenseful. I do really hope that Brian Dennehy-who starred and produced the movie- will do more Matthew Hopes. As always, McBain&apos;s books and Hunter&apos;s books are better than any movie based on them. So, read the book, see the movie and read the book again. There are also audio cassettes and cd&apos;s available of the 87th Precinct and Matthew Hope saga."

      "reviewBody": "Having seen other movies about the Zatoichi legend and having been less than entertained and having ended up ejecting the disc about half way through, it was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch this 2008 take on the legend.\n\nI will say this this 2008 version was particularly stylish and interesting compared to the other ones I have seen. It stands out as it is heavier on the action and the acting, than the older movies that are heavier on the melodrama.\n\nThe movie is easily summarized for those not familiar with the legend of the blind swordsman. Ichi (played by Haruka Ayase), a blind traveling musician, is seeking out her mentor, and on her travels she meets up with Toma Fujihira (played by Takao Osawa) and the end up in a feud between the Yakuza and a gang of thugs.\n\n&quot;Ichi&quot; has some good action scenes and sequences that were nicely choreographed, and they used a great combination of slow-motion and regular motion camera work to enhance the action. And the sword fight scenes were spices up with spray blood, although there wasn&apos;t actually any gore, so it was tastefully done. Oddly enough, though, with her skills with her sword, Ichi never got any blood on her and was always pretty and clean.\n\nThe movie was driven by a good story, and helped along by some pretty good acting. I must applaud Haruka Ayase for her portrayal of Ichi, because it was really nicely done; emotional and beautiful. The movie did suffer from the acting of Shidô Nakamura who played Banki, the leader of the thugs, it was overdone and very staged.\n\nThere was a lot of good camera work in the movie, and lots of nice scenes. They made good use of the scenery in the movie, and the sets were working quite well. And the costumes and props were working well in favor of the movie as well.\n\nFor a live action Manga, then &quot;Ichi&quot; was a good movie, entertaining and full of action. I was glad that I watched this, despite of my former bad experiences with the older movies. Recommendable for those who like feudal Japanese swords fighting movies.",

Except an object lesson about the FRG in its high culture, with all its Americanised export products to Europe, the world and soon also the naive East. Corruption, capitalism, division of society, absolutely ruthless greed for profit, lies, lies, lies. But the claim of political education is far removed from this entertainment film, one that at some point completely abandons its self-appointed task. From the middle section onwards, the petrol runs out. When I said &apos;nothing really&apos; earlier, there is too little of everything here at times. At some point, the charming goofiness just becomes stupid.",

She eventually gets picked up by an gov&apos;t organization where she along with others are being trained as assassins to execute specific people with a controlled chip installed in their heads called the &quot;Black Cat&quot; with only a one kind of pill to soothe their frequent headaches. This is the Chinese equivalent version of &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and is very entertaining since it&apos;s unique and not like a direct frame by frame copy of it&apos;s predecessor like &quot;Point Of No Return&quot;! A sequel was made called &quot;The Black Cat II: The Assassination Of Boris Yeltsin&quot; which is more action oriented.",

Wang Kuan-Hsiung defeats all and shares his prize money with the others. The military people are not happy that their man was defeated.\n\nThis is the initial movie for Wang Kuan-Hsiung. I have him listed in my database of movies as Wong Goon-Hung but HKMDB changed it so now I have to add this name so all my cross references will link. All these actors have way too many names. This movie was a good start for him. The first fight sequences were excellent then his character is killed off but he died a good death.\n\nMy copy is a digital file that plays on a HDTV as wide screen but it is not really wide screen and is cropped on all sides. This cropping creates a problem by making some parts of the fights appear too close up. The fights are good despite this problem. The dialog is Chinese. There are no subtitles and I do not understand Chinese.\n\nI can&apos;t write a proper review because of the language problem. I have watched many of these movies without subtitles or dubbing and more often than not I can figure out the story. This time, other than the military being bad guys, I could not pick up anything else. I recommend the movie for fans of martial arts movies of the golden age from 1967 to 1984 based simply on frequent and well done fights.",

Traveling to a small town to retrieve his treasure, he helps out a young orphan and crosses paths with mystery man Mickey Hargitay.\n\nNot content with merely ripping off Sergio Corbucci&apos;s popular Django character, the producers took the unusual step of creating their own Django-like character, that ends up being more in the spirit of the original film than many of the knock-offs that actually used Django in the title. Ironically, German distributors actually re-titled the film as another bogus Django sequel.\n\nAs far as the movie goes, it&apos;s alright. There&apos;s a lot of familiar European faces and some good action scenes. Fans of Ivan Rassimov (who&apos;s been in quite a few good cult films), Django, or the spaghetti western genre as a whole, will probably appreciate this more than the casual viewer.",

Those &quot;funny one-liners&quot; (and there are plenty!) are much more than that: they tell us volumes about the characters. This movie certainly does not spell anything out to the viewer (except, perhaps, the obvious), so you must be able to find the meaning behind the words.  If you listen to what the characters are saying, then you can understand their past relationships, their present feelings, which friends have stayed close, etc.  Remember, these are old friends: the script is very realistic so the characters are not going to explain every line to one another.  I believe to truly enjoy this movie you need to pay close attention to all of the details and understand a bit about the attitudes and ideals of the two eras the movie depicts.\n\nWonderful, intelligent movie!",

The cover suggested it as a major focus.\n\nUnfortunately, this whole concept just sort of meanders around in the back ground.. literally, shots of &apos;another earth&apos; in the sky, becoming more of a by-product.\n\nThis film, essentially a dramatic piece focusing on the aftermath of a tragedy, is actually good. Sadly, it just isn&apos;t what I came for and I felt slightly cheated at the lack of any actual sci-fi alien planet doppelgänger earth action. I&apos;m aware of the concept, and it works as a metaphor - but it felt like the film was pulling in two different directions, marketing as one thing but delivering another.",

However, what was at first a fun weekend for the group ends up as a fight for their life as they are attacked. \n\nAs expected from the plot and/or from a Wes Craven picture, &apos;The Breed&apos; is overflowing with the typical slasher clichés. Also present is Craven&apos;s typical &apos;tough female lead&apos;, this time played by Michelle Rodriguez (who really isn&apos;t good).\n\nHowever, two things change in this usual horror-movie clichéd situation: the house is in a &apos;deserted&apos; island instead of a forest (which changes the usual escape tactics); and the killer here isn&apos;t a Jason-style stalker, but rather intelligent (genetically enhanced) and rabid dogs.\n\nTo my surprise, the characters act unexpectedly smart for horror movie victims, actually thinking and coming up with decent/good plans to escape/fend off the dogs (though their dialogue skills are still heavily impaired). However, the usage of real, trained dogs instead of CGI is easily the film&apos;s highlight; the best scenes are done by them, with or without the humans.\n\nIt&apos;s a very dumb and idiotic film but also rather fun, and the dogs are definitely the movie&apos;s true stars. Not something to look for, but not a bad choice to watch if you haven&apos;t anything else to do.",

This is of course not surprising since the film is hugely fun, mixing Judaism/Israeli aspects into a wonderful satire of Hollywood filmdom. Don&apos;t take this film too seriously, although the acting is wonderful, with everyone clearly knowing it&apos;s all in fun. Despite that, I really got into the &apos;vibe&apos; of the story, waiting to see whether they&apos;d manage to finish making the film - whichever one it&apos;ll be. The whole Jewish angle of the film is of course especially fun for us here in Israel, and even more so because Israeli actor Sharon Reginiano plays Levy the director and inserts all sorts of comments in Hebrew which may be lost to non-Hebrew speakers, even if they are translated. The film reminded me very much of &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot; (2003) with Adam Goldberg which I saw at the JFF of that year. Both films use the Jewish/Israeli/Hebrew slants to the max and are extremely tongue-in-cheek, satirizing their respective genres. Don&apos;t over-analyze or dissect this film - just see it for what it is, a fun satire of Hollywood movie-making and all it involves. Don&apos;t know if this&apos;ll catch on in the overall US/worldwide markets, but we here sure enjoyed it. And if it does go straight to DVD, no matter - just enjoy it that way!",

      "reviewBody": "Considering Judd Apatow&apos;s previous work most people will probably see Funny People expecting a comedy.This isn&apos;t the case at all. The film is clearly a drama even though it centers around stand up comedy.George (Adam Slander) is a very successful, famous and rich comedian who learns that he has a blood disorder similar to leukemia and he&apos;ll most likely die in a short amount of time. Ira (Seth Rogen) is a struggling up-and-coming stand up comedian who works at a deli.One night George takes notice of Ira and hires him as his personal assistant. Ira gets exited with this new chance and accepts it right away.Besides being an assistant Ira soon becomes George&apos;s only friend. Later on the experimental medicine that was given to George by the doctors ends up working and George defeats the disease. With a second chance in life, George tries to reconnect with the love of his life and takes Ira along for the ride. Both of them end up learning some lessons. This is not a bad film, and I think the premise is great, the problem here is that the movie is very,very uneven.The direction of the film changes a few times, sometimes it feels like its going on the right direction and sometimes it just falls flat.As I said, this is more a drama then a comedy, but the writing is what you usually see in the late genre; the characters are two dimensional and poorly written, specially the main character George who towards the end of the movie seems like a completely different person. The acting was a big problem for me as well. Seth Rogen&apos;s acting here, lets be honest, it is atrocious, he doesn&apos;t seem comfortable at all and delivers his lines in a very awkward way (and I didn&apos;t mind him at all in Zack And Miri Make A Porno for instance) and Eric Bana has a serious case of overacting. All in all, it&apos;s a very uneven film but entertaining nonetheless and a good change of pace for Adam Sandler.\n\n6/10"

Of course, the best scene is Leslie Nielsen - still a few years away from his career in comedy* - wrestling a grizzly. This is a movie that, ridiculous as it is, must have been really fun to film. The animals really look like some mean mothers.\n\nYes, it&apos;s one of the many silly exploitation flicks of the era. Totally enjoyable, I might add. Unfortunately, the director got killed in a helicopter crash in the Philippines less than a year after the release. Too bad.\n\nAlso starring Christopher George, Lynda Day George, Richard Jaeckel, Andrew Stevens (Stella Stevens&apos;s son) and Michael Ansara (Barbara Eden&apos;s former husband).\n\n*As late as 1987, Nielsen co-starred in the dead serious &quot;Nuts&quot;.",

      "name": "Innovative romantic film with successfully integrated hardcore scenes",
      "reviewBody": "All About Anna aims to be an erotic film for and by women that incorporates unsimulated sex scenes as a natural part of the storyline. This normalization of the pornographic content is further emphasized by the fact that most of the crew and actors had no experience with making pornographic films before All About Anna. Consequently the sex scenes are photographed and performed in a way that you would not expect in a typical hardcore pornographic film. In fact, the sex scenes even play with or against the conventions customary to pornographic films, and are also used to portray the personalities of the characters.\n\nThe leading actress, Gry Bay, in particular contributes a sensitivity to the sex scenes that is unlike what you would expect in a film with pornographic content, and gives a good portrayal of the young female single who longs for her one and only great love and tries to cope with her career, room mate and boyfriend. Supporting actress, Eileen Daly, adds both comedy and tragedy to her scenes, while French porn actress Ovidie is passable as a French actress who shows Anna around Paris and has a sexual encounter with her. However, it is Ovidie who contributes one of the trumps of the DVD release. Her audio commentary is very revealing on how different All About Anna is from standard pornographic films.\n\nThe storyline is told in episodes, an approach that works very well and obviously could allow for expanding with more episodes in the life of this young female. Unfortunately, the film, and particularly the cinematography, is a bit uneven, and it is obvious from the copious extra material on the DVD release that some of the original intentions had to be scrapped in order to make the final film. E.g. the sex scenes appear to have been originally intended to be longer and somewhat more explicit than in the final edit.\n\nDespite the shortcoming of the production, I think the film successfully integrates the sex scenes into the storyline and character development. The DVD release is impeccable with several audio commentaries on different aspects of the production, a documentary on The Love-Making of All About Anna, trailers, unedited sequences, and even a director&apos;s original edit. As an extra bonus the distributor has added a third disc promoting pornographic films which gives further evidence to the stark contrast between All About Anna and the standard, more mechanical pornographic film.\n\nI suppose that this film would appeal to a female audience, aged between say 18 and 38, who are able to identify with Gry Bay&apos;s portrayal of Anna, a young female looking for her one and only love. For the successful integration of sex scenes in the storyline, Gry Bay&apos;s portrayal of Anna, and the excellent DVD release, I give All About Anna 8 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "There is evidence to suggest that children... would really rather watch something else.\n\nAs suspense/horror movies go, this one isn&apos;t amazing. Its hardly original; more like Hitchcock&apos;s The Birds meets Verbinski&apos;s The Ring. Honestly. Its a perfect combination of the two.\n\nPersonally I&apos;d recommend watching the afore mentioned separately, each being better alone than this film. Really, the only thing it seems to have in abundance OTHER than unoriginality, is cheap pop-out scares. I mean, yeah, its kinda fun the first time or two... but after about half a dozen, you start to wonder if there is anything else to be had.\n\nThe acting wasn&apos;t entirely horrible, I&apos;ll admit to that much. The Turner kids who played Ben are certainly entertaining to watch, giving a cute contrast to the grungy atmosphere of the movie. Cancer Man... wait... no, sorry, William Davis could have done better in my opinion, as could Miller... but considering the type of movie this is, one doesn&apos;t have a lot of room to nitpick.\n\nAs a quick side note, I DO commend this movie for not being gratuitously gory. Its rare to find modern movies in this genre that don&apos;t blatantly use blood and guts to invoke fear.\n\nAll in all, this movie isn&apos;t the worst of its kinda, but it is in no way the best. If you want cheap, minimal-gore thrills that will make you jump, go see it. If you&apos;re looking for a deeper, more thought-provoking thriller... I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "Apart from a few curious departures from Le Carre&apos;s book of the same name the main thing wrong with this film is the casting of Diane Keaton as Charlie. Why the producers saw fit to use a relatively minor American actress to play the key role in this very strong story is something of a mystery, particularly when so many fine European actors were available at the time. Keaton strives to do her best but remains unconvincing throughout the play and her inadequacies are, unfortunately, highlighted by the superb performances from the rest of the stellar cast. Notwithstanding, the film is still well worth watching if only for the performances of Klaus Kinski and the rest of the cast. Plus the strong story line tends to over-ride some of the casting flaws. Moreover, since the film was made in the 1980&apos;s it is grittily realistic and doesn&apos;t suffer from the mawkish revisionism of recent films about international terrorism. Note: the earlier commentator who wondered why the character of Charlie would have been selected as a intelligence agent, seems to have missed the main point of the story. Charlie wasn&apos;t an agent - she was bait.",

A magical feline(well played by Mike Myers) goes in the home of two siblings named Conrad(Spencer Breslin from last years The Santa Clause 2) and Sally(Dakota Fanning from this years Uptown Girls) and tries to teach them on how to have a fun time, while there mother(Kelly Preston) is at work. But what happens when there scumbag neighbor(perfectly well played by Alec Baldwin) begins to suspect what there up to, and trying to woo there mother at the same time. I liked this movie, it is not overacted like The Grinch was. Mike Myers plays the part in his own way, and his own comic style. And it also had cool special effects. I don&apos;t care what the other critics say, I liked this movie."

The man who brought you Bean (1997), now brings you Johnny English, a parody of James Bond. I loved Bean, and I love this one just as much, if not more. Ignore the pathetic critics that rate this as crap, because it most certainly isn&apos;t. It is a piece of comedy that you will not regret seeing - I recommend this to anyone.

I was in the army in Germany in the early 60s and a lot of this atmosphere was still present.\n\nHonest, simple movies like this one, with an easy-to-follow theme, are a thing of the past now, with directors packing too much trash into too little time, resulting in hectics with essentially no real message.\n\nAnd what a collection of stars! A brilliant Freddy Quinn, Brigitta Mira etc. etc., a beautiful Bea Fidler (as always)... I&apos;ve seen the film several times and am always ready to enjoy it again, tons of erotics but not so much as to burden the film with too much sexuality. A great time warp back to a wonderful era in Germany!",

      "name": "A waste of time, with one exception",
      "reviewBody": "What a great concept: Take 4 of the most popular European actresses of the Seventies and pop them into a Italian- style comedy that takes place mostly in bed. Unfortunately, Letti selvaggi&quot; is another one of those anthology comedies with eight separate episodes. It goes without saying that the quality ranges from terrible to okay. You&apos;ll get Sylvia Kristel, Ursula Andress, Monica Vitti and Laura Antonelli for two episodes each.\n\nThe movie starts off with Sylvia Kristel, playing a seemingly bored girl in a flat on the beach. She lures in a mobile trader who thinks she wants to have sex with him, but there is actually a body she must get rid off and the guy is just her scapegoat. Sylvia Kristel was hot and sexy in the Emmanuelle films, but she definitely was no good actress. Her wooden play is painfully obvious here, and it&apos;s up to co-star Orazio Orlando to save this quite promising episode that in the end suffers from bad writing and bad acting.\n\nNext up, Ursula Andress as a grieving widow, visited by a journalist. He can convince her to pose for some pictures which then evolves into a whole striptease. No fun here, no gags, no surprises, no twist, nothing. A waste of time.\n\nNext. A (weirdly dubbed) kid asks hooker Monica Vitti to act as his mother and bring him to school. She agrees, but in the principal&apos;s office she must find out that the kid is a terrible pupil. What an awful episode! Vitti is actually a good actress, so is Roberto Benigni, but there is no way they could save this pointless nonsense.\n\nThen Laura Antonelli as the beautiful wife of a distrustful old jerk. It&apos;s only about two minutes long and the less said about it, the better.\n\nBack to Kristel, playing the wife of a nutty professor who is constantly quarreling about her lack of quality as a cook and in bed. Kristel&apos;s acting is even worse than before. But it fits this horrible ordeal of an episode.\n\nThen Andress in a very short one: To boost business of a garage, she&apos;ll strip in lingerie on the nearby street, causing a huge pile-up. Watchable, but also forgettable.\n\nThe second Vitti outing is surprisingly good and while the storyline is ridiculous, it is also high-paced and more or less entertaining. Vitti as a jewel thief who is after an invaluable necklace. She doesn&apos;t know yet that another crook is already close on her heels. Vitti and Co-Star Michele Placido harmonize quite well and the episode definitely benefits of the two.\n\nThen we have the final episode with Laura Antonelli, and they saved the best for last. In fact, this one even saves the neck of the whole movie. A shy orchestra conductor meets a beautiful woman on the street and to his surprise, she agrees to dating and shows up at his home a little later. While there is something going on between the two, this Giovanna is a pure businesswoman and she has calls and meetings one by one. Not much time for a romance, and actually Giovanna is more in need of a servant than a lover. The story then shows the two constantly rushing around while trying to make out in some two-minutes-slots. This is quite funny, at a very high pace and with good actors. Jose Sacristan is a nice guy and quite likable, but it&apos;s of course the fantastic Laura Antonelli who makes this worth watching. Once more she proves her talent for comedy, she is bursting with energy, as always pleasing to the eye, and there are a couple of lingerie scenes thrown in.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s hard to rate these anthology comedies as impartially as possible, but I doubt this could have appealed to audiences back in the day. Especially the first episodes are just awful and I know dozens of Italian comedies of the Seventies outclassing this totally. Best thing to do is probably to skip all this rubbish and go for the last two episodes only. To those I would give 5 and 6 stars, if watched separately.",

      "reviewBody": "As most Fulci fans would agree, his best movies came out in the late seventies and early eighties. In 1988 he had to pull out of directing the terrible Zombie 3 after only a few weeks, due to ill health. What that ill health was is anyones guess. But judging by Nightmare concert of 1990 vintage, he is obviously still suffering. I am of the opinion that producers were pressuring him to put his name to something, and in the end, this is what came out.\n\nIt is a real mish mash of a slasher story spliced with scenes from other movies. Of course, fulci plays the lead. Or rather, is on screen with things happening around him. He is supposed to play himself, though i doubt anyone could be that wooden in real life. It is often difficult to tell WHAT is happening as the film jerks from scene to scene with nothing to link them together. Fulci spends most of his time looking puzzled and shocked, just as i am sure you, the viewer, will be.\n\nIt has plenty of gore in it as you would expect and will be most peoples reason for acquiring this movie. Fair enough. Just don&apos;t expect the cinematic punch of Zombie or the Beyond. At the end of the day its a horror movie, albeit a confusing one. I think it did its job, as i was left feeling somewhat disturbed and unwashed afterwards. Get it if you&apos;re a real gore hound or a fulci fan, other than that theres not really much to recommend it. Very strange psycological gore fest. Hmmmmmmmmmm....... Poor Fulci."

The band themselves do not stray from a very tight pattern on stage, but that keeps you close to the music and the performances - yes they have aged, but they still keep it together perfectly. Director Dick Carruthers lets the music do the talking, and while the editing is tight, the camera concentrates on the band, rarely focusing on the audience. Absolutely fantastic. If you&apos;ve missed them on the big screen, then seek this out on Bluray and DVD in November - you will not be disappointed if you love Zep. The best concert film in a long time.",

      "reviewBody": "After the flood of Who-DVDs we&apos;ve seen lately and the fact that &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is a pretty definite document not only on the story of The Who but on Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll as a whole, I was more than skeptical whether this new documentary on Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon was really necessary. Well, I&apos;m a fan so I picked the DVD up anyway and having just watched it I&apos;m more than glad that I did.\n\nI didn&apos;t learn anything completely new, but the &quot;Amazing Journey&quot; of The Who is so entertaining and peppered with such a great number of fantastic songs that it&apos;s just a real joy to watch it all being told once again. Besides, previous Who-films like &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; or &quot;30 Years Of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; didn&apos;t really contain that many facts, but concentrated more on live performances. &quot;Amazing Journey&quot; takes a different approach and features lots of statements by the band, their producers, managers and folks who accompanied them along the way, as well as a few fans (Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallagher, Sting, The Edge, Steve Jones). The movie also features lots of amazing and previously unseen footage of live appearances, recording sessions and historic interviews. At 120 minutes running time the makers did a fine job touching most of the cornerstones in the band&apos;s career - just why didn&apos;t &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; get a mention? - while still keeping the pacing tight.\n\nYep, this is definitely recommendable for any The Who fan, even those who already have like 20 DVDs by that band on the shelf. &quot;Amazing Journey&quot; definitely inspires to dig them all up again and remember why Pete Townshend and the other three loons were one of the greatest bands that ever existed.",

Cruise and Kidman bring some bona fide star power and keep you interested against the beautiful landscapes..

      "reviewBody": "While the years may not have been entirely kind to &quot;The Human Comedy,&quot; they have certainly been kinder than some of the comments I&apos;ve seen here, the venom and churlish malice of which frankly astonish me.\n\n In 1943, M-G-M commissioned author William Saroyan to develop a screen story about the World War II homefront. The result was this, which Howard Estabrook turned into a screenplay and Saroyan himself expanded into a novel -- which explains why the film was released before the book was published.\n\nYes, &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; is propaganda, but with a difference. Most of the propaganda of WWII arose from anger and grim determination, and films like &quot;Air Force&quot; and &quot;Operation Tokyo&quot; look excessive and embarrassing now that passions have cooled. The propaganda of &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; rises not from anger but from fear -- the fear that the crucible of war might be too harsh for the spirit of small-town America to survive.\n\nTo be honest, much of &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; also looks excessive and embarrassing now the fears have been alleviated. But few films struck such a chord in audiences of the time by showing them, if not as they were, then at least as they liked to picture themselves.\n\nThe film&apos;s appeal now is more than just as a historical curiosity, however. Despite the Andy Hardy sentimentality and Saroyan&apos;s blue-collar pseudo-poetry, &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; has much to recommend it if you can resist viewing it through the prism of our own time, with the war safely won these 50 years. It has, for example, one of Mickey Rooney&apos;s best and most restrained performances and a charming performance by Jackie &quot;Butch&quot; Jenkins as his baby brother -- he became a child star on the strength of this film, but was never this good again.\n\nFrank Morgan, too, is first-rate as a sad old man taking pride in his work and refuge in his bottle; Morgan was an idiosyncratic actor, but he was capable of great depth and deserves to be known for something besides &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; Director Clarence Brown, now sadly neglected, shows once again his sure touch with Americana and his sensitive handling of child and teen actors.\n\n&quot;The Human Comedy&quot; is a bit cloying, perhaps, but it&apos;s also a compassionate and generous-spirited film. It deserves to be regarded with the same generosity."

Again Frank Drebin(Nielsen) return from retirement to help Police Squad(George Kennedy, O. J. Simpson). Drevin is back this time to save the Oscar Academy from a plot hatched by a nasty villain. The dumber law officer from Inspector Clouseau goes undercover a penitentiary where is a top terrorist named Rocco(Fred Ward). He along with his mother(Kathleen Freeman) and girlfriend(Anna Nicole Smith) are planning bomb the Academy Award ceremony . Meanwhile, his wife Jane(Priscilla Presley) is desperate for pregnant and leaves him.\n\nThis amusing picture is plenty of slapdash and slapstick, displaying lots of laughs and silly gags. This third part with the deadpan, botcher Drebin, has been planned by ZAZ, : Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker. They&apos;re known satirists with successful work and longtime collaborators and made their own comedy troupe, the Kentucky Fried theater. The parody is hilarious, continuous and absurd , though sometimes is gross-out, but some moments here and there also is intelligent and bold. However lacks the freshness of its predecessors, two prequels titled ¨From the filed of Police Squad¨ and ¨The smell of fear¨. As always, the usual cinematographic references , being an entertaining to find them out, as the parody includes: ¨The untouchables(Brian De Palma)¨ and ¨The great escape(John Sturges)¨and prison films. Habitual cameos and long invited actors, such as, James Earl Jones, R.Lee Ermey, Rachel Welch,Morgan Fairchild, Mariel Hemingway, Pia Zadora, Elliot Gould, among them. The film is professionally directed by Peter Segal. The motion picture will like to Leslie Nielsen enthusiastic and lunatic humor buffs.",

He looks up, and sees....\n\nThis is overall an amazing comedy, which is really entertaining. This is my favourite Polish comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Lucio Fulci is most (in)famous for his ultra gory horror movies, such as Zombie Flesh Eaters, however, as with others such as his psychedelic giallo A Lizard in a Woman&apos;s Skin, this one shows once again that Fulci was in fact an excellent director. Sure, it does showcase the violence and brutality he is known for but it also is surprisingly emotional too, with actual three dimensional characters, which is hardly a given for this kind of thing. The story has four petty criminals meet in a jail and then trek across the desert, where they encounter various obstacles including a very sinister Charles Manson like bandit played excellently by Tomas Milian. The storyline and characters mainly avoid the typical spaghetti western cliches, with Fabio Testi&apos;s central character pretty far removed from the usual loner with incredible weapons skills. Also atypical is the score which is nothing like a Morricone bells and whistles affair, surprisingly it sounds more like Pink Floyd! This one also has a good turn from Lynne Frederick as one of the title characters, along with No Blade of Grass, Phase IV, Vampire Circus and Schizo this one makes up the Lynne Frederick 70&apos;s cult quintet.",

Robbin Givens and the newscaster looked a bit pleased to be seen in anything, but the rest of the cast seemed to be in pain (understandably). Heinricksen appears to have a hemorrhoid problem during his FBI review, or maybe he is just looking for the stage exit door to escape his agreement to do this film. It seems every opportunity was taken to waste chances to choose logical, practical, entertaining or otherwise valuable approaches to each scene. Some of the most ludicrous: seats with no harnesses, Star Wars fighting within the blood vessels, a terrorist who wakes up but does not even flinch during during several deep needles in the neck as he pretends to sleep, and the entire &apos;deactivation&apos; of the detonator scene! Why did Zabka leave Mr. Miagi behind--we needed him to kick this one into the trash!"

      "reviewBody": "Quality comedies -- if they go beyond one sequel -- never come in  threes. In the case of &quot;Little Fockers,&quot; three&apos;s a Focking mess. But we  asked for it; &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; ranks as the highest-grossing  live-action comedy in the U.S., so regardless of quality, we were going  to get whatever studios served us. And sure enough, &quot;Little Fockers&quot;  cooks up tired modern gags, basically forgetting that the last decade  of comedy (including its two predecessors) ever existed and that we  could be won over by open mentions of sex (ooh!) and recycled dick drug  gags.  It&apos;s several years later and Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri  Polo) live in Chicago with their twins, Henry and Samantha. Grandpa  Jack Byrnes (De Niro) has grown concerned over the Byrnes family legacy  as he&apos;s been having some heart issues lately and his first son-in- law,  Dr. Bob, has failed him after having an affair and getting a divorce.  As such, before he and wife Dina (Blythe Danner) arrive for the twins&apos;  birthday, he tells Greg that he&apos;s ready to pass the torch to Greg,  who&apos;s eager but still scared about winning Jack&apos;s full approval and  becoming &quot;The Godfocker.&quot;  The film focuses on Jack and Greg again, as expected, so among other  faults, the title &quot;Little Fockers&quot; is misleading. The kids are hardly  in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they&apos;re neither cute nor  talented. In a family dinner scene where Greg (with &quot;Godfather&quot; music  in the background) commands that Henry eat his lasagna, Henry succumbs  but then spews vomit all over his father. Whenever the film seems to  breeze about with a bit more of a sense of humor, a tasteless joke  shoots in that prompts us to do the same.   Contrivances and predictable story lines litter &quot;Fockers&quot; and damper  the occasional moments of humor. The familiarity we have with Greg and  Jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist,  but the script leans on typical &quot;misunderstanding&quot; plot devices, most  of which were ironically used most effectively in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;  and &quot;Meet the Fockers.&quot; The whole idea of &quot;if they worked once they&apos;ll  work again&quot; does not apply. The &quot;twists&quot; of this film are set up so  conspicuously that as they unfold, it&apos;s like you know what happens  because you&apos;ve seen it before. And you likely have, because there was  probably something similar in it from a previous &quot;Focker&quot; film.  Outside of Jack spying on Greg, who tries to keep it a secret that he&apos;s  trying to make extra cash by pushing a new erectile dysfunction drug  for a gorgeous drug rep (Jessica Alba), all the side characters and  plots are garbage. Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and the running joke  other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he&apos;s in love with  Pam, which never amounts to anything. Alba over-ditzifies her part,  which should have been played by a nameless attractive woman, proving  she has no idea how to shake her type.  Even Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand) are out of place,  squeezed in to appease the audience who expects them to show up. It&apos;s  actually unfortunate, because neither of them totally overdo their part  or annoy us with the fact that despite the same thing happening for the  third film in a row now, no one&apos;s learned their lesson. Greg actually  catches Jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of  knowing each other, Greg doesn&apos;t confront him. Sure this was for the  sake of keeping the tension up, but at some point you can&apos;t keep  milking the same goat, or cow, or cat. Yes, Jinxie returns, also with a  convenient line of dialogue from Wilson who says &quot;I had her brought in  town for you when I heard about your heart,&quot; just to set up another pet  mischief joke that&apos;s completely out of place at the end of the film.  Basically, we&apos;re Focking tired. &quot;Little Fockers&quot; is simply another  example of a movie concept that&apos;s run its course and should have never  gone beyond two films and only did because of the money. In a sense,  there should be no surprises here. Then again, attempted jokes such as  young Henry randomly asking if girls poop from their vaginas at the  dinner table, could have been replaced with something more thoughtful  -- and tasteful.  ~Steven C",

      "reviewBody": "The great master of the French cinema, Alain Resnais, has produced this bizarre, brilliantly made and intensely surrealist &apos;crazy masterpiece&apos;. It is based upon a novel entitled &apos;l&apos;Incident&apos; (&apos;The Incident&apos;) with which I am unfamiliar, so it is difficult to know how much of this film originated from the febrile brain of Resnais himself. The story and its treatment carry on the long-standing French traditions of two literary movements: surrealism and &apos;unanisme&apos;. The surrealist input is immediately obvious, because the story itself, although realistically portrayed, is inherently entirely surrealist. It begins with an &apos;incident&apos;, namely the theft of a purse from a woman who has been shopping in the Palais Royale in Paris. For several minutes we do not even see her face, but only the back of her head, and her face only appears for the first time floating in a bath. It was André Breton&apos;s famous surrealist novel &apos;Nadja&apos; which focused the minds of the entire French intelligentsia upon the importance of chance events which lead to chains of further complications and create a whole alternative future to that which might have been. (Kieslowski and other film directors have exploited this motif in numerous films.) This story commences in just such a way. And then further chance events ensue, such as the man finding the stolen purse and becoming obsessed with the woman who owned it, especially because she has a pilot&apos;s licence in the purse and he is obsessed by airplanes and female solo pilots. The influence of &apos;unanisme&apos; on this story is shown by the intense portrayals of only tiny portions of the backgrounds, stories, and motives of the characters, with the emphasis being given to them acting as a group, and we the viewers being left to imagine the rest. In other words, exposition is below the minimum, and we never do learn what is wrong with all these crazy people, and it is their interrelations which dominate. These techniques were above all pioneered and demonstrated by the French novelist Jules Romains, who founded the literary movement known as &apos;unanisme&apos;. Having read 27 novels by Romains, I have more than a passing familiarity with his work. It has been more influential than people tend to realize. It must be kept firmly in mind that this Resnais film contains a great deal of gnomic humour and sly jokes. It is not meant to be taken any more seriously than life itself. Some of the references are incomprehensible, as they are doubtless meant to be: why do we keep seeing the camera moving over swaying wild grass in a field? Why do we see so many pavement cracks with tufts of wild grass growing out of them? We shall never know. Many of the shots, editing, compositions, angles, and moods are so outstanding that we can see clearly that Resnais has lost none of his genius in his long career. As always, much in this film is never meant to be explained, but is only suggested, and we can make of it what we will. All of the leading characters are eventually shown to be seriously mentally unbalanced, and I take this as Resnais&apos;s view of humanity generally. And who can say he is wrong? There is a lot to be said for the theory that everybody is insane. That would then explain everything about the world. In fact, the only sane person in this film seems to be the little girl who asks about the cat munchies. And we do not even know who she is. This film is funny, sad, shocking, upsetting, provocative, thoughtful, disturbing, incomprehensible, deeply meaningful, irrational, profound, and many other things besides, but why use up all the adjectives when there is a compulsively fascinating movie to watch instead.",

      "reviewBody": "I familiar with Zinnemann&apos;s last five movies and am a great fan of his last one &quot;Five days one summer&quot;, which has received more undeserving brickbats than bouquets from some wellknown critics. It is evident to me that Zinnemann was more &apos;sinned against than sinning.&apos; After seeing &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot;, I am convinced that this man was never given given his due recognition because he was so different from his peers.\n\nThe story of &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; is narrated by a dead man. For us in the current decade having seen films like &quot;The Others&quot; such a script as this one is not uncommon. But in the Forties, this must have been groundbreaking.\n\nThe casting is superb. Spencer Tracy is fascinating and a superb choice. This is one of his finest performances--because he does not speak much--just like &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock.&quot;\n\nAgnes Moorehead appears for a few minutes but presents a delightful character that adds to the strength of the film. I thought Russ Tamblyn was the acrobat who does not speak a single line but the IMDb records indicate that I am mistaken. Was I? Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy were a delight to watch as always. The character of Signe Hasso (Toni) is probably the least appropriate character in the film but one guesses that necessity for a love interest for the lead character in a film like this. \n\nFor me the actors played a major part in making the film a wonderful viewing experience. But the real contributors to making the work impressive were Zinnemann and the cinematographer Karl Freund. The opening sequence showing the faces of the escapees establish the credibility of the two gentlemen behind the camera. The camerawork of Freund is always interesting but this film shows the chemistry between director and cinematographer.\n\n Zinnemann&apos;s choice of subjects to film has always made me wonder about the man. It is evident that he was a very sensitive person who valued great ideals. He was probably heartbroken that his last film was not accepted as much as his other work based on popular novels and plays.",

When the movie opened in 1983 and I watched the opening scene, I was drawn in and hooked! \n\nEverything about this movie seemed perfect (except the acting).  The locations were great.  The colors and lighting in the film were great.  And the fight scenes were fantastic.\n\nI just purchased the DVD to see how well this has held up through the years, and I must say it has held up quite well.  I didn&apos;t even remember this movie being so bloody and violent (I had to quickly usher the &quot;under 10&quot; crowd away from the TV).  Even by today&apos;s standards, this movie holds on tight to its &quot;R&quot; rating for violence. There is very little profanity and very little sex in this film.\n\nIt&apos;s funny that a movie with such good production values would have such bad acting.  I mean some of the lines in this movie are delivered so badly I had to laugh out loud.  And the &quot;thugs&quot; in the park look  like the Village People!\n\nHonestly though, this is, in my opinion, a great action movie.  And the characters, in spite of bad acting, are quite likeable (or hateful, whichever appropriate for the character).\n\nI also thought the music track was excellent, and doesn&apos;t really sound dated now like a lot of early 80&apos;s movies.\n\nI recommend this movie with eight out of ten stars."

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know, even after many years this one is still controversial. I think it&apos;s cooled down a lot with another &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film being released since this one. The original 1984 movie is kind of a &quot;lightning-in-a-bottle&quot; type deal. The sequel with the original cast altogether wasn&apos;t that great. The &quot;Force Awakens&quot; style Hollywood nostalgia money grab wasn&apos;t pretty mediocre. This remake is awful. You can make a movie like &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; or &quot;Back to the Future&quot; that just has a very original plot and concept, and no matter how badly you want the dollars that came with it, it&apos;s always gonna be a hollow attempt.\n\nMan, this one is very bad though. Like almost insufferably obnoxious and stupid. It&apos;s disappointing because I honestly have nothing bad to say about any of the people who worked on the film. I liked a lot of the cast members in other projects like &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Office.&quot; Chris Hemsworth is really funny, but they didn&apos;t even try to give us any chemistry between him and Kristin Wiig like they were teasing throughout the whole film. Not even anything like a funny joke. Just short little jokes about how sexy she thought he was or something.\n\nThe story is more or less a retread of the original&apos;s plot points, but I can at least give them the complement that it&apos;s a different one? Like at least not a beat-for-beat remake? Kristin Wiig&apos;s character is the only Ghostbuster that I liked, all three of the other ones really got on my nerves and the actresses all seemed like they were trying way too hard to just force jokes that didn&apos;t come naturally. I was laughing at some points, but at most of the others they just fell completely flat on their face.\n\nReally terrible special effects and awful jokes mixed with extremely obnoxious forced attempts at poop and queef humor (yes there was a terrible queef joke in this that obviously went over like a wet fart) made this one incredibly hard to watch. And for that reason I would only recommend this movie to those with a very high level of curiosity or if you&apos;re a &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; fanatic, which I guess by this point most of them have already made up their minds on the 2016 version. It gets relegated to a footnote in movie history, like &quot;hey remember back in 2016 when they tried to remake &apos;Ghostbusters&apos; with an all-female cast?&quot; That&apos;s really all there is to it.",

      "reviewBody": "Martin Scorsese once famously said he does one movie for the studio and one for himself, and so do many other directors or actors (George Clooney admits he did Ocean&apos;s Thirteen because that way he could do Michael Clayton next). Although Anne Hathaway hasn&apos;t explicitly said she does that, one can assume it&apos;s the only rational explanation for a piece of anti-cinematic trash like Bride Wars. Shooting The Devil Wears Prada after Brokeback Mountain is one thing, tainting your Oscar-nominated legacy with this bunch of nonsense is another.\n\nAnd yet it sounded like it could be a lot of fun, at least judging by the premise, which reverses the classic wedding stereotype: women are in it for the romance, guys are game because it&apos;s fun (that&apos;s what they make it look like in American comedies, anyway). This time around, the dudes are in it for the love, and the girls want to get married just to make a childhood dream come true. Apparently, if you&apos;re a woman and live in Manhattan, the ultimate dream of your life is to get married at the Plaza in June, so when best friends Liv (Kate Hudson with a Paris Hilton/Britney Spears haircut) and Emma (Hathaway) get asked the fundamental question by their beaus, they immediately try to book the right place and date. A mix-up occurs, and so they&apos;re both stuck with the same date, June 6th. Neither wants to postpone what&apos;s supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, therefore a full-on war is declared on both parts.\n\nAt this point, the real silliness kicks in: diet sabotage, tans gone awry and the occasional witty remark, like &quot;Your wedding&apos;s gonna be huge, just like your ass at prom&quot;. What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.\n\nIn fairness, no one ever expected any true brilliance from Hudson, given the last really good movie she appeared in was Cameron Crowe&apos;s Almost Famous in 2000, but surely someone could have told Hathaway you just don&apos;t choose something this bland after working with Jonathan Demme (or Ang Lee, for that matter). Maybe she wanted to return to her comedic roots, but sadly there&apos;s nothing even remotely funny in Bride Wars, save for a few brief scenes featuring the reliable Candice Bergen. Everything else is just like Liv and Emma: obsessed with getting everything right, but ultimately too self-centered to get any sympathy from others.",

This film is so far beyond the fifties horror B movie in its adaptation, that it plays everything for comedy. The dialogue is so stilted and the interactions of the characters so unnatural that we forget the plot as they pose and speak. Of course, the monster is utterly ridiculous, looking like it is made out of scraps from someone&apos;s sewing basket. I enjoyed it at first and thought it would develop, but it lost me and I just wanted it to end.",

Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear very much in this film, but the staring actors are very good. There is only an English dubbed version available in the US, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The cinematography, by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also excellent, and also lensed by Storarro.",

Never before released in the UK and unavailable worldwide on DVD until now, this exclusive re-build edit, which restores previously lost scenes, is not to be missed.\r\nIn this masterful, surreal and extraordinary film, Florinda Bolkan (Flavia The Heretic) plays Alice, a young translator who finds the real world slowly merging with her nightmares as she tries to solve her memory loss of the past few days. A postcard leads her to the island of Garma where the people there not only seem to know her but also her vivid dreams of an astronaut left behind on the moon become steadily strongerÂ…\r\n\r\nDirected by Luigi Bazzoni (The Fifth Cord) and boasting chillingly atmospheric cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now), Footprints is the loneliest, most haunting and beautiful giallo you will ever see.\r\n\r\nFootprints (aka Le Orme) (cert. 18 Â– overall DVD rating) is released uncut on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment.

Still, this movie is a must for everyone who wants to learn more about the difficult situation in Chiapas, Mexico.  The bravery and creativity of the indigenous people in this area of Mexico is breathtaking.  They have managed to tell the world their story, and survive the presence of the well-armed Mexican troops and paramilitary forces. &gt; It would take more than 1 1/2 hours to portray the Mexican government&apos;s &gt;repression of the indigenous population of Chiapas.  Still, some explanation &gt;would have been useful.  The director only explains these matters &gt;more or less in passing.  She  drops us into the middle of the maelstrom, shows us a lot of fantastic footage, and then ends the film as abruptly as she started it.  It is difficult to place the situation in Chiapas in a historic and economic context.\n\nThis is not a perfect documentary, but it needs to be seen.  I cannot think of any better way to learn about Chiapas, other than going to Chiapas and investigating the situation personally.\n\nNote:  Tom Hansen of the Mexico Solidarity Network spoke before and after the movie.  He is extremely knowledgeable about Chiapas. &gt;For a group showing, having Tom accompany the film would be a great asset.",

It would be wonderful to have a camera which sees the future. At the first half of the movie it was unbelievable that Ray (Niel Nitin Mukesh) from a poor man he became a rich man. But the bad part is that he used the camera for a greedy purpose. At least because of the evil people he learnt to put the camera for good use. But the movie had many parts where there were no connections and there was no clearty. Still I would rate it 8, because of the mystery. The movie was to the point too.",

Doesn&apos;t compete with the equally avant-garde feature length version made at the same time by Jean Epstein &amp; Luis Bunuel, yet stands well on its own. More of a tribute to UFA &amp; German Expressionism than an outright imitation, with specific nods to Caligari, Der Golem, and Faust. Visually rewarding for lighting, cinematography, sets, makeup. Compiled in a skewed fashion reminiscent of the structure of a nightmare. Captures the wonderfully gloomy, morbid atmosphere of Poe&apos;s work, the claustrophobic ambiance of &quot;Usher&quot; in particular. A treat for fans of the genre, in addition to being sufficiently unusual &amp; brief (just over 12 minutes) to hold the average viewer&apos;s attention. At one time, this film was available on an anthology videotape called &quot;American Avant-Garde&quot; along with the aforementioned &quot;Lot In Sodom.&quot; Great stuff if you&apos;re lucky enough to track it down.",

      "reviewBody": "Apocalypse Now is an interesting film, not because it is supposedly an anti-war film, but because it is surreal and shows an interesting journey into madness.\n\nMartin Sheen gives us an insight into his character here and we see the senselessness of the whole situation and how easy it is to lose yourself in certain situations.\n\nWe follow his journey and the various events that befall him and a small group of soldiers in a patrol boat traveling deep into the jungle. On their way, really bizarre things happen.\n\nAlong the way, we also see Robert Duvall in the role of a completely insane officer, whose episodic role has a profound impact on the film.\n\nThe film should essentially be anti-war, but it didn&apos;t strike me as such, but simply as a film about the fate of various people who found themselves in unusual situations.\n\nTheir whole mission doesn&apos;t really make sense, and in the end they accomplished nothing, but that&apos;s the point. Everything was really in vain.\n\nThe direction is excellent, the music is perfectly integrated into the film and matches the tone of the film.\n\nFor me, this is a film about the loss of reason and the journey to madness. If civilization completely collapses, and somewhere it has already collapsed a long time ago, this is roughly what we can expect, madness and insanity.\n\nI watched three versions of the film and I liked the Redux version the best.\n\nAn interesting and brutal journey into madness and darkness.",

Sketch Artist is actually far better than you would expect, for instance the film is downbeat and features characters who are cynical and willing to protect their own interests. Which brings us to our hero in Jeff Fahey who draws the picture wrong because he wants to keep his wife from being suspect. In real life things like this are not black and white, although people tend to find these antics unlikable it goes without saying that it gives more reality and dimension to a story that could be easily routine and transparent. While the story itself is routine, the story&apos;s downbeat angle and film noir style make this an interesting effort. A better than average TV movie if there ever was one.\n\n* * * out of 4-(Good)",

I remember part of the announcer&apos;s intro, because when my dad walked in and asked what was on, I said,&apos;some gangster movie&apos;, only recalling the word, gang. Some years later I realized that this was a somewhat accurate, though brief, look at Hitler&apos;s rise to power. Two scenes stick in my mind. Near the beginning, there is one where AH is a soldier in WWI with a handlebar mustache. He goes up to a mirror and cuts off the ends, creating the infamous &apos;toothbrush&apos; look. Later during his ascent, he walks into a beer hall with his followers, pulls a pistol out of his overcoat pocket, and fires a few shots into the air. The &apos;beer hall putsch&apos; ? Early forties, black and white. The actor REALLY had Hitler down pat.",

Although the film is as much about the holidays as Die Hard is, the Christmas holiday is the basis for the movie which revolves around the protagonists&apos; seemingly perfect relationship. It is rather nice to see a film where the main characters have a healthy relationship and how a slight snag can be what is necessary to make their relationship even stronger. As a romantic comedy, there are a few corny scenes but there are a few rather hilarious ones to keep the viewer laughing. Jon Favreau is in rare form giving us the best laugh of the movie. A light hearted enjoyable movie, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and a fun movie to watch with your significant other.",

I usually hate everything that the Sci-Fi channel sponsors but this one got my attention for some reason.\n\nThe acting isn&apos;t great but it isn&apos;t terrible either. I thought Jeffrey Combs was awesome and Matt McCoy was pretty good. Everyone else was average or worse. The story is pretty good and it was very interesting watching the special and seeing that influence came from Rear Window which is an all time favorite of mine. The gore was pretty sweet and I thought the creature looked pretty cool. I also enjoyed the ending. CHeck this one out for some B-movie fun!",

The Alphabet Killer doesn&apos;t disappoint in this respect. \n\nI&apos;ll admit, the start was pretty poor, I felt it was quite disjointed and it seemed as though a lot of scenes that should have been there to develop the plot were on the cutting-room floor. However, once we get into the middle and latter stages of the film, we definitely see a marked improvement.\n\nI think Eliza Dushku played her role well in this, and I felt the slant of Megan&apos;s mental illness playing such a large part in the story made her character more believable, and added interest to the film.\n\nOverall, this was a nicely put together film. It had little gore or anything really adult-themed, so if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after this isn&apos;t for you. If you want a killer movie portrayed more through the eyes of the main detective than is usual, you might like this. Yeah, you&apos;ll probably suss it out, but that&apos;s half the fun.",

      "name": "A very good comic book-ish film, and nothing more.",
      "reviewBody": "First of all, I&apos;ve never seen a Shinya Tsukamoto movie before this. I read reviews commenting on how this is his most unoriginal work, and I really can&apos;t confirm or deny that. As a standalone piece, however, I can say this is completely unlike any other detective movie I&apos;ve ever seenand it does so without cheese. On a technical level, does that make it original? Not necessarily, but it certainly isn&apos;t unoriginal either. Either way, it&apos;s very entertaining and interesting, and as I just said, lacks the cheese that the majority of supernatural horror films have lately.\n\nThe reason it lacks cheese is because Nightmare Detective builds up layers of gritty reality through mainly being a comic (but not comical) detective mystery. This gives a lot more weight to the supernatural elements, and creates a lot cooler tone. I&apos;ve seen people bash the detective elements of the story, but I personally thought they were genius. The idea of having two detectives, one a police detective and the other a dream detective working together was very cool. Like I said, the idea isn&apos;t wholesale original, but it&apos;s certainly different and very well done.\n\nShinya Tsukamoto&apos;s camera-work and cinematography left me in awe more than once. The man knows how to direct. The entire movie has the best production value I&apos;ve ever seen in an Asian movie, and I&apos;ve seen a lot of Asian movies. The detail is crisp, and sometimes with color washout that completed the gritty, dirty comic book tone. The dream sequences are not all-out surrealism as would be cliché, but have subtle nods at surrealism while being otherwise realistic. Once again, genius.\n\nI&apos;ve read reviews that trash this movie for not being scary. Simply put: what movie IS scary anymore? I&apos;ve seen hundreds of horror movies, and I can count the ones that were honestly scary on one hand. I can&apos;t compare this to Shinya Tsukamoto&apos;s other works, as I said, but from what I take, this is a step down on the level of terror. Fine. Why is that bad? A movie that exists only to be scary is just like a movie that exists just to be goryit&apos;s hallow. The Exorcist is quoted as &quot;the scariest movie of all time&quot;, but when I watched it I wasn&apos;t scared once. The thing is, the level of terror in a movie is mainly relative. Is Nightmare Detective scary? Some will think so. Did I? To an extent, yes.\n\nAs far as the acting goes, I didn&apos;t notice it being good or bad. As for the level of boredom, it isn&apos;t very fast paced but it will keep your interest until the end, which is something I can&apos;t say about many movies. Dialogue is standard, and never too excessive, which is another plus. The music is unoffensive and unnoticeable, except where Shinya Tsukamoto uses some really cool mellow songs to underline the mood, and it works very well.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s very much worth a watch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of mystery graphic novels, because it carries the same feel and flow. I&apos;d even go as far as to say it&apos;s worth a buy. It did what it wanted to accomplish, and even if Shinya Tsukamoto&apos;s other works are better than this, I don&apos;t see how anyone would be disappointed.\n\n4/10",

      "reviewBody": "This 1965 Italian western has many familiar faces among the cast; all do a good job, particularly Conrado Sanmartin as the elder pistolero, Duke, who forbids his friend Steve Blane from courting his daughter. Complications ensue, and eventually Duke and Steve are face to face on the main street of Providence (the same town Clint Eastwood cleaned up in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS). Most of the fun in this one is picking out the locations and identifying stock performers like Franco Ressel and Jose Calvo. Aldo Sanbrell shows up early as a bandido, and Tito Garcia is cast as the barkeep with a full head of hair for a change. The action is good, with the stuntmen earning their keep by crashing off of roofs and through remadas, and Blane&apos;s horse gives probably the best performance in the history of equine acting. Nico Fidenco&apos;s score is outstanding, although the vocal over the titles are a bit off-putting. The titles themselves are particularly flamboyant for a spaghetti, luridly painted cartoons that flirt with a fine art look. Overall I liked this one, I think seeing it in a nice widescreen print helped a lot.",

The music, the acting style, the lighting, the process shots and background paintings all give it a great look and feel. \n\nHowever, everything is so low key and downbeat that it fails to deliver any suspense or menace. What is essentially a modern thriller dressed as classic noir just isn&apos;t thrilling. The plot twist and turns but the drama is never heightened, the pace never seems to increase, it just plods along to its conclusion. \n\nApart from the sex and swearing, the actors seem straight jacketed into their roles by the 40&apos;s styling seemingly because the script lacks any of the dry wit and charm you&apos;d find in a genuine movie of this era. George Clooney for example has every little to do, his character has none of the snappy dialog you&apos;d expect, given his Marlowe-esquire role in the plot. Soderbergh compounds matters by drawing an unfortunate comparison with Bogart. Though generally the acting was of the high quality you&apos;d expect from such a sterling cast, it&apos;s difficult to empathise with their characters plights given the lack of suspense or melodrama.\n\nOverall the experiment fails to deliver anything other than a beautifully shot but unengaging film.\n\nVery disappointing.",

Six months later,Cruchot retires into mansion her rich wife(Claude Gensac) where lives a boring life. But comes his pal Marechal(Michael Galabru) remembering old times. Cruchot has a museum of records and both remember their nostalgics adventures in the Gendarmerie Nationale, as they memorize images from&apos;Gendarmes in N.Y, &apos; Gendarme get married&apos; and &apos;Gendarme at St Tropez&apos; when Lucien(Jean Lefebre) is obligated to nude himself for chasing nudists . When Lucien is interned in a clinic caused by lost memory, the group is reunited and then they go into action and impersonate again as gendarmes . The gendarmes outfit undergo several adventures,moving in disguise, dressing as hippies, smoking marijuana, and terminating into a hippie commune where everybody say: I love you.This time gendarmes aren&apos;t struggling with persistent nude swimmers but they protect them from parachuted gendarmes.Meantime they&apos;re pursued by real gendarmes and hid under a sheep flock. Besides the nuns who appeared previous episodes ask their help but five children have disappeared. Then the gendarmes wind up pursued by an atomic rocket.\n\nThis enjoyable French comedy upon the likable gendarmes packs crazy humor,lively situations amusement and too much fun. Louis De Funes, as always, stooges, grimaces and intense mocking faces . Highlights are the mimic gesticulation with a priest, and the conversation via whistle during a traffic jam. Again Claude Gensac,as Ludovic&apos;s spouse, she collaborated with Funes in numerous films, often playing his character&apos;s wife. Luminous local photography under St. Tropez&apos;s blue sky . Lively music score by Raymond Lefebre , includes the usual leitmotif , musical background in habitual ending parade.The picture is professionally directed and ingeniously written by customary director, Jean Girault.Another movies about Cruchot series are : ¨Gendarme of Saiz Tropez, Gendarme Get married, Gendarme and creatures of outer space and Gendarme and the Gendarmettes¨ , the last acting of the great Louis De Funes, an authentic farceur.",

Director Keita Amemiya definitely has a flair for this kind of stylistic filmmaking and the film looks great, although the pacing could be tightened up a bit.  What sets the film apart from so many others is the conviction and no-nonsense portrayal of the main character (Iria) by actress Yuko Moriyama.  She offsets the otherwise campy tone of the film and lends it some credibility.  Worth checking out if you&apos;re interested in a fun no-brainer sci-fi adventure stocked with girls, guns, gadgets, and monsters."

But more so about the objectification of kids by the school and by the parents. Even grief is not allowed cause you have to do good grades or you&apos;re more or less worthless. Its to much about status and grades and to little of what the kid really like and encourage that. Especially one of the kids are the parents status symbol and he have to represent the parents own imagined greatness (and when he can&apos;t match expectation life gets really hard for the kid ..who is kind of lost) \n\nWhen a kid wants another higher education than the parents had in mind, its obvious that the parents could just stop helping him, and they nearly do that in the documentary just cause its not the education they wanted their child to have (status and so on). It shouldn&apos;t be like that young people need help from the government and it shouldn&apos;t be expensive to study. Its not a good start in life cause higher education should be a way out of your home and being more independent. If your parents control you with money they could seriously influence you to take negative choices for yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "A travelogue of sorts that doubles as a brief but welcome insight into the filmmaking philosophy of famous Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky, Voyage in Time documents his travels in Italy in preparation for the making of his film Nostalghia, and is more a companion piece that finds him scouting locations with writer Tonino Guerra than an exploration of his cinematic style &amp; influences.\n\nWritten &amp; directed by both Guerra &amp; Tarkovsky, this 63 mins documentary presents the two artists discussing art, culture, history &amp; philosophy in addition to their views on the nature of cinema. But despite its short runtime, it somehow manages to be a slog with its vast stretches of nothingness. It&apos;s only captivating in bits n pieces, and those interesting parts together would&apos;ve sufficed as a featurette.\n\nThe best segments are the ones where Tarkovsky gets to answer the questions that were posed by his admirers. But there&apos;s like only three questions in total; one asking about the filmmakers he admires, second asking about his advice to young directors and final one being his stance on genres &amp; commercial cinema. He is very articulate &amp; honest in his replies and that&apos;s why it makes one wish there were more questions.\n\nOverall, Voyage in Time (also called Tempo di viaggio) neither has the behind-the-scenes footage of Andrei Tarkovsky nor a candid conversation with the director to dissect his body of work in depth. The camera hovers over images for far too long while the duo are engaged in discussions, and is dull, tedious &amp; uninspiring for the most part if not all. In short, this quasi-documentary is best reserved for Tarkovsky completists."

Django Strikes Again, is definitely not worthy of the original, but it is still an entertaining Action/Spaghetti Western genre mix. \n\nDjango, who calls himself &quot;Brother Ignatius&quot; now, has turned his back to violence and become a monk, living in a Mexican monastery, when a fatally ill former mistress tells him that he has a daughter and asks him to take care of the child after she&apos;s gone. The lady dies a short time later, and the daughter, along with other villagers, has been kidnapped by a ruthless gang of former Hungarian soldiers under the leadership of villainous Orlowski, a man who brutally enslaves Mexican civilians to drudge in a silver mine and forces women and little girls into prostitution, and is therefore referred to as &quot;El Diablo&quot; by the poor population. In order to rescue his daughter, &quot;Brother Ignatius&quot; has to return to his violent former ways and become &quot;Django&quot; again.\n\nThe story is not very imaginative, and the locations are a little bit too tropical for a Western, even though the movie is set entirely in Mexico, but Franco Nero&apos;s performance makes up for the movie&apos;s weaknesses. Made in 1987, 21 years after the original, &quot;Django Strikes Again&quot; is a mixture of a Spaghetti Western and a typical eighties action movie. It is certainly fun to watch, but it&apos;s certainly not a masterpiece like the original. Django Strikes Again may be the only official sequel, but it&apos;s certainly not the best. I&apos;ve seen &quot;Django&quot; sequels much better than this, but I&apos;ve also seen much worse. 6 out of 10 stars because of Franco Nero, the one and only original Django, who saves the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Its indeed great and also an appreciable act to go for something different and fresh in the present routine structure of our Hindi Films. But on the other hand, it&apos;s equally or even more important to ensure that the plot which looks like a winner on the paper, also gets transformed and executed on the screen in the best possible manner, providing a good return to the viewer for both his money and time spent.\n\nUnfortunately, Shirish Kunder&apos;s JOKER fulfils the first requirement reasonably but makes a complete mess in its second, involving the execution, presentation and overall impact of the movie which was rightly predicted by majority of people after watching its uninteresting &amp; patchy promos. In fact JOKER is one of those big movies which clearly reveal their weak points in the first few reels itself and then you exactly know that its not going to work in its subsequent reels too.\n\nThe film starts from abroad in the SWADES mode, wherein Akshay is forced to make a decision to visit India along with his live-in girlfriend Sonakshi. Now the moment they enter the zone of Pagalpur, you get served with some hard humor which starts falling flat with its each new gag delivered boringly. There are people falling from the trees, a man who thinks he is a lamp (reminding you of a teeth whitener advert), a teacher with a pretty bad English who believes that the IInd World War is still going on, a person who speaks gibberish (like Tushar in the GOLMAAl series) which eventually becomes the language of real aliens too and 3 clown like politicians who daringly ask for their cut sitting in their government offices only.\n\nIn straight words, after just 30 minutes into the film and an item song served in that duration only, one starts thinking about all the resources, efforts and hard work gone into its making just for nothing. Further it is also quite shocking to see that the film which had its whole promotion planned around the so called Aliens, does not have even a single scene or mention of them before the intermission and they actually reveal themselves in its second hour. Frankly that tells you a lot about the illogical and errant planning behind the making of this serious mistake aptly called JOKER.\n\nPost intermission, the disaster continues in a much bigger magnitude when the fake aliens are made with some vegetables, fruits and LEDs considering that there are fools sitting in the theater ready to accept anything. The whole screenplay post interval is simply pathetic making a mockery of almost everything around ranging from news channels, their reporters, government and military forces to the foreign officials investigating the aliens and the crop circles inspired from Manoj Shyamalan&apos;s SIGNS (2002). Moreover various scenes in the movie make you recall so many films together like SWADES, KOI MIL GAYA, LAGAAN, PEEPLI LIVE and even Spielberg&apos;s ET. Plus, the whole setting around some innocent (yet eccentric) villagers also reminds you of Akshay Kumar&apos;s earlier flop, TEES MAAR KHAN directed by Shirin&apos;s better half Farah Khan.\n\nIn the performance department only one person is able to make you laugh at times and he is Shreyas Talpade as Babban. But otherwise JOKER has its entire cast (with many known names in stupid minuscule roles), performing half-heartedly including the lead couple Akshay &amp; Sonakshi, as if they all perfectly knew that its not going to work in any case. And probably that was the reason Akshay was literally absent from its entire promotional campaign before its release.\n\nMusically it gives you nothing to write about as the soundtrack neither has any melody nor any good lyrics to win over the audience. Personally I even didn&apos;t like the heavily promoted item song &apos;Kafirana&apos; since it didn&apos;t fit on Chitrangda&apos;s persona at all. The songs honestly work as several loo-breaks which had to be included in the film because without them, it would be a 100 minutes venture only in totality. Background score fails to register in all those weird comic sequences and Cinematography remains helpless with such lackluster characters emoting on the screen. Also it was a pity to see that in such a big banner film, talking about aliens (the real ones too), the Computer Graphics were really below the mark like a low budget venture in its last sequence which even had the alien dancing along with Shreyas. Now did the makers really expect the viewers to laugh out loud on that silly alien dance without any sense?\n\nAnyway, in all JOKER can easily be termed as a poor or bizarre film made on an interestingly fresh plot which had enough space for a good comedy and many innovative enjoyable sequences in its storyline. The film majorly is a disappointment due to its mediocre and awful treatment (including the script, execution or direction) which takes the plot too lightly in an over-confident manner and fails to deliver in the end. As a matter of fact, JOKER can be perfectly used to prove these Cinematic Truths that &apos;The Director is always the real captain of the ship undeniably&apos; and &apos;What seems to be good on the paper might not be equally good or entertaining on the screen&apos;.",

Praja is one of those movies that you can never quite get enough of. It is very realistic. Don&apos;t watch it if you are used to some romantic fantasy movie which is very common in bollywood movies and the terrible malayalam movies of today.\n\nRenji Pancker and Joshy have done a great tremendous job. This is one of the very best movies in malayalam cinema history. It is also one of the very best performances of Mohanlal. Shammi Thilakan&apos;s character as &quot;Balaraman&quot; was also very noticeable and highly acclaimed. Renji Panicker is a journalist who sends his message, the truth, through awe-inspiring movies like Praja, Pathram, Mafia, Thalasthanam, Commissioner, etc. The other reviewer on here doesn&apos;t even know who renji panciker or who joshy is."

The new guy Daniel Bernhardt does a good job.\n\nFight Scenes:  The fights are well done and the actors are athletic.\n\nMusic:  Sounds somewhere in between Mortal Kombat and salsa dancing music.\n\nPhilosophy: To own something one must earn it, not steal it...or maybe both?\n\nConclusive Thoughts: The characters are not as interesting, one guy had clown style makeup on while fighting the first female warrior allowed in the tournament. The fight scenes with the generic fighters combined with the Mortal Kombat Salsa music worked well together. A backstory for some of the tournament fighters would make it more interesting and would add some plot depth.",

Noomi Rapage is great in the role of a young mother on the verge of mental breakdown.. As in many new age horror movies we have a mother moving into a suburban ghetto apartment, after having troubles with her ex husband abusing their son (just like in Dark water).. She hears some strange screams on her baby alarm, and the story starts to unfold.. The atmosphere and the puzzle is well made, but the plot to easy figure in big terms.. Screenplay and acting is good.. Story a bit too mainstream for my taste, but still thrilling at times for sure.. Noomi Rapage does a very good job, lots of tension.. The sceneries and the suspense works, but I missed a little originality to the story.. But bottom line, and enjoyable ride, that could have been better with a more simply story.. A little too many threads for it own good.. Still i give it 7 cause, its well done and I am a sucker for subttle slow semi horror movies...",

They spoke just like Italian people talk if you were brought up like this you will totally understand why you are the way you are They were just like my grandparents. Listening to them tell stories brought me back to the days I miss so much I could watch them for hours. I would listen to my aunts and uncles talk for hours (drinking wine and espresso)telling these stories never ending stories .. The stories were intriguing. I really felt like I belonged in this family. There&apos;s something about Marty&apos;s Mom and Dad that relaxing they can be your own parents what a gift I stumbled across.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a tricky decision the you have to make when you choose to do a film examining the controversial elements of an industry.\n\nYou have to choose whether to fix the film in a place and time, and discuss real historical events, or to allow the film to examine broader topics through fictional constructs, thus freeing the movie to be timeless.\n\nBoth choices can be fraught with peril, and Sally Potter braves those waters with Rage, choosing to create a fictional context for examining the class disparity, sweatshops, and unrealistic beauty standards that are at the heart of most of the Fashion Industry&apos;s major controversies.\n\nPotter uses a bare-bones film technique, fixing a camera at a green screen, and shooting a series of documentary-style still-camera interviews with actors playing fashion industry archetypes.\n\nThere is a fundamental premise, and a story arc complete with acceptably dramatic events of a shocking nature, but these are neither compelling, nor believable in any context. The story here is secondary, and is a means to an end.\n\nThis film is, essentially, an acting exercise. It is an opportunity for Sally Potter and her actors to explore a character&apos;s arc in the broader context of a (largely silly and contrived) fashion industry disaster.\n\nThe film never answers any of the poignant questions it asks, and it never really allows any one character to follow a satisfying arc (with the possible exception of Jude Law&apos;s character, the high point).\n\nFor the most part, theatre and film geeks will enjoy the effort, if not the execution, but mainstream film-goers will be bored to tears inside of five minutes.",

But then again there are some just plain and dull outings and for me this European stint &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot; fell in to this group. Seagal feels like nothing more than a bit player and a bored one too. Spending more time sitting about, pondering, having a heartfelt chats or if he has to - walking from &apos;a to b&apos; to shoot someone or casually crack some bones. So when it comes to the explosive bursts, they do lack any sort of punch or adrenaline despite the seedy scene. Here he plays a streetwise American Interpol agent assigned to a drug / weapon trafficking task force in Eastern Europe. This is one rather generic action drama, which thinks it&apos;s tough, but comes across as violently spiteful and sluggishly paced with a bogged down script. The director keeps it rather kinetic with the filming techniques, being slickly dressed up with sped up visuals, slow motion and titled camera angles. The performances are nothing to write home about, but the cast do acquit themselves well enough. Not terrible, but a very ho-hum Seagal vehicle.\n\n&quot;I like your style&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "STUCK is one of those films that creeps up on you, teases you into thinking a comedy is in the making, then slowly reveals itself as what seems to be an exposé of our current manner of getting through life, of competing in the workplace, and of self absorption to the point of endangering those around us. The fact that the film is based on a true story as adapted by director Stuart Gordon and transformed into a bitingly satirical screenplay by John Strysik increases the impact of this well-crafted little low budget film. Watch it once for the gritty content of the story, then watch it again to appreciate all of the very dark (and very pointed!) humor in what at first appears to be a grisly tale. \n\nBrandi Boski (Mena Suvari) works as a Nurse&apos;s Aid in a nursing home of senile elderly patients, giving some of the finest care for those entrusted to her talents. Brandi&apos;s compassionate work is noted by the supervisor Peterson (Carolyn Purdy-Gordon) who manages to trick Brandi into an even heavier work schedule by suggesting a raise in position. Excited about her possible promotion Brandi and her working partner Tanya (Rukiya Bernard) celebrate that evening with Brandi&apos;s boyfriend/drug supplier Rashid (Russell Hornsby) who gives Brandi a pill of Ecstasy and the mixture of the drug with the alcohol creates a mess of Brandi&apos;s mind. \n\nThe parallel story involves one jobless Thomas Bardo (Stephen Rea) who lives in a tenement, is evicted because of past due rent, and becomes a street person, treated with cold (but satirical) mechanical responses at the Department of Unemployment. Left to sleep in the park he is befriended by another homeless person, given a shopping cart, and makes his way toward a midnight mission. \n\nBrandi cum altered thought processes drives home, hits Thomas who comes sailing through her windshield badly injured, and out of fear and distress Brandi merely takes the &apos;stuck&apos; Thomas home to park him in her garage, knowing that her boyfriend Rashid will help her. Thomas is conscious, unable to climb out of the glass of the crushed windshield and begs for help. How the stranded and injured Thomas is treated by the desperate but self-centered Brandi, by the frightened but macho Rashid, and by neighbors who fear intervention because of reporting an incident that would encourage police intervention and threaten their deportation as illegal immigrants results in an ending that shows how &apos;justice&apos; can prevail! \n\nThe cast is first rate - especially Rea, Suvari, Hornsby and Bernard. The direction is tight and maintains credible characters in incredible situations and holds the audience attention every moment. This is a fine example of how a low budget film, in the hands of pros, can be more successful that the big budget, less thoughtful movies that crowd our marquis. Grady Harp",

The film is by Sanrio - the giant corporation that brought us Hello Kitty, and who were making films at that time in emulation of Disney. Hani, a director with some cult films under his belt, was presumably told to go to Africa and make something with lots of cute animals. There are animals galore - nothing but animals in fact for about half of the two-hour film - beautiful photography throughout - and that gives it an atmosphere all its own.\n\nThe pace is mesmerisingly slow and at times it feels like Clare Denis. There&apos;s a beautiful teenage girl (billed only as Kathy) living with her reclusive grandfather (Stewart) in the forest on the edge of the savannah. The dim light inside their lodge is gorgeous. Lots of cute animals roam in and out - a kind of Daktari Monogatari.\n\nA light aircraft crashes in the wilderness and after a desperate time, including getting caught in an impressive wildfire, the survivor comes across the girl, who is given to wandering around with hippy joie-de-vivre among the lions and wildebeest. The old man repels the new arrival at first but after a further disaster - a rainstorm, even more impressive - reaches rapprochement. The whole things seems to convey an existential message.\n\nThe acting though is awful - Stewart looks uncomfortable when he speaks to someone and gets silence in return - and the storyline is bland, but the girl with her husky voice is winning and the animals about the house, including Tikki the mongoose - who gets a tragic moment - are great. It&apos;s a children&apos;s film, but there&apos;s none of Disney&apos;s archness and preachiness, only a quiet, drifting, philosophical melancholy that weaves a memorable spell. This would have been my favourite film for a while, as a 12 year-old."

I don&apos;t remember the last time I laughed that hard and for that long! Also, I noticed two references to other horrors movies in there--Halloween, when the nun walks up to the little girl in the graveyard she has on the Michael Myers mask. And when the nun walks up to the girl in the desk in that flashback scene she spews green stuff on her (The Exorcist.) This movie will have you in tears laughing! (Well it did for at least me, my sister, and my aunt!) I also think it was the director&apos;s intention to make it campy fun I dunno if he intended it to be an actual horror film.\n\nOr maybe he did and knew that it&apos;d turn out to be a crappy D horror flick so he went crazy with the budget and script! I found this extremely entertaining and gave it a 7!",

Nicole Kidman is excellent, given the material, though her transition from likeable, virtuous innocent to a cold and corrupted woman doesn&apos;t ring as true as it should--the three years glossed over with a subtitle isn&apos;t adequate to show the change.  I blame this on the interpretation, direction, and/or editing rather than Kidman&apos;s performance, however. Malkovich is not as strong, and one wonders what any woman could see in him as a lover. \n\nThe ending is cold and unsettling.  Most filmgoers prefer to know that their hero/heroine is &quot;safe&quot; at the end of the story.  Here, who knows ?\n\nProduction values are good, and the film is quite stylish with interesting use of camera tilt, lighting, and angles.  It&apos;s quite artsy.  I am glad I saw the film, but acknowledge it&apos;s not likely to be everyone&apos;s cup of tea.",

      "reviewBody": "1934&apos;s &quot;Girl O&apos; My Dreams&quot; was among Monogram&apos;s entries in the &apos;campus musical&apos; genre, so popular in the 30s and 40s, best exemplified by Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, or later Donald O&apos;Connor and Peggy Ryan. While much of the cast are familiar to their roles, its truly a revelation to find 28 year old Lon Chaney Jr. in what amounts to the starring role, billed for the last time under his real name, &apos;Creighton Chaney.&apos; As Don Cooper, star shot putter and discus thrower for Rawley College, Chaney beats out hotshot track star Larry Haines (Eddie Nugent) for the title of &apos;Joe Senior,&apos; after which he suddenly begins to act more like Haines in his girl chasing, neglecting his athletics. Will Rawley still triumph over Stanford in the thrilling competition finale? Need you ask? Sure comic performers like Sterling Holloway, Arthur Lake, and Tom Dugan do not disappoint, though the girls (apart from the Crane twins, Beverly and Betty Mae) are almost invisible. Brunette Gi-Gi Parrish is Chaney&apos;s girl, Mary Carlisle the blonde who uses him to make Haines jealous (the twins are called &apos;Nip and Tuck!&apos;). Best of all, halfway in we get to actually hear Creighton Chaney sing atop a piano, and not badly either. His voice isn&apos;t as deep as John Carradine&apos;s, but he could have made a &apos;basso profundo&apos; (this basso sang a song 30 years before &quot;Spider Baby&quot;). Unfortunately, the tune ends abruptly by the untimely arrival of music teacher E. Phlatt, played by Olaf Hytten, familiar as the little girl&apos;s father opposite Chaney&apos;s Lonster in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein.&quot; Most incredibly, the director was Raymond McCarey (brother of Leo), and the writer George Waggner, who years later brought Lon Chaney to Universal, scripting and directing his debut for the studio, &quot;Man Made Monster,&quot; and producing and directing his iconic classic &quot;The Wolf Man.&quot;",

However, the human element of the story (i.e what Bullington&apos;s daughter has to go through, the dear sweet ol&apos; actress Bullington holds captive, and the mass evacuation of London) is not lost for a millisecond.  Superb acting (Especially by Morell and Jones) and writing.  Do not miss!!"

      "reviewBody": "While fighting to enter in the theater where the press screening of the Roma Film Festival took place I hadn&apos;t great expectations for this film. The trailer looked so bad. More, I have never been much confident in Richard Gere&apos;s acting talents, but I must admit: in this film he proved me wrong. Appearing in almost every scene, not handsome as ever (he changed his hairline and his nose to look more like to the real Irving) Gere gives at last a good performance. I discovered he&apos;s also pretty good doing impressions - he does a great Howard Hughes, whose photos are constantly shown in the film and who, by the way, doesn&apos;t at all look like Di Caprio. Alfred Molina is also very good - hilariously funny, he&apos;s the best part in the movie. As for the supporting cast, there are pleasant cameos by Stanley Tucci and Eli Wallach. As for Richard Gere, I wasn&apos;t much confident in Lasse Hallström too - I found most of his films rather sappy. He did a good job in the Hoax though. The film has a nice &quot;70s&quot; look, with appropriate cinematography and a nice soundtrack as well. The one thing that didn&apos;t thoroughly convince me was the script: it started pretty well, but past the middle of the film it kinda loses its way and becomes more confused and repetitive. Still, a nice film. Gere fans, I&apos;m sorry you will have to wait, since the opening in USA has been postponed to April, but the wait will be worth it. My rating is 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "THE LOVE ETERNE (aka LIANG SHAN-PO AND CHU YING-TAI) is a 1963 Hong Kong operetta based on the oft-filmed classic story, &quot;Liang Shan-Po And Chu Ying-Tai,&quot; aka &quot;The Butterfly Lovers.&quot; It offers sumptuous color filming on lavish Shaw Bros. studio sets and tells its love story in a combination of dialogue and song, focusing on a pair of students at a university in Hangchow, one, Chu Ying-Tai, a female disguised as a man in order to gain entry into the school and the other an older fellow student, Liang Shan-Po.\n\nYing-Tai falls in love with Shan-Po and, when she has to leave school after three years, tries to drop hints in song that she&apos;s really a female as the clueless boy accompanies her part of the way on her memorable trip home. Eventually, he gets the picture but by then her family has already promised her to someone else, setting the stage for a tear-jerking finale. This is the film that Ang Lee, director of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, chose to watch with reporter Rick Lyman when he was the subject of an installment of the &quot;Watching Movies&quot; series in The New York Times (March 9, 2001).\n\nThe stars of the 127-minute film are Le Di (touted in the DVD cast notes as Hong Kong cinema&apos;s &quot;one and only &apos;Classical Beauty&apos;&quot;) in the role of Chu Ying-Tai and Ivy Ling Po (aka Ling Bo), one of Shaw Brothers&apos; top female stars of the time, in the male role of Shan-Po. They&apos;re both quite captivating, whether in the straight dramatic and comic interactions of the spoken dialogue or the operetta-style singing to each other in the more intimate scenes. The camera is usually focused on the two lead performers so the success of the film depends greatly on their expertise in conveying believably the strong emotions of the intense love story, particularly in the latter stage of the film where Ying-Tai&apos;s family has effectively blocked the young pair&apos;s budding romance. Ling Po&apos;s turn as a heartbroken young man in the throes of an emotional breakdown is quite wrenching and most convincing.\n\nIvy Ling Po often played young men in Chinese Opera-based Shaw Bros. films of the era, most notably THE GRAND SUBSTITUTION (1965), a tale of court politics and family loyalty in Old China. The actress can also be seen as a female swordswoman in TWIN SWORDS (1965), starring Jimmy Wang Yu. Both films are also reviewed on this site.\n\nThe songs in LOVE ETERNE are quite pleasing and the orchestrations, making use of traditional instruments, quite evocative of Chinese Opera. The score does not use the famed &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot; violin concerto, which figures prominently in a later film version of the same story, THE LOVERS (1994), directed by Tsui Hark and starring Nicky Wu (a male actor) as Liang Shan Po and Charlie Young (an actress) as Chu Ying-Tai. The characters don&apos;t sing in Hark&apos;s film, leaving the scriptwriters more time to pack the film with plot and incident and make it much more intense. They tell the same story but they&apos;re two different kinds of films, with the older one drawing more explicitly on Chinese theatrical traditions while the newer film is a little punchier and designed to spruce up the tale for modern youth appeal.\n\nThe Taiwanese DVD available for review was made from a print with very good color values but transferred with too much cropping--on all four sides. The cropping at the bottom of the frame is designed to cover up the original burned-in Chinese subtitles and provide a space to put the new, removable subtitles. That said, it should be pointed out that much of the camera-work consists of closeups of the two leads rather than the widescreen action compositions featured in so many Shaw Bros. films that suffer from cropping when transferred to tape. Also, unlike those tape transfers, the subtitles in LOVE ETERNE are all clear and wholly visible. As a result, this DVD offers one of the better transfers of an early HK film available in the U.S., although a new subtitled widescreen transfer would be most desirable.\n\nThe English title given on the DVD case is THE SHAN-PO AND CHU YING-TAI.\n\nADDENDUM (April 6, 2010): Since doing this review, the film has come out, under the title LOVE ETERNE, in a restored, remastered Region 3 DVD from Celestial Pictures as part of its massive Shaw Bros. restoration campaign. Watching the new DVD was like seeing it for the first time. It&apos;s a beautiful film and Ivy Ling Po&apos;s performance is breathtaking. Also since the original review, a Taiwanese animated version of the tale has come out on DVD, under the title THE BUTTERFLY LOVERS (2003). It has its good points, but is too Disney-influenced and kiddie-oriented for my tastes."

Save for one absurd image in the beginning, and the trope of interviews in different classrooms of a school, there is nothing comic here. Mr. Pilmark&apos;s character&apos;s smile on the cover of the video is misleading. Still, in the time of America&apos;s 45th president and in a time of compassion fatigue, what we do with the intractible problems of the least of us is worthy of discussion. This is not light though, and it is not funny.",

      "reviewBody": "JURASSIC PARK 3 / (2001) *** (out of four)\n\nBy Blake French:\n\n\t&quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; is not as good as the first but a whole lot better than the second. It&apos;s also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That&apos;s basically &quot;JP3&quot; in a nutshell. It&apos;s not necessarily a great movie, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn&apos;t inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. \n\n\tThe story takes place eight years after the incident at Jurassic Park. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) still works as a paleontologist on dinosaur dig sites in Montana with his young assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola). He&apos;s offered a good sum of money by a wealthy couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who want Grant to guild them on a flight over Isla Sorna-also owned by the dinosaur cooperation. Sam agrees, but once over the island, something goes wrong and he&apos;s once again stuck on the dinosaur infested territory fighting for his life.   \n\n\t&quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; is complied with stunning brevity. The dialogue is concise and doesn&apos;t wonder. The character&apos;s relationships are instantly obvious. It&apos;s very clear that this film is shorter, cheaper, and more simple than its predecessors. That is not such a bad thing. The second Jurassic Park was terrible-an all star cast placed in situation and situation where they run from big monstrous creatures. Although &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; is more or less the same formula, it gets sassy and fresh. Eye-popping special effects involve everything from a bird-dinosaur attempting to feed a human to its babies to a massive battle between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a new breed of lizard called Spinosaurus. Some of these scenes do not really work. Amazingly, many succeed. \n\nI have various complaints about the movie. There are not enough violent encounters to keep the audiences interested throughout. Unlike the first two films, the dinos in &quot;JP3&quot; only eat a handful of characters and they occur in the opening half hour. You can probably guess the characters who meet a graphic demise; anyone who is billed in the film&apos;s credits that you have heard of will probably live. I also think the movie needs more thrills. It seems as if the producers are more interested in proving to the audience that these dinosaurs are really smart rather than focusing on lean, clean terror.\n\nRegardless of the pictures many problems, during a summer movie season jam-packed with special effects extravaganzas that don&apos;t work (&quot;The Mummy Returns,&quot; &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;The Fast and he Furious,&quot; and &quot;Swordfirsh&quot; to name a few) finally comes one that does. I recommend &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; on the basis that you don&apos;t expect something remotely as fascinating as the original, but still hunger for a shallow 90 minute thrill ride.",
