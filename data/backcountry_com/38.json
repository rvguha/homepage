I haven&apos;t had issues with hot spots, but they do cause a bit of tingling if ratcheted too tightly. I use them for both gravel and XC mountain biking. \n\nMy experience with these shoes is that they are NOT true to size. I am a size 6.5 or 7 women&apos;s in some brands, and ended up returning the size 37 because they were too big. I had to order the size 36 through Specialized&apos;s website because they were the only ones that carried that small of a size.",

If you tighten the boa to try and keep the tongue from sliding down, you cut off your blood circulation. Horrible shoe!\n\nThank you Backcountry for allowing me to return them. This is why I shop Backcountry; they are a great company with an excellent return policy.",

        "reviewBody": "This shoe looks good and works well.  Overall, I am very happy with these shoes and give them 4 out of 5 stars.  Giving 4.5 might be more accurate.\n\nI have found that despite being stiff on the pedals, they are comfortable to walk in.  Though I&apos;ve not yet had to do a serious hike-a-bike, the soles look just wide enough to provide stability.  They&apos;re certainly more substantial than &quot;classic&quot; XC shoes.  More sneaker-like shoes will very likely be wider, especially at the heel.\n\nThe Boa lacing has worked well and did not loosen over the course of rides.  Break-in time for riding is quick - my fifth use of them was a seven hour ride and I had no pressure nor sore points.  For walking, the shoe might need more time to fit like old blue jeans.\n\nWith regard to sizing, my feet are &quot;low volume&quot;, somewhat narrow, and I use a Specialized insole for arch support.  The fit seems true to size - I usually wear a 10.5 US and the 44 European fits me well.  The Boa laces provide the majority of the snugness and the tongue provide good padding for the laces.  My toes have plenty of room in width and height.  This has worked out well and will allow me to wear thicker socks when cold weather arrives.\n\nThe construction seems to be good though I haven&apos;t used (abused) them long enough to know for certain.  My size 44s are about 410 grams (14.5 ounces) per shoe, with my insoles and SPD cleats.  With regard to foot protection, I suspect that they provide moderate protection.  The toe area is stiffened, but like most other shoes, the sides are effectively a single layer.\n\nI think these are a great option for everything from gravel to modern XC and marathon.  If they were stolen from me today, I would buy them again tomorrow.",

Calling them fleece lined is a bit confusing, before they arrived I thought there&apos;d be two layers of fabric, one for the weatherproof shell and one for the warm fleece. Nope, these are a single layer, and it&apos;s awesome how they get so much performance out of a fabric. Warmth is great, had them out in 40 degree temperatures and felt nice and warm. The waterproofing is also great, the DWR coating repelled all the water from bring in the rain for over an hour. These will be my new favorite pants for traveling, as well as for winter sports. The built in belt is functional, the only complaint is that for the price I&apos;d prefer an aluminum buckle over plastic.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought this on sale from a third party.  Well constructed, smooth sealed zipper function and seemingly durably material.  Have a Rab raincoat which does not have the same degree of durability.  Had the opportunity to wear this in a variety of rainy conditions over the last 3 weeks.  Remained dry with no wet through after 70 minutes of light to moderate steady rain.  The must have chest pocket kept electronics dry throughout.  I am 5’8” 152 lbs and range between small or medium depending on cut.  This coat seems to a slightly fitted cut and the small fit fine with room for a base layer and either micro puff vest or jacket with still plenty of room for movement.  Large vents are bidirectional.  Small criticism of all rain coats of this version would be the lack of lining/light pil on the inside front of the jacket when it is fully zipped - the fabric can get a little harsh around your chin/mouth.  Light weight and readily packable.  Not yet sure what the DWR retreat rate will be but mfg specs suggest using Nikwax wash/treat products.  To date, a nice light weight, waterproof shell.   So far, 5 stars.",

I was abandoned on a Backcountry chat trying to cancel the order since no one would be around to receive the package. So, I called in to cancel. The rep told me they would recall the shipment from FedEx. That did not happen. I called in again and another rep told me they would never recall a shipment and did not recall this one. \r\n\r\nAbandoned. Misled. Missed shipment. Unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI&apos;ll be buying elsewhere going forward.",

This is very disappointing; I wish I had have read the reviews here before purchasing, as it appears I&apos;m not the only one who has had this problem.

I carry on average 40+ pounds on my trips and have noticed how much more comfortable my Gregory Deva 70 pack is on my back than other packs.\r\n\r\nOther convenient features I really appreciate are:\r\n- the side pocket for actual ease of removing a 32oz water bottle without having to take my pack off\r\n- the plethora of front / side pockets for stashing various items\r\n- U-shaped front zipper to open up the entire inside of the bag instead of having to top-load\r\n- large zipper loop design that make it easy to access different parts of the pack\r\n- sturdy back support\r\n- included rain cover\r\n\r\nI only have a few critiques for what I wish for that would make it perfect:\r\n- better colors for women (I really like the men&apos;s colors)\r\n- a keychain loop inside one of the top compartments and a small zippered money pocket for safekeeping the important stuff\r\n- maybe a couple external daisy chains to carabiner stuff to\r\n- perhaps having an integrated daypack as the pack&apos;s brain\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I received this product as a gift in exchange for a review, but these are my own words and honest opinion and I would 100% recommend the pack. After a couple of trips I&apos;m already confident that it&apos;s the best amongst the packs I own and I&apos;ve already sold off the rest. I love the Deva 70 and it&apos;s definitely a keeper for me!\r\n\r\n#giftedproduct",

        "reviewBody": "This pack is perfect!  I took it for 7 nights in the Sequoia/Kings Canyon backcountry, and it exceeded my expectations in comfort - even though I was carrying more than 1/3 of my body weight.  Everything fit nicely, even my giant bear canister, and I am one to bring a ton of clothes and carry all my own gear, tent, hammock, book, etc.  I highly recommend this pack.  If you are debating between this pack and the Kalmia, I recommend this one - I have used both!  (I am 5&apos;8&quot;, 140lbs, and athletic build.)\r\n\r\nAs a recent convert to the Gregory brand, I just have to say: POCKETS!  This pack has great pockets, which is lacking in so many other brands.  The bottom zip-off compartment even has a divider to keep your sleeping bag and other items separate and accessible.  The dual front zip pockets are perfect for storing incidentals, and there are multiple internal and external pockets in the brain too.  The best though are the hip belt pockets - I could store my large phone, sunglasses, snacks, and TP all comfortably!  This alone will make me never go back to the brand I used for nearly a decade before switching to the Deva.\r\n\r\nMy other favorite feature was the clip to secure my reservoir hose (though I do wish they had the clip on each side - it is only on one, but minor issue).  This was lacking on my last pack, and I don&apos;t know how I lived without it!\r\n\r\nOverall, great pack, great company!",

I have a pair of Trek shorts , paid less than 100 for them 3 years ago they are still in very good condition!! I finally got my last pair of the FR-C pro shorts and got 2 years out of them , but they are coming apart in the same area.\nwould not spend this much money nor would I recommend them!!",

All have lasted for years, indeed I&apos;m wearing one now, though this past summer moths ate pinholes and larger in some, despite camphor in the closets!  It&apos;s not those other brands&apos; fault, and I keep them mended, too. But you can kind of see the mends and either wear them under other stuff or for gardening.\n\nSo, this new baselayer from Smartwool is a delight!  Yummy thickness, not too thick, and refreshingly clean and new.  I don&apos;t need to hide it under stuff but I can if I want to on a cold day.  Haven&apos;t washed it yet.\n\nMust try harder to fight moths this spring!",

Turns out, it did fit well. But…….i bought the navy blue. I wore them one day with no show Sox and at the end of the day the blue dye colored all of the toes. Not only were my Sox stained blue but it went through and stained my toe nails navy blue as well! Sure wasn’t expecting that, and no I did not have unusually sweaty feet wearing them. I’ve never experienced that with any shoe ever. Now I hate to wear them. I’m going to need to figure out what to do next. So……they are comfortable, but this blue dye thing is a disaster. It’s not that easy to scrub blue dye off your toe nails.",

I have worn my pair for almost a year and a half now every single day and they are still kicking. Build quality and comfort is unmatched. My toes have plenty of room to breathe and wiggle while feeling natural and not clunky. These shoes are on my feet at the office, gym, out to eat... really anywhere I go they go. Sizing is spot on. They do take a few wears to really break in, but once they do, they never come off I recommend these shoes to anyone who is looking for a HIGH QUALITY minimalist/barefoot shoe.",

I was dry and &quot;comfortable&quot; given the conditions. Its ventilation is better than the Alpha bc of its front vent.

Also loved that the chest vent had velco which made it quick and easy to access a beacon on the inside of the jacket. The fabric itself felt on the lighter side, but stood up to any abuse I put it through. It also allowed plenty of movement which I loved. I&apos;m 6&apos;0&quot;, about 195lbs, and have about a 6&apos;1&quot; wingspan. I&apos;m normally in-between a Large and an XL.

However, if temps dropped and it was brutally cold, I felt I could wear a burly puffy underneath and still have movement.\n\n-It feels bombproof, like the Backcountry Cardiac jacket, so it should last a very long time if taken care of.\n-Nice, adjustable powder skirt\n-Hood that actually fits over a helmet for extra warmth.\n-Little pass holder within the arm pocket is a nice touch.\n-Pit zips are nice and large to dump heat AND a front vent to open when things get even more toasty.\n-Internal phone pocket is a hair small.\n-leashed lens cleaner is also a nice touch.\n-The vertical pockets, while being a bit oddly located, are very accessible and nice and open nice and large, so you can access items with gloves on!\n\nI&apos;ve used it for resort/sidecountry, and a bit of touring, and works great for all.",

        "reviewBody": "I have found this jacket to be extremely utilitarian. I roll it up and put it in my pack for my backcountry AT and then hit the slopes and lift rides. It&apos;s all about the layering, but just a medium weight flannel and this shell make for a perfect mid 20&apos;s day at the resort. When in the backcountry, it rolls up and packs as good as would be expected for a jacket of this build. \n\nLet&apos;s talk about the build. The zippers being fully sealed is great and have yet to get a mis-zip out of any of the zippers. The recycled 3L Gore-Tex Pro fabric is top notch. I can see how these products will last a long time. Especially with the Norrona brand and their repair center in Norway. Yes you may be without your garment for some time while it goes back to its headquarters in Norway to get the TLC it may need. Because Norrona stands behind their products (check out their YouTube Channel). It is getting repaired by highly skilled seamsters and seamstresses. They design their products to last you a lifetime and want you to be proud of owning a quality piece of gear for your outdoor adventures. \n\nI went with a size large in the lemon chrome color; to help my partner find me on the slopes and to be seen in the backcountry. I am 5&apos;10&quot; and weight 190 atm and it fits me very well. The powder skirt fits snuggly against my hips and waist; as it should. The powder skirt is removable if you plan to spend a chill day on the groomers for a little bit of a more relaxed feel. The left arm pocket for your pass works really well; at least at my home resort of Steamboat. The breast pockets work well for snacks, sunglasses, goggles, or what-have-you. The left breast pocket has a microfiber lens cloth and there is an internal pocket that appears to be designed for your beacon should you be touring in the backcountry with a beacon device. \n\nBuying into Norrona is buying into sustainability, eco-minded, and quality. At its price; it is definitely an investment. In my opinion it is a good investment because you are buying these additional aspects when buying Norrona. And is a piece you can have for life.",

You won&apos;t appreciate how amazing this hood is until you&apos;ve tried it out.  Best hood ever!  Sleeves extend over the top of the glove adding extra moisture protection in a great touch.  Easiest pulling &quot;pit zips&quot; I&apos;ve ever had, which matters.  Bottom line, I ski every day (over 200 days this season) and this jacket still looks good, the color hasn&apos;t faded (which often happens in our intense California sunshine), and it still beads water like it did back in November.  I like a more relaxed fit, so I upsized, runs true to size for a more modern fit.  Highly recommended.",

What&apos;s really annoying is how bulky they are, so my winter gaiters don&apos;t fit. I literally can&apos;t overlap the velcro closure, or hook to the gaiter rindg. There also is no space under the arch for the gaiter strap, as there is under my old Keen boots. Finally, I can&apos;t get my microsoikes on these boots because of the pointier toe, so I need a larger size. When you design boots there needs to be more thought given to the various interfaces. My gaiters and spikes fit all my other size 9. 5 boots, Keen and Salomon, just not these. Get rid of that pointy toe please! If anyone else made a winter boot that didn&apos;t squish my toes I would send these boots back in a heartbeat. Having to buy new gaiters and spikes makes them an expensive boot.",

        "reviewBody": "These are my all time favorite winter boots !! This is my 4th season with these shoes, and I wear them daily for work, and they are still holding up great ! I live in Lake Tahoe and have definitely put them to the test. \nThey still keep my feet warm, still don&apos;t smell too bad 😅, and soles aren&apos;t wearing out. I tried on a few different pairs too before I settled on these, and I&apos;m oh so happy with my purchase. When they finally wear out I will definitely be getting another pair!",

        "reviewBody": "From Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Today was the first true test with these boots. We just had a massive storm last night with 25 cm of snow, then freezing rain, then rain. I have 2 big snow dogs that need a good 5 km run so I did a lot of research before buying these boots. I needed to make sure that the boots could withhold my needs, as I&apos;m outside a lot during the winter. Well they keep my feet warm, are good walking in the snow but on ice be careful. I was hoping this traction technology on the boots would be enough for me not to wear my ice grippers but if it&apos;s really icy outside, I think I&apos;ll still wear the ice grippers. I had a few cold puddles to walk through so that tested the waterproof aspect. Mind you, my feet were warm but my socks were a bit damp when I took off my boots. I wouldn&apos;t recommend a long walk in deep puddles with these boots. Overall, I&apos;m satisfied with them so far. I love my Keen hiking shoes so I said why not try out the boots. I did order half a size up for my thicker winter socks and they fit great. I would say true to size. I would recommend these to a friend, especially the hiking shoes.",

I had to modify the bag to be a bolt on bag (the description of what I purchased mentioned bolt on) but even using the straps for a short time the bag was stable. Good space holds an iPhone pro max, keys and not so minimally wallet for shorter rides or plenty of carbs for those longer rides",

Polartec Alpha is a weirdly well-kept secret. Particularly well suited for those who sweat. A lot. Think of this as a major step up from Cap thermal in both moisture control and warmth. Great under a shell going down and all alone or under a light vest going up.",

The big downside is the waist, for some reason they use an additional black fabric, a sort of mesh lining the waist, that it&apos;s not elastic at all, it has zero give.\n\nI&apos;m a skinny 28&quot; and the short fits well, but when I&apos;m moving around on the bike and because there&apos;s no zipper on the fly and it just have a single snap button, it snaps open everytime I expand my abdomen!\n\nIf the waist was made of the main elastic fabric only, it would have some give and it would be fine, but it&apos;s not.  So make sure the size you choose is slightly larger, otherwise if you choose the exact size, you might have the same problem I have.",

It makes it difficult to mount the bike, and when I was in front of the saddle it got stuck making it impossible to get back on the saddle.

The first is issues is these are longer than described in Backcountry&apos;s listing. \n\nSecondly, the liner short is laughably weak for a short of this price, with thin chamois that isn&apos;t very effective at tamping vibration, and the waistband lack sufficient elasticity to keep them up when you ride. They also lack compression in the legs.\n\nThe outer short portion is even more poorly designed, with a too slim (vertically) waistband and the cinch straps don&apos;t stay where you adjust, loosening constantly while you ride, leaving you having to frequently pull the shorts back up and re-cinch them - the adjustment straps would be better with a locking cam on them, or just make them Velcro so they don&apos;t slip.\n\nDefinitely do not recommend these, they&apos;re awful.",

Fox just went with the trend of Fattening America and seemingly just sized up across the line.  Size Sm that used to fit me perfectly now just fits like all the garbage enduro-brah stuff out there.  Waist is bigger and inseam is longer.  Returning... the search continues.  Also really don&apos;t like that the waist adjustment is external and visible.  Adds an additional element of cheapness to the product.  Previous models had internal velcro size fitment.   I didn&apos;t notice that in the pics when ordering the black color.",

There is difficulty in sliding the fiberglass stays all the way down into the  case.  I am very much questioning the longevity of the case since the material seems lighter than the previous travel case.  The zipper is less robust and does not zip it smoothly as my previous case, which my son is now using, nor the zippers on my wife’s case, which is the same generation.  So, although the design is excellent, the price has increased, and the quality may be diminished. Time will tell.",

I&apos;ve traveled all over with road, gravel, xc, and enduro bikes and never had any issues packing everything in (the enduro bike to push the weight limits for airline fees). It&apos;s great to be able to break it down in a small size so you can fit the built bike and the bag in a rental car. I&apos;ve also never had any issues with damage (knock on wood), which I can&apos;t say for other cases. It&apos;s much more secure than it looks and feels. \n\nI did see the negative review re: installing the struts. I did have a similar (well, not to that extent) frustration installing the struts. It does take a little work the first time but pretty smooth install beyond that. The key is just to make sure there&apos;s no slack and don&apos;t get caught up on the plastic base.",

I didn’t give it a 5 star because I followed their sizing guide and ordered a (L) that is my normal size 5’7 170 athletic build. The fit is a little too boxy and the neck keeps pulling towards the back and I have to keep pulling it down (even with the front tuck).\nIt’s beautiful and very luxurious. I may have sized down for a slimming fit but I’m afraid it wouldn’t look right.",

I got hot trying it on indoors.  If you live somewhere really cold, this is the sweater for you.  I usually wear a S, but the S was too long in the arms and boxy in the shoulders... so I would need to try an XS to make it work.  Otherwise, awesome quality and warmth!",

I have larger C size breasts, and they kept falling out the sides of this bra. It would be really cute for someone with smaller breasts, but not for me. The fit is so strange. This could never support you in an activity. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money and can&apos;t even be used to look cute because my boobs just fall out the sides.

I first ordered small because I did not want them to slip down, but those were too tight, medium fit perfectly and they do not slip at all in my experience.  I ride in the high 80s and low 90s here in the desert and they are not too hot, and I get hot.  I had a huge fall that severely sprained my rotator cuff requiring two months of PT, and even though my elbow still got scraped up pretty badly, no broken elbow, and the sleeve is still in great condition, no damage to it!\n\nMake sure you take them off carefully by the padded section as much as possible to not stretch the mesh area.  Other than that, these are great protection for a wide variety of riding and provide sun protection to boot!",

The only reason for the 4/5 stars is because I had to return the same pair I purchased for myself for a Medium.  I compared measurements to the size guide but I would suggest to size up if you are in any way concerned. It seems to me the measurements given and the max measurements and not those I would consider comfortable.",

But this seat was an epiphany for me, and it&apos;s all I&apos;ve ridden for years on all of my bikes. I can bore comfortably through a headwind for 30 minutes seated in the drops, no matter how rough the road. When changing positions I glide over the seat with plenty of room for my boys. And the nose droop is a perfect perch for spinning on steep climbs. Yes, you will be mocked with puerile manhood jokes. Jokes, however, are a small price to pay for a saddle that you can sit on forever with out pain. One warning; if you buy this saddle, you&apos;ll never go back.",

With the pandemic I no longer taught spinning classes and set my road bike up on a Wahoo Kickr for indoor riding. I began to get chaffing which lead to saddle sores on my upper hamstring region. After researching saddles I took a leap of faith and purchased the SMP Plus as there were no demo?s available. After installing and adjusting I really like it! No more chafing and very comfortable...I now have it on both my bikes. On my outdoor bike I have it mounted to a Specialized Cobble Gobbler suspension seat post and am very comfortable even with extended rides...really saved me!!!",

Not only is the backrest at close to a 45 degree angle, but so is the seat! \n\nThe ideal customer would be sitting by themselves, enjoying the view (without a drink), and stretching their legs out.

        "reviewBody": "I ordered two Dometic camp chairs from Backcountry. The first was new and in new packaging. The second appeared to be previously used as it had wear spots in the fabric and even had a small hole in the material. The carrying case had black marks as it had also been used. It did not come with the original labels. I am disappointed as I am not sure if I received a previously returned item. It should have been advertised as used not new.\n\nI tried to call your customer service help line, but my call was directed to a call center out of the country. Your gear head was not that helpful. \n\nAs far as the quality of the chairs, the aluminum frames seem well constructed. However,  the “burley, heavy duty 600D fabric” does not seem like it will last the length of the 3 year warranty. I cannot recommend these chairs and they are not worth the money. \n\nHonestly, I think I am more disappointed with the Backcountry service than the product.",

They wash well with hand washing and in the dishwasher. The knife probably wouldn&apos;t cut foods like a tough steak, but it likely would cut most of the other foods.

You have to take the rubber cover off completely as the gap in the side is pointless as you cant open the protective door to the SD car. With this GoPro also having a fixed base connector you also have to unscrew it from whatever its attached to every time you want to charge it because you have to take the protective cover completely off. It also recommends the GoPro is charged often but with this stupid embarrassing design it&apos;s such a pain to keep taking it on and off. No thought has been put into this at all.

The GoPro HERO 13. This does not fit that model despite the answer provided when someone asked on this page if it fits the 13. The answer provided by GoPro is that it fits the “new” HERO. IT DOES NOT. I wasted my money. It would cost me more money send it back to you because you charge to ship returns. It is absurd. I am stuck with a case that does not fit my new camera. Your description of this product is terrible. I don’t care how much market GoPro has. It is ridiculous. How much they nickel and dying you for every little accessory that should be included with the product. How do you not include any kind of protective case, a lanyard (it’s a piece of string!!), and a LENS COVER??? The next time I am looking to buy a camera like this, I will not be buying a GoPro..",

        "reviewBody": "This is great. I didn’t know cassettes came this big. It looks like a comically large hubcap back there but it works like it came new from the bike store. I did a 26er conversion….1999 Litespeed Ocoee HT, to a 1x (44 narrow wide/11-51 cassette) with…. Deore 11 speed rd-5100,  SRAM NX 11 spd grip shifter, old RaceFace turbine cranks(4 arm), ISIS - 73mm/113mm spindle w spacer (2.5 or 3mm) - shell is 68mm and kmc 11spd chain. I haven’t dropped a chain yet since my first shake down ride since spindle is perfectly centered. I still need to fine tune the shifting but the weight loss and loss of FD complexity really makes this one of the best upgrades/mods I’ve ever done and I’ve been cycling since 1990s. Great for hilly areas like my area.\n\nCompetitive Cyclist should have most of the parts you need at the best prices! Thanks Competitive Cyclist!",

You should run a steel freehub, as the cassettes splines will gouge a aluminum freehub, and ruin it. With steel freehub, no problem. The cassette holds up extremely well in all conditions. I run it on a Pivot Mach 429 trail, 2x11 drivetrain. Riding trails from Michigan to Colorado to Arizona. I have worn out 2 cassettes in 3 years, due to rocks in Utah and Arizona.",

Setup is really easy and the height is fantastic to use.\n\nMy only complaints are small ones that I would not necessarily expect at this price point. I wish there were more pockets in the tent for storage, and the little ones in the corners were touching a part of the tent where water would seep through if you touched it so things in those pockets needed to be water proof or you could not use them. \n\nOtherwise, for the money this tent can&apos;t be beat!",

Living in south Texas, I was especially concerned with ventilation issues. After having used the tent in the hot Texas summer, I can say without a doubt that this tent exceeded our expectations. Also, it is easy to set up and take down. I have also used this tent in a rain storm and we stayed dry and experienced no issues with water leaks. The text is very spacious and the best part is that you can stand up inside. I highly recommend the Jade Canyon X4 to anyone think about purchasing a tent for family camping.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this tent as a replacement/upgrade to my Eureka Sunrise 9 that I have been using for Boy Scout Summer camp for many years.  With the more vertical sides, his tent has greater volume, less curves, and greater height compared to the Sunrise.  The tent is more complicated than the Sunrise with the additional poles, but that is what gives it the volume.  As such, in potentially windy situations, I will use the additional ropes to help secure the tent down.  Was a little surprised to see the windows are held up by little toggles in lieu of a zipper, but the design appears to be water tight, and should be a lot quieter than zippers.  Went with the Jade Canyon over the Copper Canyon because of the thicker material and higher quality poles, since I plan on using this tent for many years of summer camp.  I will still use a plastic ground cloth underneath, and the fitted footprint inside, to help take care of the floor and get many years of use out of this tent.  This is my 4th Eureka tent, as I still use my Eureka Backpacking tent I purchased 30+ years ago.",

        "reviewBody": "We extensively researched tents when looking for a bigger version than our old “”4 person”” Coleman Flatwoods. We wanted a tent that we could not only stand up in, but was quality. We had never heard of Eureka tents and were skeptical. Im SO glad we got this tent. It was our home on a two week car camping trip and was put up, taken down, and moved almost every day. It is ridiculously easy to put up &amp; down. Im talking one person, two minutes tops. The poles are THICK, sturdy, and a beautiful bright color. Really quality design and SO spacious. The flap windows concerned me originally but they work great in use. Love customizing the open window shape with the various window “latches”. We had rain over a few days and the tent stayed dry. I was impressed. My onnnly complaint is that the floor is a little thinner than my old coleman, however it may be nicer material. Overall, we love our Jade Canyon and are extremely pleased with our choice!",

        "reviewBody": "This shoe gives you a ton of ground feel, which I love. I wear barefoot shoes and usually run in mid-cushion trail shoes, like the Saucony Peregrine or Topo Mtn Racer. This shoe is super light too, which feels awesome. The toe box is nice and roomy and the mid and heel fit is loose but not sloppy. My two gripes are the gusseted tongue and the lugs. The tongue is floppy and attached to the sole with two big elastic bands. For some reason I find it really hard to put the shoes on without wrinkling up my socks. It also feels a little weird once I do have my sock straightened out, like my mid-foot is being squeezed in a weird way. The lugs aren&apos;t great in the mud. They aren&apos;t very deep, and they&apos;re flat. I don&apos;t know if I would buy these again. I would probably just buy another pair of Sauconys for $70 less. One other thing, I&apos;m usually an 11.5, with this shoe I went with an 11. They run about a half size large.",

        "reviewBody": "These shoes are about 40 bucks more than I think they should be, given similar competition, but they are very good and still my go-to choice for big miles over super technical terrain. I live in Tucson and the trails in the Santa Catalina mountains are very rocky, very technical, and have tons of vertical. Half the time there is more of a scramble than a run. The rocks are either very smooth and slick from water or razor sharp and most other shoes I have aren&apos;t grippy enough and/or they are durable enough to handle the abuse. The lower lug depth works really well for these drier rocky technical trails, the upper doesn&apos;t tear or blow out anywhere from wear or from rocks or cactus. The laces always stay tied but are a few inches too long, IMO. The foam is cushy enough for 12 hour runs while also giving good enough protection from rocks and insane trail feel. I have to size down 1/2 a size from normal, no pun intended, because they run long. They are also super light and dry quickly when they get wet given there is no insole. They aren&apos;t fancy, and are expensive, but they are the one shoe that always works and doesn&apos;t fall apart.",

        "reviewBody": "Really thrilled with all these boutique shoes coming out (Nnormal, Norda, etc) lately and that we are getting away from the mass produced 100&apos;s of models of the same shoe that all underperform and consider the environment.  Fully transparency - these shoes were purchased on sale, which was a big help.  First impressions were that the shoe feels very minimalistic and the fact that Killian wins 100 milers in these tells me that he could win barefoot, however the cushion is wild because the rebound is there, the durability is there and the protection is somehow there too while offering the most ground feel i have experienced outside of something i would never actually run a race in.  Really happy with these shoes, upper is next level, fits like a glove and i usually opt for wider type toe box shoes.  I have probably 140+ miles on these, handled a fairly grueling trail race and many training runs inbetween and somehow this shoe is a top pick for every sort of run, be it a race, recovery run, hike or long run it can do it all.  Only complaint is that i feel like this shoe would improve alot with only a drop more stack, that and the lack of insole takes a little getting used to and caused some blisters at first but other than that its awesome.  Also thank you to Backcountry for hooking it up after the first pair that was delivered got robbed by some porch pirates.  Order a half size down.",

This one is beyond what I had imagined. The material is beautiful, soft, high quality cotton! It&apos;s durable, yet very nice looking. It&apos;s the perfect length  for me at 5&apos;9&quot;, I&apos;m 150lbs and ordered a med. Fits like it was made for me. It doesn&apos;t bunch up anywhere and I don&apos;t sit on it when I sit down. It doesn&apos;t look boxy, has a nice natural shape and lays/hangs well. It&apos;s lightweight, but feels like an expensive down blanket. The pockets are perfect size and warm. I love the fact it&apos;s all cotton and down without feathers to eventually poke thru. It&apos;s extremely warm . The color is absolutely gorgeous, the parka looks way better in person.",

To enhance their longevity, I applied two coats of Nikwax for leather after my initial wear, as I noticed the factory waterproofing may not hold up over time. One area for improvement would be the fit; they feel a bit narrow for my feet. If they could be slightly wider, they would undoubtedly be ideal for longer walks with my dog and shorter semi-urban hikes. Overall, I appreciate the quality and functionality of these boots!",

I ended up buying these because other Hestra 3 finger ones that I bought weren&apos;t as warm as my gloves in this model.  These 3 finger ones are amazing... and I&apos;m hoping they make a mitt again because I&apos;ll buy those too.\nMy gloves are size 10, so I bought a size 10 and 11 in these and went with the 11.  Sizing up was the right choice.",

Several days skiing in 10 degree weather had me so pleased that I had spent a little extra money, as my fingers and hands were never even close to cold, even when I was stuck waiting for others for 30+ minutes not skiing I was beyond comfortable. I have been waiting for more reasons to wear them, but weather has not been in my favor.",

They feel as if you’re still wearing a five finger glove, but with the warmth and padding of a mit. The do run a tad bit smaller than hestras other gloves so I’d recommend sizing up one size. I have the hestra fall line gloves in a 10 so I ordered these in 11 and they fit perfectly. This will definitely be my last pair for a very long time.",

        "reviewBody": "They look great, but have absolutely no foot support, I had to put some store-bought insole support for the footbed, the footbed was not comfortable at all until I put the orthotic insole w/an arch in it. It&apos;s true to size, I wear a size 9 and size 9 comfortably fit my foot, I have slightly narrow foot and it felt snug in this boot, didn&apos;t feel like my feet were swimming in it like other medium width boots can feel like to a narrow width foot. But as you take a stride, it&apos;s not the most comfortable boot, they look comfortable but aren&apos;t. They look fashionable though. The chunky heel bothered me more than I thought it would, I normally buy no heel Merrell&apos;s and they didn&apos;t have any good snowboots this year so I opted for something as similar as I could get, except for the heel. I didn&apos;t think the Kamik&apos;s were nearly as comfortable as my old Merrell&apos;s, because the footbed of the Kamik Sienna 3 boot was lacking in comfort.  I take them off and my feet feel relieved when I put my slippers on like my feet weren&apos;t happy in the boots, so I can&apos;t really recommend this boot.",

On top of that, I live in Arizona, where UV degredation destroys nylon in a matter of days. My tent has been retreated every other year, and it is still tear resistant and strong. I bought Solarproof again because I trust the product.\n\nTwo star shipping. The bottles arrived wrapped in plastic, which was thoughtful. They had spilled during shipping and the plastic DID prevent the liquid from getting on the rest of my order. However, it was not a small spill. The Solarproof bottle is less than half full. I collected as much of the spilled liquid as I could into a spare bottle. I am not sure how mixed with the Solarwash it is now. Hopefully, mixing will not impact the effectiveness. I lost much more than I had hoped.",

Could use a zippered pocket inside the main compartment for small items and the main compartment zipper should extend the length of the pack, at least along one side, for access to stuff at the bottom.  Quibbles aside, this pack will get the job done no matter how much stuff (or water) you cram into it.  Rust color is dark rust, not orange.  Great sale price.",

        "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a good pack with a couple minor complaints. The pocket design is different than other traditional touring packs and I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s in a good way. The shovel and probe are accessible through the main compartment zipper while the main pack compartment is separated by a Bungie top closure. This works okay except the shovel/probe naturally press against the main compartment opening making it harder to access pack contents. The other issues is that as the pack fills up, the shovel\\probe sit more upright, pushing the exterior of the pack out and away and creating a negative space outside the main compartment. This becomes a space that isn&apos;t easy to fill with the top of the shovel\\probe sticking up. Although I&apos;ve found it&apos;s kinda nice to just toss a layer of two or gloves in and put of this space and not need to throw them back in the main compartment. Another minor issue is if the pack is full and the shovel\\probe facing up, the lid tops main pocket gets pretty crushed from the shovel\\probe. Hard to keep goggles in there and I&apos;m worried my sunglasses or similar items might break. Another little issue is the deployable helmet cover pulls down from the top and I&apos;ve noticed a couple times it beginning to spread apart the main compartment zippers. It also forces the mini pocket it comes from to stay open so no valuables can go in there although I use it for snacks, ski straps, hand warmers, etc... \n\nBeyond that it&apos;s a really solid pack that has everything else you&apos;d want from a touring pack. Lightweight, two ice axe capacity, hipbelt pocket and gear loop, daisy chains which I added some Bungie for crampons (but it&apos;s mostly been used for beer cans haha). The color scheme is great and I really like it. The fast track feature is cool and I&apos;ve used it a couple times but ya gotta really ask yourself how often you&apos;ll use it. I&apos;ve had trouble getting the skis fully crosswise to balance the load. It normally stays on the right side and any extended booting that sucks. I gotta check out their videos again to make sure I&apos;m doing it right.",

It was only after googling that I came across information on Reddit and Ariat’s own website that tells you that you must break in the boot before wearing. I did not see this on the product page. (May have missed it). Once I spent 30 min doing that, they performed flawlessly even in the rain. Would highly recommend!",

Too big in heal area and allows for slip and pulls my socks down while being too tight across the mid foot/toe area. My legs are already tired after one day. They have great cushion and I love that they don’t set off the metal detector but unfortunately these were not worth the investment. The search for a great waterproof boot continues.",

Had a need for a second pair and North Face indicated that these were the &quot;updated&quot; version. The pants fit and will work for an urban hip-hop hiker well. They were NOT made for the mountains. Belt won&apos;t stay cinched. Legs snag on every little thing. Don&apos;t even try to take of the lower leg part if your boots are muddy. You won&apos;t be able to. The old style had a zippered sleeve that opened up making this SO easy. North Face, appears to have decided that they&apos;d rather concentrate on the hip-hop crowd and have mostly abandoned the Outdoors Adventurer crowd.",

That being said there is not much to this product, you are essentially purchasing the bearings and the top cap. They took out the top seal to reduce the stack height.",

Purchased a 10 pound propane tank and use the Genesis system for all our cooking needs, from making lattes with eggs and hash browns in the morning to baking in our back pack oven. Great unit and highly recommend the entire system..",

The DWR is a must like it is in any outdoor pant but the stretch is what make these stand out. Most pants with stretch either don&apos;t have enough or tend to feel like yoga pants. These are perfect! they have great recovery so it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re wearing a stretchy pant. Definitely worth adding to your wardrobe.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this bike rack after careful consideration of all the options available.  While it is one of the pricier options you&apos;ll find, I am certain there are none that feel as sturdy when carrying bikes than this one.  Assembly takes two people to make everything easy. While the instructions could be a bit clearer, it went together with only a few bolts and nuts.  There is an included and integrated cable bike lock to secure your bikes to the rack when you park in those shadier parts of town.  The rack system also comes with a keyed hitch pin, making attachment to your vehicle simple and secure. \r\n\r\nOne of the most unexpected features I do appreciate is the way the hitch can tighten down and compress within the receiver. This makes the rack feel extremely secure and removes any wobble from the rack.  Loading bikes is a breeze. Lift them onto the rack, lift the locking arm and loop the rear tire strap and tighten. Much easier than the older racks a used to have with all the straps and excess cords to deal with.  \r\n\r\nThe rack does tilt down and out of the way for easier access to the back of your SUV.  It drops fast, so be prepared that first time you pull the lever. I am considering getting the swing arm mount to move the rack totally out of the way, instead of reaching over the rack and bikes, but for now, this will have to do.  \r\n\r\nThere is a small tire adapter for the kid size bikes you may be traveling with, included in the system.  The rack will also accommodate fat tire bikes with ease.",

        "reviewBody": "I owned this rack for about 4 months on my Ford Maverick and was impressed by the build construction and ease of use. The anti-wobble mechanism that takes up slack in the hitch mount is near perfect and never came loose for me - the thing is rock steady when mounted. The fold-up mechanism, ratchet arms, and wheel straps all seemed really solid and didn&apos;t give me any trouble. \n\nThe locking mechanism doesn&apos;t seem as well set up for longevity as the rest of the rack. This rack has two lock cables - one per bike tray - which store inside of the tray when not in use. This feature is awesome because it allows you to lock both bikes (think theft deterrent, not necessarily prevention) within 20-30 seconds. However, when the cable locks get dirty, as they will when locking around mountain bike wheels, they tend to slide back into the tray storage position roughly - the system is not very tolerant to debris. As well, the cavities where the cables slide into tend to collect some water. When I took the rack off my truck and tilted it on end, about a quarter cup of water dripped out of each tray. As a result, the ends of the locking cables were starting to rust from sitting in the water (and the dirt probably didn&apos;t help things either) by the time I went to sell the rack. I park outdoors and the rack was exposed to the elements all summer, so this may not be a problem for those with a garage.\n\nThe bike repair stand that is built into the end of the rack has some sizing issues. I was using it with a Specialized Stumpjumper EVO with Shimano XT clip-in pedals and this setup was too wide for the rack. The pedal hit the rack preventing the crank from turning freely. This is a bummer because turning the crank to adjust your drivetrain is of course half the point of mounting your bike to a repair stand. It&apos;s a great feature, it just needs to be adjusted outwards to accommodate modern mountain bikes.",

        "reviewBody": "I researched for months before I decided this was the most functional rack based on specifications and reviews.  I’m returning the favor with my review.  First and foremost, Backcountry’s shipping speed consistently impresses.  At a whopping 53 pounds, this rack is easily lifted using both upper extremities and proper body mechanics.  It’s sits a little higher than my previous Yakima, which I owned for 4 years before I started to notice rust that came from washing my bike while on the rack and not drying it.  That was on me.  Once loaded onto hitch, I really appreciate the knob mechanism used to secure rack to reduce excess movement.  The hitch pin included easily slides through right side opening and locks of left.  Unfold it by pulling a hefty lever that’s easily accessible, and assist by passively lowering until it sits horizontally.  Because the rack sits a little higher than my previous hitch, I have to raise my bike a bit more to load it, but, I’m also 5 feet short.  Front tire hook is solid, and rear tire cinch is a breeze.  I will say that my previous hitch had a loop to anchor down rear tire cinch to keep it out of the way while I loaded my bike.  It’s the only thing missing on this rack to give it a perfect rating.  It also comes with magnetic tie downs that require a key, which comes in handy while making a quick pit stop and fear your bike may get snatched.  I almost forgot to mention I purchased it at a discounted total of 735.23.  I selected the black option because I felt the grey/orange (also very nice) may be more conspicuous.  Overall, very, very pleased with my solid decision.",

We at the moment have a full suspension mountain bike, kids bike, gravel bike, and will probably grow to fat tire bikes, and anywhere in between. We had a hard time finding a rack that could do it all without rubbing frames. Well, we found it here.\n\nI like the small features, the fact that the rack doesn&apos;t shift and rock around, the extra arm to work on bikes on the road, which we have had to use already. This rack is heavy with just the 2, and we will soon add the extension, so getting this on and off the car will be a bit difficult, I figure that is a small issue. The loading and unloading of bikes is so easy, I can load my bike go pick up a friend and go wherever we want without adding much time.\n\nWell worth the cost!",

Second, add a 1/4” valve at the oven connection so you can actually turn the flame down enough once the top is almost done,\nso the bottom can finish cooking. The valve on the oven will not allow a low temperature. Before I added the valve, I would turn off the oven when the top was done, and let it sit to finish the bottom.

        "reviewBody": "Jacket seems nice. It has the same Patagonia quality you’d expect. I have a nano puff I’ve been wearing for years and absolutely love it. I like the water/wind resistance and wet weather protection with the synthetic insulation of the nano puff. Wanted to pick up a second Patagonia synthetic jacket but didn’t wanna pay full price for another nano puff (also wanted something with a hood but didn’t want to pay nearly 300 dollars for the nano puff hoodie.) This jacket seems a little less warm than the nano puff but that’s perfect for me since I run hot anyway. I think this jacket will fit into my early spring/fall wardrobe very nicely. Seems like it will work well for 40s to 50s and a light drizzle which is pretty much everyday here in nw Washington state. The only thing I do not like about it is the bottom of the jacket is a little bit too tight but I guess that’s just because it’s a bomber style. I run between a small and a medium (5’6 145 lbs) and the small fit me nicely. Still had enough room for a hoodie or a flannel underneath. Also worked well under a Gore-Tex shell.",

The former issue was simply remedied by forgoing the stuff sack included and simply either throwing it in a bag, or wrapping it in 550 or elastic cord. The fitting issue wasn&apos;t the product&apos;s fault, as it is the &quot;long&quot; variant. I definitely plan to order a standard length one before the next field exercise; the thing made falling and staying asleep in weird sleeping spots easy. Word of warning, double check that the valve to let the air out is closed, before you try to start filling; it&apos;s common sense, you say, but it happens.",

I tried pad out on an un-carpeted floor and found that while it did pad me (6&apos;1&quot; 170lb side sleeper) without bottoming out, it felt precarious and unsatisfactory by itself. I think it has to do with the small volume of air, so with my weight it becomes highly compressed and firm, with no give (more air would have more room to distribute the weight and allow for springiness). Inflating it less wasn&apos;t an option as the line between &quot;inflated&quot; and &quot;not&quot; was paper thin. When I added a roll of closed cell foam underneath I felt less uneasy about damaging it, but no more supported. As a topper for a cot I could see it making a lot more sense, it is breathable and compact. Or for someone who doesn&apos;t need much cushion (like a back sleeper who&apos;s used to just using a foam roll) and wants a lightweight option it might be just what they&apos;re looking for.",
