Everyone was unprofessional and kept saying, “we have to call the tour guide to see what really happened,” Like we missed the guide or something. (We did not, I was at the bar talking to the bar tender who knew the tour guides and said they haven’t seen them. He even went out to check). The dude on the phone for the local office took my name and number and said he only had one phone line to use so he had to hang up with me to try and call their tour guide. (He doesn’t have a cell phone?) So he hung up on me and never called back and I never got a refund.  Out $74 dollars. Viator and Seattle Terrors are both scams as far as I’m concerned. Horrible"

This was the only food tour that accommodated my daughter’s lightweight wheelchair.\n2. Our guide, Will, was knowledgeable, funny, and took care of all the people on this tour - I have a food allergy and Will arranged alternatives for me so that I also could enjoy the food too.\n3. Group size was small - 8 people and therefore very personable.\n4. Background stories about each food or shop added uniqueness and enjoyable information.\n5. Pace was perfect. We didn’t stop and stand around for long periods of time or felt rushed to get to the next stop.\n\nAnd most of all the food was delicious.\nI would highly recommend this tour! Thanks, Will for a fun noontime experience."

Every single thing we ate was PHENOMENAL -- the chai from Aditi, the perfectly ripe persimmons, the lamb stew from Turkish Delight... keep in mind that many places can pack to travel or will ship to you, so don't be shy about asking for business cards or websites. \n\nWe absolutely recommend this tour!

There seemed to be no historical relevance to the food locations we had tastings for and if there was we weren't told about them. All we  did was walk to about 5 locations and taste something they sell. \n\nI've been on a handful of food tours around the US and I would not recommend this tour unless they switched it up and added some food locations that make Seattle what it's known for. From this tour I have no idea. "

I would highly recommend this tour and would have booked more with this company after talking to her if I'd had the time."

She shared some of the complexities of Seattle’s history including the displacement of indigenous people and the internment of Japanese families during WWII. The focus on local merchants and the tastes were also marvelous. \n\nAlong the way we enjoyed a delightful chocolate croissant, an excellent grilled cheese sandwich, some Washington state apples, and some smoked garlic pepper salmon. \n\nLou at Hellenika Creamery gave us a rundown of the company’s history and the chemistry behind their amazing gelato! Try the Seattle Fog (Earl Grey flavored) and the 7th Inning Stretch (think CrackerJack caramel corn). \n\nEarly in our tour Carolyn mentioned Indi Chocolate and the owner, Erin’s commitment to building relationships with the cacao farmers. We shared our interest in the chocolate making process so later in the tour Carolyn took us by Indi. We enjoyed a sample of their hand lotion which Erin says is a favorite among the fish market guys on date nights! The scent of the lotion was amazing. \n\nFor the coffee fans, we sampled a latte at Victrola, a mocha at Chocolate and Ice Cream Delight, and a French press at Storyville. All were quite good - and we don’t usually prefer coffee!\n\nIt’s clear that Carolyn has a deep appreciation and affection for the Market and its people. Many of the merchants know her by name and wave or call out a happy greeting. This tour is a great way to enjoy the stories and tastes of the Pike Place Market!"

For 1 adult and 4 kids, $45, was way too much and  we quit after 5 of the 10 clues. \nWe liked the starting point. A national park in downtown Seattle! They offer a free 1 hour wallking tour.\nWe were disappointed."

I truly thought this was going to be more like an escape room, and while there were some elements of that puzzle-like approach, this was an incredibly fun way to learn about the city, do some exploring, and take a very nice walk. Be prepared for the weather of course as Seattle is very rainy. This is easily friendly for the whole family or something to do solo as you're walking around the city and viewing various historical sites, interacting with the different locations you encounter in one way or another. One of the stops along the way is the Smith Tower and be sure to budget time to stop and take the tour! We were lucky enough to catch the end of their weekend brunch. I am so glad we did this as it is such an amazing way to have fun, see the city, and be outdoors without spending an arm and a leg."

Unconventional, not a class; learn through experimentation! You get to take risks in this lab that you wouldn't normally take at home with hundreds of ingredients at your fingertips. Tools include smoking gun, test tubes, shaker sets, etc.\n\nIt is my goal as your host to work with each of you and fine-tune each event to fit your individual mixology goals. By design, any awkwardness and negative judgement is kicked out the door in order for the madness to ensue! \n\n",

Jen, our host, was incredibly knowledgeable but kept things relaxed and playful the whole time. You could tell she knew her stuff, but she made sure the focus stayed on creativity and enjoyment, not rules or perfection.\n\nWhat I loved most was how everyone participated — whether you’re a mixology nerd or just curious, there was zero pressure and no wrong way to experiment. The small, intimate group made it easy to connect and share creations, and somehow, everyone just fit. It felt like a perfect mix of structure and freedom, and by the end, we were all laughing and sipping drinks we’d never think to make on our own.\n\nA totally unique and memorable experience. If you’re in Seattle, go. Whether you drink alcohol or not, you’ll walk out with a smile."

She started with a tour of the lab and how she organized ingredients and then we were left to our own devices (except for the smoker). Everyone in my group had a fun time deciding what ingredients to mix and match and try. Some of our concoctions tasted professional, some tasted toxic, but we enjoyed bringing to life what our imaginations thought up and assigning punny names for each drink. I would highly recommend to any friend group that enjoys drinking, laughing, and experimenting together!"

Jen stocks the bar well and there is no recipe she can't help create with a little imagination. I highly recommend this fun laboratory in a great neighborhood."

It felt like a hidden speakeasy. There were loads of interesting curios around the lab: an old phone (that worked), books with secret compartments, a fortune cookie dispenser with adults-only fortunes, a bar globe, among other fascinating artifacts. The host spent the first 10 or 15 minutes explaining how things work and emphasized that it was not a mixology class, but rather a laboratory where all the time was yours to spend experimenting. There seemed to be dozens of different types and brands of alcohol and hundreds of different things you could add to the alcohol: sweet syrups, flavored bitters, ice, smoke, fruit, dried spices, etc. For my first cocktail, I decided to keep it simple and create a rum old-fashioned with some spice. The drinks that followed were much more experimental, using things like avocado powder, glitter, charred salt, smoke, chocolate, and rosemary. Altogether, I made four drinks in the two hours and sampled other people's drinks as well. The host and her assistant were super friendly and answered any questions I asked them.\n\nI highly recommend this activity for both groups, singles and for a good date night."

From the moment you step through the doors and into the lab there is a level of sophistication and creativity.  I do not want to give too much away, but the lab experience is the opportunity to unleash your creativity and experiment with different flavor combinations. From smoky mezcal infusions to tangy citrus blends, the possibilities are endless. With a vast array of ingredients at your disposal, you're free to let your imagination run wild and create drinks that are as unique as you are. Jen does a great welcoming her guests in and I feel it is a must go and visit if you are in town.  Additionally, to have the opportunity to even mix, mingle, and connect with people is fanatic especially since Seattle has this misconception of an introvert town."

The garage is located one level below the \"entry level\" noted above.\n\nAIR CONDITIONING\nAir conditioning is a real rarity in Seattle.
