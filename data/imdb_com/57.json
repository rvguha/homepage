His great ensemble direction rivals Robert Altman&apos;s. And just have a look at that cast - Mastroianni (effective as always), Trintignant (always so surprising), Tognazzi (in charge of his difficult rôle), Gassman (what a superb actor!), Reggiani (moving), the lovely Stefania Sandrelli and a débutante very young Marie Trintignant. For those who like Italian cinema and politically oriented films with a touch of humor. 8/10",

This was a great experience and being up close to the filming, the director and the cast was really a fantastic opportunity and then to see the film when it was released in an Italian movie theater as a finished product was a real treat.\n\nOver the years I have had contact with a few of the American&apos;s that were cast for &quot;La Pele&quot; (most of them as extra&apos;s). Many of the American&apos;s were from the NATO base in Naples, Italy and were friends with or knew my father.\n\nThis may not have been the greatest war film ever made but the experience that I had was great and will always be remembered.\n\nMike Cohen / mikesc99@hotmail.com",

      "reviewBody": "Pick up truck. Large breasted girls in terrible 80s clothes. Dilapidated mansion. The opening scene looks like The Beverly Hillbillies crossed with the Addams Family, dragged kicking and screaming into 1980s, with a cast of large-breasted female cyphers jiggling for the camera in an old mansion, before flashbacks of a driller killer begin.\n\nThis will either be goofball fun, or mind numbing. Sadly, it is mostly a mixed bag.\n\nNewspaper headlines try to fill in the viewers to the history of the house in this story, but Elvis Lives! headline was moronic, and turns the entire scene into an unfunny joke. When a Satanic serial killer in plaid rears his bloated, flabby face near the house on a rainy night, the girls strip to their undies and consult a Ouija board for help.\n\nLightning flashes are lifted from the title scene from Gilligan&apos;s Island! \n\nAt one point, it takes the killer about five minutes just to walk across a two lane street while stalking the girls. It&apos;s pouring down with rain when he begins walking, but by the time he gets across the street and at the house, it has stopped raining. The film&apos;s pacing is as slow as the killer&apos;s walk, because it takes forever for anything to happen.\n\nLinda (played by short little Robyn/ Gail Harris) is my favourite of the lot, but there are no decent nude scenes or sex scenes. It seems more like a PG-rated lingerie shoot than a slasher flick for the first 30 minutes, then some mostly mild violence is brought into the mix, as the girls are stalked (very slowly) by Captain Happy in his plaid overalls, throughout this old mansion.\n\nThis one-act story stretched out to 77 minutes basically climaxes about 60 minutes in, and then it falls back on the undying killer cliché, before resorting to the demonic possession cliché, in a surprisingly blood-drenched ending. Of which, there are no less than FOUR endings to this!",

There&apos;s a a few cool moves he makes, but don&apos;t expect too much from this movie.  The plot moves quickly and really isn&apos;t that interesting.  It&apos;s all about the fight scenes.\n\n One thing that really got to me was the movie takes place in Detroit City but there&apos;s almost a Canadian landmark in each scene.  &quot;Welcome to Detroit AM&quot; [CN tower in the background], Sky dome signs, Canadian food chains and even in the first few scenes there&apos;s filming right in front of City landmarks.  Why not just say Toronto rather than Detroit?"

      "reviewBody": "If you limit yourself to just one documentary, make it One Shot. You will be rewarded with two unforgettable filmsone consciously created by director Nurit Kedar and another one that emerges despite her intentions.\n\nThe film by Kedar, scriptwriter/editor Tali Halter-Shenkar, and Yoni Zigler, director of the opening segment, is shocking and accusatory as it interviews and comments on snipers that accompany most regular Israel Defense Force squads. The opening begins the indictment, depicting ritualized movements by masked men wielding scythes. The clothes, the khaffiya-draped heads, and the ceremonial routines are reminiscent of archival photos of terrorists in training camps but these angels of death are Israelis. The Hebrew lettering of their insignias is translated as &quot;You can run but you can&apos;t hide,&quot; presenting the soldiers who carry out &quot;targeted killings&quot; as faceless dealers of death. These images of anonymous purveyors of death return throughout the film, countering the personal interviews which insist on the men&apos;s individuality. The agenda of the filmmakers is clear; Israeli snipers are murderers. The symbolism of the scythes is augmented by the blurred green light of night vision goggles worn by actual soldiers and by a host of other images: monochromatic, war torn buildings in &quot;refugee&quot; camps, a solitary Palestinian schoolboy, the silent and beautiful sunset, the sunbathing Arab child. Add the restrained sound of chanting Imams and even the flurry of stones thrown at Israeli police is reduced to innocence by the insistent rattle of gunfire. When these images are alternated with the actual interviews, and we hear the snipers&apos; words about the joy of killing, the sense of power, and the &quot;game&quot; of death, even defenders of Israel are shaken. And for those who come to the film already condemning Israel and its policies, the words and images confirm that these men are cold blooded killers and make it easy to level at them the accusation hurled at Nazis, namely that they were moral barbarians, manipulating the tools of a technologically advanced civilization against the helpless.\n\nBut there is another film here, one that may explain the IDF&apos;s cooperation in the making of One Shot. Stalin was purported to have said that death of millions will be ignored more easily than the death of one because a million is but a statistic. Journalists, documentary filmmakers, and storytellers fight the namelessness of statistics by focusing on individuals, making the death of a specific person real. The strategy works just as well in reverse; it is easier to condemn a group than an individual. And in introducing us to a few individual snipers, Kedar succeeds in humanizing them. Whatever their initial comments, as they speak, the men reveal themselves to be soul-searching, often conscience stricken, always articulate and intelligent people. It becomes clear that the club of Nazism, a favorite stick of Zionism bashers, simply cannot be wielded here. These haunted ex-soldiers will never hide behind claims of &quot;We were just following orders,&quot; and turn into old men lying to themselves about their innocence. All of them demonstrate an awareness of the significance of life and are clearly committed to preserving it in the future. They might complain about the restrictions the IDF had placed on them during missions, such as firing only at legs or targeting only the specific person and withholding the shot if it may hurt someone else, but in retrospect they are pleased that the restrictions limited killings and protected those who were not targets. Though the images attempt to point viewers in one direction, the words defy the attempt. There are no madmen here, declaring it sweet and glorious to kill for one&apos;s country. There are only young men clearly struggling to find the right thing to do among the conflicting demands of country, morality, and the imperative to survive.\n\nImage and language are both hypnotic in One Shot, whether in the service of the view presented or the view that emerges. The Israel Defense Force was either very foolish for allowing the interviews and ignoring the powerful, pro-Palestinian visual context or incredibly optimistic in its belief that the essential humanity of the men will triumph over the filmmakers&apos; point of view. List me as one left with the belief that if this is the worst of the Israeli fighters, the possibility of eventual rapprochement between Israelis and Palestinians is likely because these designated &quot;assassins&quot; lack anger, are devoid of hatred, and free of self-justification and rationalization.",

      "reviewBody": "I am very surprised that no one has yet commented on this film. It is a fine old Shaw Bros. release, a very traditional sword-play film, with a solid cast, solid story, solid film-making.\n\nWhat makes this all the more confusing is that this film has two of the strongest female characters to ever appear in Hong Kong cinema. Feminist critics are always telling us women need strong, independent role models as heroes in cinema - well, look no further, here they be.\n\nTwo students fight over inheritance of a murdered master&apos;s sword. The bad=guy wins. what he doesn&apos;t know is that the student he kills has a wife who&apos;s actually a better fighter than her husband. To find the killer, she goes under-cover as the servant of a leading general&apos;s daughter. \n\nThe general is forced by the king to betroth his daughter to a real scumbag prince. The dead hero&apos;s wife saves the daughter, seriously wounding the prince. From the nature of the wound the bad-guy student (the king&apos;s hired assassin) figures out who the servant really is.\n\nHowever, this heroic widow now goes into hiding with the general&apos;s daughter (who becomes her protégé). The young girl goes out riding one day and meets a kind of Chinese Robin Hood, a heroic bandit. Together, all three heroes join up with a rebellious nobleman, and join the cause of revolt against the evil king....\n\nThere are numerous fight sequences; the fabled sword of the murdered teacher changes hands several times; and there is a lovely musical number right in the middle of the film.\n\nThe acting is first-rate, the cinematography beautiful; the characters are charming, and the story is fairly compelling, with only one episode towards the end that is a little hard to follow (since it involves a character of whom we as yet know nothing).\n\nThis is a film that is difficult not to like. The contemporary audience may need to be cautioned to give it some time and patience, but it will certainly entertain you, given the chance.",

And I&apos;m glad, because if this material had been attempted by anyone without extreme skill and sensitivity, it would have been a monstrous disaster. As it is, I don&apos;t think I would add it to my DVD collection. I don&apos;t know if I could watch it again, and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d feel comfortable people seeing it on my shelf unless they knew me well. There are moments of great hope in this movie, when you think misery may finally give way to happiness. There are moments of great honesty, when a character says just what you&apos;d expect them to say, and you realize how &quot;safe&quot; every other movie character has been in comparison. The humor that other reviews talk about is not the kind of humor that makes me laugh, personally. It&apos;s the dark, visceral humor of human weakness, meanness and even pathology. I still appreciate it for what it is, and it is used in a profound and delicate way. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to accept that life, and especially sexual life, is really much more complex and difficult than we usually admit. I recommend watching it alone, or with a friend or partner with whom you can discuss the most emotionally difficult topics. This movie will test you if you stick with it, but you&apos;ll know you saw something profound."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; is this incredible movie that is so under rated. It&apos;s the battle of the sexes and this book was written over 200 years ago! I love to know that there was this same problem that we still have to this day. That&apos;s why enjoyed &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; so much because it proves that we have so many differences from the opposite sexes. Men are usually expected to have sex and with a few clever words destroy women&apos;s reputations in minutes, while women have to be careful of sleeping with whom, because it&apos;s considered shameful.\n\nGlenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil, a proper lady with a secretive double life of sex and wishing to destroy a girl&apos;s reputation for revenge on her ex for dumping her for this young lady. She also makes a bet with her closest friend, Vicomte Sébastien de Valmont played by John Malkovich, that he could not bed a lady of such high stature and morals, in return if he succeeds, he will finally have the conquest he&apos;s been dreaming of, bedding Marquise Isabelle. I don&apos;t care what people say, this was Glenn&apos;s best performance and she was so brilliant. Her speech of &quot;Dominate your sex and avenge my own&quot; was perfect and as a woman I rooted for her in the story. She is a tragic figure that was over looked by many as just another slut. Glenn had my sympathy and I agreed with a lot of her dialog.\n\nJohn as Valmont was absolutely perfect, he&apos;s not that sexy looking but has such charm and charisma on the screen you believe him as a lady&apos;s man. &quot;It&apos;s beyond my control&quot;, he repeats this several times throughout the film and it becomes more darker each and every time he says it to Michelle&apos;s character. He does the Marquise a favor of bedding young Cecile to help the Marquise&apos;s plan of revenge and does such a good job. It was almost too easy for him, but he has a more difficult task of bedding Madame Marie de Tourvel who is married and has very high morals and standards of God and love. He falls in love with her in the process of getting to know her and is so believable, you can see how it breaks his heart to break her&apos;s. But he feels he must stand by his reputation and your own heart goes out to him despite his cruel manors as a &quot;man&quot;.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Marie de Tourvel is so beautiful and elegant and is the only one who knows of Valmont&apos;s true side. But she cannot help but fall for his charm and love for her, when she talks to his aunt, this is one of the most true speeches ever in cinema that all women can relate too &quot;I&apos;m sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it. Do you still think men love the way we do? No... men enjoy the happiness they feel. We can only enjoy the happiness we give. They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person. So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief.&quot; That is so incredibly and painfully true that Marie knows better but can&apos;t help but give herself to Valmont.\n\nSwoosie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, and Mildred Natwick are all so exceptional and amazing as well in the film. They truly bring the story to life and keep it going with their dialog and actions. Keanu? Shudder, his acting is like... how do I put this delicately? I think it&apos;s... wood. :) Otherwise, trust me this is one of the best movies of all time. This deserves higher than a 7.6 and should be in the top 250. But it&apos;s beyond my control. :D \n\n10/10",

This is an intriguing Raymond Chandler tale that has the &quot;private dick&quot; solving a murder while seeking a missing socialite. Montgomery directs himself and is primarily only seen in a scene looking in a mirror. Novelty of the camera work is clever and makes YOU part of the movie. Its pretty cool finding the clues. Very apt cast featuring Audrey Totter, Lloyd Nolan, Leon Ames and Jane Meadows. Fun to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot; is a war movie that abuses of bad clichés and is disrespectful with films such as &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; or &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot;. The unrealistic story shows, for example, an American pilot with problem on the shoulder that is capable to climb, flee from a prisoner of war camp using a rope made from clothes or roll over the wing of a Japanese airplane. Another example is the soldier that spits blood on the face of a cruel Japanese lieutenant and is surprised when he takes his saber to decapitate him, recalling &quot;Hogan&apos;s Heroes&quot;. The story is awful and a waste of time. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Regresso do Rio Kwai&quot; (&quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Midway through &quot;Prime,&quot; there&apos;s a scene in which Uma Thurman&apos;s character, Rafi, comes to her boyfriend&apos;s (Bryan Greenberg) house for dinner with his family. His mom, played by Meryl Streep, as usual giving a performance better than the movie it&apos;s in, has up until very recently been Rafi&apos;s therapist. The women must now navigate very tricky terrain. A relationship that had been maternal in one way has now become maternal in a very different way. The therapist loves Rafi and thinks she&apos;s a wonderful person, but she also knows much about her that prospective mothers-in-law don&apos;t necessarily know about their sons&apos; girlfriends, things that compound the problems raised by Rafi&apos;s not only being 14 years older than the son, but also decidedly NOT Jewish.\n\nI wish more of &quot;Prime&quot; had been about this relationship, the one between Thurman and Streep. As it is, the movie feels like it has two separate halves that the young director/writer Ben Younger doesn&apos;t successfully bring together into a comprehensive whole. The rest of the film follows Rafi and her boyfriend as they try to build a relationship despite the age difference. Nothing about this half of the movie is new or fresh, and Younger never convinced me why I should care. I was too distracted by the fact that he had a wonderful actress like Streep in his film and didn&apos;t seem to know what to do with her.\n\n&quot;Prime&quot; is far from a bad film, and given its indifferent reception when it was released in theatres, I actually expected it to be worse than it was. But it is a rather half-baked film, and not one you need to spend a lot of mental energy on, which in this case is a criticism, because it raises a lot of interesting ideas that it never explores.\n\nGrade: B-",

Of course, there were also some children&apos;s scenes, but what else is expected in a family film. Of course, there were scenes where I laughed, but it can be seen that the authors&apos; goal was to cram as many scenes into the film as possible, but not in what way. All in all a good movie for a Friday night with the whole family. But nothing special and nothing memorable.",

      "reviewBody": "Old San Francisco (1927) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nFifth Vitaphone production from Warner is silent all the way through with the exception of some sound effects used in small places. The film tells the story of a Spanish family who moved to what would become San Francisco to set up their ranch but in 1906 an evil Chinese landowner (Warner Oland) tries to steal it away. The Spanish daughter (Dolores Costello) must try and save her land even though the odds are against here and all the fighting leads up to the famous earthquake. This is a decent movie at best, which works on some levels but is rather disappointing in others. This type of revenge story isn&apos;t anything new and had been going on as early as the Griffith shorts at Biograph. Storywise nothing new is really done here but a few nice things happen with the new setting of Chinatown. Today the racial stereotypes of the Chinese folks would be considered racist but what we see here was accepted in 1927. Costello is pretty good in the lead role as she brings some energy to her character that helps the film. Oland is also very good as the Chinese man who pretends to be white in order to try and steal the land. Charles Emmett Mack and Anna May Wong have supporting roles and are pretty good as well. I&apos;m not 100% certain but the final earthquake sequence appears to have scenes borrowed from the Lon Chaney film The Shock, which was also set in San Francisco and featured the legendary earthquake. With that in mind, the final earthquake sequence really isn&apos;t that impressive but there are some newly filmed scenes mixed in of building burning and these effects look pretty good. The Vitaphone sound effects are all rather small and include a few gunshots early on, bells ringing and a few screams during the earthquake."

This movie not only enhances the struggles between drinking and growing up too fast, but it shows the love in a family. This movie would play mind games with you which would inspire you to love each character. Felicity Huffman, played Lindsay Lohan&apos;s distressed mother and slowly throughout the movie it is seen how closely alike they are. Georgia Rule was a new take on movies and if you are in for a new turn of adventure and occasional comedy kicks, Georgia Rule is it.",

      "reviewBody": "MYSTERIOUS SKIN  REVIEW 7/6/05\n\nIn his new film Greg Araki uses a prudent ploy to snag and reel you in: having the visuals effusively speak and the screenplay divulge the least amount of information necessary to keep the story evolving. Words can only reveal so much, while Araki&apos;s images display an almost unbearable amount of visceral material, exploiting vibrant color, alluring texture, dark and light, the brooding and harrowing eyes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the handsome modesty of Brady Corbet.\n\nThe film resonates on a level of rawness unseen and unfelt since Cuesta&apos;s &quot;L.I.E.&quot; or Solondz&apos;s &quot;Storytelling.&quot; The film is jarringly penetrative and pervasive: the visuals in your mind play over repeatedly and the disconcerting but intellectually uplifting feeling &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; infuses lies active long after you leave the theater. The film is not easy to digest. Seeing that there is pervasive sexual exposure between adults, as well as between adults and kids (though discreetly handled), this film will repulse many viewers. This film also had to be made.\n\nNeil (Gordon-Levitt) and Brian&apos;s (Corbet) story starts in the early 1980s when they are only eight-years-old. Neil&apos;s little league baseball coach initiates a sexual relationship, of which (most likely to the consternation of several audience members) Neil actually recounts a rosy-colored remembrance: he enjoyed it. Brian that same year describes how his perpetual and mysterious string of blackouts and bloody noses began one rainy night after a baseball game.\n\nThe story moves forward to when Neil and Brian are at adolescence&apos;s conclusion. We discover that Neil has grown up to be both gay and a hustler, while asexual Brian&apos;s free time is taken up seeking the source of and resolution to his insoluble physical ailments. Brian soon deduces that aliens abducted him and meets a fellow abductee, Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), with whom he finds ephemeral solace.\n\nNeil and Brian&apos;s story act in parallel, moving forward and backward over time, but never disjointedly. Neil eventually moves to New York, while his pining friend Eric (Jeff Licon) actually befriends Brian and an endearing friendship ensues. Neil&apos;s (unappeasable) pursuit of everlasting male love ends in the most unlikely of places: back home. Brian&apos;s pursuit of the truth leads him to, predictably, Neil. Araki exquisitely handles the ending (not divulged here) with the appropriate effusion of tendered emotion by the two main actors (warning: though the film&apos;s trailer subtlety gives away the finish). \n\nI cannot give enough plaudits to the two male leads. A long way from &quot;3rd Rock&quot;, Joe&apos;s sensuous flirtations and dynamic eyes mate well with Brady&apos;s tranquil, naive, yet profound, disposition. Brady&apos;s last scene with his character&apos;s father, as well as the climax, demonstrates his aptitude and assured longevity as an actor (beyond &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;). \n\n&quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; evidences many matches made-in-heaven: from film and director to material and actor to music and film. The film is entirely amoral, but not immoral. It is also a difficult film to watch. Many will cast it aside as tripe and trash (along with other morally relative films), but those fortunate enough to engage themselves in the movie&apos;s discussion will revel in it long after the credits&apos; close.",

      "reviewBody": "Is Greenaway our most intelligent filmmaker? One of them at least. He is master of lush self-referential allegory. Here this is hung on a mystery masquerading as restoration comedy. Just maintaining the period and manner is quite a feat.\n\nSelf-reference. The film is about an artist who creates rich images that include incongruous elements. The arrogance of the artist is balanced by his blindness as to the meaning, the context of what the images reveal. Both the artist and the viewers are confused by the meaning and flummoxed by the events that the meaning triggers. Greenaway clearly means this to extend to himself, his film and the incompleteness of what we the viewers see. The drawings and the drawer&apos;s hands are in fact his.\n\nFantasy-allegory. This is a film richer in symbology than Drowning and Cook, but probably less so than the later `book&apos; movies. Great attention has been spent on recondite supplementary images, including a central painting in the house being itself painted by the draftsman and filmmaker. I viewed it (the whole film) once just for details. The living statue is only the most obvious illogical element, and in fact draws attention away from other smaller visual diversions.\n\nMystery artifice. The whole environment is one of genteel artifice, hiding cruel mechanics of conspiracy. The cleverness of the construction is that Greenaway and us are full conspirators. No one, not us, him or the characters shown fully understand what is going on. The mystery form has always been a dialog between artist and consumer, a contest to see who can outwit whom. Very clever use of the mystery form here to include us in the artifice by not ever `playing fair.&apos;\n\nRestoration comedy. Past the visual allegory and the fantasy mystery and the self-reference is a restoration comedy which taken straight is hilarious. The statue is from this form.\n\nMy only criticisms are minor. This film contains a restrained story, and incidentally all sex takes place offscreen. Why be so conservative in these areas? Also, Lady Herbert required a more powerful actress I think."

Especially from the main actors, the ones we have to look at in close-ups: the dead-fish stare with the eyes bugging out, the hyperventilating laborious wheezing breathing, the screaming.....OH MY GOSH, the screaming, you can see it coming a mile away, and you just get ready for it....the same garbage that&apos;s presented in pretty much every D-rated j-horror films just like this one. This film has no substance, over 2 hrs long, that&apos;s just too much of the wheezy screaming and bugged-out eyes for me. Just another lousy attempt to make those pop idols into actors, so someone can make a paycheck. Pass on this one, or check Wikipedia to get the run down on the story, if you really must know. In my opinion, the first one is still the best, the second-a complete mess, and this one is just unbearable. I&apos;ve seen ratings 10 out of 10, really??!? Well, it takes all kinds...they must the idols&apos; fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Essentially seen by many as a warped sex fantasy that uses the codes and conventions of the detective thriller to disguise a darker, more psychological film about the wayward perversions and sinister desires of a seemingly affluent area of contemporary Madrid; Matador (1986) can also be seen as a not-so-subtle comment on the nature of modern-day relationships, aspirations and obsessions in a meta-textual form that makes continual use of its titular, bullfighting motif. Although it does have some slight thematic problems, particularly in terms of the overall tone of the film and eventual motivation of the characters, it is, nonetheless, one of Almodóvar&apos;s most interesting and perplexing films of this particular period; featuring a refinement of many of his earliest interests and characteristics from films like Dark Habits (1983) and What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1984), as well as being the film that signalled the move into the second phase of his career.\n\nAs the implications of the title would suggest, the film&apos;s narrative is bolstered by numerous references, both spoken and visual, to the obvious role-play and iconography of the bullfight. It is also a film about violence, and the sexuality of violence; an uncomfortable idea that is reinforced by the film&apos;s provocative opening sequence, in which we find the central matador of the title, Diego Montes, masturbating to violent scenes of exploitation cinema. The scene establishes the nature of the matador, both as a character and as a social phenomenon, as well as introducing the link between sex and death that will come to form an important thematic strand to the narrative. As the story progresses, the mechanisms of the drama conspire to throw together two separate characters that come to complement the unspoken desires and murderous lust that they seemingly share with one another, with the eventual courtship and inevitable seduction presented by the director as a surrogate bullfight in its self.\n\nWhere the film falls apart slightly is in the presentation of the character played by Antonio Banderas, a hyper-sensitive, implied homosexual who idolises the matador to the extent that he actually attempts to rape his young, fashion-model girlfriend (an act that eventually leads him to confess to a string of serial killings as a result of his mother&apos;s enforced, catholic guilt). It is a complex character, impeccably performed by the young Banderas, but his appearance ultimately sends the film off on a tangent that detracts from the central crux of the drama. Though the inclusion of this subplot does allow Almodóvar the chance to make a satirical comment on the nature of everything from fashion, to religion, sexuality, etc, these themes often feel like they&apos;ve been handpicked from a completely different film, not always complimenting the central story, and too often leading it in directions that in the end feel unfinished or slightly unformed. Many of these loose ends can be glossed over, while some (the last minute implication of &quot;second sight&quot; as suggested by a solar eclipse) really seem to come out of leftfield.\n\nNevertheless, these are minor criticisms that don&apos;t necessarily destroy the ultimate intentions of the film - which really only become clear in the final scene - or the fantastic direction of Almodóvar and the performances of his cast. Although Matador certainly has its flaws (not to mention its detractors), it is, in my opinion, a fine little film and one of Almodóvar&apos;s most original and audacious creations. The performances are all incredibly committed, including the central pairing of Assumpta Serna and the late Nacho Martínez, as well the fine support from Banderas, the gorgeous Eva Cobo and Almodóvar regulars Carman Maura and Eusebio Poncela; whilst the central idea behind the script and the bold stokes of the director&apos;s intuitive grasp of the various film-making processes further refines and develops a number of themes that have come to be at the forefront of Almodóvar&apos;s career for the last twenty-five years."

The plot development was decidedly leisurely in the first half of the film, but this was not a game-breaker as far as my enjoyment of the movie. However, compared to all the other versions on this story that I&apos;ve seen, I found this French effort to bring an element of earthy realism (best way I can describe it) to the story that the others lacked. The scene where the gamekeeper and Lady Chatterley &quot;decorate&quot; each other with flowers and subsequently disport themselves outside in the field and woods is a particularly interesting and memorable sequence. One minor quibble: the film seemed to both begin and end rather abruptly...you&apos;ll know what I mean when you watch it.",

But this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity. The superstitions, the epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the West had in the times of Homer but that is now, unfortunately, completely foreign to most of us in the &quot;developed&quot; world. We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life, often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. The film makers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scrappy saltmen. And made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture. So disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the driveway lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure.",

Of course, the best thing about it is Sonny Chiba&apos;s absolute commitment to doing everything in the most macho, accentuated way possible.  I hate to be a copycat, but &quot;Injured ape with respiratory problems&quot; is the perfect way to describe his fighting style. Sonny does some pretty weird poses, and kind of slouches and stutter-steps around like James Dean doing improvisational ballet.  That, and the thirty second pauses he takes between beating up people to breathe/twist face/grunt/breathe/try to breathe/twist face, grunt are priceless.  I think you can really see his ninjitsu training in this film.  He does a lot of wasteful movements.  I recommend the film, but the guy in no way could be called the successor to Bruce Lee."

The film lacks the playful free-form structure of his earlier &apos;Tampopo&apos;, but compensates with more of the same inflated, deadpan humor, diluted here by a cruel (but not incompatible) streak of anger no doubt reflecting the director&apos;s own relationship with the Japanese IRS. Itami&apos;s heroine is a plucky, incorruptible Internal Revenue agent (played by his own off-screen wife) involved in a high-tech, fast-paced game of cat-and-mouse with a ruthless, lecherous businessman trying to protect his illicit income by any means possible. Her single-minded pursuit of the Almighty Yen in the service of her government is no less compulsive than the creative tax-dodges of her money-hungry target, and the exaggerated methods of detection and evasion give the film an irresistible comic energy. The tempo doesn&apos;t really take off until the second hour, when the entire team of tax agents joins the chase, and their obsessive devotion to duty carries the film beyond the level of absurdity, transforming a colorless world of glorified accountants into an exciting, romantic adventure and showing just how shark-like the lure of money can be, on both sides of the law.",

The film manages to capture the down to earth feel of the original television-series while at the same time take it beyond with a colourful and humorous cast of characters.\n\nThe combination of authentically grimy make-up and costumes, utilization of Finnish nature for the film&apos;s setting and the usage of specifically late 80s/early 90s music gives the film a great hypered atmosphere and undoubtedly makes it exciting to watch for children and adults alike. The film also has some hidden adult references but these are thankfully neither dominating nor derailing to the film (unlike say &apos;The Cat in the Hat&apos;). Instead their subtlety serves the film&apos;s over all feeling.\n\nThe only slight complaints one could have about the movie is that its narrative, while dramatic and well paced is not perhaps very original and there undoubtedly is a pretty blatant environmentalist under-current to the movie. Also, the physical appearance of the &quot;Trashers&quot; loses the comical double-meaning these characters had in the original television series, but as their Evil Cult adds to the drama of the film, I can&apos;t complain too much.\n\nBest of all, the base essentials of what makes a Rölli movie worth watching, Allu Tuppurainen&apos;s physical performance and songs are also in place and definitely add to the movie over-all. This is without a doubt not only the best film adaption of the character but also one of the better fantasy movies to have ever been made in Finland.",

      "reviewBody": "As a filmmaker and happily married man Alain Cavalier leads an unremarkable life for the most part. However, it is the little moments that one experiences life and deals with injury and death that the true tale of humanity lies. In this respect, Cavalier has produced a remarkable snapshot that is at times intimate and others extremely impersonal.\n\nThe past decade (1994-2005) that is covered in the film starts with the director and his wife filming a gorgeous sunset on a beach. As the years past Cavalier becomes enamored of catching his wife &apos;Francoise&apos; asleep only to capture her rude awakenings. He also coaxes her to bare her nude body for the camera which may seem perverse, but later it&apos;s learned her wonderful breasts could possibly fall victim to a mastectomy and his film is preserving the memory of her anatomy.\n\nSimilarly, episodes involving his father and mother precede their eventual deaths each in succession. Then Cavalier himself is struck with skin cancer around his nasal area which allows him to candidly reveal this painful experience which forces him to get reconstructive surgery.\n\nThis is case where the filmmaker is not only the observer, but the subject and in many cases he uses the camera as his confessor. Not for all tastes, but if you have a streak of humanism within you then this is one human being you will want to acquaint yourself with. His wife is a delight too!",

      "reviewBody": "When you are used to get great things, and you expect them again, the average won&apos;t satisfy you.\n\nThis happened to me when I saw this Danish movie. As a person who adores movies from Northern Europe, especially when it comes to children in movies (regardless if it is a kid&apos;s movie or an adult drama with kids in important roles), and finding Danish movies usually even better than their northern neighbors, I expected too much.\n\nOskar &amp; Josefine is made after a TV serial as a sequel. Though it is more than obvious throughout the movie, there is no problem to understand the plot because of the introduction sufficient to those who haven&apos;t seen the serial (like me).\n\nThe serial was a fairy tale for younger kids. The actors in the movie are a bit older, and so are the characters, they are a boy and girl who are in love and going on vacation together (though they go to boy&apos;s grandparents and though it is Denmark, we can assume that the authors aren&apos;t persuading us they are 12). But the plot is again a fantasy in a fairy tale style, so the target audience appears to be rather unclear. Kids who watch the movie must have some knowledge of history and other subjects (not easy for 9 or 10 years old, who would maybe otherwise be interested in such a fairy tale), but the knowledge of characters is also sometimes surprisingly weak. Just for example, Josefine, a girl old enough to go with her boyfriend on vacation, and who has already saved Jesus and Christianity (in serial) doesn&apos;t know what antibiotics are.\n\nMovie for younger kids, though a fairy tale, can still be enjoyable for the whole family. Ronja Rövardotter maybe pushed the standards unreachably high, but it&apos;s not the only good one. This one is watchable, but nothing more.\n\nI have another problem with Oskar &amp; Josefine. Teenager traveling through time in North European movie reminds me in a second on Sofies verden, unbelievably intelligent movie (for a bit older audience, again the one very suitable for adults as well), who succeeded on different levels so can be watched as an adventure (from early years, though preteens might be bored), SF (not for hard-core fans), semi-documentary (a lot of facts that can make adults repeat their history and philosophy lessons) and a real art movie with references from Carroll&apos;s Alice to Fahrenheit 451. People who haven&apos;t seen Sophies verden are in advantage when watching Oskar &amp; Josefine, because they won&apos;t compare these two movies (and the latter is weaker in any aspect you analyze).\n\nThe choice of actors was not perfect either. Not only age-plot relation, but their acting wasn&apos;t impressive as Danish (and Scandinavian) kids usually act. There is a strong hollywoodisation of Danish cinema in new millennium. But the work with young actors has never lost its quality that hasn&apos;t been achieved almost anywhere else. Pernille Kaae Hoier is no Sarah Juel Werner or Line Kruse - but this role would be perfect for Julie Zangenberg, whose age would fit as well. Instead of Mikkel Konyher I would prefer to see Adam Gilbert Jespersen or Anastasios Soulis (from Sweden, but borders were never a problem in North Europe), however as a couple Julia Krohn and Bernhard Naglestad from Norwegian movie Ikke naken would fit the best.\n\nOn the other hand, adult actors played just the way this movie needed. Average photography and music won&apos;t be remembered after the closing credits.\n\nSo if you are not familiar with Danish movies, don&apos;t start with this one. You might give up with further explorations, what would be a great loss considering how great Danish cinematography is.",

Then , a gang of pirates attacks the lighthouse .The pirates (Aldo Sambrell, Jean Claude Drout, Tito Garcia, among others) are fiercely commanded by Kongre (Yul Brynner). Handsome hero named Will Denton (Kirk Douglas) with only company a little monkey , suffering misfortunes for the conditions in which unlucky is forced to exist . Denton soon realizes that the island in the base of pirates who lure ships to their doom on the rocky coast and they arrange shipwrecks for profits and eventually appearing castaways (Samantha Eggar and Renato Salvatori) who are cast adrift and ashore. Later on , Will Denton discovers the truth and confronts Kongre in a fight to death. Jules Verne Takes You Over the Edge of the World!\n\nThis is an enjoyable Spain /Liechtenstein /United States co-production financed by Alfredo Matas, Ilya Salkind and Kirk Douglas himself . A breathtaking adventure with tension , suspense, thrills , violence and good action scenes . Some fierce hand-to hand combats and pursuits scenes will have you on the edge of your armchair. However , the ending is some ridiculous , unconvincing and overblown. Spectacular landscapes shot in Spain : Cadaques and Manga Mar Menor, great location-footage of both locations , the Spaniard coast is the best thing about this spectacular movie. Starring duo is frankly extraordinary . Kirk Douglas gives vigorous physical performance, he&apos;s magnificent as individualist, stubborn hero , similar to his roles in ¨Spartacus¨, ¨Vikings¨,¨Ulysses¨ and ¨20000 leagues under the sea¨(also by Jules Verne)¨. Impressive Yul Brynner , as usual , playing exotic roles , such as ¨Taras Bulba¨, ¨Salomon¨, ¨The buccaneer and ¨King and I ¨. They&apos;re accompanied by a lot of familiar Spanish secondaries , most of then regular in Spaghetti/Paella Western and terror genres , such as : Aldo Sambrell , Fernando Rey, Tito García , Víctor Israel , Tony Skios and Luis Barboo .\n\nThe film displays a colorful cinematography by cameramen Henri Decae and Cecilio Paniagua , furthermore evocative and thrilling musical score by Piero Piccioni . The picture was regularly directed by Kevin Billington , though being decent enough . This is a highly agreeable movie and suits marvelously . I can recommend this work to everybody who enjoy good adventures and spectacular maritime outdoors , however no for small kids by violent and realistic scenes.",

Thus, I am not about to disclose the story line, not that there is a single one, nor will I use this forum to say something profoundly philosophical about the meaning of life within the time dimension. The low score by a very few here @ IMDb doesn&apos;t surprise me. This film is not for everyone. I think I myself wouldn&apos;t have liked it so much a few years ago, there has to exist a collection of experiences to develop a certain affinity with the imagery on the screen, or perhaps it&apos;s simple aging that does it... Anyhow, Marlen Khutsiev is one of the few really talented Soviet directors who knows what the cinema is about and how it&apos;s done. By the way, he considers this to be his best work, and I must agree, at least for me &apos;Beskonechnost&apos; is by leaps and bounds the greatest film he made, and he made some culturally very important ones throughout the whole post-Stalin era. Kudos to Berlin festival for the recognition. Thus far, I don&apos;t know of any subtitled version of this movie. Russian DVDs obviously exist, unfortunately without subtitles. As a sad post-scriptum, Russians by large don&apos;t like this film much, it&apos;s simply on another plane of existence for the brain-washed masses being fed pop culture of the worst kind amidst the carefully placed bits like Ukrainians and Georgians are bad.

      "reviewBody": "On the surface, Francois Truffaut&apos;s Mississippi Mermaid is a taut, well- made Hitchcockian thriller that features good looking actors (including the alluring, icy blonde), exciting chases and bizarre circumstances. However, Truffaut gives the story his own twist by focusing on the characteristic of obsession and how it claws at the protagonist and affects his judgment. \n\nJean-Paul Belmondo puts aside his typical suave and cool demeanor to play a wealthy but lonely and somewhat naive tobacco plantation owner who puts in a request for a mail-order bride, only to discover that she looks like Catherine Deneuve. Naturally, he is taken under her spell and soon discovers she is much more duplicitous than he expected. Many film lovers may know this story better as it was remade in 2001 with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie as Original Sin. Despite having not seen that film, I am confident it cannot be better than this version for two reasons. First of all, Truffaut is a much better director, able to seemingly tie all these various strings together into a coherent and plausible story. Second, there is no way Banderas and Jolie could match the sizzling chemistry between Belmondo and Deneuve. They are capable of being remarkably sexy and sultry without resorting to complete nakedness. This is a sign of true thespian abilities. \n\nWhile not one of Truffaut&apos;s stronger works such as his Antoine Doinel series or Jules and Jim, it is still an entertaining romantic thriller that manages to be both romantic and thrilling. Given the status of many of these types of films recently, there is plenty of reason to revisit this New Wave example.",

      "reviewBody": "Not so much about the particular party politics as it is about the pride of Ghana. Abolishes media induced stereotypes and gives a true picture and feel of an election and life in an African country. \n\nMore important than the outcome of the dramatically close election is the necessity to prove to the world and even more than that to set the foundation for Ghana pride through the upholding of the solid legitimacy of the election. We don&apos;t know how the election will turn out and that is exciting but even more so we root for a peaceful democratic election that may seem questionable based on media induced notions. It proves to the world influenced by the media, who plagues Africa with the stereotypical political corruption and anarchy, how solid, serious and legitimate the process is and how far Ghana and Africa have come. A multi stepped detailed process entailing the upholding of the constitution, the hard work of the neutral election committee and the people&apos;s heart and soul lining up to place their ballots with zeal. All to ensure Ghana elects the rightful leader and upholds democracy as well as any nation on the globe could. \n\nRiveting and intense the close election and the outcome make an unpredictable edge of your seat thriller that not only entertains but informs. We learn about party politics (not so much the individual politics of Ghana&apos;s leaders rather more general notions of partisan politics), we are exposed to an interesting gueveraesque revolutionary history with charismatic leaders that has not been overly delved into and is probably not that well known by most westerners and we get a life on the streets feel where we arm chair travel so that we briefly feel and witness the country, the people and the continent. The rapid shots were intense but a slower passed editing style is more favorable to absorb some of the scenes and more fully transport to Ghana. The access to both the top leaders and the election committee will amaze. It is probably the closest any filmmaker has gotten to both opposing party leaders at that highest level. A great documentary!",

Up to that point, the film was for the most part believable, and it was totally unnecessary to jazz up the ending. Reality plays far better than conjecture, so the confusing conclusion was out of place. You can watch &quot;He Was a Quiet Man&quot; as many times as you want, to speculate. I on the other hand would have preferred simple entertainment, which until the end, this movie was. My conclusion ...................................This movie is good for awhile, but the ending drags the whole thing down a couple notches. - MERK",

The policeman&apos;s frustration and skepticism is beautifully portrayed, so his loyalty to his new-won friend/pal in the end, which inspires a hidden homosexual colleague to step forward in the open. His anxiety of the possibility to having had sex with a man is taken seriously and the trust he experiences from the gay man is beautifully returned, especially in the bathing scene. A handsome actor giving life beautifully to the character of Edgar, the openly gay man, as a good guy. The story is not a happy-ending and in another way it is. The film showing Edgar as not taking advantage of the situation, being kind and respectful to his new friend. Unusually showing the gay man as a normal masculine guy with masculine interests without being outrageous in any way. Just normal! \n\nA heart warming film which should be recommended for viewing in schools.",

      "reviewBody": "Jesus Franco has made so many movies that it&apos;s almost inevitable that he will occasionally get one right. This is one of those movies where his bizarro and repetitive plots, his pan-and-zoom-happy cinematography, and his obtrusive jazz score all manage to gel for a pretty dumb but thoroughly enjoyable movie. It helps, of course, that this was one of only four films he made with the incredible Soledad Miranda before her untimely death in the early 1970&apos;s. There&apos;s no denying that Franco&apos;s regular collaborator (and wife), Lina Romay, was a very sexy actress in her prime and has become something of a legend in her own right, but she is a pale shadow of Soledad Miranda, who was if anything even more beautiful and had a kind of class and talent that none of Franco&apos;s later actresses could ever hope to emulate.\n\nThe plot is about as simple as you get--this is yet another Franco knock-off of &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; with Miranda avenging herself on the scientists who drove her husband to suicide by censuring his morally dubious embryo research. Of course, this involves getting them all in bed (including the one woman, who is naturally a lesbian). This makes for some interesting (and sometimes disturbing) scenes--a nude woman being smothered with a see-through plastic throw pillow, a single trickle of blood running down Miranda&apos;s bare thigh after she stabs one poor guy in the back (while he is apparently licking the lint from her belly button), and, perhaps most disturbing of all, Howard Vernon, Dr. Orloff himself, in the altogether(shudder!). Like any good Franco movie this film is deliciously perverse. Miranda&apos;s murderous campaign against these hapless souls is every bit as morally questionable as her husbands grisly experiments. She manages to achieve an uneasy combination of touchingly sympathetic, voraciously sexy, and frighteningly psychotic. Her last two victims (one of who is Franco himself) realize exactly who she is and know she is going to kill them, but they can&apos;t resist her anymore than a male praying mantis can resist the female who is going to rip him apart and eat him.\n\nIs this is perfect movie? Well, no. The whole premise is completely ridiculous and it has the most unconvincing fatal car crash in cinema history near the end. But it sure is a lot of fun to watch."

One could even get away with calling this spy/thriller/buddy with a dash of comedy formulaic. Maybe it is. I might just be fooled by the foreign language, but Secret Reunion Is not just familiar, but fresh. The film hinges on the relationship between two opposing intelligence agents. Both have been abandoned by country and separated from family. Kang-ho Song plays the damaged bumbling South Korean field agent. I enjoyed his performance more than anything in this film. I cannot logically justify this, but this is the third film were he felt like a Korean Humphrey Boggart. Yes this is crazy, but how could I better articulate this man&apos;s natural charisma? Dong-won Kang has a tougher roll as the desperate emotional despondent North Korean operative. His character was just written uninteresting, but he holds his own while interacting Song. Perhaps a weakness of the film is that I enjoy it when these two simply coexisting more than when they are chasing each other. I guess something has to justify the action sequences. Nothing surprising here, except possibly the institution of foreign brides to western audiences. A sociologist might find its portrayal interesting, I just enjoyed how it forced Song to reach for moral justifications. Otherwise, the story is cookie cutter and wraps up so unrealistically clean you would think Reunion briefly teleported to Hollywood. But hey, Casablanca was made by recipe, so I can give this movie half a pass. It is hard to completely recommend a benign spy film. I think those who have previously other Korean smash hits will dig Secret Reunion. Song&apos;s performance provides just enough to outshine the truly mediocre. Just please don&apos;t ignore this endorsement because of the insane Boggart comparison.",

      "reviewBody": "So I begin my selection of this year&apos;s SIFF with a documentary. Directed by Erwin Wagenhofer, We Feed the World begins by highlighting a very fundamental wastage. That of overnight bread, tons of it being offloaded, meant for the incinerated, when there are thousands left hungry.\n\nThe documentary focuses on various aspects on the supply side of the food chain, giving some insight to the various industries which produce food, like fishing, vegetables and poultry. It also provides a glimpse into the political side of supplying food, that of the profit maximization strategy of any public company (here, it&apos;s Nestle), of the genetically modified seeds which supposedly produces superior crop as opposed to better tasting, natural ones, and various EU plans and initiatives which seem to go down the wrong path instead of fulfilling its supposedly planned objectives.\n\nWhile it covers a lot of ground, some segments proved to be a little draggy and preachy. I particularly enjoyed the segment on the fishing industry, where there are plans to wrest knowledge from the small timers operating smaller fishing operations, and to eventually merge/close them down when the bigger boys come into the picture. As demonstrated in the movie, there are reasons why big trawlers doesn&apos;t equate to fresher and better catches.\n\nThe other segment which moved was on the Brazilian&apos;s poor north-eastern parts, where on one hand, you have very poor people going hungry all the time, yet Brazil&apos;s one of the major exporters of maize to Europe. Maize which are used for burning for fuel generation. It just boggles the mind, and makes you feel sad at the way things work, illogical as it may seem, in the name of profit - watching the kids drink untreated murky water, and the adults resorting to unnatural means of keeping their children alive, will gloom your day.\n\nAnd I could have swore off chicken come the final segment. Nowadays lifestock are treated as an 8-week cycle of a production line, from incubating, hatching, fattening, until the final days of slaughtering, where they&apos;re hung upside down by the legs in conveyor belts, before passing through a circular bladed discs where their throats are slit, and left bleeding till death. For those which are missed by the blades, there is a butcher on standby with a knife to do the deed.\n\nBut while the movie tried to made its points, what I found lacking are the many ways in which to link the message to the issues. Many times it felt a little sporadic, or the linking done quite weakly through intertitles. That aside, perhaps I&apos;m already attuned to the more in-your-face style of Michael Moore, nevermind if there are echoes that his style is manipulative. For a topic like this, perhaps it could gain from that bit of controversy to hammer its opinions through.",

      "reviewBody": "This is almost a flawless film, the minor setbacks being the musical numbers - even though the songs are very good, the dances are not well staged and during the final revue the male dancers actually look as if they have no choreography at all! Probably the good choreographers were busy staging some Marika Rökk musical in another studio... And the ladies&apos; orchestra with their instruments of glass don&apos;t seem to have any idea how to hold a trumpet or clarinet in their hands! The poor girl who is required to portray the trumpet player probably hadn&apos;t seen this instrument blown in real life and looks more as if she is trying to suck the music out of the horn. If you are willing to turn a blind eye, you&apos;ll have a well written and directed film with very fresh actors. Some of the dialog between the two leads is really heartwarming. A good film indeed.",

I give it a 7/10 because its fun and enjoyable. If u are a Fantozzi fan u will enjoy,if u don&apos;t know who he is and if u never watched one of the movies of the series,I recommend starting with the first one.",

I do not speak German very well, however, this was not a deterrent in watching the movie in German, as the acting was very good, meaningful, nothing very dramatic and extremely to the point. The story line is very well adapted, although there are some loose ends here and there and the screenplay is exciting especially with the character development of the kids in the flat living with the (wretched) man, earning a living through stealing and giving away almost all the money to him! It is quite a real-life portrayal of such type of crimes which still exists in a developed country like Germany.\n\nI must recommend it to everyone who wants to feel for the people who are victims of such terrible crimes and maybe some eyes open to seeing the unfairness that exists all over.\n\nAgain, very well made and definitely a must watch!",

The script to the Hot Chick is surprisingly good and well-organized (though it&apos;s premise is basically a raunchier riff on 80s body switch movies like vice-versa and freaky friday without any moralizing). It may not be original (similar to my other favorite comedy so far this year, old school) and it may not win any oscars , but it&apos;s funny, follows an established formula well, and doesn&apos;t deteriorate in the third act like a lot of comedies I&apos;ve seen as of late into moralizing or seemingly tacked on drama. Rob Schneider and Anna Farris are incredibly funny together. Watch for a cameo by Adam Sandler. If youre in the mood for citizen kane or next year&apos;s oscar winners, look elsewhere. If you&apos;re in the mood for good, dumb, fairly raunchy fun to watch with a couple of friends - this movie&apos;s great.",

      "reviewBody": "Man in the Attic is directed by Hugo Fregonese and adapted to screenplay by Robert Presnell Jr. and Barré Lyndon from the novel The Lodger written by Marie Belloc Lowndes. It stars Jack Palance, Constance Smith, Byron Palmer, Frances Bavier and Rhys Williams. Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Lee Tover.\n\n1888, Whitechapel, London, and as the murders continue, perpetrated by the man known as Jack the Ripper, the mysterious Mr. Slade (Palance) rents out the upper rooms of the Harley household...\n\nJack the Ripper was popular for transference to film and literature even back when the 20th century was born, now in the 21st century nothing has changed. It&apos;s a name synonymous with dastardly slaying&apos;s in foggy Victorian London, a name that conjures up images of British coppers chasing their tails while Jolly Jack went about his bloody business, only to then vanish like a plume of smoke in the wind.\n\nMarie Belloc Lowndes&apos; novel has been mined a few times, with a couple of film makers following the source and choosing to reveal from the off the Ripper and put &quot;him&quot; front and centre as the antagonist. In fact for this version there is an out and out motive offered up. Fregonese&apos;s film lacks the class and quality of production that John Brahm&apos;s 1944 version has, or the twist of Hitchcock, but that doesn&apos;t mean Man in the Attic should be dismissed. And rightly so.\n\nIt lacks a mystery element for sure, that feeling of not knowing for sure the who, whys, motives and means etc, but it doesn&apos;t lack for atmosphere, period design or strong leading man performance. This is very much one for fans of fog bound cobbled streets, of gas lamps and watery canal side blackness. Where coppers sport a truncheon as their major weapon, the whistle their call to arms. That the murders are off screen and thrust into our mind&apos;s eye is also a select film fan requirement, as too is the odd leap of faith as regards stupidity of none Ripper characters. But this does a fine job for those inclined towards such Victorian eeriness.\n\nMusical interludes halt the mood, even though they please (and stimulate as regards Smith&apos;s wonderful legs), yet it also brings to light a community trying to carry on with wine and a song as blood was adorning those cobbled streets outside. This is far from perfect as a Ripper thriller, yet still it has much to recommend for a viewing on a dark winters night. 7/10",

As y&apos;all may have gathered from my reviews I&apos;m a huge Shinobu Yaguchi fan I love his movies Swing Girls and Water Boys they have a certain brand of humour that&apos;s just so funny- people act in the craziest of ways like no human would and that heightens the whole experience, there&apos;s no real antagonist- only accumulated craziness and fun that&apos;s not only from the protagonist but the surrounding cast as well- it&apos;s as if the world Shinobu Yaguchi directs is a cartoonish version of the real world which I do appreciate since reality is seldom fun.\n\nThe Secret Garden follows Sakiko a girl that is obsessed with money since childhood, that obsession leads her to do such funny and actually great (?) things that normal people would get commended for if they did, many people usually talk about being particularly inspired by noble things such as knowledge, strength etc... but in Sakiko&apos;s case her sole driving motive is only money which is so funny because movies usually depict money-hungry people as people doomed and immoral so it&apos;s funny to see how the other extreme looks like and it&apos;s funny as heck.\n\nThe comedy is tightly packed in this 1 hr 23 min movie giving you almost no place to rest, if it would&apos;ve been longer then it wouldn&apos;t have made sense so I really appreciate that it&apos;s short!\n\nThe cinematography is also simple and effective, very great shots throughout the movie, it looks gorgeous even if it was made 1997- also the soundtrack with Irish motifs (perhaps a hint on the luck of the Irish/leprechauns with money?) is so funny, it gives the movie a jolly tone throughout.\n\nCheck this movie out for a fun romp that&apos;ll tickle your funny bone. Shinobu Yaguchi is such a talented director!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Aviator&quot;--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese&apos;s lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here&apos;s the rundown:\n\nThe first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes&apos; bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since &quot;Goodfellas.&quot; The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.\n\nThe rest of the film, despite Scorsese&apos;s amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes&apos; obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous &quot;Spruce Goose.&quot; It&apos;s all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.\n\nAs for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor&apos;s director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he&apos;s impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in &quot;Casino&quot; and Cameron Diaz in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face. \n\nIn the end, &quot;The Aviator&quot; flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation.",

      "name": "West German Adventure Flick with Michele MERCIER and Richard JOHNSON",
      "reviewBody": "Rapid-Film&apos;s flagship project: A German-French-Italian costume ham by Christian-Jaque\n\nAt the time, this lavishly produced costume film was one of the most expensive West German films ever, costing 5.3 million DM. The director was the veteran Christian-Jaque (1904-1994), who has already produced such classics as &quot;Fanfan la Tulipe&quot; with Gerard Philippe and Gina Lollobrigida, &quot;Madame sans Gene&quot; with Sophia Loren and Robert Hossein, and &quot;The Black Tulip&quot; with Alain Delon and Virna Lisi and of course &quot;LE GENTLEMAN DE COCODY / Powder Keg and Diamonds&quot; with Liselotte Pulver and Jean Marais. In the 1980s, the busy Christian-Jaque contributed two of the then very popular ZDF Advent four-part series: &quot;Race to Bombay&quot; (1981) with Christian Kohlund and Manfred Seipold and &quot;The Man from Suez&quot; (1983) with Horst Frank and Constanze Engelbrecht. The life story of Lady Hamilton was produced by Wolf C. Hartwig (1919-2017), who worked his way into the top ranks of German film producers over the course of the 1960s with his exotic adventure films, which often starred Brad Harris. His greatest successes with the unspeakable films in the Schoolgirl Report film series were still to come.\n\nIn England in the early 19th century, we as viewers see how the young farm maid Emily Lyon (Michele Mercier, known from the &quot;Angelique&quot; films) confronts the strapping neighbor boy Dick Strong (Howard Ross, who turned 80 on January 10, 2021). !) and has to fend off his demanding advances again. By chance, a passing painter (Boy Gobert) sees the buxom provincial beauty and makes her his favorite nude model. With him in London she meets a lot of people like the prosperous Dr. Graham (Dieter Borsche, who formed dream couples in the West German film industry with both Maria Schell and Ruth Leuwerik in the 1950s) and the lovely brothel mother Mrs Love (Gisela Uhlen, 1919-2007). The career path of the easy-going Emily seems predetermined. But one should not underestimate the ambition of this voluptuous beauty! Instead of just becoming the lover of the young and irresponsible Harry Featherstone (Harald Leipnitz, native of Wuppertal!), she even marries his uncle Lord William Hamilton (John Mills, 1908-2005, known from &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; ) and becomes Lady Emma Hamilton. Together with her much older husband, she moves to Naples, where her husband becomes the English ambassador to the court of Queen Maria Carolina of Naples (Nadja Tiller). Even though Emma is genuinely devoted to her old husband, he cannot even come close to satisfying her excessive physical needs. The good guy also sees this, so the two lovebirds can have an open marriage. It&apos;s a good thing that the Queen of Naples, a daughter of Maria Theresia and sister of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette, also cast a benevolent eye on the lavishly endowed Emma. Unfortunately, the two ladies&apos; happiness in love is soon affected when Emma meets the love of her life in Lord Horatio Nelson (Richard Johnson). The overthrow plans of the evil Prince Caracciolo (Venantino Venantini, whose facial features are also known from &quot;A Zombie Hung on a Bell Rope&quot; and &quot;Fair Game&quot; with Cindy Crawford and William Baldwin) cause additional confusion.\n\nThis film has a large star cast and actually offers everything that makes a great epic. You can really see how they want to compete with &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. But despite all the slipperiness that was now possible in 1968 and that goes beyond that of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, the spark doesn&apos;t quite ignite. This is mainly due to the two main actors Michele Mercier and Richard Johnson (1927-2015, who was also seen in &quot;Deadlier than the Male&quot; and &quot;Woodoo Island of the Zombies&quot;), who do not do justice to their roles Lovers cannot convince. That&apos;s why you can&apos;t really be excited about the fate of the country bittern, who achieves great advancement and falls in love with the greatest war hero. The film is certainly an interesting museum piece from the good old days of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Denys de la Patelliere in unlikely to belong in anyone&apos;s Pantheon of great directors but his straightforward, understated style suits this material admirably.\n\nAdapted by the director and Réne Havard from the latter&apos;s novel, the film&apos;s slow pacing enhances the dynamic between the five protagonists whilst the editing of Jacqueline Thiedot maintains the tension throughout, especially in the gripping minefield sequence.\n\nThe film also has the brilliant Michel Audiard written all over it with many quotable lines, not least &quot;Two sitting intellectuals won&apos;t go as far as one walking brute.&quot; The &apos;intellectuals&apos; in this instance are played by Charles Aznavour and Maurice Biraud whilst the &apos;brute&apos; is, unsurprisingly, Lino Ventura. Making up the quintet are Germán Cobos, here &apos;dubbed&apos; by Marcel Bozzufi and Hardy Kruger whose role as an infuriatingly clever German made him perfect casting as the even more infuriating Dorfmann in &apos;Flight of the Pheonix&apos; four years later.\n\nFor those interested in such things, should the ongoing musical theme sound familiar, it is an arrangement of the nineteenth century French Christmas carol &apos;Les Anges dans nos Compagne&apos;\n\nOnce again Charles Aznavour&apos;s screen presence overcomes his diminuitive stature and he fulfils the promise of his earlier performance in Franju&apos;s &apos;La Tete contre les murs&apos; whilst the role of Theo not only solidifies Lino Ventura&apos;s popularity but also enables him to shake off his &apos;gangster&apos; image. De la Patelliere was one of Jean Gabin&apos;s preferred directors during his later years and as Ventura matured he was to assume Gabin&apos;s mantle.\n\nInspired by the true story of two soldiers, a German and a Dane who aided each other having lost their way in Finland, the message of this piece is that even in the worst of times, Humanity can transcend borders and nationality.",

      "reviewBody": "Handsome but dull western (courtesy of Spanish landscapes) to depict Custer on a mission to steal land from the Indians. A blond ROBERT SHAW looks convincing enough on horseback but something about his accent seems wrong and charisma is lacking. The Indians look more European than like American Indians and too many of the action scenes are slow paced and repetitive as Custer and his men go on various missions.\n\nMARY URE as his wife, Libby, has little to do but register impatience with being kept in the background between battles with long waits before she shares the screen with real-life hubby, ROBERT SHAW. A more mature looking JEFFREY HUNTER (sporting gray hairs) is Will Benteen, one of Custer&apos;s more loyal officers.\n\nThe mountainous plains in Spain are no substitute for our standard glimpses of John Ford territory with not a single shot looking as though photographed in the American West. But it&apos;s the dull storyline that defeats the movie from ever becoming anything more than a series of handsomely photographed outdoor sequences. A surprise Indian attack by the Cheyennes on an Indepdence Day Celebration is one of the more colorful moments and triggers Custer&apos;s determination to fight the redskins, no matter that they greatly outnumber his men.\n\nNothing in Shaw&apos;s performance suggests the color and vigor of Custer&apos;s bigger than life personality nor does the screenplay do any real justice to the man or the myth. As storytelling goes, the first half of the film manages to be just plain dull and the film only picks up speed as it nears the climactic fight at Little Big Horn.\n\nBattle skirmishes with Indians are, on the whole, well staged and full of furious gunsmoke and flying arrows--but the big set piece is saved, of course, for the finale which comes too late to save the first half of the film from the doldrums. One is left with the impression that some inventive fictionalizing would have helped (as it did with THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON).\n\nSumming up: A very miscast Shaw plays Custer as a snarling villain who barks orders and the story has a plodding script. Could have been much more impressive if filmed in the U.S. on more realistic locales with more accurate casting. A cameo by ROBERT RYAN is no help at all.",

He is master in opening up his film in a slow pensive way so that when it ends, it hits you hard. Sweet Rush of course starts in room in solitude lighted by a window in a Edward Hopper fashion. The scenes swing between under lighted home and clinic of the doctor husband to the brightly, quietly, peacefully pastoral countryside where the tragedy ends the serenity of Riverside. Story swings from Death to Life and back again. Suddenly at the river, you see the sequence which once looked to be part of the story being filmed. I am not sure about the concept of film within film tried here. In real life Wajda&apos;s cinematographer Edward Klosinski was Krystyna&apos;s real husband as in the film. Krystyna Janda as Marta is superb.",

The plot is weak and the characters shallow and the comedy is absolutely pathetic but still I found myself watching it to the end. This film is a very good piece of entertainment for young and old alike. The two young actors are good and it is only a shame we haven&apos;t see Jessie-Ann Friend in more films since. Not only is this film gently gripping and lightly entertaining it is a beautiful story and an uplifting tale. I thoroughly recommend it for anyone who has a couple of hours to spare and just needs the relaxing involvement this film gives.",

      "reviewBody": "For decades, movie dinosaurs were realised either by some form of puppetry or stop motion animation. Then, in 1993, Steven Spielberg&apos;s Jurassic Park proved to be a game changer, amazing audiences with realistic prehistoric monsters created inside a computer. The problem since then has been in delivering that &apos;wow factor&apos; - how can Hollywood keep on thrilling audiences when Spielberg&apos;s original set the bar so high? To be honest, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve found the answer yet.\n\nThe special effects in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom are technically brilliant, but the film doesn&apos;t really do anything that we haven&apos;t seen before, making the film as a whole yet another underwhelming experience. In desperation, the film-makers have resorted to more outrageous set-pieces, as well as inventing bigger and badder dinosaurs that never actually existed, all of which requires way too much suspension of disbelief.\n\nAnd talking of pushing the boundaries of believability too far, the notion that velociraptors were intelligent enough to be trained is quite preposterous: they had pea brains, experts rating their intelligence on a par with a rabbit. Anyone stupid enough to try and become a veloci-whisperer would wind up as a meal for the ravenous lizard (except, of course, for the fact that velociraptors were, in reality, only the size of a large chicken!).\n\nOther things that had me rolling my eyes: Chris Pratt becoming an MMA fighter to plough his way through countless bad guys; a dinosaur that pretends to be asleep to catch someone off-guard; velociraptor Blue knowing only to attack the villains; the transportation of numerous ginormous dinosaurs to a mansion in the US without the knowledge of the authorities; and obligatory child Maisie (Isabella Sermon) ultimately releasing the captured beasts into the wild because she feels sorry for them. Duh!\n\n5.5/10 for the special effects, rounded down to 5 for annoying comedy-relief tech-geek Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) and for Toby Jones. There&apos;s never an excuse for Toby Jones.",

      "reviewBody": "Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior more than exceeded my expectations. I have been waiting for nearly a year since I first heard of it to actually see it and it did not let me down. Although the movie started a bit slow, after about half an hour, things began to pick up and the movie never looked back.\n\nOng-Bak is about a small town villager named Ting (Tony Jaa), who sets out to find the head of his beloved sacred statue, which was stolen. Ting finds his long lost cousin from the village, Humlae (Perttary Wongkamlao), who at first claims to not know Ting until he sees that his village did not send him alone, but with a bag of cash to use as he sees necessary to get the statue head back. This is our first real look at Tony Jaa&apos;s talents, as the first chase scene begins after Humlae takes off with the bag on his motorcycle. Amazingly, Ting follows Humlae all the way to a pit fighter type of place where the real action begins.\n\nAlthough the plot is pretty thin, it is more than made up for by Jaa&apos;s entertaining and seemingly impossible stunts. The movie plays up the stunts big, as it claims no stunt-men, no wires, no CGI, etc. With all that in mind, this movie is pretty mind boggling. Comparisons to Jackie Chan are going to be inevitable, and not undeserving. I can only imagine what the two of them could have accomplished if they did a movie together while Chan was younger. Simply amazing. 8/10"

That&apos;s the gist of it but the movie is also really stylishly filmed and has a lot of emotional depth too. It&apos;s directed by Takashi Ishii who also made the classic Yakuza movie &quot;Gonin&quot; as well as it&apos;s sequel and if you&apos;ve seen one of his movies then you&apos;ll know what to expect - Violence, gun fights and buckets of blood, a dark and brooding atmosphere, offbeat characters and harsh violence towards female characters who don&apos;t really deserve it. It isn&apos;t exactly a laugh a minute but i love this kind of movie.\n\nDefinitely not for everyone, i can see some people with more &quot;woke&quot; sensibilities disliking it (and his other movies!) but if you like dark and violent Yakuza movies from the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s which don&apos;t pull their punches then it&apos;s a must see. The sequel is very good too but is unrelated to this movie.",

      "name": "Loving to depict bourgeois alienation, Antonioni shows here a couple&apos;s marriage breaking down, with Monica Vitti as a delightful foil",
      "reviewBody": "In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni shot a series of films exploring the psychological torment of his bourgeois protagonists. In spite of the wealth and security they established, they had no idea what they wanted in life or what they were supposed to do. In spite of busy social lives, they found it impossible to truly connect with other people. LA NOTTE, from 1961, is one of these, and I think it&apos;s the very best of them.\n\nAs the film opens, one morning in Milano, married couple Giovanni (Marcello Mastroianni) and Lidia (Jeanne Moreau) visit their friend Tomasso (Bernhard Wicki) in the hospital as he lays dying. Lidia is clearly shaken by the experience and, after Giovanni leaves for an appearance to promote his new book, the camera tracks Lidia through a long, aimless walk around Milano as she processes her thoughts. Here Antonioni (anticipating his later film Il Deserto Rosso) shows the drastically changing face of Milano in the postwar construction boom, and the appearance of new tech gadgetry in everyday life, as just one more way people can feel they have nothing certain they can hold on to in this world.\n\nGiovanni and Lidia, while never outright squabbling, have clearly grown cold towards each other. Gradually one begins to wonder if there is any life left in their marriage whatsoever. Things come to a head, however, when Giovanni and Lidia go that evening to a party at a rich industrialist&apos;s villa, and Antonioni&apos;s favourite actress Monica Vitti appears. Vitti&apos;s role as a foil to Giovanni and Lidia is powerful and moving, but I think its precise nature should be left unsaid here, as it&apos;s better audiences aren&apos;t spoiled first.\n\nA mere description of the plot might seem like nothing happens in this film besides bored people talking and yet another mid-century European cinematic tale of adultery. But LA NOTTE is a film of incredible visual poetry, almost like the work of Andrei Tarkovsky. Even scenes that evoke the characters&apos; boredom are shot as such beautiful tableaux that the viewer is enraptured. Antonioni often shoots his characters reflected in mirrors and the like, and there is some cinematic legerdemain here that just makes you go &quot;wow&quot;.\n\nAppearing in Antonioni&apos;s body of work between two similar films that are often considered a trilogy, LA NOTTE has often got less buzz than its predecessor L&apos;AVVENTURA, with its daring plot twist, or its successor L&apos;ECLISSE with its chic Monica Vitti-Alain Delon love affair. But I think that in terms of the picture-perfect visuals and elegant pacing, LA NOTTE deserves every bit as much praise as those other two classic films.",

      "reviewBody": "Due to the copious negative reviews about &quot;Mars Needs Moms,&quot; I decided to write a quick positive one.\n\nI&apos;ve read a bunch of different kinds of bashing over this film; from sexism and hidden political agendas to poor animation and a poorly timed release. Now, I think we can all safely agree that if the viewer really wants to find something negative about &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;, they won&apos;t have to look very hard. Keeping this in mind, I went into watching this film with just one simple goal in mind, to be entertained, and I was. This film really isn&apos;t as bad as everyone says it is as long as you just go into it with the right mind set.\n\nThe animation is incredible, as well it should be with a $150 million dollar budget and over 6 minutes worth of end credits of people who worked hard creating it. Like Beowulf, the human characters look almost identical to the actor/actress voicing them and the surroundings like the space sequences, the garbage mountains, and the Mars tunnels are breathtaking. This simple animation element will be enough to entertain the open minded person. Yet, the overdone and predictable story is still heartwarming and I believe it served as a nice reminder of how special a mom really is. Though some of the dialogue isn&apos;t the greatest, and there are a few ominous notes played throughout (leaving me to recommend this movie to children over ten), wait for it to go down from a new release rental price and give it a try."

Vinod Khanna played the titular role with Amrita Singh as his lady love and Kiran Kumar as his foe. A not so bad film which tanked at the box office; CID is a film most regretted by Juhi Chawla who had probably signed this inconsequential role before her stardom. She had a strip tease song with villain Kiran Kumar pawing her all over which was reminiscent of the Padma Khanna- Premnath number in Vijay Anand&apos;s Johny Mera Naam. The item number became talking point of gossip mags. The film however, sank without a trace.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

When Riza Niro discovers that Sadec and his colleagues are after him, he disguises himself as a punk rocker, and falls in love with the stunning Sexilia, his first straight relationship.\n\nThis film is rarely seen in American because, so far as I know, it has never been released on DVD here. That is somewhat surprising given the major name Almodovar has become. And to have Antonio Banderas as a gay terrorist is something that is so out of character with how we might think of him today (2017).\n\nBy American standards, the film may be considered soft-core pornography. There is a fair amount of nudity, with men and women... and men on men. No doubt this was risqué in its day, and some might still consider it so. Whether Americans are prudes or Europeans are perverts, I do not know.",

      "reviewBody": "An enthusiastically splattery, low-budget comedy gore-fest from Argentina, Zombie Plague Mutant Zone sees three survivors of a zombie outbreak (caused by an alien virus) intercepted by the authorities and thrown straight back into the now quarantined town. The trio, an ex pro-wrestler named John West (Pablo Parés), medical student Bill (Pablo Parés), and a nerd called Max (Hernán Sáez), fend off the undead whilst trying to figure out a way to escape their predicament.\n\nWith a visual style very reminiscent of Peter Jackson&apos;s early horror classics, this ultra-bloody slice of cartoon-style splat-stick starts off very promisingly, featuring plenty of silly laughs and loads of cheap &apos;n&apos; cheerful make-up and gore. Unfortunately, it soon becomes evident that silly laughs and loads of cheap &apos;n&apos; cheerful make-up and gore is all the film does have to offer, and proceedings eventually become rather tiresome. There is zero plot development and the directors (stars Parés and Sáez) obviously don&apos;t know when to call it a day (even after the end credits have started rolling, they feel the need to throw in an unnecessary epilogue).\n\nStill, if you don&apos;t mind the repetitiveness of the action (fight scene, followed by silly zombies, followed by fight scene, followed by silly zombies, followed by fight scene), there are definitely enough good moments to make staying for the duration worthwhile: an early three stooges style gag with a severed arm; a revolting bit in which a zombie clutches his lower bowel and releases a stream of feces into the hero&apos;s face; a kung fu fight using a torn, bloody appendage as a weapon; a climactic battle which includes some terrific and very inventive effects; and an enjoyably daft musical interlude (featuring the catchy John West theme tune).\n\nIf only the makers had added a bit more meat to the story, and shaved a little bit off the running time, then this one would&apos;ve got a 7 out of 10 from me. As it stands, it gets a 6.",

      "reviewBody": "Unique and oddly powerful documentary. Essentially a series of talking heads; interviews with the military judges who presided over the military courts in the territory Israel annexed during the 6 day war.. Mixed in, occasionally playing behind these men on a green screen are snippets of archival footage of the conflicts in the occupied territories. \n\nHearing this description, one could well assume the film would be dry and academic, but the ideas beneath what it being quietly discussed are so powerful and disturbing that the film works as a kind of documentary theater piece. By focusing on one specific aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israeli filmmaker Alexandrwicz gives a deeper sense of the legal and moral hypocrisy and inhumanity of Israel&apos;s treatment of the Palestinians than many wider ranging and flashier documentaries. \n\nBy simply having these judges try to explain the odd military justice applied to the native people of the land Israel occupied, and how the courts kept bending and twisting both words and international law to justify their actions, (for example, under the Geneva conventions, an occupying nation is not allowed to move civilians from their country into the occupied land. So how to make the settlements legal? The Israeli supreme court simply changed the wording, saying that henceforth the territories were no longer &apos;occupied&apos; but &apos;held&apos;. As if changing the word could justify the behavior -- even though just about every Judge uses the term &apos;occupied territory&apos; in the film.) One is left with a sad and sickening feeling. \n\nAs these judges admit to knowing that an accused had been tortured into confessions, that not only the accused but even the judges themselves were often not allowed to know the details of the case and the accusations, that the judges had to simply take the word of the army prosecutors, since just about everything was labeled &apos;classified&apos;, it&apos;s hard not to see echoes of the recent legal overreach in America towards accused terrorists. \n\nThe personalities of the judges are fascinating as well. Some clearly feel guilt about their actions, other ambivalence, others are defensive, and yet others seem to blithely miss just how twisted and sad their self-justification sounds. \n\nWhatever you feel about the incredibly complex middle east situation, where there is plenty of guilt on all sides, this film is a powerful indictment of when the supposed &apos;rule of law&apos; becomes instead a cudgel to control a people, and justify questionable policy.\n\nI found the film only grew on a second viewing. Far from feeling repetitive I was able to follow in even deeper detail, and contemplate in more depth the complex issues being examined. I found myself more emotionally effected. I also was able to more fully appreciate just how inventively the film-makers had incorporated green screen techniques to give an unusual power to their interviews, and create as documentary that was actually quite cinematic, in it&apos;s unique way.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Internes Can&apos;t Take Money&quot; is the first Dr. Kildare movie and unlike the long string of Dr. Kildare/Dr. Gillespie movies from MGM, this Paramount film has an entirely different cast, style and, in some cases, characters. It&apos;s really odd when you&apos;ve seen the MGM films...and I think it&apos;s best to see the movie without trying to compare it to the later series.\n\nWhile Joel MacCrea plays Dr. Kildare, in this case he&apos;s NOT a doctor right out of medical school but a full-fledged doctor at the hospital. And, there also is no cranky/avuncular Dr. Gillespie as his mentor.\n\nWhile Kildare is a major character, the story seem to revolve more around Janet (Barbara Stanwyck)...a woman just out of prison whose baby was stolen from her by her rat of a husband. The husband is now dead and she has no idea where to find the girl. So, she spends much of the film looking in vain for the kid...and nice Dr. Kildare eventually helps her with this task...along with some significant help from a mobster (Lloyd Nolan)!\n\nThe style of this film is nothing like the later Kildare films and it&apos;s less a hospital movie and more a crime film. As such, it&apos;s enjoyable and well acted...though the story is, at times, a bit hard to believe. Still, it is worth seeing.",

That has less to do with the setting or time period. It has more to do with the style and the subject matter. The romance has no time to develop and has a very superficial manufactured old romance novel feel. Other than a pretty face, there is nothing to justify the grand romance being depicted. It would probably be more compelling to have this about a family member. Cate Blanchett is a truly wonderful actress, and any positives from this movie are all due to her. There is a sense of danger but it doesn&apos;t persist. Director Gillian Armstrong has made a beautiful movie. It just doesn&apos;t have better passion or excitement.",

I was not surprised at all when he went on to win the Oscar for directing &quot;Silence of The Lambs.&quot; The performances he evokes from his actors in &quot;Married&quot; are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.\n\nOne of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80&apos;s, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a superlative movie and I&apos;ll try to put any spoilage at the end. There are multiple themes interwoven in the script. The first and most important theme is that of redemption and of course the second chance. Eddie Jones is the trainer who is an educator, and to some extent, a rescuer of damaged souls. One of the surprises is that he needs rescuing himself. While set in a framework of a traditional fight movie, it does have something extra. If you haven&apos;t yet had the privilege of seeing this flick, stop reading here. I would say any spoiler begins here: I don&apos;t generally go in for the gay experience in movies as it doesn&apos;t interest me as a dramatic theme or personally. Just a matter of personal taste. I don&apos;t give a damn about orientation except as it relates to fairness and decency to other people. It does here. There is a strong theme of love and trust here with the gay&apos;s place in a &quot;manly&quot; sport. It is this tension that provides so much drama and is so important to us all when we consider how we treat each other.\n\nJones&apos; character has an almost Christlike ability to repair another&apos;s broken spirit and it is his hubris (for the purpose of the drama) that his orientation has interfered with both his career as boxer and trainer, as well as his own sense of worth. His self-sacrifice for his protégé elevates this drama and gives it much of its specialness.\n\nThe theme of love and self-worth are masterfully handled here. The secondary theme that love transcends orientation - that it should not matter - is illustrated well here. One&apos;s human obligations trump one&apos;s personal tastes somehow. I loved the trainer&apos;s sense of caring and him personally, and it is one of the triumphs of this flick that Tommy Riley does too, in his own hetero way. More importantly, trust, character, and humane values are validated here as well.\n\nI was also intrigued by the art and techniques of using facial aspect to show different stages and struggles in character development. The ways the director and cinematographer use the visual effects of contrast in facial definition are notable. From the somewhat maniacal face of lust and personal struggle in the face of the trainer at one point, to the final difference we see in Tommy&apos;s face itself at the end: more mature, seasoned, and somehow stronger for the sense of love, loss, and yet redemption, seen in his visage. A most striking way of making one&apos;s point. I give this film both my thumbs up.",

      "reviewBody": "Richard Dees (Miguel Ferrer) is a nasty and bitter senior reporter from sensationalist tabloid Inside View. When a mysterious pilot starts killing persons nearby the airports, Richard&apos;s boss Merton Morrison (Dan Monahan) invites him to cover the matter, but he is not interest. However, rookie reporter Katherine &quot;Jimmy&quot; Blair (Julie Entwisle) studies thoroughly the story of a serial-killer that killed his victims Claire Ellis Bowie in Maine; Buck Kendall in New York; and Ray and Ellen Sarch in Maryland. But Richard steals her research and gives the following advice to Katherine: &quot;Never believe what you publish...Never publish what you believe&quot;. He flies to each place in his plane and realizes that the killer might be a vampire due to his style and calls him &quot;The Night Flier&quot;. Meanwhile Merton assigns Katherine to follow Richard to give a different view of the same story. When Richard finally finds The Night Flier, he descends to the hell in his insanity and Katherine follows his advice. \n\n&quot;The Night Flier&quot; is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King for video, with an interesting horror movie with a different vampire story. The plot is well constructed, and the story is very simple, but also very frightening. Miguel Ferrer has a good performance in the role of a scum reporter. Unfortunately, Julie Entwisle has a very weak performance in an important character. The contrast between the final black and white scene and the following bright colored one is visually impressive. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Vôo Noturno&quot; (&quot;Night Flight&quot;)",

I would love to see this film again, but I don&apos;t know how or where to find it. Any help will be most appreciated. I remember how terribly sad I and many relatives were when the death of La Jana was announced in late 1940. I recently read that La Jana was selected for the part of LolaLola in Blau Engel but that Sternberg&apos;s wife who was a friend of Dietrich managed to give the part to Dietrich, thus changing cinematic history. In retrospect it seems that Dietrich rather than the imperious La Jana was a better choice for the part, even at the expense of beauty."

      "reviewBody": "I saw &quot;Korczak&quot; for the first time in the late 1990s when a young teen, and even then I remember cringing at the amateur way the production had been handled. Why? Because I also saw &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; prior to it and realized that, by comparison, &quot;Korczak&quot; feels like a high school video project...a very bad one at that! I&apos;ve recently rewatched it and the impression was even worse.\n\nNow, don&apos;t get me wrong, the subject matter is important, the story is incredible and this film needed to be made, just not by the people it was...unfortunately.\n\nI think Wajda is hugely overrated. His movies always struck me as excessively &quot;theatrical&quot;...as in they look like someone only knew theater but wanted to try cinema for a goof; sort of &quot;let&apos;s put the camera in front of the stage and hope for the best&quot; approach. &quot;Korczak&quot;, by comparison with the rest of Wajda&apos;s movies isn&apos;t the worst actually...if it wasn&apos;t for the horrendous production value! And it&apos;s not even about the budget; it&apos;s more about the craft. I realize it&apos;s a 1990 movie but only three years later a true timeless cinematic masterpiece followed - &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot;! And Spielberg spectacularly achieved what he had intended by using his groundbreaking and innovative imagery (credit to the great Janusz Kaminski here) - he wanted the film to look and feel so no one could tell when it was made. &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; stomped &quot;Korczak&quot; to a pulp.\n\nMy main criticisms are:\n\n\n* Horrible sound\n* Horrible cinematography\n* Horrible editing\n* Just bad directing overall, which reflects on acting\n\n\nI honestly think someone should reintroduce Korczak&apos;s story to world cinema in a manner it deserves as the 1990 film looks like something hastily put together in 1950.",

      "reviewBody": "If someone were to ask what Ravenous is all about, the easiest thing to say would be: `It&apos;s about cannibalism in a remote Army outpost in the 1800s.&apos; That&apos;s exactly right, and that&apos;s probably what kept audience members away from Ravenous when it briefly ran in theaters back in 1999.  Cannibalism? Who needs to watch that?  Indeed.\n\nYes, there is cannibalism in Ravenous.  Quite a lot of it, in fact.  The film is steeped in murder, the eating of human flesh, and is flavored with madness.  At times the film can be downright difficult to watch, though the compelling nature of the narrative keeps the viewer&apos;s eyes locked on the screen for the full ninety-eight minutes.\n\nRavenous is so much more than a meditation on people eating other people, though it&apos;s obvious there was a great deal of confusion about how exactly to present this dish to the public.  Its plot is fairly simple for the first half: Mexican War hero (and hidden coward) Lt. Boyd, played by LA Confidential&apos;s Guy Pearce, is assigned to an end-of-the-Earth fortress in the western Sierra Nevadas.  This fort, populated over the winter by a tiny handful of misfit officers and enlisted men, receives a visitor in the person of a starving man with an awful story of a failed mountain crossing that eclipses the Donner Party&apos;s.  What happens then is so twisted, but skillfully crafted, that it would be criminal to spoil what transpires.\n\nBut Ravenous is not just a horror story.  What lies at its heart is an allegory about man&apos;s relationship to other men and how society structures itself around the powerful and the powerless.  Issues such as the morality of Manifest Destiny and even the ethics of simple meat eating are touched upon.  Guy Pearce gives an underplayed performance so low-key that he almost vanishes into the film stock, while co-star Robert Carlyle (most recently in The World is Not Enough) plays opposite him with delightful nuance.  The material even brings deeply textured work out of Tim Burton stalwart Jeffrey Jones as the commander of the fort, and scattered around these three are solid supporting actors like Jeremy Davies, who&apos;s much better here than he was in Saving Private Ryan, and David Arquette.\n\nIf anything works against Ravenous at all, it&apos;s the curious inclusion of humor at the outset of the picture.  Director Antonia Bird, who also made Priest and Safe, is not known for her lighter side, which makes the appearance of a goofy epigram at the very start of the picture, and the use of some bizarrely inappropriate music during a later sequence, seem more like some producer&apos;s half-hearted attempt to blunt the sharp edge of the film&apos;s commentary with silliness.\n\nLuckily for the viewer and the film, however, Ravenous is far too powerful a motion picture to be undercut in this fashion.  By the time the final reel has passed, any memory of earlier missteps is forgotten as the pace grows more deliberate and the action becomes bloodier and bloodier up until the final moments.\n\nUnjustly neglected on the screen, Ravenous is a film with a great deal to say.  It&apos;s only too bad that cannibalism was the best way to say it.",

He begins an affair with American model Candice Bergen and takes her along on a shoot in the Uganda and crosses the border to interview the men at a training camp for mercenaries. When they return to Paris, she wants him to tell Mlle Giradot, but he says he needs time to disengage.\n\nClaude Lelouch&apos;s follow-up to A MAN AND A WOMAN is about the ability of love to survive when one of the partners is in a job at once exciting and frustrating, and whether it is love at all. Lelouch alternates between his principals engaging with each other -- although Montand gives a performance in which he seems to be acting all the time -- and montages: war footage, African wildlife, the aftermath of a battle in Viet Nam,Montand and Giradot after their breakup, with Lelouch&apos;s longtime collaborator Francis Lai doing the score.\n\nMlle Giradot offers a fine performance, as does Montand. Miss Bergen is not so engaging, although that may be a deliberate choice.",

But as this doc claims there are more darker sides to this youth organization that meets the eye.\n\nNashi seems more preoccupied with trying to silence their opposition using very violent methods, propaganda, using football hooligans to beat up people etc. Masha Drokova at first, denies these allegations but then gets to know one of Putins biggest critics, Oleg Kashin and his friends.\n\nOleg Kashin claims that Nashi is fully comparable to Hitler Jugend, and that it only serves as mean to brainwash Russia&apos;s youth to obey Putin. Masha Drokova on other hand tries to convince him of the opposite until one day.....\n\nThis documentary is quite simply just as riveting as any political thriller, look at All the King&apos;s Men (1949), Choose Connor (2007), The Ides of March (2011)etc. Or other fascinating documentaries about politics, Follow the Leader: Young, American and Right (2012), The War Room (1993)etc.\n\nWhat we get to see is a young girl full of idealism, naiveté and also part of the new young Russia that was born after the fall of communism, and has only benefited(socially, economically) during Putins reign.\n\nViewers interested to know more of Russia today, and why critics seems so hard on Putin, etc should watch this. Others should stay away."

      "reviewBody": "Compared to this movie Harry Potter, Asterix and classical fairy tales look very down to earth. They claim that magic exists and that if you know how to use it you can actually work miracles. Young Wickie&apos;s only power is his alleged cleverness. But his solutions just ignore the laws of physics and logic. And that&apos;s not clever at all.\n\nAt one point the ship of Wickie&apos;s Vikings has to catch up with another one that&apos;s quite ahead of them. A map illustrates the situation: Wickie&apos;s ship is on the right side of an island, both ships are heading for a place on the left side. Wickie sees that the route across the island is only a third of the route around it and gets the genius idea to just cross it - with their ship. Harry Potter would have figured something out and wiggled his wand, but Wickie&apos;s men really have to pull the big viking ship for miles and miles over land. Later on he uses some minuscule kites flying next to the majestic big sail of their ship to get it up into the air. Cleverness never looked that stupid.\n\nThe whole point of the Wickie character is that he&apos;s a small and weak Viking boy who is still of great value to his community because his ideas are based on the general knowledge of our times and therefore are way ahead of his. In this movie he&apos;s got only wacky ideas that even an eight year old should recognize as humbug. Still his inanities gain him the admiration of the elders.\n\nAll grown-up vikings are depicted as idiots, all kinds of idiots: the vain idiot, the bragging idiot, the cowardly idiot, the &quot;No, I&apos;m not stolen from the Asterix comics&quot;-troubadour idiot. The kids and the women are basically alright, but the men are all half-wits. Would you really consider to expose your children to such hateful nonsense? A good comedy will lift you up, this annoying movie is set to dumb people down. If you are intellectually insecure enough to need to laugh about stupid people, you will like this movie because it doesn&apos;t feature anything else, but please don&apos;t expose innocent children to this junk.\n\nI didn&apos;t read the &quot;Wickie&quot; books from the 60ies or watched the 70ies TV-show, but it would really surprise me if they&apos;d be even slightly as heart- and witless as this Michael &apos;Bully&apos; Herbig movie. Yes, that&apos;s the director&apos;s official nickname. Right in the beginning Wickie is forced by a big strong grown-up bully to engage himself in a duel of physical strengths designed to humiliate him in front of the whole village. Evil. Who&apos;s that bully? Wickie&apos;s father. Now that&apos;s really evil! This is definitely not a family movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;East Meets West&quot; idea of an Asian fighter in the Wild West was not new anymore (see Terence Young&apos;s &quot;Soleil Rouge&quot; from 1971, or &quot;Il mio nome e Shanghai Joe&quot; by Mario Caiano, 1973), but &quot;The Stranger And the Gunfighter&quot; was the first time (1974) that an Asian production company, namely Shaw Brothers, came to Italy for a Western production, bringing Lo Lieh as a seasoned star of their own. The kung-fu fighter has to recover a treasure that once belonged to his uncle and return it to China. The map leading to the treasure is tattooed in 4 parts - on the backs of 4 ladies. Yes, that&apos;s a bit of a different idea for once ;-). Lee Van Cleef plays a bank robber who assists very unwillingly, but in the end even enjoys a little trip to Asia. \n\nThe movie is nowhere near &quot;Soleil Rouge&quot; and Lo Lieh isn&apos;t Toshiro Mifune, but it&apos;s an entertaining action movie with a story you haven&apos;t seen before. &quot;Il mio nome e Shanghai Joe&quot; is a very violent flick, whereas recent movies such as &quot;Shang-High Noon&quot; are silly comedies. What I like best about &quot;The Stranger And the Gunfighter&quot; is that it&apos;s well balanced between action and comedy.",

They fight off a common enemy, some Nazis that come to the factory to get the treasure at the end of the war. The children and the GIs have no idea that the war is actually over. Lots of fighting and some flashbacks help explain some of the characters past. The story is entertaining and tragic all at the same time.

      "reviewBody": "Along with Fernando DiLeo and Sergio Martino, Enzo Castellari is one of the Italian genre directors whose work has really been rehabilitated lately thanks to people like Quentin Tarantino. And, however, you feel personally about QT, it&apos;s hard to fault his tastes. Castellari, whose father (Marino Girolami) and uncle (Romolo Guerreri) were also respected Italian directors, made many films in many genres, including Westerns (&quot;Any Gun Can Play&quot;),gialli (&quot;The Cold Eyes of Fear&quot;), and horror flicks(&quot;Sensitiva&quot;). His two most famous films were &quot;The Last Shark&quot;, which never shown in the US because of an injunction brought by the makers of &quot;Jaws&quot;, and &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot;, which Tarantino recently (and very loosely) remade. This movie is not one of his more famous, but it is definitely one of Castellari&apos;s best.\n\nFabio Testi plays a cop who is taking on a big, mafia-connected protection racket that is shaking down businesses all over Italy, and using disgruntled left-wing university students, including a tough female ( ) to do it. Frustrated by the limitations of the law, Testi eventually puts together a gang of victims of the racket including Vincent Gardenia, a small-time crook who lost his nephew to the gang, an Olympic champion skeet shooter who lost his wife, and perhaps most touching, a restaurant owner who went crazy after the gang raped his young daughter and she killed herself. Together they plan an improbable, but not entirely unbelievable, campaign to take down the entire racket.\n\nThis movie has a lot of the elements of a police thriller, but also of a rape-revenge/&quot;Deathwish&quot;-type movie. I wouldn&apos;t really call it &quot;fascist&quot; though because it really doesn&apos;t glorify violence (not too many people are left alive by the end of this). The protagonists, especially Testi&apos;s character, are flawed, three-dimensional, and vulnerable rather than being just a heroic super-cop types. And this has downbeat, noirish elements like some of the early American police thrillers of that period (i.e. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;Deathwish&quot;), but that were definitely lost by the happy-fascist Reagan era. These aren&apos;t self-righteous, fascist crime fighters, but decent people driven to extremes in a violent, decaying society. Of course, as an action movie this is still very entertaining, but the realistic violence and three-dimensional characters always keeps it from simply degenerating into another cop-worshipping cartoon. Recommended."

      "reviewBody": "Buckle your seat belts: this film is quite the ride. As so often with David Lynch&apos;s movies, &apos;Lost Highway&apos; doesn&apos;t bother with a traditional narrative and follows its own, dreamlike (or nightmarish) logic. It is a wild, expressionist work of art, and while it starts on a slow, brooding note, the film soon explodes into a crazy, violent trip that hooks you competely and doesn&apos;t let up. My advice to people unfamiliar with Lynch&apos;s work is this: just enjoy the experience and let yourself be immersed. While it is fun to analyze Lynch&apos;s movies, especially his most surreal ones, they&apos;re not mysteries that require resolution in order to be enjoyed.\n\nAs for the filmmaking itself, the pacing is fantastic throughout, the cinematography outstanding and the cast of character actors like Bill Pullman, Robert Loggia and Patricia Arquette simply a joy to watch (especially Loggia gets to shine in a wonderfully over-the-top part). Another aspect that should not go unmentioned is the music. The orginal score by Angeolo Badalamenti (who is to Lynch what John Williams is to Spielberg) is hauntgingly beautiful, but equally important is the amazing soundtrack - featuring greats like David Bowie, Lou Reed, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor and more - which fits and enhances the images on screen perfectly.\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concerned, this is Lynch at his best. &apos;Lost Highway&apos; is a dark, violent, surreal, beautiful, hallucinatory masterpiece: 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",

      "reviewBody": "The second film version of an archetypal adventure story is arguably the best despite some dated elements; John Ford deftly handles the proceedings and Max Steiner&apos;s stirring score - which at times foreshadows his later one for CASABLANCA (1942) - is a major asset. The solid cast of character actors is highlighted by Boris Karloff&apos;s remarkable turn as a religious fanatic who is slowly driven crazy by the amorality of his comrades and the futility of their struggle against unseen Arab attackers. The film can not only be seen to form part of the &quot;British Empire&quot; sub-genre of adventure films - with THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935), THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (1936), THE FOUR FEATHERS (1939) and GUNGA DIN (1939) being its most notable contemporary examples - but, if one were to stretch it a bit, also paves the way for more modern stuff like John Carpenter&apos;s ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976). It&apos;s unfortunate that nowadays, only the 66-minute reissue version seems to be available rather than the original, full-length 74 minute version. Over 20 years ago, I missed my one opportunity to watch this one on Italian TV and have been on the lookout for it ever since; however, I did manage to catch two similarly-themed wartime actioners, BATAAN (1943; with Robert Taylor) and SAHARA (1943; with Humphrey Bogart) over the years which were quite good in their own right. Curiously enough, Cyril McLaglen had played the same part played here by his brother Victor in the earlier 1929 British film version.",

Sadly though, as an actor his talents don&apos;t stretch a great deal further in this amiable fantasy adventure. He has to beat three suitors and a manipulative vizier to win the hand of the Princess &quot;Jamila&quot; (Rossana Podestá). Luckily, he has three genies to help him out as he seeks the golden arrow that will prove his identity as the heir to the kingdom and a worthy husband for the princess. The production is pretty basic, but this is still a colourful romp with plenty of action, bows and arrows, magic carpetry and Hunter has a distinct glint in his eye - especially when talking to people who are clearly going to be superimposed by the visual effects people later! At least they all went to Egypt to film the exteriors, and there is plenty of light-hearted action taking us to the inevitable - and really quite entertaining - battle at the end. I quite enjoyed this.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, i just read the previous comment and i can&apos;t say I&apos;m quite happy with it :( I mean, the movie was not that bad at all!! Everything was in the right place: the music, actors, the plot and all... No, really... I just don&apos;t get why he said (I mean that guy) the actors were bad. They were just brilliant! Well, maybe to watch this movie u gotta have a sense of humor because many scenes in it were quite funny. Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth and Thomas Sangster were really good it seemed to me. Well Aishwarya Rai could of acted better probably... But anyways I reckon there are so many really bad movies and I don&apos;t think this one is just watch-it-once-and-then-forget-it film! Besides, the whole thing was real: I mean the castle, all the decorations, they shot it on location, and if you see throngs of people running on the battlefield you know this is all real! I guess u gotta appreciate it because they could of made in on computers... I mean, it&apos;s such a rare thing nowadays... Speaking about the plot... Yeah, maybe it&apos;s a bit naive and even silly (remember this when you watch the final scene) but overall it was quite dynamic and everything. Finally it was Dino De Laurentis production, they&apos;ve been writing the script for 6(!) years so do you really think they didn&apos;t notice it was crap or something? Well maybe it&apos;s not that great compared to &apos;300&apos; but it&apos;s good enough anyway My conclusion is: you gotta watch the movie especially if you like Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley or Thomas Sangster or if you like adventures. And it seemed to me it&apos;s a kind of a teen movie rather than a serous one (i suppose it&apos;s for people of 12-25). And one more thing to say: though it&apos;s a historic movie (and i really hated history at school!!!) somehow i liked it and I&apos;ve seen enough movies to tell a good one. Enjoy!",

This movie is a mixture of the guns of Naverone and battle of the bulge as you have American tanks m41 walker bulldogs and m48 Patton as German Panzers ( all of which is footage lifted from Tobruk ) similar to the bulge film. You have Burton exactly copying the actions of Peppard to fit the stock footage of Tobruk into the action scenes of this film. However this is what lets the film down as it doesn&apos;t use any new footage as far as battle scenes are concerned it is like watching Tobruk again but just with different actors. Still worth a watch as it is exciting and well acted",

Despite the torture inflicted on Helena, Fenn&apos;s portrayal never allows you to feel abject horror, as her Helena remains caustic, tough and impossible to break throughout the film. Julian Sands is good, although he maybe over-eggs the pudding a bit in some of the more gruelling scenes. The first sight of Helena propped up in bed without legs is never forgotten and the special effects make her amputations incredibly realistic. It&apos;s just a shame that the ending is such an appalling cop-out, sanitised for viewers who couldn&apos;t accept that love and need can blossom in the sickest of circumstances. In fact, I felt tears of frustration well up at the ending because I felt so cheated! If only it had been braver, this would have been a film of groundbreaking proportions. Fenn is great though and acts the hell out of Kim Basinger, the original choice. Watch it but don&apos;t build yourself up for the ending."

      "reviewBody": "In Bringing Out the Dead, Nicolas Cage plays Frank, a graveyard shift EMT technician in New York City in the early 1990s. In classic Scorsese style, the themes of masculinity, subcultural underground interaction, and fast paced film editing combine to form the frenetic basis of Frank&apos;s neo-noir lifestyle. The film is dark, urban, and also blackly comic, relying on strong masculine characters to provide energy and humor.\n\n Overall, Bringing Out the Dead appears to be heavily influenced by film noir. Frank, the protagonist, is at the end of his rope in a rather solitary and stressful job and he often finds escape from the ghosts of his failures through alcohol. Patricia Arquette plays Mary, the femme fatale character and woman in distress Frank seeks to save. The film is uber-urban, set mainly in the nighttime ghettos and hustling districts of New York City, and the major events center around various city dwellers. Frank&apos;s adventures in life saving are highlighted by the colorful characters of City life, including prostitutes, drug addicts, homeless persons, insane persons, goth-punk death rockers and the ubiquitous &apos;Mr. O.,&apos; the smelliest destitute to plague Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital. Frank is led by Mary into the narcotic underworld, and meets the proprietor of &apos;The Oasis,&apos; a charismatic dealer with a passion for tropical fish and silk robes.\n\nMany of the lighting techniques also serve to emphasize the urbanality of the surroundings, often combining music and fast paced editing. The darkness of the City night is contrasted with the searing halogen of the hospital, and the sunlight that creeps through the window at dawn mocks Frank&apos;s insomnia. Indeed, the movie ends at dawn, with Frank nodding off to sleep. This is very similar to the traditional horror movie ending at dawn when the nighttime monsters are relegated to their nocturnal lairs. Editing techniques are feverish and accelerate in pace as the movie progresses and Frank&apos;s hysteria mounts. Many of these sequences involve a montage of the flashing ambulance lights, 360-degree camera rotation, blurred traffic lights and shots of the crazed driver behind the wheel. My personal favorite scene is when Frank is going to answer a call, and the montage is set to R.E.M.&apos;s What&apos;s the Frequency Kenneth.\n\nOverall, most of the main characters are the male ambulance drivers/EMTs. These characters, Frank, Tom, Marcus and Larry, exude a kind of unquestioned masculinity, which they prove through various means such as violence, excessive flirting, and alcohol consumption. Tom is a violent, hair trigger macho who enjoys pummeling transients and minorities. Marcus is a smooth talking black man who chain smokes stogies and praises Jesus. Larry is an overweight everyman, wanting to start his own paramedic business. Frank is a Marlboro smoking altruistic cowboy with a drinking problem and insomnia. At some point, most of the characters engage in drinking (liquor) while on duty or at least in the ambulance. The characters names are also quite masculine, especially in contrast to Noel, a man who is a drug addict of ethnic descent that is never arguably fully a man.\n\nInherently, Scorsese&apos;s New York City is an urban jungle that will break any man who is not strong or tough enough."

Power gets fired and laughed at and can&apos;t prove he didn&apos;t marry the lady so decides to turn things around on her.\n\nThere are no surprises here, with a supporting cast that includes Reginald Gardiner (wasted as Tierney&apos;s boyfriend who takes her out but can&apos;t get to first place with her, not that he looks like he really cares) and Lucille Watson (also wasted in a trivial role). I was a little surprised at how obviously fake are the Sun Valley, Idaho backdrops in a few scenes. This is a remake of Love Is News, a 1937 comedy Power had made with Loretta Young, making Power one of the few actors to appear in a remake of one of his own films. Why 20th Century Fox would choose to revive such weak material again over a decade later is beyond me.\n\nAlthough Power is primarily remembered today for Nightmare Alley and as the hero of a few costume adventures, at the start of his career at Fox he appeared in a number of light weight romantic comedies of a forgettable, frothy nature. That Wonderful Urge, released almost a decade after the last of them, would also be his final venture into screen comedy for, unfortunately, less than memorable results. It was also around this time that he appeared in The Luck of The Irish, a somewhat more engaging affair inasmuch as it mixed the romantic comedy with fantasy by having a leprechaun play the role of matchmaker.",

But, taken on it&apos;s own terms, Arthur 2: On the Rocks isn&apos;t half bad and actually has some really funny moments.  Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli convincingly reprise their roles from the original and exchange some really funny lines between each other; they work well together and are fun to watch. All of the other actors also, from the original (minus Jill Eikenberry), do their best to add spark to offset the mediocre material. In fact the movie gets as far as it does solely on the performances alone. The movie itself is bland and lifelessly plotted and totally lacking in the warmth, magic, and style, courtesy of the late Steve Gordon, that made the original so much fun and endearing. Plus the new plot plays more like a sitcom than pure comedy. But the stars manage to squeeze out a few laughs anyway and Moore still gets some belly laughs as the perpetually drunk Arthur. So if your looking for a sequel that is on par with the original you will no doubt be disappointed but if your just looking for an average comedy with a few good laughs to kill time with you might enjoy it."

The boys have somewhat troubled home lives, and fighting is a means of expression for them, and is used as a metaphor for general perseverance in the face of adversity - don&apos;t take it lying down! The other main characters are Kazuyoshi&apos;s friend who always feels like the &quot;second fiddle&quot;, and the anime-esquire Ritsuko, who is... adorable :) This is one of Miike&apos;s earlier films, made just before the watershed FUDOH. It is not one of those &quot;extreme&quot; films with which Miike made his name, but still betrays his touch in the quirkiness of his characters, a mixture of deadpan and slapstick humour and a general level of intelligence, sophistication and wit that audiences who have only seen his more transgressive efforts may not realise Miike possesses (though it is present even there).\n\nThe pacing of the film is... unhurried, as with a lot of Japanese cinema. One of Miike&apos;s gifts is a willingness to let the characters tell their story without resorting to lots of exposition. He can actually be very subtle when he wants to be.\n\nI suppose I should note that although the film does revolve around fighting, it is in no way an &quot;action movie&quot;. The fights are brawls, short and sharp... sometimes quite intense, other times quite amusing. Please don&apos;t expect it to be a martial arts film though! The film is mostly a drama with splashes of comedy and quirkiness that occasionally wanders into surrealism. Sometimes funny, sometimes quite moving. Quite &quot;low key&quot; in the Takashi Miike scheme of things, but another solid piece of work from one of cinema&apos;s true masters.",

He was the original singer for Christian Death. This is a creative short shot in BW super 8. Given that Rozz produced this, I would have liked to hear a bit more original music. I can see how Bruce LaBruce may have gotten some of his pig mask ideas for photo shoots from this film. The sign language and backwards vocals are very Lynchian. The instructional book Rozz refers to is probably the most impressive thing in this short. Although Rozz died in 1998, and this short seems to have come out in 1999 I can only assume it was released posthumously. Perhaps it was just a creative venture for his private collection."

A group of Incas escaped from South America to the Wild West and is home to a legendary treasure. You have to figure it out first! But one after anonther!\n\nMuckiMan Samson (Sergio Ciani under his Mucki name ALAN STEEL) alias William Smith is overjoyed with the beautiful Janet Nixon (Brigitte Heiberg). But suddenly their father is murdered, and Samson&apos;s best friend Alan Fox (Olympic ski champion Toni Sailer, who won three gold medals in Cortina d&apos;Ampezzo in 1956) comes under suspicion of murder. Samson doesn&apos;t believe a word of it. Then Alan is kidnapped by the real murderer (Mario Petri), who also got wind of the aforementioned Inca treasure.\n\nNot so easy to keep track of!\n\nIn all this confusion, Alan meets an Inca boy who he rescues from the criminals and who then helps him. It&apos;s just a shame that the good-looking Trollo didn&apos;t even notice that the nice Inca boy is actually the beautiful Princess Mysia (Anna Maria Polani). Oh right!\n\nMeanwhile, when he arrives in the Incas&apos; treasure cave, muscle man Samson joins his friend Alan. How exactly this happened was quickly forgotten. But whatever!\n\nAnd finally the tightly built westerner, who has so far been wearing his exciting western clothes, can take off his shirt to present his magnificent upper body. After all, Samson still has to live up to his name and tear down the pillars of the treasure vault. After all, why does Sergio Ciani have his huge muscles?\n\nYou can tell that you shouldn&apos;t take this wild amalgamation of different elements, which even with the best intentions don&apos;t fit together, too seriously. Just turn your head off and laugh!\n\nOther roles include Pierre Cressoy, Wolfgang Lukschy and Harry Riebauer as the sheriff.\n\nCertainly only for die-hard fans, but definitely entertaining!",

The film makers appeared to lack the financial resource to build a set to duplicate the buildings of past era, and it is very obvious to those who visited Shanghai that although the story was about the nineteen thirties, nineteen sixties, and nineteen eighties, the buildings are those newly built/remodeled in the late nineteen nineties."

      "reviewBody": "I thought this movie was riveting. It did start a little slow, but soon thereafter caught my full attention. I had to change mental gears from expecting a Pitch Black sequel/clone, but not in a bad way at all. And there ARE tie-ins with Pitch Black plainly evident unless you aren&apos;t particularly observant or haven&apos;t seen Pitch Black. I thought the special effects were some of the best I have seen in a very long time, and after I began to become adjusted to the more involved background story, I found it engrossing. I felt that the characters had some depth to them. Enough for me to care a little about a few of them anyway, and Riddick became a little less of a cardboard cut-out, and a little more intricate in this movie. Some of the action sequences are also pretty impressive. I find it quite disappointing that this did not do better in theaters, and intend my rental to become a purchase. I hope that they continue the series with the next one? or two? movies that have been rumored to be following. \n\nThose who found the movie itself disappointing, I would guess would be: 1) Hardcore sci-fi, or action movie fans who spent way too much time making mental comparisons to their favorite storyline/universe, or acting star during a movie to actually just enjoy the movie. 2) People who just wanted straight up action without all of the intricate details of a sci-fi storyline. 3) People expecting a sequel to Pitch black that didn&apos;t grow or expand on the storyline or character, who couldn&apos;t switch gears.\n\nI took this film as THIS film, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not spend the entire movie making mental comparisons to other sci-fi or action movies or stars. Yes some of it&apos;s ideas have been used before. So what? Plumbing was an idea used by the ancient Greek and roman civilizations. Should we not use plumbing, because someone else used it before? If you spend all of the time during the movie making comparisons, then you might not give the movie the full attention it deserves.\n\nFor any who enjoy a good sci-fi action movie with a little thought behind it, and don&apos;t have some holy grail to compare it with, I would highly recommend this one.",

      "reviewBody": "If Newman hadn&apos;t been up against Ghandi, he probably would have.  I think the Academy realized their error and Newman&apos;s win for The Color of Money was really for his portrayal of Frank Galvin, in this well-done tale of moral decrepitude and ultimate redemption.  Writer Mamet and Director Lumet are into heavy symbolism throughout, with the scene of the developing Poloroids of the victim (the case becomes clear in Galvin&apos;s mind), to Galvin&apos;s pilfering of a woman&apos;s mail to run down a lead on a potential witness. The closing statement of Newman&apos;s character to the jury is powerful."

We usually don&apos;t see the everyday life of mentally disabled in documentaries, and even more rare are the times they are seen expressing their thoughts, loves and frustrations through rough rock music.\n\nNow we do. We are able to watch lives we usually don&apos;t see and learn to know the people behind those speech difficulties and weird face expressions. We see how they gain popularity and become famous. This documentary takes you to a different rock&apos;n&apos;roll life with a professional touch. A well-made documentary that moves gently but close to the skin of its characters.",

You certainly don&apos;t think funny, and you&apos;d certainly never think he could play a NERD, but he does in this film.  Not only is he a convincing complete geek, but he&apos;s funny, AND sexy!\n\nThe story is pretty silly (inspired by &quot;Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs&quot;, really):  A group of dorky professors are writing an encyclopedia, and English Professor Cooper decides he needs more information on Slang.  In his quest for current jive talk he meets Barbara Stanwyck, as a too-lively singer/gang moll.  She takes advantage of his invitation to discuss verbiage to use his ivory tower as a hideout, and moves in with the professors.  She quickly decides to stay, then to have her way with Coop (who wouldn&apos;t), and then falls...\n\nA very funny, sprightly film, fast-paced and full of wonderful performances. Stanwyck is glowingly wonderful, but I still can&apos;t get over Cooper&apos;s wonderful characterization of a supremely attractive total geek.  If that sounds like a contradiction in terms, see the movie and you&apos;ll realize it&apos;s true."

The characters in the movie talk all the time about Friday and Halloween but the plot has to do with &quot;April Fool&apos;s Day&quot; and the death scenes with &quot;Scream&quot; and these others 90&apos;s movies. Yes, there is the house around the city,some teenagers killing each others and a &quot;misterious&quot; killer. The killer outfit is pretty nice, and the death scenes are good, better than IKWDLS Urban Legend... Focusing on the actors, bad performances except from one or two that i can&apos;t remember the names. But what&apos;s the problem with bad acting!!!!!!I love them!!! Anyway  Final Stab is worst than Scream but at the same level as Cherry Falls and better than  I know and Urban Legend . Watch!",

      "reviewBody": "At the expense of sounding a bit cliché, it wasn&apos;t on par with the best of the genre (Such as John Woo&apos;s better films), and in my opinion it wasn&apos;t quite on par with a more closely related title, The Big Heat. Why? The constant music was nothing special, and at it&apos;s worst, slightly annoying.\n\nThere are a few somewhat wooden performances. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was far better in Hard Boiled. I don&apos;t think Tat-Chi Yau knew how to wring all of the potential Tony has out of him for this film, and it shows.\n\nThere was a certain dynamic that&apos;s almost a staple of the HK action/crime genre missing... The power of the weapons wasn&apos;t conveyed as I&apos;ve seen it numerous films over the years. What I mean is that the guns didn&apos;t truly seem as powerful as they should of. The shots, underpowered, and it&apos;s a bit underwhelming when I&apos;m used to even pistols coming across as these loud, near deafening, definitive things. Small thing but it ran through the entire film and I think it&apos;s worth mentioning.\n\nCould of been about 20 minutes longer, with more characters being fleshed out a bit more. Film could of benefited a lot from that.\n\nBad subtitles. Quite a few misspelled words and I&apos;m sure I missed the gist of multiple things because of the poor subs. Ah well.\n\nThose are all relatively small issues I had with though, and on the flip side it&apos;s got a lot more positive things going for it. A great build-up of suspense at multiple times through the film, a pretty complex interweaving plot, two very interesting, I might dare say original action scenes which made me grin...\n\nTo boot, it was brutal and uncompromising. No humor (Though the random, unexplained vomiting kind of teetered on it) A few nice, brutal for this kind of film scenes that pleased the inner gore hound in me. The coloring throughout the film, as mentioned by others, was nice and added a nice dynamic to the film.\n\nHehhehehee, the movie also stars, without a doubt, the most unrelentingly sweaty character in the history of film. Tony Leung literally wipes his face down with a towel every few moments for almost the entire film. Hey, it&apos;s the little things that I get a kick out of. He kept washing his hands and what not too. I think he had some kind of sanitation issue.\n\nOverall, a 7.5 out of 10 in my very personal opinion. Well worth hunting down and adding to your collection, as it&apos;s a very solid entry in a sadly still declining genre.",

Coyote). Chuck Jones is a legend of this genre for good reason, and the special is well animated, and generally well done. The plot is pretty funny, as the Big Bad Wolf has basically taken Santa Claus hostage and set up shop as a businessman / corporate executive concerned with efficiency, and in his estimation Santa&apos;s is the least efficient operation around. So he will start new policies, including charging children for Christmas presents, and spreading Gloopstick (a plasticizing substance) over all the gifts so they&apos;ll never break (but also never be able to be played with). Some environmental criticism of materialistic culture for sure, but overall, a family and child friendly film about the magic of Christmas being love. The scene towards the end wherein the climax is reached and the conflict is resolved has a unique song that breaks the fourth wall with Raggedy Ann doing a bit of call and response song with the viewer.",

This movie was so bad and boring that I watched it (by its end) almost alone in the movie theater... I also wanted to leave but I never leave - may the movie the worst piece of crap or not! But here I almost lost my principles.\n\nStay away from this movie. It&apos;s top 1 on my top ten list of the worst movies I&apos;ve ever seen.

      "reviewBody": "Mirroring my review for BRING IT ON: ALL OR NOTHING years ago, I say that the &quot;losing&quot; team had much better moves. The Malibu Dream Team were more crotch-gyrating. The All Stars had a terrific lead dancer. Rachelle Brooke Smith was fantastic!\n\nOkay, about the movie itself. The first bit, oh, cr... I was already thinking up a super-negative headline. Let me say one thing straight. Christina Milian as the lead girl, no way. Old enough to be a teacher. In the patio training scene with personal favorite Sky, there you see real youth, real delicate movements. The weak link in the whole thing is a performance that just alienated me from the get-go. It did get better. But the damage was done...\n\nTo the reviewers complaining about not understanding, well, if you&apos;re watching on DVD, switch to subtitles. One round of that, next time you won&apos;t need it. It is a pretty valid point if you&apos;re not watching on DVD, though. I would not have been able to catch what was said.\n\nI ended up enjoying it immensely. And if The Raven compliments, well, take it as a feather in your cap.",

      "reviewBody": "Fourth part of the Teufelskerl series\n\nThe devils staged by Ernst Hofbauer had already arrived in Istanbul with the third part (&quot;Two devils on the way to Istanbul&quot;). The beating continued in the Yesilcam studios there. The Turkish film industry was at times the third largest film industry in the world in the 1970s. Mainly successful films from Hollywood and Cinecitta were &quot;creatively&quot; imitated. The original music was often treated very profitably without paying annoying royalties. :-)\n\nThis beating flick is also known in German-speaking countries as &quot;Drei Teufelskerle lachen alles nieder / Three Devils Laughing Everything Down&quot;, in Italy as &quot;Mettetemi in galera&quot; and in the USA as &quot;The Three Superboys in the Snow&quot;. The original cast included the acrobatic Alberto Dell&apos;Acqua as Arti. Wolf Goldan had already dropped out since the third part. But with the attractive Tarik Akan as Homer and the beefy Beyk Imanverdi (listed here as Jim Gordon) as Jim, there was powerful reinforcement.\n\nAs always in the films of the TEUFELSKERL series, the actual plot is not worth mentioning. The small-time crooks Arti and Homer get by with charm and tough fists. Then they find out that a certain Jafar (Öztürk Serengil) has embezzled and hidden a lot of money. Even though he&apos;s in prison, he doesn&apos;t want to reveal where he&apos;s hiding. Together with the assertive Jim, the two day thieves approach Jafar in prison in order to gain his trust. When they finally know where the loot is and the good-for-nothings are out again, the gang boss Smerlock (Hüseyin Alp) and his henchmen also want to get their hands on the money. So there are enough reasons for a number of fights in which the three devils can beat up countless opponents to their heart&apos;s content. In prison, in the hammam, in a laundry and even in the snow, there are crazy fights in which the three Superboys of course always come out on top. But the smart guys also know how to use a woman&apos;s weapons in a targeted manner. So they cause a lot of laughs in women&apos;s costumes, which was particularly well received by the Turkish cinema audience at the time. Of course, it won&apos;t be revealed here whether they can get the money they&apos;re looking for with all of these skills...\n\nSo don&apos;t expect a masterpiece here. Of course not! What&apos;s important in this film is that there are a lot of funny beating scenes. Alberto Dell&apos;Acqua impresses again with his circus-ready agility. Beyk Imanverdi gives a strong performance. A big surprise is the smart Tarik Akan (1949-2016), who not only impresses as a dashing womanizer, but can also hit hard. Tarik Akan has had a very interesting career in Turkish film. He also played the main role in &quot;Yol - The Path&quot;, which was awarded the Palme d&apos;Or at Cannes in 1982. So a really good actor as a fist-swinging devil who could also make a mark in the ArtHouseCinema!\n\nAfter this film, the TEUFELSKERL series was finally over. The spectators were tired of the brawls. From now on, the originals Bud Spencer and Terence Hill had no competition when it came to spanking movies.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an adaptation of Howard Pyle&apos;s &quot;Men of Iron&quot;, and an unusually enjoyable film from start to finish. Ignore Tony Curtis&apos;s accent; it hardly matters to anyone that young and everyone in the film is bright, lively and suitable to his/her part. The direction by Rudolph Mate gives a light, sunny feel to the entire piece, and he keeps the action moving splendidly in my judgment. The storyline is classic. Myles and his sister Meg have been raised as peasants. One day they journey to Mackworth Castle and enter a new world, the world of noble landowners, quarrelsome young prigs and knights. Myles continues to search for the secret of his origins and finds it in the Library finally, the Black Shield of Falworth, shield of an attainted traitor--his father; of course he was innocent; and when Myles turns out to be a promising young knight of courage and natural skills, he is willing to be knighted in order to fight it out--at Prince Hal (the future Henry V&apos;s) plan--with the villain of the piece to claim his rightful heritage and wear the family symbol again. Along the way, he falls in love with the daughter of the household and his sister with his best friend in the dangerous and unruly body of young knights. In the cast along with Curtis and Barbara Rush as Meg are Janet Leigh, then Curtis&apos;s wife, as his love, Torin Thatcher in top form as the master of knights, David Farrar, Herbert Marshall as Mackworth, Dan O&apos; Herlihy as Prince Hal, Patrick O&apos;Neal as Walter Blunt (very good), and Craig ill as his friend Frances; others in the stellar cast include Ian Keith as Henry IV, Doris Lloyd, Rhys Williams, Maurice Marsac and others. Music was supplied by Hans J. Salter, and the screenplay adaptation of Pyle&apos;s novel is the work of Oscar Brodney. Irving Glasberg&apos;s cinematography is delightfully rich,the art direction by Alexander Golitzen and Richard H. Ledel very good indeed. Rosemary Odell&apos;s costume are worth the price of admission. But this is an in-depth adventurous look behind the grim tapestries that usually baffle the seeker into the late Medieval Age, There is humor in this film, much hard learning for the young knight-to-be, mystery, skillful dialogue and unusually well-developed characters. This is an enjoyable and memorable work that is bright and lively from start to finish.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very logical and well-considered storyline developed from David Westheimer&apos;s WWWII thriller by Wendell Mayes and Joseph Landon The escape that ends this film, a trainborne flight across Italian lines toward Switzerland provides a vivid action climax when the train is attacked; it is a bit implausible only because of the length of time the train has to go on unstopped. The film begins its exciting adventure narrative with the arrival of &quot;Von Ryan&quot;, then Ryan, among a group of busy British and American sorts trying to escape from a stalag run by a sadistic commandant. They are being punished, but will not give up their attempts. As the now-ranking senior officer, Ryan orders them to stop escaping, then betrays their tunnels to the enemy in return for decent conditions. He is betrayed; then he issues an order that causes him to be put into solitary. he gets respect from this; but he is now &quot;Von Ryan&quot; for the remainder of the film. the war ends; the prisoners revolt successfully and capture the Commandant. Then they have to move overland to escape, and&quot;Von Ryan&apos;s&quot; sparing of some prisoners costs lives. But it his great idea once they are captured and put aboard a train to be taken to imprisonment in Germany is to steal the train and head for safety elsewhere. They succeed; against all odds, even though he must kill an Italian officer&apos;s loyal betrayer, a beautiful woman; and by ruse, attack, feint, false messages and speed, they do what is necessary. Then as they head for Switzerland, the German planes attack. And at the last, Ryan runs after the train, the last of all--and becomes a legend the hard way. Music by Jerry Goldsmith, makeup by Ben Nye, cinematography by William H. Daniels , art direction by Hilyard B. Brown and John Martin Smith all under the direction of producer-director Mark Robson add up to a recipe for a first-rate color adventure film. As Ryan, Frank Sinatra is not entirely miscast and tries very hard, sensibly underplaying his role, matched every step of the way by Trevor Howard who mostly reacts and gives speeches about the way things ought to be done, very effectively. Edward Mulhare comes off Academy Award level in the film, and others such as John van Dreelin, Sergio Fantoni, Adolfo Celi as the Commandant, and Vito Scotti do well. Raffalla Carra is the girl Ryan must kill, Wolfgang Preiss, Brad Dexter, John Leyton and Richard Bakalyan are soldiers on one side or another. There are many exciting scenes provided, none moreso than Mulhare&apos;s impersonation of a German officer; the death of the girl, the final attacks on the train, several of the scenes set in the Stalag and the train&apos;s progress which is counterpoised many times to German language scenes of what their pursuers are doing; dialogue scenes lead here to action, action to reassessments, to challenges and to consequences. This is sometimes a slick film, but never a boring one, I suggest. Its characters are not developed as they would have been in a dramatic film; this is an adventure-level film with dramatic elements. And it is a good and occasionally thrilling ride, with the curious sense about it of a dream and a symbol both. Its theme is the courage to dare; and in the enigmatic Ryan, it finds an appropriate hero, a bit tarnished about the edges as a soldier but a first-rate result-getter nevertheless.",

      "reviewBody": "Lars Von Trier&apos;s feature début is a stylish, extremely bizarre and intriguing tapestry about an ex-cop (Michael Elphick) who obsessively pursues a serial killer. Playing with different film genres and supported by a fantastic production design, &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; was very different from what I expected, but not in a bad way. This is the first film in Lars&apos; &apos;Europe trilogy&apos;, followed by &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1987) and &quot;Zentropa&quot; (1991). Influenced by Fritz Lang, Terry Gilliam and many others, the film also has a voice of its own (Von Trier&apos;s raging verve); I&apos;d call it &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; meets &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, so you can have an idea of how bizarre it is. If that sounds interesting to you, you should check it; even if you&apos;re not into the likes of &quot;Dogville&quot; or &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;, you may still appreciate it. Interesting for Von Trier fans and admirers of puzzles alike. 8/10."

      "reviewBody": "This prequel was very enjoyable and charming. I don&apos;t think it isn&apos;t as good as the classic first film or the series(a childhood favourite of mine), but I do think it is an improvement over the rather average Little Mermaid 2:Return to the Sea. Here, the animation is breathtaking, beautifully fluid and colourful, and fairly true in terms of style to the original. The music, while not as catchy as Alan Menekn&apos;s score in the original, is still surprisingly delightful. I Remember was outstanding. And the voice acting is great, Jim Cummings is a worthy replacement of Kenneth Mars as Triton, and Jodi Benson(who also voiced Thumbelina in the Don Bluth movie, Ariel isn&apos;t the only role she&apos;s done, it&apos;s just the role she&apos;s best remembered by) is just amazing as Ariel, with a fantastic singing voice that makes me want to sing with her. Remember the song in the series&apos; episode Wish Upon a Starfish, Daring To Dance, amazing song, amazing vocals that reduced me to tears. Marina-marvellously voiced by Sally Field- is an improvement over the bland Morgana, Sebastian is hilarious, there is nice character development and Benjamin is so cute. And the beginning with Ariel&apos;s mother brought some poignancy. However, the film is too short, the plot while a wonderful idea is rather so-so in execution and takes time to get going, and Flounder&apos;s voice was more teenage than innocent-sounding, the latter suited the character more. Still it is a very charming prequel and well worth the look. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Anyone can enjoy this film, whether they&apos;re a major sci-fi buff or not.  As a matter of fact, I didn&apos;t figure out until I was pretty far into the movie that it was sci-fi at all!  Which is to say--this movie might be the closest representation of what *would* happen if visitors from the future or outer space or somewhere showed up.  Hollywood makes no appearance in this film. The story is intelligent, coherent and easy to follow.  Every detail is taken care of easily and completely, so the story hangs together marvelously, unlike some sci-fi movies I could name.  Everyone acts well and believably.  Jeff Daniels proves his worth as a serious actor, and Adriana is one of the cutest and least-annoying child actors I&apos;ve seen.  The character of Oscar adds just the right amount of humour the movie needs. The script avoids cliches, as does the concept. I think the producers should&apos;ve gone ahead and released Grand Tour theatrically, instead of merely on cable TV.  Then maybe a wider audience would&apos;ve (or could&apos;ve) seen and enjoyed this fine example of what a good director can do with good actors acting a good script from a good story. What can I say?--the movie&apos;s good."

This film was the first of their horror-comedies, and Lou&apos;s frightened reactions were so hilarious, all films that followed featured at least one scene where Costello gets scared, no matter what the film was about. The film is a very clever, &quot;Old Dark House&quot; type of film, with an excellent cast. Most notable is the beautiful Evelyn Ankers(one of Universal&apos;s most famous scream queens) as one of the strangers trapped in the house with Bud and Lou. Everything about this film is great. No complaints on my part!",

It begins with an intriguing premise- that a witness to an attack saw more than he perceived- and pays off with a nice thriller.\n\nMy only beef is that I rewatched the beginning after it was over and, well, try it for yourself.\n\nIf you liked this and can stomach some much more extreme gore, try TENEBRAE. Maybe you shouldn&apos;t watch them back-to-back as I did, but give it a spin some time."

      "reviewBody": "Platina Data is a Japanese thriller / sci-fi / mystery. I mainly watched it because Kazunari Ninomiya was in it, but I also found the premise of the movie interesting. In the movie, Japan is developing a DNA database that has everyone in it. The main goal is to be able to solve crimes more easily. However, already at the beginning we can see that they have taken DNA profiling to the next level. When people closely related to the program die, a surprising series of events start. More would be spoilers.\n\nI found the movie interesting. The story had me glued to the screen. Though frankly, I knew who the killer was halfway through. It&apos;s usually the case with me. I probably watch too many crime shows. What did keep me watching was Nino&apos;s character, whose story was an integral part of the movie. The cinematography was excellent. Some pictures I was tempted to pause, because it spoke of so much. Silence is always more difficult than dialogue.\n\nThe main character is played by Nino. He&apos;s a scientist working on the DNA system. I have watched him in other movies, and I always find him very good. He made me forget that it was Nino that I was watching. The other main character is Detective Reiji Asama (Etsushi Toyokawa), who is tasked with figuring out who committed the murder. While being a prolific actor, I actually haven&apos;t seen him in anything, but I&apos;m definitely going to hunt some of his work down now.\n\nOverall, this is an exciting movie. It has many twists and turns, and I didn&apos;t even see them all coming! Worth checking out, even if you have to read the subtitles.",

I didn&apos;t think I would like it but the movie actually pulled me in - got me interested fairly fast and held it to the end of the film - I was surprised.\n\nIt&apos;s a weird film! A couple gets married, goes on honeymoon, stays at the honeymoon motel, here comes the ambulance then complete strangeness of the film begins. The more of the film you watch, the stranger it gets.\n\nThe movie will have you asking questions: Why didn&apos;t she go to the police right from the start? Why did truck driver Bill help her (he never answered her nor the viewer&apos;s question)? Why did the truck drivers help her? When the police did get involved, why didn&apos;t she tell them there ARE other witnesses - the truck drivers? What happened to the ambulance drivers at the end of the film - were they caught? \n\nDr.Jackson is creepy - even when she decides to turn herself into the police and helps the girl she&apos;s just plain creepy! \n\nThis is not a great film but it is an interesting one. It takes some twists and turns that are unexpected - it&apos;s not a slasher film like I thought it was going to be. It&apos;s not perfect - it&apos;s got it&apos;s flaws - but it is worth watching for a 1970s made for TV horror-thriller.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "WARNING - YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS FILM\n\nThis is the ONE film that made Gérard Depardieu a world-wide superstar. Although he was a star in the french cinema for years, Gérard Depardieu was an un-heard-of unknown in the United States prior to the success, and critical acclaim of this french language film. This film also won 2 Academy awards in 1990(best foriegn film, and best costume). If you have ever seen this film then you know that this was the role that Gérard Depardieu was born to play. After seeing this I cannot imagine another actor in the world playing this role but Gérard Depardieu. This movie will make you laugh, and it will make you cry. You cannot help but to experience all of Cyrano&apos;s passions and his lust for life, as well as his heartache for never getting Roxanne to fall in love with him,and his anger and embarassment he feels about his self-contiousness about his large nose. As the film moves foward you grow to love the Cyrano de Bergerac charactor as you experience his emotions with him.There is some good battle scenes and some action scenes and even some killing(but what little bloodshed is done in this film -is done with good taste and relavence to the story instead of a bunch of meaningless killing like as seen in other films in this genre). This is about as well done as any film will ever get. I give it 5 out of 5 stars, a perfect film- A masterpiece",

This is mostly due to the dark lighting and extremely creepy sound effects. In ways it reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Be forewarned though: This movie is EXTREMELY violent, gory and quite disturbing in a couple of scenes. Of course the subject matter about a guy who gets out of prison and starts making &quot;snuff&quot; films with his buddies is offensive in and of itself, other movies have used this theme since then. Most notably 8MM. Last House on Dead End Street is pretty scary but definitely not for the squeamish."

I truly adored the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout. \n\nJamie Foxx has become one of the premiere actors in Hollywood as is clearly shown in Ray and he should get an Oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive accolades. I really liked Kerry Washington who played the exceptional wife...Ray Charles obviously married well. Regina King is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a struggling young mother.\n\nIn all honesty, I&apos;d say this whole project was providentially arranged. The entire cast was perfect, great screenplay and awesome settings...major props to the director Taylor Hackford and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of Ray Charles to the screen so flawlessly. This is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "The title of this movie was my prime stimulus to watch it: not only to deconstruct the meaning but also because a movie about math - apparently - might provide a unique filmic experience, I thought. Well ... I&apos;m correct about the first, but not the second.\n\nHappily for viewers, it&apos;s not all about math. But the story is about a young man who is, at an early age, recognized as a math genius. We follow him, Mattia (Luca Marinelli) and his childhood companion, Alice (Alba Rohrwacher), as they both grow up, through their teen years and on to adulthood. Both are introverted to the point of almost total withdrawal; both indulge in aberrant behaviors; both experience intense personal and psychic pain early in life which heightens their isolation; but, also, both recognize each other for what they are - primal individuals unable to communicate according to society&apos;s dictates. \n\nFor the next twenty plus years, they each try to establish a lasting relationship with each other. During the course of that time, they briefly meet, in person, perhaps on five or six occasions; at the end of the story, Alice sends a short, urgent letter, to which Mattia responds in person. At all other times, we see their lives unfold individually as they each grapple with the many obnoxious (or helpful) people who intrude upon their solitary existences.\n\nSome viewers might find the plot too slow; indeed, a few sets and scenes do include long static shots, particularly facial close-ups. What&apos;s more annoying, though, is the elliptical structure of the story as it cuts between three different time periods; which I&apos;m sure will tend to confuse some or even many viewers. Having read the novel - brilliant writing which worked exceedingly well as a linear narrative - I&apos;m still puzzled why the director decided upon disjointed flashbacks. Visually, it doesn&apos;t work well at all; frankly, it lessens the dramatic tension, especially when compared with the novel.\n\nMy overarching criticism, however, concerns the ending, the resolution to Mattia&apos;s and Alice&apos;s solitary anguish. In the novel, it ends realistically and appropriately, I thought. This movie&apos;s end is, unfortunately, hopelessly Hollywood.\n\nThe production is competent, although I think the music is too loud at times. The cast and acting are fine. In view of my above comments, though, my recommendation is: read the novel, forget the movie. Give it 5 out of 10, barely.\n\nMay 2nd, 2016",

      "name": "Besson wanting to claim himself as an &quot;auteur&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "Besson&apos;s intention by directing this movie was good. There is, it seemed to me, a big effort to make his film deep considering the discourse. It can be perceptible through the plenty of plays with symbols that are contained in it. The main problem is that by writing such dialogs, certain scenes seem too artificial and often too long. This has to be added to the fact that if you see the film in french, you&quot;ll quickly notice that the dialogs that often concern both J Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen are more than sometimes incomprehensible and require a permanent attention to decipher them. Rie Rasmussen, even if she&apos;s quite a wonderful creature on a physical aspect, is however an average actress and the scenes that deal with emotions are spoiled -this is rather surprising considering Besson&apos;s job on The Professional- by a clumsy actor&apos;s direction. However cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is astounding and foreigners will find a wonderful black and white postcard of Paris as they&apos;ll see the movie. It is also regrettable that Besson didn&apos;t appeal to Eric Serra for the soundtrack. For Besson&apos;s defense, it must be said, I think, that his staff and himself have worked in such constraining circumstances to shot in Paris that the number of shots was counted and couldn&apos;t allow actors to give their full potential. This is the first time also that a director has full access to production and budget resources by himself so he can write a screenplay that does not have to be selected by instances like CNC allowing himself to direct a personal but too poorly &quot;collaborative&quot; project. Anyway, this is a film that has definitely to be seen.",

Cusack stars as a hotshot air traffic controller whose top dog status is threatened by the arrival of the equally gifted but enigmatic Billy Bob Thornton. Cusack&apos;s mounting rivalry with the inscrutable Thornton eventually consumes his personal life as he falls prey to Thornton&apos;s sexy wife (Angelina Jolie) and his marriage (to Cate Blanchett) gradually disintegrates. Director Mike Newell showed great flair in balancing comedy and drama in 1994&apos;s &quot;Four Weddings And A Funeral&quot;, but here the mix is less assured and the extremes far too close together. Only fitfully amusing, &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; too rarely concentrates on its examination of air traffic controllers and their daily stresses, opting instead for a simple one-upmanship plotline with a superficial and sometimes flippant look at the men and women within whose hands we entrust our lives. The four leads are more than adequate in their roles, though the characters portrayed by Blanchett and Jolie (excellent during her brief appearances) are all but forgotten for long stretches at a time. As for rental possibilities, visibility should remain zero."

      "name": "Captain America: The Winter Solider",
      "reviewBody": "Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.\n\nThe Winter Soldier does everything that a sequel should do, and that&apos;s improve on every aspect from the last film. The creative team told a juicer, more cohesive story, with better character involvement and development, while the action not only took a step up, but became one of the standout films for it&apos;s action sequences. Not only did they improve from the first installment, keeping the continuity involved, but they created one of, if not, the best stand-alone films the MCU has put out to date. The creative team utilized so many great layers and depth, to really break everything down, while adding in a tremendous amount of tention throughout the entire narrative.\n\nWith Shield being the main focus of the film, I wasn&apos;t too sure on how things were going to play out, but because of the Russo Brothers creativity, I was perfectly okay with it! With Shield being center of attention, it allowed for Sam Jackson to have a lot more character moments, which had a heavy hand in the success of the film! Chris Evans is an absolute stud as Captain America and Steve Rogers! He is fleshed out much more, having the best character arch of the film. His character is a lot more complex this time around, other than being that public figure everyone knows him for. Evans steals every scene that he&apos;s in because of that genuine patriotism persona he carries, being nothing short of admirable. Scarlett Johansson was also another key contributor to the success of the film. We&apos;ve seen her in a few films prior, getting a little bit more and more to do as the films go on, and she really sets out her skillset here. With decent chemistry and tention between her and Captain America, and her and Nick Fury, she shows once again, that she is capable of being an Avenger. Anthony Mackie gets his debut in the MCU as Sam Wilson/Falcon, and he is just an all around good addition. He doesn&apos;t add much as far as the superhero antics go, but he is a great compliment to Captain America, and the team. The Winter Soldier is a GAME villain! He doesn&apos;t have much to say, but his physical presence is quite enough for him to be a decent villain, with a great tie in to the series.\n\nThis is probably one of the strongest screenplays by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. They wasted no time after The First Avenger, to hop right into the screenplay for this film. McFeely and Markus added a great amount of wit to this script, by making everything cohesive to the story, while incorporating some dialed down, yet sharp humor. They added a great deal of politics to the narrative, that isn&apos;t just all in your face; it flows extremely well with the story, feeling authentic.\n\nThe action of the film was definitely the driving force of the film. All of the action scenes were shot so well, with many exciting and gritty action sequences! The Russo Brothers executed the hand-to-hand combat in such a professional way, and it just looked fantastic! The visual effects weren&apos;t heavily relied on, like they usually are, but when they were present, everything looked seamless.\n\nOverall, there is no reason why this film shouldn&apos;t be at the top of your list; one of the best the MCU has to offer !",

I thought it was a light hearted, typical French Comedy.  I think the reviewer fails to understand that the typical French Comedy is either based on mistaken identity, or a mistiming problem or a combination of both.\n\n The French seem to have honed this genre to a fine art.  Take for example the Dinner de Cons which does both, timing problems and mistaken identity. There are a few exceptions such as Ripoux, or My New Partner but this is pretty much what to expect from a French Comedy.\n\nIn the Gift, the first mistaken identity is the woman on the train.  The hero who is retiring from the bank is given an expensive call girl for the weekend to accompany him on his last business trip to Venice...he does not know she is a professional and he believes she is attracted to him...thereafter there are series of timing errors and other mistaken identifications which leads to his wife coming to Venice, his son, his boss, etc. while he is hob knobing with shieks and tycoons...\n\nNo one is hurt, everyone comes out ahead and it is a fun movie...I saw in the recommendation of Siskel and Ebert and wasn&apos;t sorry.",

      "reviewBody": "Nie lubie poniedzialku is a great satire on the Polish reality during the period of harsh Communism. Tadeusz Chmielewski, similarly to another famous comedy director Stanisław Bareja, wanted to present the society and all of its problems in a really exaggerated way. \n\nWhat may be surprising to some of the viewers is the fact, that even though the movie presents a caricature of the country&apos;s situation, there are still some scenes and incidents that could have as well taken place in the 70&apos;s.\n\nThe movie takes on a truly irreverent tone, as it shows all of the occurring characters as people that may seem totally out of context. Yet, their peculiar behavior beautifully intertwines with the main storyline.\n\nAll the events in this film occur on one unlucky Monday. As the title says: &apos;I hate Mondays&apos;. Because who doesn&apos;t? Everything bad always happens at the beginning of the week and it is better to stay at home and wait for the next day, just to avoid any misfortunes.\n\nHere we find an Italian, who through a complex (and really funny) series of events is mistakenly taken for a totally different person. The most amazing fact is that nobody even noticed the he can only speak Italian. However, due to magnificent Polish hospitality he finds himself right in the middle of a big ceremony. And if this wasn&apos;t enough, he is also dragged into an affair with a pretty Polish lady.\n\nIn order to be able to fully understand all the dialogues, comical situations, and many, sometimes very odd, accidents one has to know even a bit about the history of Poland in the post-war era. It is almost impossible to translate the conversations to English language (or any other) without losing their contextual meaning. \n\nHowever, if you still want to experience a bit of Polish reality in those very hard times, but experience it with dozens of laughs, be sure to watch Nie lubie poniedzialku. It&apos;s definitely one of the best comedies that the country has to offer.",

All I&apos;m sure of is that it was for me.\n\nSet the Thames on Fire invites you to an absurd yet magical world, telling an incredibly bittersweet story of love and dreams and gives you a quite nihilistic, yet sweet look on the world.\n\n&quot;Why are you smiling?&quot; &quot;Because him and me even if we didn&apos;t work out..&quot; &quot;You haven&apos;t worked out&quot; &quot;Even if we didn&apos;t work out. We had fun.&quot;\n\nIt doesn&apos;t really have any profound massage, at least from my interpretation, yet it&apos;s a beautiful ,personal and incredibly sweet story of two people who found each other right when they needed to. It&apos;s not overly &quot;romantic&quot; nor too dramatic, it takes itself for what it is, which is a very entertaining tale in an amusing yet horrifying world.\n\nOverall I recommend it if you&apos;re looking for something rather &quot;artistic&quot; and you&apos;re open to nontraditional story telling. If you&apos;re fine with watching kind of surreal, dream-like media than this will definitely fit your taste.",

It&apos;s a delightful look at him in a classic comic predicament -- a man who thinks his first wife is dead discovers on his honeymoon night with his second wife that wife #1 is still amongst the living. The next complication: she has spent 7 years with another man -- and Grant gets to do his best as the jealous husband.\n\nThis is just plain funny."

      "reviewBody": "The Panama Deception (1992) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nOscar-winning documentary takes a look at the American invasion of Panama in 1989. Through archival footage from all the major networks, we see that the majority of Americans and all of the media were behind this invasion even though overtime it became clear that they were mislead about the real reasons. People were told that it was for American safety but this documentary tries to show a more malicious reason, which resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of Panama citizens being killed. When viewing this film today I think many people will connect it to events that are going on within the last few years. Overall this is a pretty impressive documentary and you can tell that the director really has a passion and anger over what happened. There&apos;s some pretty graphic material here and especially towards the end when we&apos;re told about all the mass graves and we see some brutal footage of them being dug up where we see many of the bodies that were thrown in there. We also get some photographs of dead civilians who were shot and just left on the streets. Throughout all of this we get footage from the major news broadcasts and we see how they were all behind the invasion and not too many questions were asked and not much detail was given to anything except showing the Americans who were killed. As impressed as I was with the film, the one thing I&apos;d hold against it (and many documentaries) is that they only show one side of the story. It&apos;s really too bad someone who supported what happened wasn&apos;t interviewed to give their opinions on why this invasion was needed. Many sources here are Panama newspapers and I&apos;m really not sure if we can trust them any more than we can trust American newspapers. With that said, THE PANAMA DECPTION does a very good job at getting its point across and history buffs will certainly want to check this out."

      "reviewBody": "I came here today to look up Ferenc Zenthe (after I learned that the Actor of the Nation passed away earlier today) and his life. If we hear the name Zenthe usually two of his &apos;films&apos; come to mind (though both of them were series): the &quot;Szomszédok&quot; (Neighbours) and the &quot;A Tenkes kapitánya&quot; (Captain Of The Tenkes) so I was greatly surprised to find no comment here.\n\nThis series is known by everyone in the country. You can hardly find a person in Hungary who doesn&apos;t know the music of the film. (I didn&apos;t write soundtrack, because it is more than that. When you hear it from the radio you think: &quot;Ah, yes, the Captain of The Tenkes.&quot;) \n\nWhen the series was first broadcast on TV it was so popular that it was introduced even in China (and it is a long way from Hungary) and became ever so popular there as well. After the series they made a shorter 2-hour version as well and both can be seen on TV quite often even nowadays.\n\nOne of the actors said that it is almost like a fairytale and it is watched best as that. There is no blood flowing, we can&apos;t see any murders committed with revenge or hate, sometimes it is slow, there is no slang and of course it is black and white. But if you actually sit down to watch it it will grab you and will never let you go. It is a tale where the good wins but the bad doesn&apos;t really suffer either. The performances are outstanding, from the youngest first-time-actors to the oldest experts.\n\nIt is about how Máté Eke (the &apos;Captain&apos;) and the people near the castle of Siklós try to rebel against the commander of the castle and make his days hell while awaiting the relieving troops of the kuruc&apos;s to finally free them from the rule of the foreign soldiers, set in the early 18th century. \n\nIt is a tale which can be watched even by children (not just over 12 or 13) and is constantly re-watched by adults.\n\nIt is one of those rare films which will be broadcast even in 20 years, for the &apos;Captain&apos; and his whole bunch simply cannot be forgotten.",

Her workaday like is a background to her domestic life with flashbacks of school, a failed love, and death ... a major theme in her writing.\n\nBut rather than being gloomy, the film points out the joys of a life even if unfulfilled by husband and children. Jackson enacts many of Stevie&apos;s poems as a counterpoint to her own life, and she is quite superb.\n\nMona Washbourne is excellent and endearing as the aging aunt who really doesn&apos;t understand the Bohemian life of her gifted niece. Yet they have a wonderful life together. The domestic scenes of the simple joys of conversation and good sherry are wondrous.\n\nAlec McCowen is the lost suitor. Trevor Howard is the narrator who wanders through the story.\n\nA pity this is not available on DVD. A lovely film for the intelligent viewer."

      "reviewBody": "Joao de Deus, broke down spindly intellectual, lives in the yellow house in Lisbon, a fussy boarding house for various of life&apos;s unattached. His touchstone is Erich von Stroheim, lady&apos;s man, chevalier, cineaste. He is also a Quixotic sensualist, and when frustrated in his attempts, an assaulter of women. He aspires towards a certain divinity, inspired to action by enabled figures such as Beethoven, von Stroheim, and Empedokles (via Hölderlin). This divinity exists, not so much in the eyes of others (although there are occasional flutterings of recognition), but in his own view and strivings. Reality is a big obstacle here, hard to pretend to be a god when you have to wait in line to use the bathroom. It is at these times that Joao has a certain elan, as if he is generously willing to overlook life&apos;s indignities.\n\nEmpedoklites were the followers of Empedokles, proclaiming one&apos;s own divinity can inspire followers, and maybe Monteiro makes a play for followers here. Life is somewhat of an embarrassment, why are we constantly needing to be ashamed of our instincts, who endowed Joao with the senses and appetites to make him lust after almost entirely uninterested women thirty years his junior. What is it to be a god other than to do as one&apos;s passions dictate?\n\nIt&apos;s important to be clear that sexually assaulting women is a nauseating and objectively wrong activity (consent violations are violations of objective morality). An educated individual can nonetheless take some vicarious enjoyment in Monteiro&apos;s staged displays of narcissism, and indeed the opening of the film is a mosquito tone designed to repel a different type of audience to the lobby. The film contains other provocations, designed to test the intimacy which our familiarity with his medical complaints has established, but also various sublime moments: various scenes suggest that classical music is our access to the divine; sat here, quite by chance listening to Beethoven&apos;s Pastoral Symphony on a shuffle, I find it impossible to disagree.\n\nJoao&apos;s watery-eyed dignity asks of God the eternal &quot;why?&quot; question, immortalised by Blake in his painting of 1795, &quot;Elohim Creating Adam&quot;. Whether this feeling of &quot;J&apos;accuse!&quot; legitimises his behaviour and the blasphemy of the ending is a question for each viewer, it&apos;s certainly a very funny film that is far from unreasonable, I prefer it to the more famous brand of solipsism from Allen.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this when it was fresh on video and it is weird. Like TRACK 29 by Nicolas Roeg is weird. Both films have screenplays by the irrepressibly strange (God bless him) Dennis Potter; This one has 2 heavyweights of the British theater, Denholm Elliot and Joan Plowright, and a thoroughly convincing STING as ...what? An evil sprite? The devil himself? watch it and try to come to your own conclusion; that is the pleasure of this odd little gem.\n\nRichard Loncraine has style to burn and he fills the screen with expertly crafted compositions and he has a nice tendency to use slightly wide-angle lenses to make everyday objects take on a malevolent aspect; he knows how to shoot STING, in order to make him look sinister, that is for sure. Bravo.\n\nOver the years I have shown this to many different people and it always captivates them and holds their attention from the first frame to the last. I would have to say this is my favorite of anything Dennis Potter has written to hit the cinema screens,so far. He is a difficult artist do do justice to, but BRIMSTONE &amp; TREACLE delivers the goods,in spades. Its darkly funny and also thoroughly squirm-inducing in places. The acting is all first rate; Denholm Elliot is magnificent as the repressed and domineering husband; he projects a marvelous sense of twitchy hostility and discomfort; watching him agonize is one of the films strange pleasures. And Sting is fantastic. I think a lot of people here on the IMDb are being unfair to him because of his pop stardom, but I think he delivers an excellent performance, full of sly menace and sinister charm.",

There&apos;s plenty of weirdness, certainly, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after, but also stretches where not much of interest occurs, and the bulk of the bizarreness comes during the last third of the film.\n\nMost of the special effects are of the chintzy, rubbery variety, probably on par with American schlock of the 1950s. There are a few genuinely gruesome moments, however, with worms and gore, so squeamish viewers are forewarned.\n\nNewcomers to Indonesian fare are directed to Queen of Black Magic or Lady Terminator first. If you&apos;ve already seen all of the other Indonesian titles offered by Mondo Macabro, however, and still find yourself wanting more, White Alligator Queen is available if you know where to look.\n\nNote: The other reviewer mentions a musical sequence that wasn&apos;t present in the version I watched, so it may be that there are different cuts of varying degrees of surrealism floating around out there.",

      "reviewBody": "India has, through the years, fascinated many a major film-maker, including Robert Flaherty, Fritz Lang, Louis Malle, Michael Powell, Roberto Rossellini and Jean Renoir. Renoir&apos;s film, based on a novel by English novelist Rumer Godden of BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) fame, is as gorgeously shot (in ravishing Technicolor) as can be expected from a master film-maker and the son of a famous French impressionist painter; however, the narrative itself is rather disappointingly thin to support its 99-minute running time. Having said that, the coming-of-age story of two English girls living in India and loving the same young officer wounded in WWII, is appealingly performed by Nora Swinburne, Esmond Knight, Arthur Shields and Adrienne Corri. The central character, played winningly by newcomer Patricia Walters (whose only film this turned out to be) is a stand-in for Godden herself, whose considerable writing talent was not encouraged by her stern family. The film offers Renoir another chance to show his humanist side dwelling as it does on the strange (to Western eyes) social and religious customs of the Indian people; even so, when all is said and done, there is just too much local color in the film. However, as Renoir is not only one of my favorite film directors but arguably the greatest of all French film-makers, I am confident that a second viewing of THE RIVER will elevate significantly my estimation of it, as it is probably too rich an experience to savor all at one go.\n\nAmong the copious supplements on the Criterion DVD, there is a typically enthusiastic interview with Martin Scorsese (who also helped in funding the film&apos;s restoration) who waxes lyrically on the effect the film had on him as a 9 year-old film-goer; surprisingly for me, he also confesses that the appeal of Renoir&apos;s masterpiece, LA REGLE DU JEU (1939), an automatic candidate for the title of the greatest film of all time, escapes him!!",

      "reviewBody": "Arriving on local theaters without the benefit of 3-D, the novelty of &quot;The Final Destination&quot; goes doubly kaput, as it not only lacks inspired deaths and sympathetic characters, but also because the flatness of David R. Ellis&apos; body bag-fodder isn&apos;t mitigated by whatever shallow entertainment an additional dimension might have brought.\n\nEric Bress&apos; script wastes no time in shaping its interchangeable characters as, apparently, Death has to immediately dive into placing its cardboard victims in intricate fatalities that have been the series&apos; central gimmick. Nick (Bobby Campo) experiences a premonition of a disaster in a race track and manages to get a few people out, who would have otherwise died. As per the franchise&apos;s tradition, Death won&apos;t be cheated and it starts to do anything -- like toppling cans and letting waters drip -- to create a ripple of events that would eliminate the survivors.\n\nDespite showing how lame entertainment can be entertainingly lame with &quot;Snakes on a Plane,&quot; Ellis -- who also directed &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; -- doesn&apos;t strive for an ounce of creativity, resulting to a terribly disposable fare that fails to hit its its mark despite aiming so low. And as embodied by the narrative shortcuts this gorefest constantly employs, the Rube Goldberg set pieces start to feel less impressive than mechanical, which makes one believe that Death has worked itself too much over the last three installments.",

      "reviewBody": "In the future, overpopulation has become such an issue that those in authority take some pretty drastic steps. Any couple that refuses to get with the program and stop having kids will be punished with public execution. Instead, people have to make do with dolls that prove to be highly inadequate replacement for flesh &amp; blood children. Russ and Carol McNeil (Oliver Reed and Geraldine Chaplin) decide to defy the law and do their best to raise a child in secret. Of course, it&apos;s only a matter of time before they&apos;re found out. Their neighbours &amp; friends the Bordens (Don Gordon and Diane Cilento) learn their secret and their desire to be a part of this childs&apos; life only serves to permanently scar the friendship.\n\nWhile obviously done on a low budget, this is dealt with fairly successfully by having the outside world in this future be overcome by smog, forcing people to often wear masks. This gives this modest, reasonably entertaining production a certain degree of atmosphere. However, the film is never quite as involving as one would like. It&apos;s a little too slow and a little too static. It does succeed at being somewhat disturbing at times: first, whenever the authorities bring around their special killing domes, and second, when Russ goes to the library to learn what he can about premature birth, raising the suspicions of those in charge and leading to his being tortured.\n\nFilmed on location in Denmark, &quot;Z.P.G.&quot; gets by mostly on the performances of its four principal actors. Reed is commanding with his typical whispery delivery, and Chaplin is endearing as the young woman wanting a human child more than anything. The lovely Cilento and the under-rated Gordon are equally fine as the envious friends.\n\nThere is a sombre quality to the whole thing yet by the conclusion it does create a sense of hope and peace. With a bit more style and energy, this really could have been something special. As it is, it&apos;s good, if not great, and it does have a place among genre films of the time that dealt with the idea of dystopian futures.\n\nSix out of 10.",

I was 12, after all!!\n\nRecently watched the film again for the first time in at least 15 years. I was blown away by the final segment, it&apos;s truly a classic which really scared the stuffing outta me. That evil little girl who takes Polaroids of everything freaked me out to no end. For me, it&apos;s the only segment in which the quality of the writing matches the direction and visuals from beginning to end.\n\nI saw the original episode upon which Joe Dante&apos;s (3rd) segment is based when I was spending the night at my friend&apos;s house in 4th grade. It, too, really frightened me. I remember thinking to myself how hopeless the situation was-- if you even TRIED to not think bad thoughts about Anthony, you would end up thinking them, and he could still get you!! And didn&apos;t he &quot;wish someone away to the cornfield&quot;?? Man, that&apos;s some serious freakiness.\n\n I thought the design of that segment in the movie was incredible, I&apos;ll never forget the mom holding the fishbowl, or the ferocious rabbit creature, or what happens to Ethel (&quot;Run, Ethel....!&quot;) But the ending is truly atrocious and almost ruins what has come before.\n\nWhat can I say about the other two segments? Better scripts were needed in order to make them work. And in the case of &quot;Kick the Can&quot;, sticking more closely to the original episode would have given it more impact. (Not to mention firing Steven Spielberg.)And it&apos;s sad seeing Vic Morrow in his final role-- I&apos;ll always think of him as the sadistic coach in THE BAD NEWS BEARS, which is one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAll in all, a very uneven movie which improves steadily as it goes along. 6/10."

St. Dominic&apos;s Church is an oasis in the middle of the area that has seen better days. We realize how deeply in trouble the parish is from the start as Mr. Haines is trying to give Father Fitzgibbon an idea of how much he owes the bank and the fact the church will disappear soon.\n\nWhen Father Chuck O&apos;Malley arrives at St. Dominic to try to save it from its uncertain future, Father Fitzgibbon doesn&apos;t have a clue the younger man is going to be over him in all matters of importance. Yet, Father O&apos;Malley never steps over the older priest&apos;s shoes to make his rank felt.\n\nThis film was shot after the more successful, and better made &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&apos;s&quot;, but it was released earlier than the other film, probably to capitalize on Bing Crosby&apos;s popularity. The film, in fact, is a showcase for Mr. Crosby, who was a likable actor and singer. He has good opportunities in the movie.\n\nAs good as Mr. Crosby was in the film, Barry Fitzgerald steals the movie with his Father Fitzgibbon. Mr. Fitzgerald&apos;s crusty priest was one of the best creations of his long career. Frank McHugh, another excellent character actor of the era is seen as Father O&apos;Dowd. Gene Lockhart also has a small role as the money man, Mr. Haines. Rise Stevens, the soprano is seen and heard in the film singing in her inimitable style.\n\nThe film is a classic that should be seen during the holidays, as it brings cheer and hope to everyone lucky enough to catch a screening of it during Christmas.",

In Lake City, Violet Madison (Natascha Gregson Wagner), Austin Walker (Todd Field), Emma Scarlett (Dina Meyer) and Jared Roth (Mackenzie Astin) are good friends. After going together to a bar, Jared comes wounded to Austin&apos;s apartment in the late night and confesses that he is gay and has just killed a man in his apartment. He asks to his friends to help him to vanish with the body of the victim. The group agrees, and after many incidents, Violet stresses, jeopardizing the group. Many secrets are disclosed along this surprisingly good thriller, with lots of plot points and black humor. The story, including its presentation, is very original and enjoyable. In some moments, I recalled the magnificent &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; and &quot;Mystery Date&quot;. This unknown movie deserves to be discovered in the rentals or in the stores. When you think that there is no more surprises in the screenplay, the plot has another twist. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Calafrio!&quot; (&quot;Chill!&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This is the final film about the character, Antoine Doinel. He first appeared in The 400 Blows and you see him in 5 Truffaut films over the years. You see him grow from an emotionally neglected little punk in the first film and by the fifth, he is a Woody Allen-like little guy who has had a long series of troubled relationships that he ultimately sabotaged due to his discomfort with emotional commitment. He has a great time falling in love but soon strays or otherwise causes the relationships to sour.\n\nThe plot and emotional growth of the character is excellent. So why only a 7 for this film? Well, much of the film is simply cut and pasted from the previous Antoine Doinel films. This gave it a certain cheap look. Plus, what I really found inexplicable was that Truffaut used clips from Jean-Pierre Léaud films that were NOT about Doinel but pretended the clips were about him. In addition, clips from some Doinel films were shown but the entire scene is re-dubbed or explained in a way in which the scene did NOT appear in the original film. A good example is a clip from Stolen Kisses. The narrator says he (Doinel) was unlucky in love and followed attractive women because he&apos;d become infatuated with them. However, this scene was actually of Doinel following a lady because he was a private detective in this film--this was NOT someone he was infatuated with. Those who remember this movie well will be shocked at how easy it is to spot this obvious change. Finally, for some odd reason, one of the clips from Stolen Kisses is shown in black and white, while all the others from the movie are in color. It just didn&apos;t make sense why this occurred.\n\nThese inconsistencies are not great film-making. Decent film-making, maybe. For a better Truffaut film, try watching The Bride Wore Black (my personal favorite) or Wild Child or The Story of Adele H.",

      "reviewBody": "I was kind of inclined to headline this as being the movie guaranteed to make highbrow film fans froth with incredulity. That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don&apos;t feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.\n\nPlot? Well it&apos;s the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, the president&apos;s daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it&apos;s a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well &quot;Snake Plissken&quot; wasn&apos;t available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.\n\nOn the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it&apos;s a &quot;Snake Plissken&quot; movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of sci-fi design are well served here. Because even though there might be the worst CGI effects ever during a chase scene (that mercifully only runs for 50 seconds), the space ships, sets and Torsion System sequence, prove that you don&apos;t need Michael Bay type bucks to please the eyes. From the quite brilliant and hilarious opening interrogation beat down, to the big reveal and punch line, this Besson produced piece is serving popcorn with a smile to a certain segment in the film watching populace.\n\nWith bits of the &quot;Snake Plissken&quot; movies, &quot;Fortress&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot;, &quot;Last Boy Scout&quot; and any other quip laden dude/wronged man on a mission movie, Lockout clearly lacks originality. But seriously! Was anyone involved playing it as anything other than a sly homage movie? No, they wasn&apos;t. Pearce is great fun in the role, but he isn&apos;t trying to worry the highbrow crowd&apos;s votes for films of the year. Anyone viewing it expecting something cerebral should feel more guilty than those who stand up to say they had a great time watching it. Ingem Ferem. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "These three brothers contains some good elements, but runs out of steam in its last third. The best character sketched is Pascal Legitimus and his company with Bernard Farcy as Steven. Each of the three characters played by our Inconnus embodies in an exaggerated way key characters of their time, well sketched in the first half of the film.\n\nThe film starts well with the three brothers who meet each other, who have to cohabit even though they are socially and societally in different worlds. Some of the gags work, but the film runs out of steam over the course of the film and the three writers struggle to finish and close their story: the ending has no hysteria. The half of the film is severely lacking in pace. A third party&apos;s point of view is missing to complete the scenario and bring it out of its embryonic state.",

A good attempt by the director and he made most out of the script. It keeps you intriguing and wondering what happened between Maria and William plus a weird relationship between Kristen and Eddie keeps you stuck with the story. Though I have felt at times it gets little slow but then again it paces up. Kristen Stewart looks damn gorgeous and acted well. Eddie Redmayne as a psychotic weird teen did a good job, another Britain import to look out for. William Hurt and Maria Bello are seasoned actors so obviously they were great. Overall a good movie about redemption &amp; love.",

But this one is as different as it gets - true horror seeps from every possible plot hole, bland facial expression and camera movement. After two hours of watching I was absolutely terrified. Mostly of the fact that P. Ruminov might make another movie. Dead daughters come bundled with almost everything that was good in the last five years of horror films, but each and every brilliant idea, plot twist or piece of sfx only serves as a reminder of the original thing. The director claimed there are only two four-minute stills in the whole movie, which is innovative. And indeed it is - for the other 115 minutes the camera keeps wobbling, jumping and circling around every object in sight, bringing nausea and carrying away the viewer&apos;s ability to see the details. And then there&apos;s the desaturation, making everyone look like a malnourished vampire. The actors&apos; performance is surprisingly realistic - they have absolutely no idea of what&apos;s going on around them and they&apos;re not afraid to show it by staring blankly at the camera. Also there is an unhealthy amount of inside jokes, only funny to hardcore Russian anime fans. Of course, the creator could use - and used - free advertisement, but by now almost each one of those fans who cheered for the future masterpiece is trying to move as far away as possible.\n\nI can congratulate Russian moviegoers on having an aspiring Uwe Boll-wannabe in business, of course, but I personally think one is more than enough.\n\n*It gets a two instead of one because of a single good joke. Two with a minus, but slightly above the ground.",

Perry King plays the new music teacher, and he gives a decent performance. Roddy McDowell steals the show as the biology instructor. His best scene -- pointing a gun at his students and threatening to kill them if they get the wrong answer to a science question! This film is extremely well made, a classic b-movie that is first rate compared to junk like &quot;The Faculty&quot; or any of the other awful &quot;I Know What you Did Last Summer&quot; type of teen flicks out these days...",

      "reviewBody": "Move over Dr Strangelove; &quot;Monster from a Prehistoric Planet&quot; is the new satire in town. Okay, maybe my sarcasm is unjustified, Japanese satire is either too high brow for me or gets completely lost in translation. And its perfectly easy to loose anything in the atrocious dubbing kaiju films get plastered with.\n\nIf I&apos;m kind I have to call it a parody of King Kong; as the film deals with an expedition force, who are trying to find exotic animals for a new theme park, stumbling across a mysterious island where the indigenous tribe (who look strangely similar to Japanese with coal on their faces) worship a god called Gappa. The expedition take a baby Gappa back to Japan, with the parents in hot pursuit. Cue the miniatures.\n\nWith the hideously handled love side story and the hilariously sentimental finale, I can only assume that this film was intended as tongue in cheek fare, and the satire label certainly confirms this. This aside however, the film is terrific by the standards of the time, with incredible amounts of destruction and very little time to breathe in between. Whether I&apos;m missing the supposed hard-hitting social satire I don&apos;t really care; &quot;Monster from a Prehistoric Planet&quot; is a wonderfully extravagant example of monster films done properly, with a plot that doesn&apos;t dither amount and action that moves back to Japan pretty swiftly and doesn&apos;t let up from then on. The clichés are all over the place but this is hardly an issue, intentional or otherwise. Certainly, a kaiju film trying its hand at satire would be expected to be about as subtle as a ton of bricks, and with this in mind the film could have turned out a hell of a lot worse.\n\n(To the elite, &quot;Monster from a Prehistoric Planet&quot; has a special appeal. The Gappas are the very same monsters that menaced Kryten and Rimmer on wax world in series 4 of Red Dwarf; and as Kryten observed, you&apos;ve probably seen more convincing dinosaurs in a packet of &quot;wheatie flakes&quot;)",

      "name": "Charming fable that&apos;s still fresh",
      "reviewBody": "Cocoon is a charming science fiction fable by the underrated Ron Howard. Howard is an amiable, frequently baseball-capped figure who, in the 70&apos;s, became a familiar face through his 6 year stint as Richie in TV&apos;s Happy Days. Cocoon followed immediately after Splash! (1984), another successful fantasy. It exchanges the Tom Hanks figure featured in that film with a similar one played by Steve Guttenberg, another romantic innocent. But whereas in the earlier film Hanks had a central role, here Jack Bonner (Guttenberg) has far less prominence. This is perhaps because of Guttenberg&apos;s modest acting abilities, but principally so the narrative can focus more securely on the characters that matter  the community of senior citizens facing their twilight years at the Sunny Shores Retirement Center.\n\nCocoon&apos;s achievement as a film is all the more remarkable when one reflects upon the scarcity of active, old people in American cinema, let alone a group of them presented so positively in a state of sexual re awakening, then led to such an upbeat conclusion. Behind this apparent optimism, however, the thoughtful viewer can still reflect on some final doubts and uncertainties. \n\nThe central circle of old people, around whom events turn, together prove a fine acting ensemble. Arthur (a still svelte Don Ameche), Ben (Selwyn Wilford Brimley) Jo (Hume Cronyn), Bernie (Walter Gilford), Alma (Jessica Tandy), Bess (Gwen Verdon) and the others are a convincing unit, squabbling, relating and facing the end of their lives with cantankerous dignity which is entirely convincing. Tandy and Cronyn were married in real life. Many of film&apos;s most poignant moments of the film spring from the relationships between these people. The quiet passing of Rose for instance, and her husband&apos;s grief by her bedside. Notable too is the wooing by former song and dance man Ameche of his new lady love, a process during which he shows no lessening of time-honed screen courtesy and assurance. During the opening of the film, Arthur and Jo&apos;s witnessing of an unsuccessful resuscitation is a stark reminder of the mortality of the principals, sadly off and on screen. Cocoon was a last hurrah for many of the elderly cast (although one or two survived advancing years to appear in the terrible Cocoon 2(1988)).\n\nThe other major character group are the Antareans. Here too a refreshing leap out of the stereotypical is taken as the aliens prove reasonable, non aggressive and forgiving  perhaps characteristics inspired by Spielberg&apos;s influential and amenable ET (1982) or the religiosity of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Jack Bonner&apos;s near hysterical reaction to their initial unmasking (&apos;If you try and eat my face off you&apos;ll be very, very sorry&apos;), his following conversion then inevitable dalliance, are all handled with an effective lightness. Even Howard&apos;s depiction of an alien orgasm on screen as Jack romances Kitty (Tahnee Welch) without touching, in the life giving pool, is done sensitively. It is perhaps the most striking moment of its sort in Science Fiction cinema since Woody Allen&apos;s Sleeper (1973). Cocoon is a film in which sexual energy is equated closely to an amplified life force and is seen as both positive and welcome. Both young and old feel the replenishment of their passion, directly or indirectly, in connection with the cocoon tank. Here the items retrieved from the sea are settled at the bottom, somewhat ominous reminders of a life to come. The title itself is suggestive, not only of the typical dormacy of a chrysalis, but of impending rebirth such an object heralds. As the oldsters rejuvenate with the &apos;fountain of youth&apos;, they find new meaning and value in their lives, a belated development which even leads to the sad break up of families. The desire for life can be selfish, even when healthily expressed, and some prefer to &apos;stick with the hand nature has given&apos; them.\n\nThe Antarean&apos;s recovery of their &apos;ground crew&apos; is what brings them to earth. While their leader&apos;s account of them having originally lodged themselves in what was Atlantis is slightly hoary (their bases apparently having sunk during the &apos;first great upheaval&apos;) the film wisely seers away from too much alien hardware. Apart from the pretty device on the deck of Bonner&apos;s boat, and the splendours of the returning mother ship, very little technology is glimpsed. The Antareans are certainly strange, but lacking much hard evidence of their difference enables the audience to relate to them easily. Even their unskinning, as they emerge as their true, shining selves, is a wonderous event, a shining transfiguration with no implicit threat to humanity.\n\nThese are aliens associated with whiteness and with life, forgiving and considerate, exhibiting &apos;christian&apos; values. They radiate and float like angels when emerging from human covering, and their ship takes the departing OAPs up into the light. Hollywood readily associates such light with the rewards of heaven (for other examples of the brilliance bestowed upon the departing see The Frighteners (1996) or Jacob&apos;s Ladder (1990). Substitute the pool of life for baptism, the smiling Walter (Brian Dennehy) for a prophet, and Cocoon&apos;s alien spaceship might just as easily be the Gabriel leading the faithful to paradise. \n\nBut what of the end of the film? Is it really as happy and as affirmative as it first seems? Bonner has made great play with his responsibility as a skipper in an earlier scene with Kitty. At the conclusion he might, therefore, reasonably be held to account for his loss of a cargo of elderly transportees. At least one extended family is broken up by their leaving. And Walter has to return home, his mission a failure, together with a boatload of unexpected guests. At the least the final ascension is a complex event, leaving some tensions unresolved. That Cocoon manages to hold all these elements together in a satisfying whole is one reason to seek it out. To enjoy a warm hearted family film is another."

When he intercepts a call for Dr Baird to replace LA shrink Dr Maitlin in his practice and his radio show.  Baird had been selected because he was inept enough not to put Maitlin in the shade.  Burns escapes from the hospital, travels to LA and assumes Baird&apos;s identity to get the job.  Issues are complicated when drifter Becker recognises Burns as a conman and tries to get in on the act.\n\nThis is an earlier version of Dolly Parton&apos;s `Straight Talk&apos; - a straight talker gets mistaken for a radio host, gives mad advise but the public love it.  This is complicated by Matthau&apos;s conman getting involved and other little subplots.  The plot doesn&apos;t always convince or hold the interest but it is quite amusing at points.  The ending is pure laziness as it attempts to milk a happy ending out of unlikely circumstances.\n\nAykroyd is well suited to his character and provides all the jokes here. Grodin and Matthau are both good but Matthau is certainly greatly underused. Really it&apos;s Aykroyd&apos;s show and everything slows down when he&apos;s not onscreen or when he&apos;s having to move the story on.\n\nOverall this is a very standard film.  It&apos;s only amusing when Aykroyd is allowed free reign, for the rest of the film it&apos;s dull at times, aimless and meandering at others.  Of the famous cast, this is nobody&apos;s finest hour."

A movie about the interactions of regular people in a neighbourhood. No special plot, just a poetic observation of life in a limited space.\n\nUnfortunately the film was a total disappointment. It felt like a juxtaposition of stories which never allow the audience empathise with the characters.\n\nThe most engaging scene was the one in the park with an interesting alternation of the camera between different people. The viewer felt part of the scene as a common bystander sat on a bench, observing each different group, each different scene. The director should have developed this part as the film title lead to believe instead of letting the scene at the hardware store drag on.\n\nIn the end I wonder why so many great French actors agreed to collaborate on this film.",

It is similar in many ways to &quot;Air Bud&quot; or &quot;Monkey Trouble&quot; but a little bit more on the slapstick side. It has a fairly predictable plot line and some corny lightning shots, but nothing too scary for young kids (and the kangaroos are sort of cute).\n\nYoung Billy is a bit of an oddball locally because he is very fond of animals (even giant ants). When the obnoxious neighboring farm hires a city slicker to clear the &apos;roos off their property, one baby kangaroo (Joey) is left behind. Billy then strikes out for Sydney in an attempt to reunite Joey with his parents. Along the way he meets the American Ambassador&apos;s daughter and they team up to stop an illegal kangaroo fight. The cops are bumbling, the villains are melodramatic, and the kids are plucky. Just what you&apos;d expect, but a diverting watch nonetheless.",

      "reviewBody": "As I&apos;ve said, I&apos;ve only seen the last 10 minutes of this movie. I managed to record 5 of those minutes on video tape, after a frenzied dash to the vcr. This video tape is now one of my greatest treasures. I can&apos;t find this movie anywhere, no matter where or how hard I look - not online, not in video stores or specialist stores, not in libraries or anywhere else. Only in Knowhereland. Will I ever see this whole movie? Why am I so obsessed with 10 minutes of a movie I haven&apos;t seen? Funny and strange, I know. Those 10 minutes felt like a lifetime of off-the-scale filmmaking. The maddest 10 movie minutes without any need for gore or special effects. Total, unadulterated Art, capital A included because this truly was great Art. Those 10 little minutes alone felt like 3 or 4 full movies and 6 or 7 top Directors, all rolled into one crazy hyper-show. It was surreal, funny, heartbreaking, philosophical, happy, disturbing, spiritual, frightening, sad, scientific, insane, solemn and I&apos;m running out of words to describe all the things those 10 measly minutes were. Now it&apos;s only 5 minutes, on ancient video tape. Woe is me. I will tell you nothing about the plot. I do know what the movie is about and its style of presentation, but it&apos;s better to seek the movie, like me - I hope you&apos;ve better luck. I will tell you about the first 5 minutes I saw because I don&apos;t want to ruin the other 5 minutes - the ending, which is intense and overwhelming, in a freeing way. Oxymorons pepper this movie.  If I was reading this, I&apos;d leave at this point. Why ruin even just 5 minutes of a movie by knowing what happens in it?  Regardless, I&apos;ll carry on because this clip withstands knowing it - you have to see it. I hope I remember this correctly, long time ago. I came in on a black and white scene of a man with bright white hair and thick rimmed, square glasses. He was walking around a bright but dusty and dilapidated building. He wore a boring-looking suit - bureaucrosy personified. He appeared like an awkward type of person, uncomfortable with life. But, he was a funny-looking guy and strangely likeable.  As he walked on, a stage appeared out of the darkness. As he got closer to the stage, a guy dressed like a punk came from the shadows. He looked menacingly at the Bureaucrat and reached into his black leather jacket. Suddenly, he pulled out a microphone. He pointed the microphone at the Bureaucrat, in a threatening way, at first, then offered the Bureaucrat to take it, in a friendly way. The Bureaucrat declined. The punk looked angry, then sad, then defiant, then he started to sing. The song was a mad punky, riot-type song, a cry to the skies. The lyrics were rebellious, decrying the Soviet Union/Russia for had losing its old glories and becoming weak in the eyes of the world and to itself. It was a call to violent action.  The Bureaucrat moved away from the stage, awkwardly, as the song got more impassioned and violent. On his way, he came across a group of punks, lounging against a wall. They motioned him to sit with them and made room for him, in the middle. He sat there awkwardly, and pretendied to like the music, as he tapped along and nodded his head. One pretty punk girl glared at him, momentarily, and then started to smile, a real smile, and then nod her head a bit, in rhythm with the Bureaucrat&apos;s nodding. Suddenly, the other punks in the group started to nod their heads. The Bureaucrat was freaked out, but they were smiling, happy smiles, so he kept nodding, and they kept nodding.  Then, the punks raised their arms and wiggled their torsos. They seemed to be having fun, so the Bureaucrat joined in with them, with the wiggling. They all wiggled up onto their feet, laughing, standing in a circle, wiggling. Just as they started to break into a dance, it seemed like the walls behind them were pulsing. But, as the lights lowered, those pulses became disco lights, as the dance got crazier and crazier, and increasingly punky, with the Bureaucrat the maddest dancer of them all. The Bureaucrat flung his arms around, full of joy. Unfortunately, he noticed the time on his watch. Immediatey, his face was flooded with utter dread. His shoulders and arms and all of his full life and joy fell from him. Panic arose and a frenzy began. He pushed his way through the punks as they pleaded with him to stay. They started to grab him. He tried to pull away as it started to get a bit freaky. By the time he got to the door, the punks appeared like zombies or cannibals and it suddenly seemed like a horror movie. He tumbled out the door but came out of an underground rail station, walking up some steps.  He looked out onto the busy streets - back in reality. Phew! The Bureaucrat brushed the dust from his boring suit. He jumped to action when he saw a bus at a bustop. He started running and flailing after it - an adsurdly funny run. As the bus pushed on from the bustop, he went totally mental, screaming and shouting and whistling. Finally, he raised his arm, defiantly, violently, and willed the bus to stop. &apos;The movie froze here on a freeze frame of the Bureaucrat, with his arm raised aggressively and a frightening look on his face. This then had an image superimposed on it. The image faded in to reveal the punk singer, on the stage, with the raised arm and violent fist and face - it was a perfect fit, face on face. Then, it cut back to the Bureaucrat. The movie started again. The Bureaucrat lowered his arm, shocked by and ashamed of his own violence. He lowered his arm and watched the bus leave. dejected. Suddenly, the tone of the movie changed completely from black and white to the sepia tint you get from old photographs - a pale orange brown.  I can go no further - it&apos;ll give away the amazing ending. It truly is an ending of endings - the very best ending I&apos;ve ever seen. The very best movie I&apos;ve ever seen even though I&apos;ve only seen 10 minutes of it! I can give no higher recommendation than the one I give to this movie. This movie is totally insane but also completely logical and sensible.  If anyone knows where I can find this wondrous movie, please let me know.  Thank you.",

Looking at the other reviews I haven&apos;t seen any reference to the director&apos;s tip of the hat to Julie Andrews and The Sound of Music in the scene where Angelique dances down the shopping arcade with her samples suitcase.\n\nA little gem.

Groucho delivers some of his most scathing one-liners, Harpo provides a perfect blend of devilry and sympathy, and Chico struts like a peacock.  Even the fabulous Margaret Dumont gets in on the action, telling her warbling daughter to &quot;stop singing on the beach at all hours&quot; after one truly atrocious song. What brings this film down is bad editing and the godawful songs--Mary Eaton singing &quot;Do the Monkey Doodle Do&quot;--say WHAT!?!?  The dancing is,as Groucho states, &quot;A little entertainment--very little.&quot;  And Harpo&apos;s harp solo was really just pasted in there.  Stay away from the fast-forward button, though--the songs are just as laughable as the jokes(for all the wrong reasons, of course), as is Kay Francis&apos;s drag queen-esque performance. And don&apos;t miss the show-stopper &quot;I want my shirt!&quot; My sister and I were rolling on the ground laughing.  The love couple is truly nauseating, but a touching moment is provided when the childlike Harpo comforts a heartbroken Mary Eaton.  Full of vaudevillian jokes and biting one-liners, this is definitely a film no Marx Brothers fan should miss!"

      "reviewBody": "This movie is available in two versions. The English-language version is a badly-dubbed, waste-of-time sex comedy (not unlike a lot of the films co-lead Gloria Guida was starring in at the time). The Italian version is similarly light-hearted for much of its running time, but it does make some serious commentary on police corruption, the confused politics and ultimate hollowness of the 70&apos;s era counterculture, and the reactionary nature of male-dominated rural Italy. The ending is unforgettably brutal, inspired no doubt by films like &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; or &quot;Late Night Trains&quot;. Like those films it was quite controversial, and really for the same ironic reason--because you really come to like the two lead characters and care what happens to them. This is no mean feat as Gloria Guida had no real acting talent beyond looking (really) good naked and the other lead, porno-starlet-to-be Lili Carati, was, if anything, even less talented.\n\nThe plot of the movie is rather loose and picaresque. It follows these two &quot;beautiful and p***ed-off&quot; girls as they hitchhike, shoplift, crash at a commune, dabble in prostitution, sell encyclopedias to lecherous university professors, get rousted by the police, and finally meet a tragic end at a roadhouse. Along the way the way they more than fulfill the sexploitation skin quotient and frequently throw themselves at various men who hilariously rebuff them (although despite the famed sexual aggressiveness of Italian men, it is not impossible to believe that they might react this way if the tables were suddenly turned on them). It is this free-spirited sexual aggressiveness that proves to be downfall of the two girls, but this movie is ultimately more touching and tragic than cautionary and moralistic--traditional, male-dominated Italian society certainly doesn&apos;t come off to well here.\n\nThe two versions have different discoesque musical arrangements that the characters do sexy, impromptu dances to--the Italian one is kind of catchy but the English-language is about as enjoyable as a barium enema. I would&apos;t bother with the English-language version, but the Italian version is definitely a worthwhile little movie."

Nowadays, any film that enters into the psychoanalysis field and its world should be at least seen. \n\nIn this case, Faenza shot a  non Italian film, with a multi national coproduction about a sort of small biography of Carl Jung the famous psychologist who has funded a personal current beside the one developed by Siegmund Freud. The film has some very good moments, specially when Jung is at his very beginning of his career in a house hospital in Zurich and meet Caroline Ducey as his very first patient. The developing of her illness and Jung&apos;s very modern approach compared to the rest of his colleagues in the hospital is really the best part of the film, this together with the start of their love &quot;affair&quot; worth the whole film. Unfortunately the rest of the film is not well driven, a sort of general and confused flashback brings the old scenes to a &quot;today&quot; situation through a &quot;path&quot; that a relative of Caroline is following in Russia with the help of some old books. \n\nRating: 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "DVD PLAYER AT K-MART: $29.95. \n\nPUBLIC DOMAIN DVD RELEASE OF THIS MOVIE + 3 OTHERS JUST LIKE IT: $5.95. \n\nA CASE OF BEER &amp; TWO BAGS OF SNACK MIX: $20 \n\nBEING ABLE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE DRUNK WITH YOUR FRIENDS: Priceless.\n\nFor everything else, there&apos;s the crap at Blockbuster. Who knows what the real story behind this movie is. It&apos;s graced those cheapo bargain bin horror DVD releases now for about seven years and has yet to be improved upon, as far as low rent, low esteem, low taste entertainment goes. Matthew is a boy with mommy issues who runs over his dad with a tractor, manages to get his arm mangled underneath the runaway machine, and is promptly shipped off to a juvenile mental ward or hospital for the young &amp; psychotic for the bulk of his adolescence. Cue forward to about the age of 18 and Matthew -- who cannot even masturbate because he as been fitted with a razor sharp metal hook to replace his arm -- returns home to find his beloved, creepy mom about to marry one of the hayseed crackers who helped her run the farm after Matthew killed her husband. Imagine his disappointment. So Matthew promptly axe murders the pair of them and sets off on a killing spree across the byways of rural Kansas in search of someone else to be his mommy.\n\nInstead, he finds promiscuous young couples who want him to go skinny dipping with them, a hooker with a heart of gold who paints truly awful paintings, drunk belligerent sailors, various low-wage domestic workers who can&apos;t even make chicken right, and a dog that is so unfocused on it&apos;s role in life that it doesn&apos;t even bark as he hacks up it&apos;s 80 year old mistress with a meat cleaver. All he wanted was a nuclear mother figure to tell him what to do and maybe beat him off, but no. Just people &amp; things -- including the church -- which fail to live up to his need for protective authority figures with breasts. We all want things in life we can&apos;t have and all Matthew wants is the attention of women who have their own lives to live, don&apos;t have to measure up to his moral standards to get through the day, enjoy sex, and look good in the nude. It isn&apos;t easy being a psycho killer sometimes.\n\nI mean look, what can you really say about a movie called SCREAM BLOODY MURDER? And, what do you say to people who watch a movie called SCREAM BLOODY MURDER and end up not liking it? Since there are about 14 movies titled or re-titled SCREAM BLOODY MURDER I can see how one might end up with this by mistake, but if you are looking for a movie called SCREAM BLOODY MURDER in the first place, dude, like, what were you expecting? Camus??\n\nBut when all is said and done and if you can find it within yourself to get into the spirit of things, this is a fast-paced, luridly subtexturalized and genuinely amusing little pre-Freddy Kreuger hacker about a maniac who isn&apos;t bright enough to realize he doesn&apos;t need axes, knives, meat cleavers or other weapons when he has a razor sharp metal claw molded onto that dead arm of his. This is all American exploitation horror made at a time when movies like this were the staple of drive-in movie double bills, and half of the time you weren&apos;t even bothering with what was happening on screen. Watching it in your dingy little apartment by yourself cold sober isn&apos;t exactly going to help improve one&apos;s perception of it since you&apos;ll be focused on things like plot holes, inept performances, tacky locations &amp; fashions, laughable special effects, and a strange moralistic dichotomy that is at odds with the manner in which the film was meant to be seen: Drunk, in the company of friends. Or, half ignored while scoring with your date.\n\nWhen used to fill either of those roles this retains it&apos;s power as a superior little example of low budget regionally made exploitation horror that is probably a lot better than it had to be, and more satisfying than most similar examples. I like that garden room at the mansion especially, and the idea of an artist making their living as a prostitute is actually somewhat Kafkaesque. One word to the wise: I&apos;ve been trying to find an &quot;uncut&quot; home video version of this film for years &amp; none seem to exist. I&apos;ve sampled 2 different VHS and four DVD presentations, including the new one by Retromedia titled as CLAW OF TERROR -- which does look good compared to the others -- but they all show the same fullscreen 86 minute edit purporting to be the R Rated original version. Any one of them is as good as the other, or so it would seem, and it would be amusing to find out why SCREAM BLOODY MURDER was censored in the first place, and what became of the original elements. That&apos;s what makes me a FILM DORK, and this movie will always have a place close to my heart for setting it&apos;s sights low, aiming straight for the gutter, and scoring a bull&apos;s eye.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "One wonders how director Hans Steinhoff, dismissed by Billy Wilder as &apos;a talentless idiot&apos; could have turned out so many marvellous films! This is a stunning biopic of Rembrandt van Rijn whose uncompromising pursuit of his artistic vision makes him in the humble opinion of this reviewer, the greatest painter of them all. As one would expect from UFA studios the production values are exceptional courtesy of Richard Angst as cinematographer and Walter Roehrig as art director. There is a marvellous score by Alois Melichar which is used sparingly and to great effect. The performances are out of the top drawer. Hertha Feiler as Saskia, Gisela Uhlen as Hendrickje Stoffels and the fascinating Elisabeth Flickenschildt as Geertje Dierks. Rembrandt himself is portayed by the brilliant Ewald Balser who captures beautifully the artist&apos;s single-mindedness and humanity. The scene where he paints the seated Hendrickje(now in the National Gallery) whilst debtors strip his house bare, is unforgettable. The harsh realisation that Genius is seldom recognised in its own lifetime and that giants are very often dragged down by pygmies makes the final scene where he gazes upon his cruelly neglected masterpiece &apos;The Night Watch&apos; even more telling. I would strongly recommend watching Ewald Balser as Beethoven in &apos;Eroica&apos; of 1949. Another knockout performance.",

      "name": "Enjoyable gothic horror, if troubled by too restrained a tone",
      "reviewBody": "One can&apos;t help but immediately note the terrific filming locations, luscious sets, gorgeous costume design, fetching hair and makeup, a beautiful leading lady (with more in the supporting cast), the tall, dark, and handsome baron, and suggestions of budding amorous feelings. With all these aspects firmly in mind it would have taken very little for this picture to have been realized purely as a gothic romantic drama, like &apos;La belle et la bête&apos; except with more terse and complicated dynamics between all the characters involved. It nearly is, really, since the totality of the horror element doesn&apos;t fully come into play until late in the last act, and before that we get only passing scenes and imagery of more insidious goings-on. All the while &apos;Scream of the demon lover&apos; is splendidly well made, with all the aesthetics we&apos;d assume of contemporary period genre fare out of Italy, capable performances, and strong work from all those operating behind the scenes. And the story that this has to offer is earnestly engaging and compelling.\n\nIt&apos;s just that if one is looking for a robust thrill ride, or a horror flick that inspires visceral reactions, this isn&apos;t the title to provide it. When all is said and done this is enjoyable and satisfying - only, I think one can readily imagine other angles it might have adopted that would have been more wicked, more fun, and more satisfying in turn. For that matter, even if José Luis Merino had only realized the concept with more energy, and a greater sense of dynamics, the end result would have surely benefited. I&apos;m glad I took the time to watch, but I admit I&apos;m a little let down that the movie retains such a measured, restrained tone; it would have required little alteration to have shone more brightly. I think &apos;Scream of the demon lover&apos; is well worth checking out if one has the opportunity, and above all if one is a fan of contemporary horror generally, and specifically like features coming out of Italy. One should perhaps just be aware that despite even the names this was given in its various releases, ultimately the viewing experience is more slow, steady, and thematic for the vast majority of its length than it is vibrant, violent, and hearty, as it is at the very end.",

      "reviewBody": "This is Uwe Boll&apos;s best film to date. That being said, it&apos;s still crap. Abundant plot holes, crudely forced shock tactics, a shallow attempt at satire, and the worst director in the entire world are just the tip of the iceberg on why this movie blows. I hate Boll&apos;s work. I hate his belligerence. He should not be allowed near a camera.\n\nThe ultimate question, however, is did I laugh? Yes. In spite of everything , I laughed. This movie is Uwe Boll&apos;s &quot;F*^# you!&quot; statement to the world. He&apos;s going to continue making movies whether we like it or not, and he&apos;s actually a lot better at crude humor than any sort of horror, adaptation or whatever random dung heap genre he sticks his nose into. He even makes fun of himself in this movie during a cameo between him and the actual creator of the postal franchise. For some weird reason, I respect that.\n\nZack Ward was fantastic, and really should be getting better work. This may be a rare time when an actors participation in a Boll film didn&apos;t herald their imminent career death. He proved himself to be an adequate action actor, and I&apos;m hoping this gets him some publicity. The same cannot be said for Verne Troyer or Dave Foley, who are circling the drain. (I still laughed though.)\n\nIs it worth the price of admission? Nope, but it&apos;s so much closer than any of Boll&apos;s films have ever been. Boll may be a deluded, stubborn and angry man,(at the Q&amp;A he explained to us in a very serious tone, how postal was a gutsy, intelligent satire) and his work may be awful, but Boll genuinely loves films and wants to make them. He wants to get better and who knows? Maybe one day Boll will produce something worthwhile. Tasteless director John Waters invented Hairspray, which was thought to be impossible. Maybe Boll will one day harness his ambition towards film-making in a productive way. Or not. Who cares?\n\nYou shouldn&apos;t see postal if you have an option, but if you don&apos;t, you might giggle a few times, in spite of yourself. However, if you&apos;re a moron, you&apos;ll love it!\n\n-Max\n\nP.S: Boll has always clashed with wheelchair-bound &quot;AintItCool&quot; news leader, Harry Knowles. They don&apos;t get along at all. Why do I reference this? There is a mentally challenged character in the movie who begs for money from the seat of a motorized wheelchair. Can you guess his first name?",

      "reviewBody": "Firstly the good news. Ken Foree is an absolute legend and it&apos;s great to see him returning to the zombie horror genre.\n\nAnd now for the bad news, which is absolutely everything else. Having read some good reviews on this film, I decided to give it a go as I&apos;m a big fan of zombie flicks even bad ones. It isn&apos;t often that I can&apos;t watch a film to the end (The Country Bears being the last one - I even made it through the Squeakquel) but at the half way mark I felt like eating my own head. Around two thirds of the way through I couldn&apos;t take any more and fast forwarded through the rest, stopping every so often to see if it improved. It didn&apos;t.\n\nAllow me to list off some of the things that made this the worst movie I have ever seen.\n\n1. The dubbing. At least I hope it was all dubbed. If these idiots really speak like this, they should all be shot.\n\n2. The acting. OMG! Where did they get these muppets from? Everything was wrong and I do realise that zombie movies rarely get Oscar nominations. The body language was completely wooden - not one person (including Ken) managed to look like they really were in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. They looked like they were taking part in a primary school play and a bad one at that.\n\n3. The plot. Seems like the same terrible primary school did the screen writing as well. If you were responsible for the script then you should be ashamed. Never, ever write anything again. I mean it. Put the pen down. Bite your fingers off. You&apos;ll be doing us all a favour.\n\nIf I can prevent one person from ever having to go through watching this drivel, then I can rest easy knowing my sacrifice wasn&apos;t in vain.\n\nYou&apos;ve been warned...",

The great Frederic Forest (Blue Duck in Lonesome Dove and Cook in Apocalypse Now) plays a USN Admiral. However, the lack of competent technical advice made the military side of this submarine action thriller hard to take. On the SSN sub Ulysses, the new XO, we are told, is the youngest in USN history, yet he has --shall we say-- limited social skills. And his immediate subordinate ( a Lt. Commander) derisively refers to him as a &quot;college boy&quot;. Problem is ALL USN commissioned officers are college graduates. Hatches are called &quot;doors&quot;, lieutenant commanders are called &quot;Lieutenant &quot;, and an ex Navy SEAL also moonlighted as a submarine designer. Prior service guys will find these mistakes--and others like them--a hoot. But if you can say &quot;whatever&quot; and let it ride, it will provide a decent final act for your patience.",

Its message is for workers of the world to choose between fun holidays on the Black Sea or strikes and lockouts in the UK or France. Between brotherly inter-racial support or the Klu Klux Klan. Between peace or war.\n\nIn cinema terms an interesting reminder of the cold war and of how the world worked, at least according to the Soviets, a couple of generations back. Musically though the film is of great interest boasting an original score of considerable invention by Dmitri Shostakovich and with the title song, with words of Bertolt Brecht (in translation by S. Kirsanov), sung by Paul Robeson episodically through the film. Although a certain amount of music will be familiar to Shostakovich enthusiasts, with quotations from Song of the Forests and Symphony No. 8 among other works, much is as yet unrecorded.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film with one of those great exploitation titles that promises so much more than it eventually delivers. At first glance I was expecting to see some extreme kung-fu horror flick with a mad sorcerer reviving Bruce Lee from his death and turning him into an unstoppable zombie killer, with only a young novice martial artist to stop him. Sadly this was not to be. Aside from the cheesy opening shot, in which a guy pretending to be Bruce Lee jumps straight out of a grave and a drawing of such a scene follows on quickly, we&apos;re in the middle of a run-of-the-mill fight flick that has nothing to do with Bruce Lee at all. In fact, he&apos;s not even mentioned!\n\nThe film instead concerns a young Bruce Lee lookalike named Bruce Lea (see where the confusion can arise?). It turns out that an old buddy of Lea&apos;s has died, so he goes to investigate and find the killers responsible. It turns out to be, apparently, the Village People! Yep, a Japanese man, a black man, a cowboy and a white man were last seen with the deceased and soon Lea finds himself battling the criminal gang in a succession of largely unimpressive fights. Things are tied up with a very unsurprising twist ending, a touch of tragedy and lots of very bad dubbing and worse acting. Lots of running time is taken up with scenes of human bonding which occur between Lea and would-be girlfriend Deborah Chaplin and the will-they-or-won&apos;t-they relationship which develops between them.\n\nInterspersed with the light plot are some fairly average scenes of kung fu which are nothing to get excited about. They are okay, but Lea is no Bruce Lee or even Bruce Li. In fact, Bruce Lea is a better actor than he is a fighter, which is unusual considering the proliferation of good fighters/poor actors that fill our screens year after year! Chaplin is also not bad in a developed part, although the bad guys are little more than clichés waiting to be cut down by our hero.\n\nThe film is quite slow and uninteresting, let down by poor production values and a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. The photography is always dark and the editing looks like child&apos;s work, with silly slow-motion inserts for no reason (the moves aren&apos;t even that impressive to begin with). For some reason, some prints of the film claim that Umberto Lenzi is the director, but I believe this to be a simple case of mistaken identity; also, why on earth would Lenzi leave his beloved cop films in Italy to go globetrotting for a low budget kung fu trash oddity? A guy named Doo-Yong Lee appears to be the real culprit.",

      "reviewBody": "It is a very difficult job for me to pick between this and Suspiria as Argento&apos;s best work.  Both are masterpieces in their own right.  Deep Red is about a man that sees a murder committed and then tries to unravel the mystery of finding the killer.  David Hemmings does a fine job in the lead as he walks the streets of an Italian city in search of this homicidal killer.  As with most of Argento&apos;s work, the viewer should not try to make too much sense out of the plot, but rather enjoy the rich subtext and visual tapestry with which Argento paints the screen.  The killings, most notably done with a hatchet, are inventive and decidedly gruesome.  More than one time I found myself jump and wince(I suppose those are good things!)  The acting, even though most dubbed, is very good.  The set locations are very atmospheric as well.  Argento&apos;s camera, however, is the principal character as it shows us all kinds of images related to plot and otherwise and reached into our subconscience for real meaning.  This is first and foremost a visual film, and it certainly shows Argento&apos;s homage to his mentor&apos;s work, the films of Mario Bava."

It was painful to read all the garbage written by some reviewers before me, and it appears very clearly that they understand very little the spirit of the 1950s as it was superbly encapsulated by this film. A lesson of history and less brainwash by contemporary politically correctness will certainly help understand this movie properly. It is not about a wedding, it is not about a village wiped out, or about communists, it is about historical destiny and humanity. Those who have seen beyond the comedy understand what I mean by that. The rest of you should really stick to shallow movies, because anything beyond that will confuse you unnecessarily.",

The horror of rodents swarming all over a health spa and the cereal aisle of a supermarket(an early example of product placement for Kelloggs?) is eclipsed by the, ah, poignant story of a boy and his rat. No really. The real story is the friendship between the homicidal Ben and this boy, prohibited from the normal activities of boys his age by a weak heart. Also on hand are Meredith Baxter as the older sister and a subplot concerning two detectives. Shesh, why reduce the movie to an extended episode of POLICE STORY? And of course, that theme song . . . who better than Michael Jackson to sing about that special love between a boy and his rat? And, as one reviewer pointed out, the film is a cornucopia of 70s kitsch, certainly a pleasant secondary benefit of viewing this film."

      "reviewBody": "This review is biased, cause I love the show, it&apos;s my favorite italian series. It&apos;s timeless and hilarious and tragic, and its success can be attributed both to witty and comically sharp writing and to how much the bleak absurdity resonates with people that watch it. Now the movie is basically an entire season compressed in 100 minutes, and the theme is movies instead of tv, so the meta narrative keeps going. Italian cinema suffers just as much as tv for its dry and unappealing offerings. It&apos;s not a movie that can be watch separately from the show, which is maybe a waste of opportunity. The story is basically the continuation of the series, and it doesn&apos;t waste any time putting you up to speed. The pacing of the story is a little strange, might have been better structured. The plot itself is very much a repetition of the plot of the last season, but with enough different ideas to justify its existence. Not much to say, really: it&apos;s very much part of the Boris canon, and if you liked the show you&apos;d like this movie, if you hated the show stay away from this movie at all costs. The cinematography is more sophisticated than the show, the actors are still on their A game, there are a lot of jokes and memes and creativity. All in all a very good movie, and the best conclusion of the show. No, season 4 doesn&apos;t exist, I reject it, sorry.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Human Centipede&quot; will definitely repulse most of its viewers. It&apos;s not so much as gore-filled as say, &quot;Hostel&quot; or &quot;Zombie&quot;, but it&apos;s the idea behind the movie that will leave a lingering, nauseating feeling days after you&apos;ve seen it. \n\nThe story is simple: 2 American girls on vacation in Germany are invited to a party. They rent a car and on their way they get a flat tire. Unable to fix the problem by themselves they walk in the middle of the rainy night and arrive at what looks like a decent, upper class residence. A creepy old man let&apos;s them in so the girls can use his phone. Right from the start we know this guy is evil through and through. It seems the German guy is a respected surgeon, known for his &quot;siamese twins&quot; separation procedures. But the guy (who is ironically called &quot;Josef&quot;, a nod to the angel of death himself: Josef Mengele)wants to try a new surgical procedure on the girls and with the help of another victim (a Japanese guys), he will create what he dubs, &quot;The Human Centipede&quot;. \n\nNo explanation is given as to why this Josef guy wants to do a procedure that serves no purpose at all (unless he wants to sell freaks to traveling circuses), nor any background is ever mentioned or hinted at (it seems the director wanted to avoid any audience sympathy for this deranged doctor). Still, &quot;The Human Centipede&quot; remains a harrowing experience to watch.\n\nWhen the movie was over, all I could think of was that the girls would&apos;ve save themselves from A LOT of trouble had they known how to change a flat tire. Sure, they were going to a fancy party, were all dressed up and stuff but they never ever checked for a tire replacement in the trunk. They thought it would be &quot;much easier&quot; to walk in the middle of the night with the pouring rain on them in a country where they barely knew anyone or the language. \n\nIf it was me directing, I&apos;d call this flick, &quot;The Flat Tire&quot;!",

She&apos;s a big time soap star, so I was quite surprised at her appearance in this. Her accent is quite apparent. Oh, and I also liked that the heroine drove a Nissan 240 in the film. Lol. I&apos;m trying to stretch out this comment because IMDb will not let me post this unless it&apos;s at least ten lines long. I don&apos;t get it. So I will just write, write and write until it allows me to post this ridiculousness. OK, also, this is the only film where the girl looks cuter in a goofy dress than in her &quot;sexy&quot; garb.",

      "reviewBody": "When I saw the trailer for Space Chimps, I honestly thought it looked cute and fun, also they mentioned that it was made by the same folks who did Shrek, so I figured that it was going to be gold. I was first off a little surprised that it didn&apos;t do so hot at the box office, not only that, but it has a pretty low rating here on IMDb. I was thinking how this movie was probably awful, but how could it be? It&apos;s an animation film, so I still wanted to see it, I checked it out today and honestly, it&apos;s not a 4.4 rating movie, I think people are being a little too harsh on it. I agree that it&apos;s nothing special, but it&apos;s a cute movie that had it&apos;s moments. Opening the same weekend as The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia, we needed a good hearted film for the family as well, and Space Chimps does deliver on that.\n\nHam is a chimp who is the grandson of a famous chimp astronaut who was the first chimp in space. When there is possible life found on another planet, three scientists decide to experiment and instead of risking human life, the send out the chimps including Ham to space to find the alien life form. Ham, Luna, and Titon are sent out into space, but Ham isn&apos;t taking it seriously, constantly joking around, hitting on Luna, Titon constantly taking credit for everything. When they do land on the planet, they meet some interesting creatures and have to save the planet since one alien, Zartog, wants to take over.\n\nSpace Chimps isn&apos;t a bad movie, it&apos;s just nothing special, I&apos;d recommend waiting for the rental. It&apos;s a cute movie thought for the little ones. But I did enjoy a few scenes, I loved the line Titon says to Ham &quot;Are you David Bowie?&quot;... you&apos;ll have to see what I mean, but there are some cute and fun moments. The animation is so-so, the voices are decent, except some moments seemed a little stereotypical and cliché. But as a family kid movie, I would say that this is a go, just don&apos;t expect anything like Shrek.\n\n6/10",

Back when I was younger, I hadn&apos;t a clue who Rolf Harris was or what he was about really, but yes I recognised him. The stunning style of animation, the deep detailed characters (by detailed I mean well developed) really hit home, and when something personal happens you really feel for that character. Definitely worth a watch. Brilliant film and why I&apos;m awarding it a 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "* Spoiler alert * I will describe the opening events of the film\n\nEscape From Paradise is yet another film that takes place sometime in the future after an ecological disaster has occurred.\n\nAt the beginning a child finds a medallion at the beach and then stumbles across an old man who claims the medallion is his, subsequently the old man goes on to tell the story behind it, so that is the setup for the movie. \n\nThe tale concerns two young people, Teo and Beatrice, whom live apart in an underground vault. Their separation is not by choice however, since this vault is governed by a computer named Harry - it decides which males and females are compatible to be paired together. Of course, Teo &amp; Beatrice are very much in love and wish to be together, but doubt whether Harry will give them its blessing. The two can see each other on view screens, and neither having seen the outside world, only experience a limited controlled version of it through holographic simulations, in one scene it appears Teo is running on a tread-mill while Beatrice is running along a field on-screen - the low budget is clearly in evidence, but the idea of them being alone together is nonetheless adequately conveyed. \n\nOne night Teo decides to borrow his father&apos;s cherished Medallion to find out what all the fuss is about while his parents are out for the evening to take in some cultural entertainment, featuring (gulp) semi-nude Gladiatorial combat on harnesses - this really has to be seen to be believed, quite hilarious. When Teo &amp; Beatrice discover the medallion contains a video-disc showing images of the outside world, both beauty and disaster, they decide it must be investigated. Together with the help of a robot (think Buck Rogers &apos;81 season two) Teo and Beatrice find a way out of their designated sectors to the ruined world above. Of course, the parents are worried sick their children are missing, so a military-like group are sent out to retrieve them headed by the menacing commander Thor, played convincingly by the late Buchholz.\n\nI suppose at its core the scenario is akin to one found in an episode of the original Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, brought up to date with more cruelty and violence. There are definite shades of Bronx Warriors with the obligatory flame-throwers featured prominently, but given the innocence of the central characters&apos; there is moments of sensitivity and warmth that characterizes this piece and moreover puts some distinction between it and the glut of Post-Apocalyptic outings of the 80&apos;s &amp; 90&apos;s."

      "reviewBody": "Michael Hui is one of Hong Kong&apos;s most talented scriptwriters and given the overall quality of his films, he&apos;s allowed one duffer from time to time.\n\nThe Contract isn&apos;t exactly poor and it only fails comparison when one compares it to other Hui efforts, such as the brilliant Security Unlimited (1981). The lead cast is the same: Michael Hui and his two brothers, Sam and Ricky, all playing friends who get caught in circumstances a little outside their control. Sam provides the theme tune, again, and while the melody is memorable, the song didn&apos;t hit the charts with as much vigour as some of this other offerings.\n\nThis time, the plot revolves around a contract signed with a TV studio whose CEOs are expected to commit suicide when ratings plummet. This more or less describes the silliness of the film and unlike other Hui-penned comedies, The Contract relies too much on slapstick and not enough on clever lines. Hui also relies on gadgetry - while this plays tiny parts in other films, it&apos;s written in here more.\n\nFor once, Ricky Hui doesn&apos;t play the sympathetic loser, but a technical inventor and genius with aspirations to become the next Thomas Edison; Sam is the usual mid-1970s stud who&apos;s also an aspiring magician; Michael begins the film as an unbelievably poor dancer and extra at a television studio.\n\nThere are some high points (Michael and Ricky attempt to get the contract back from the studio&apos;s safe) but in all, many scenes are milked way beyond what the script allowed through Hui&apos;s own direction. Good for those who appreciate Hui&apos;s humour and style; while served with less quantity, it should have enough pace for those who enjoy a 1970s Hong Kong comedy.",

The gore parts are rather weird as well and have no purpose, to me killing people and worshiping a harvest or corn is rather spooky. But since I&apos;ve seen scary movies this one came out to be rather weird and not so much disturbing just really. I know I say weird a lot in this review, but some of the graphics were weird too. I&apos;m surprised they made a whole bunch of sequels to Children Of The Corn based upon the Stephen King novel &quot;Children Of The Corn&quot;."

It seems that this is supposed to be closer to the original story but those seem to be a few things and the biggest differences are completely new ideas written for this movie. The film is so, so great with Burton&apos;s storytelling finesse up until they enter the Chocolate Factory. The grandpa&apos;s connection to the factory was great. Depp&apos;s Wonka is a whole different character than Wilder&apos;s but just the change wasn&apos;t the problem. Wilder made that whole movie great while Depp just like his character made the movie awkward. It was just awkward and not funny to see him trying to be too weird and awkward all the time. Willy Wonka is not particularly likeable with most of his actions, so Wilder&apos;s version was a charming guy who ultimately does the right thing, so it worked. Here, not only he&apos;s weird and unlikeable throughout the movie, but even at the point where the previous movie ended, he doesn&apos;t do the right thing. Now, the backstory given to him just didn&apos;t feel right until the end when it is used for further change in character. Even though that part was nice, it didn&apos;t feel rightly placed. Burton doubling down on the problematic aspects doesn&apos;t help too much either. The Oompa Loompas were a bit too much and all those songs were annoying as hell. However, it also had incredible visuals throughout the movie using both practical effects and CGI, the film looks beautiful in a unique way only Burton can do.",

It is a story of passion of sport, passion for life, passion for friendship, the magic of giving and sharing and the Christmas spirit.\n\nEnjoy the film! A delightful cast, wonderfully filmed, with a great script.

The special effects (by Ray Harryhausen) must have looked spectacular back then but come off as pretty shaky nowadays; still, this takes nothing away from his achievement and doesn&apos;t affect one&apos;s enjoyment  or involvement  in the film in any way (the design of the aliens&apos; metallic suits and the briefly glimpsed creatures themselves is also quite impressive).\n\nThis is actually the first black-and-white Harryhausen film I&apos;ve watched, and also the only one which doesn&apos;t have to do with prehistoric or mythological monsters of some kind; as such, it&apos;s not as juvenile as his other work and makes me look forward to the effects wizard&apos;s other sci-fi outings  IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA (1955), TWENTY MILLION MILES TO EARTH (1957) and FIRST MEN IN THE MOON (1964). The Columbia DVD includes, among other things, an engaging 9-minute featurette on the making of EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS where Harryhausen is interviewed by genre enthusiast Joe Dante (who recalls first watching the film on a double-bill with the obscure THE 27TH DAY [1956]).",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is a fusion of several genres (drama, adventure, sci-fi, comedy, romantic tragedy) as well as an attempt for an art-house cerebral movie to attain commercial blockbuster status. In my opinion it mostly succeeds, but finding a large mainstream audience is its biggest challenge to be met (at this point, before wide release).\n\nImagine taking six short (but big-budget) films with different stories and directors and combining them into an anthology feature, united by a common theme and cast of actors in different roles, and then editing the entire thing out of sequence. The &quot;nested&quot; narrative of the book has been re-arranged for the sake of the visual medium of film, and after first being introduced to the 6 worlds, it&apos;s not that hard to keep track of who&apos;s who, what&apos;s what and where &amp; when. Frankly, it&apos;s a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for Best Editing - it works very well considering the challenge of making it flow coherently. \n\nThe cinematography, set &amp; art design, music score and performances range from good to great. The make-up in some cases created a distraction (a Korean woman transformed into a red-haired Caucasian; Hugo Weaving as a buxom female nurse) but it adds a bit of fun to the experience. There&apos;s a smörgåsbord of material here for most people: human drama, mystery, violence, sex, adventure, farcical comedy, gloomy sci-fi and occasional romance (both gay and straight). It&apos;s 6 movies for the price of one! Just be ready to spend almost 3 hours in your seat and suffer a bit of whiplash as the transitions can get frenetic at times, with multiple cliff-hangers happening simultaneously. Like a good roller-coaster, it has its lulls and rushes. Some might find the finale a bit conventional, sappy or anti-climactic. But there&apos;s no denying this is a big, expensive gamble on the part of the Wachowskis and their producers. Hopefully it&apos;ll achieve the kind of success they got with the first &quot;Matrix&quot; and not the fate of the abysmal &quot;Speed Racer.&quot; (PS I saw the film at its world premiere at TIFF.)",

Three brothers in Rangoon attempt to return home to their family in Southern India, who have fallen upon hard times. The main message of the movie is to try and treat other human beings as if they were your brothers and sisters.\n\nAt the time the movie was incredibly controversial, particularly for its attack on religious institutions. Nowadays it comes across as exceptionally kind-hearted. It&apos;s definitely a wild ride though, there&apos;s some pretty graphic actual war footage (the movie occurs during World War II), brutal narrative elements, and some extreme turns and swerves in the story - all mixed in with some really very picturesque matte work in beautiful studio settings, comedy, and romance. It&apos;s a long uneven movie, and often I was confused about where it was going, but the payoff is pretty great and intense.",

With no new frontiers to explore they choose to expand their minds to the extent that one of the most important luxuries to be acquired is a pleasure microchip. &quot;Lori&quot; (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson) is a bodyguard living under Los Angeles who has been pressed into service to protect a smuggler by the name of &quot;Juice&quot; (Lu Leonard). As it so happens, Juice has a briefcase full of microchips she wants to exchange for money to a criminal by the name of &quot;Plughead&quot; (Vernon Wells). Things go wrong during the exchange and Lori winds up with the briefcase and attempts to flee to the underground city of New York with Plughead in hot pursuit. Accompanying her is a pleasure android by the name of &quot;Danner&quot; (Jim Metzler) who agrees to help get her to her destination. The rest of the film involves the chase and the troubles Danner and Lori encounter along the way. Now, although this wasn&apos;t necessarily a bad move, I found the wardrobes and some of the characters a bit too far-fetched for my taste and the acting was second-rate as well. That said, in my opinion the only two people I thought contributed anything of interest to this film was Dana Wheeler-Nicholson (who was attractive) and the character of Plughead. Other than that everything seemed to have a hollow feel to it. Others may disagree but overall I found the film slightly below average.",

However we lose them a few reels in, to settle down to the romance of Bálint and Béres. Best scenes are the trip to the movies where her comments over the historical compilation, in which we glimpse her as a child working on the Pioneer Railroad, become voice over and they repeat this with the montage of Béres&apos; social work clients who her advise will not help.\n\nThe bleak living conditions - lack of accommodation, slow advancement, unappealing Communist and Catholic values, don&apos;t get any more cheerful as Szabó tries to inject hectic, free wheeling camera gymnastics and citations of Truffaut. The intended echoes of the Nouvelle Vague come over as derivative.\n\nBy the time he got to &quot;Mephisto&quot;, the director had acquired more gravitas. The sensitivity and seriousness of purpose that come without surprises is evident in both."

The authenticity with which this story is told is astounding, showing a deep respect for those who in search of a way to make an honest living, subject themselves to countless humiliations and are relegated to live outside the margins of mainstream America.\n\nKudos to the writers!! This is the first time I have ever seen an American film in which the dialogue in Spanish was written by someone who actually speaks the language and can grasp the nuances and feeling of the language so perfectly.  Richard Hicks is to be commended for casting both Elpidia Carrillo and Pilar Padilla in the roles of Rosa and Maya, respectively. They deliver their dialogue, especially in Spanish, with an emotion and passion that is rarely seen on the Hollywood silver screen.  Needless to say, Bread and Roses is now on my list of must-have-films to add to my DVD library.",

      "reviewBody": "Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker&apos;s life. He&apos;s had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can&apos;t hold a job because he&apos;s always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.\n\nSam Raimi&apos;s direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There&apos;s still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie&apos;s highlight. Danny Elfman&apos;s music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work.\n\nThe cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what&apos;s right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she&apos;s saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane (&quot;Go get &apos;em, Tiger.&quot;). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she&apos;s amazing. She steals every scene she&apos;s in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe&apos;s Green Goblin in the first film.\n\nWhen this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman &apos;78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It&apos;s followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.",

Peter O&apos;Toole gives perhaps his best performance ever as the egomaniacal filmmaker who will do anything, perhaps even murder someone, in order to protect his artistic vision.  The underrated Steve Railsback is good also as the paranoid Vietnam vet turned fugitive from the law.  The action scenes are very funny and well-done, especially the rooftop chase. The music score is appropriately clever and matches what&apos;s happening on screen.  Real-life stunt man Chuck Bail has a good part as a stunt coordinator who shows Railsback the ropes.  The editing techniques help blur the line between reality and make-believe.  The film is a bit too long, though, and some key scenes go on longer than necessary.  These are minor complaints, however, because a film like this doesn&apos;t get made very often anymore.",

      "reviewBody": "What can I say, DEAD MEAT is excellent. The first true Irish Horror film sets a high standard for all future Irish features to live up to.\n\nA wonderful blend of genuine thrills and over the top humour, DEAD MEAT manages excellently to satisfy all the viewers needs. First and foremost, DEAD MEAT is a film made by horror fans for horror fans. This is what makes this film such a genuine treat. \n\nThe basic plot revolves around a cow suffering from mad cow disease breaking out and attacking a farmer. This leads to a new strain of the disease that once infected turns everyone into flesh eating Zombies. The film follows a group of stranded folk and there efforts to make it through the horde of Zombies and make it to safety.\n\nPlot aside, this film succeeds where many other imitators failed due to the fact that it doesn&apos;t take itself overly serious, but at the same time refrains from falling into the trap of lame slapstick. This is the directorial debut of Conor McMahon and his work along with the Irish Horrorthon founders, Ed King and Michael Griffin shows a genuine eye for what made all the classic horror films so good. \n\nA mixture of modern humour with the style and atmosphere of classics such as Night of the Living Dead and the many 70&apos;s Italian Zombie films this film is guaranteed to delight any fan of the genre (or just enjoyable films in general). Another worthy note is the music which shifts from an eerie score to at times a John Carpenter-esque style. Over analysing the film would only take away from the pure fun and entertainment that this film embodies,\n\nDestined to be a cult classic, Get it, watch it and ENJOY IT!!!",

The rest of the actors were Canadian and not known to me - therefore, for a while, it was difficult to tell the blondes apart and the young leading men apart from one another. I didn&apos;t recognize Kinski at first (I forgot she was in it).\n\nAnyway, the story is Sybil-esquire. A girl is abducted as a child, comes home two years later - flash forward to adulthood. She&apos;s a college student, and one of her professors is murdered. She is accused, and her sister, who works for the D.A.&apos;s office, goes on leave to defend her.\n\nThis is a typical Sonny Grosso production - that godawful music and a draggy pace. The story held my interest, and the acting ranged from good to adequate. The lead woman was quite good, except when she cried, she wasn&apos;t crying and needed the glycerin they use to fake tears. Not in the budget I guess. Not sure what&apos;s up with Kinski - she is still beautiful certainly and she was always a good actress. At the time of this TV-movie, she was about 42 years old - I suppose with her ingenue days over, the going got tougher.\n\nEntertaining if you can tell everyone apart. To me a lot of them looked alike.",

But there&apos;s a quality about it that is wonderful.  The simplistic scenery is attractive in its own way.  The acting was not amazing but let&apos;s remember a few things - it was a made for TV movie in the 80&apos;s, and honestly there were very few decent films that came out of the 80&apos;s anway.  For those who wish to over-analyse this film, I suggest you remember one thing - it&apos;s a children&apos;s movie, it was not meant to be broken down and analysed, it was meant to be simply enjoyed. I would highly recommend this movie for the enjoyment of viewers with young families.  After all, Christmas is the time to enjoy sugary sweetness.",

      "reviewBody": "Plot-- Two money-hungry Englishmen organize a safari to Africa to bring back prizes of elephant ivory and a reluctant Jane Parker. Trouble is she seems to prefer an apeman, a loincloth, and a cave to city sophisticates, evening gowns and country mansions. In the safari process, however, they overlook that even the jungle has its laws.\n\nThanks TCM for showing the movie&apos;s uncensored version. I expect the morality watchdogs must have overdosed on 1934 viewing. But there&apos;s a heckuva lot more to the movie than bared female skin and two unmarried people living together. O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s absolutely enchanting as Jane. Her charm even outshines herds of stampeding elephants and bands of chattering chimps. More importantly, I think I&apos;ve got her bare hips memorized. Then too, add a man of few words, the lean and lithe Weismuller, to the movie mix. He&apos;s perfect as lord of the jungle, more at home in the wilds than in the city, traveling by swinging vine instead of clogged freeway. \n\nThen too, I detect a topical allegory lurking in the subtext. Something about living in harmony with nature rather than trying to plunder it. Sure, nature here is a creation of studio wizards at MGM, and not the real Africa. Still, the results are impressive as heck, even with backscreen projection and liberal use of matte. But since when did I go to adventure movies expecting documentary realism. That I&apos;ll leave to the textbooks and PBS. Actually, my favorite movie moment is when thoughtless chimp Cheetah decides to tease three baby lions, only to find that a muscular mother doesn&apos;t quite understand. It&apos;s an amusing little touch. Anyhow, if there&apos;s a better Tarzan movie, I haven&apos;t seen it, even if this one is an antique. Meanwhile, I&apos;m off to the jungle with visions of loincloth Jane dancing in my head. Okay, maybe not, but it&apos;s still a big thanks to this great movie."

      "reviewBody": "The X-Files movie really is as good a big screen adaptation as you could possibly hope for.\n\nIt helps that it&apos;s entirely controlled by the people behind the series, and that the programme had cinematic qualities in the first place. On repeat viewings, however, the story is revealed to be thin, and lacking in incident. Its need to tie into events of the series makes it not wholly satisfying as a stand-alone vehicle, though it should still be understandable to those that have never seen an episode.\n\nDavid Duchovny as Mulder seems surprisingly at ease in his limited way, while Martin Landau is good as far as plot devices go. Gillian Anderson is unfortunately encouraged to overstate her lines, particularly in the beginning, while a cameo by The Lone Gunmen is perhaps the only indulgence that would be lost on non-fans.\n\nThere are inevitable concessions to the cinema format, of course. Not the touted mild use of expletives, which happened from time to time on TV anyway. But the alien presence that mutates to owe a debt to Ridley Scott&apos;s Alien, or the near-kiss between the two leads. Thankfully, the first point actually makes a logical sense and carries the story forward. The second is something that was also long overdue, and silly that it took so long. For two people who obviously feel about each other the way Mulder and Scully do, to go five years without even kissing is stretching credulity.\n\nUltimately, though, it lacks any clear focus for a casual film audience, and flits repetitively from action sequence to sloppy exposition and back again throughout its duration. Creator Chris Carter, like Gene Roddenberry with Star Trek before him, is not the smoothest writer of his own series, though he does adequately most of the time. Worst example is the opening Mulder/Scully scene which is laughably trite, and there are plenty more examples of Carter&apos;s trademark purple prose. Yet it does have a beginning, middle and end, and can be watched back-to-back with a TV episode with no noticeable jumps in style. In that sense, then, it is a most successful big-screen adaptation of a television series.\n\nHard-core X-File fans will be inclined to award an extra mark to the total, then. But for a non-committal audience, this is a &quot;6&quot; as they would have no idea from watching this that the frail, fag-smoking pensioner is the series&apos; major villain.",

In what boils down to be one woman&apos;s tirade against her partner&apos;s sexual aggression, this film is so heavily weighted towards her own perspective, the viewer is never emotionally complicit, because the film fails to deliver a full and realistic portrait of the marriage. We briefly witness the family&apos;s interaction, but after that, we are left to consume Alexandra&apos;s bitterness - and believe it.\n\nGary Sweet delivers a raw and emotional performance, and Helen Buday as Alexandra is polished and convincing. Her character, however, is two dimensional, and, by the end, the viewer is left in a state of not caring about her actions. Add to this Alexandra&apos;s unbelievable and unjustified final torment, and you are left with a film  which had a fantastic concept at its core, but sustains only a mildly successful delivery.\n\nFor a good De Heer film, get &quot;The Tracker&quot;, which is more subtle, and a more accomplished piece overall.",

      "reviewBody": "I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton&apos;s Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn&apos;t scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  &apos;Nightmare&apos; is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  \n\nWith Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell &amp; Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he&apos;s grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O&apos;Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack&apos;s vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.\n\nMuch credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton&apos;s finest accomplishments.  A+",

The film goes absolutely no where, and as far as French males go Yves Montand is one of the least attractive Europeans I&apos;ve ever seen (and that&apos;s putting it too mildly).  Surely Monroe&apos;s character has better taste than this?\n\nNo one&apos;s funny in this movie.  Comic legend Milton Berle can&apos;t hope to save this film with his small part, ditto with dancing legend Gene Kelly&apos;s cameo, nor any of the other cast.  Monroe herself, as appealing as she is, can&apos;t salvage a blase script like this turkey.\n\nThere&apos;re so many things wrong with this film.  Drab costumes, uninspired numbers, miscued performances, wandering story and just overall poor direction that it&apos;s a wonder it was ever released at all.  Though I suppose the studio had to recoup its losses somehow.\n\nI&apos;d heard a lot about this film since I was a boy, but had never had a chance to see it, probably because it was deemed to racy at the time for younger audiences.  Well, now I&apos;ve seen it, and not only do I wish I hadn&apos;t, I wish it had never been preserved.  Then again we need poor films in this world to remind us good films are good in the first place.  Too bad Marilyn had to be in this one.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pass on this film."

      "reviewBody": "Interiors (1978)\n\nThis is one of those dark, serious, realistic personal dramas that critics shook their heads at in 1978. It wasn&apos;t because it wasn&apos;t good--it&apos;s frankly a brilliant combination of the big three: acting, writing, photography. It was because it was directed (and written) by Woody Allen. And Woody Allen is funny, right? Critics at the time, however, to their credit, gave the film a fair reading, and for three brilliant excerpt of period reviews, I recommend the Wikipedia entry on the movie.\n\nSo watch this film thinking it&apos;s by someone else, if you have to. take it in on its own subtle terms as three sisters watch their own deficiencies bloom when their parents abruptly separate. There is some familiar territory here, actors Allen has turned to many times (including Diane Keaton, of course, who he was once, in 1970, involved with). The world is one that might actually be parallel to his own, not Jewish New York but rather a highly educated literary set with money and ambitions, but deeply steeped in the arts. \n\nIn short, &quot;Interiors&quot; was and is appreciated but always with a feeling that it isn&apos;t quite complete, that it isn&apos;t what it could have been. It&apos;s easy to see that it is unremittingly dour, almost to perversion. And you might say that it plays the Bergman card too hard without overt appropriation (which makes it merely derivative, that worst of echoes). It is fair, I suppose, to say that Allen really has succeeded, but not in the remarkable ways he had succeeded so clearly in his earlier films, including his previous nugget, &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; which is in my view his first true drama, but which has the benefit of also being funny.\n\nOr you can just sit back and take it in for what it does do so well, letting the interior lives of these people seem as shattered and pathetic as they really seem. The photography by Gordon Willis is admirable for being beautiful and inventive without being distracting. Allen and Willis make clear this intention with opening shots, a series of fixed camera views of rooms, and then views out windows, all framed with classic proportions, but sequenced to pull you in. But look how often the camera follows two people as they walk and talk, either up close in front of them, or along the beach through an irregular snow fence. Its pace and &quot;tastefulness&quot; of the photography almost seems designed by one of the main characters, the troubled interior decorator mother played with uncanny effectiveness by Geraldine Page.\n\nExpect nothing in particular here except a tour-de-force that works on its own depressing terms.",

      "reviewBody": "Dave Dearborn (Tom Keena) Vietnam veteran, free-lance journalist, and mercenary, is operating a discotheque aboard a ramshackle junk plying Singapore&apos;s harbor, when he receives an offer to investigate a probable defection of a scientist from Communist China. An overly complicated storyline depicts Dave taking the assignment because Chinese &quot;businessman&quot; Mr. Lim may have his claws into the defector in order to vend his expertise to the highest bidder, assisted by Lim&apos;s mistress Mai Lee (Vicki Racimo) for whom Dave carries a torch from their former affair. In the course of searching for the missing researcher, Dave becomes entangled with and beds several avidly willing females, while other bodies of the deceased sort pile up following a string of shootings, and we are given a surfeit of material detailing Dearborn&apos;s past as a cocaine addict, murderer for hire, and undercover homosexual! Filming is in Singapore, completed in 1971, but the piece was not released until Troma, a company specializing in exploitation features, offered it in 1984; there is, therefore, some interest within the production for its footage along the city&apos;s Orchid Road, Sago Lane and, in particular, Bugis Street with its swarms of transvestites, all given the kindness of being cleaned by the regime of Lee Yuan Lew subsequent to the movie&apos;s completion. Aside from this historic significance, little remains of value as the picture suffers from pronounced flaws in continuity and logic, in addition to generally shabby production values under the direction of schlockmeister Joel Reed, with a cast of largely, and thankfully, unknowns. Racimo is an able actress but here is wasted, as during one rather fantastic scene when, after her character dispatches her current squire by shooting him to death, including a close range finishing shot to the head, she then gives in to the demands of lust with Keena&apos;s character, the pair thrashing about amid four recently slain evildoers; there is precious little by way of interpretation that can be provided in such an instance.",

That being a good or bad thing is up to the viewer. The girls are funny and the dude is a douche. The blonde is a bitch and the pledges kill her. Tie in some Evil Dead voodoo, a mind control battle and zombie sorority girls, it&apos;s pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a movie like this. Lots of references to other horror films. The Ron Jeremy bit is definitely a highlight of the movie but it&apos;s an oddly serious scene. The boobies in the beginning of the film were awesome. Schoolly D the rapper is in the film but doesn&apos;t rap. Which is weird. I give it 8 Stars.",

You can&apos;t compare Sir Rex and Mr. Brynner as the King. the performances are so different. Harrison gives a wonderfully cruel yet compassionate performance. he is a slyer, more intellectual Monkut than Brynner was. His scenes with Irene Dunne bubble with chemistry. Dunne is every inch the Anna that Deborah Kerr was and gets a scene that was removed from the remake. The performance she gives after the death of her son was stunning!\n\nI recommend this film over the musical for sheer consistency of style. Sir Rex and Ms. Dunne are wonderful together and the entire film its a gem fro start to finish.",

It&apos;s simply brilliant fun. Great action adventure larks, with likable characters, a neat time-travel plot, a groovy &apos;80s theme tune, and an appearance by genre legend Peter Cushing (in his final screen performance). Honestly, what more do you need? Oh, you need more, do you? OK, then: Francesca Gonshaw, the really cute barmaid from early seasons of &apos;Allo &apos;Allo, as a Belgian resistance fighter (i swear, if she&apos;s said &quot;Listen very carefully, i shall say zis only once&quot; in that accent, my mind - and indeed my pants - may have exploded). Also, for all of us watching Doctor Who in the mid to late &apos;80s, roles for both James Saxon and Marcus Gilbert. How&apos;d&apos;ya like them apples?\n\nAbsolutely sublime nostalgic fun. To be watched with a few ales, alongside &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; or &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear&quot;. Bliss!",

The boy gets off on masochism. While many viewers may find this scary it is a realistic and common fetish. I for one thinks it is quite exciting. \n\nBut as erotic as some people might find it that&apos;s not what the movie deals with. It deals with the psychological impact of that realization. \n\nThe girl does not know how to handle that aspect of the relationship and the boy finds himself &apos;desturbed and perverted&apos; Problems arise and both try to come to terms with the situation in different ways.\n\nWhitout going too much of the story away I want to make clear this is NOT a pornographic movie. It tries to address certain more exotic aspects of sexuality in a normal, non-judgmental way. It shows us what could happen in a relationship when one or both parties has a fetish. It also shows us that having a fetish does not mean that the love for one-another is different than any other relationship. Just the way someone expresses it or experiences it is different.\n\nAll in all a very honest and heartwarming movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary from the peak of the Japanese New Wave is a well-structured and valuable resource for people looking to understand Japan in the years 1945-1970. Imamura progresses chronologically through the political highlights of those years, emphasizing the events that raised or frustrated the hopes of Japanese leftist and student groups. The timeline begins with the surrender in 1945 and progresses through 1952&apos;s Bloody May Day, the Ampo protests of 1960, and the troubling presence of American spy submarines and soldiers en route to the unpopular war in Vietnam.\n\nYet history without characters lacks a sense of reality, so at every stage Imamura lets his &quot;Madam Onboro,&quot; a salt-of-the-earth woman named Emiko Takada, give her impression of historical landmarks and augment them with stories from her own life. Her recollections do not always intersect with the events that newsreels covered, but that is the point of this exercise: the rhythm of people&apos;s lives, the decisions and mistakes they make, are what history looks like on a human scale.\n\nImamura&apos;s approach covers the political and the personal, but it fails to capture the most significant &quot;event&quot; of the first postwar quarter-century: the &quot;economic miracle&quot; that transformed Japanese standards of living. Emiko&apos;s life does illustrate that transformation - she notes that the Korean War boosted her family&apos;s income, and she became a business owner after an inauspicious youth shaped by class and caste. Yet neither her interviews nor the newsreel footage that Imamura uses to bridge them addresses the country&apos;s economic transformation overtly.\n\nI would love to know what became of Takada after 1970, where the movie ends at a major transition in her life. I have not found anything on the internet or in the digital archives of Japan&apos;s largest newspapers. I&apos;m posting this review here and on Letterboxd in the hope that someday, somehow, somebody will find out the rest of her story, or parts of it anyway, and share it. It&apos;s just one person&apos;s story, but Imamura picked a good one to tell, and I&apos;d love to know how it turns out.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t have a particular interest in the subject of tattooing, but this German-Swiss feature-length documentary about three of the earliest pioneers of this profession in Europe is a fascinating look at the lives of three men, Albert Cornelisse (Rotterdam, 1913), Herbert Hofmann (Freienwalde, 1919) and Karlmann Richter (Kiel, 1913) and their shared passion for the art of tattooing. For a long period, tattoos remained largely within the exclusive domain of sailors, soldiers abroad or criminal circles (for instance the Japanese Yakuza or gang members in the U.S.). Although from the &apos;70s onwards people from other circles started sporting tattoos, they were rarely socially accepted, especially in the workplace. In the last decade however, most taboos surrounding the practice seems to have disappeared and the popularity of tattoos in Western countries exploded. A poll conducted online in the U.S. in 2003 found that 16 % of all adults had at least one tattoo. In the age group 25-29 years old, this was 36 % and is still rising. Considering the ever increasing popularity of the subject, it&apos;s a mystery to me why this documentary is still relatively unknown. \n\nThis film doesn&apos;t really cover the profession itself. Above all, it&apos;s a portrait of three men, whose first passion is tattooing. On first appearance, they might look like ordinary elderly men, but beneath their clothes, they are covered in tattoos from head to toe. Herbert Hofmann&apos;s tattoo shop in Hamburg St. Pauli, &quot;Germany&apos;s first professional tattoo shop&quot;, is the place where the lives of these men crossed. They all helped Herbert professionally for substantial periods in their lives, but when he decided to pass over the shop to his younger cousin in 1981 the others felt betrayed and their friendship came to an end. Until the making of this film, when the three men saw each other for the first time in years. I&apos;m not sure if they became on very close terms again, but their encounter after all these years was a very moving sight indeed. Of course, the story behind all this is much more complex. One of them, Karlmann, even secretly left his wife and family in Southern Germany to work alongside Herbert Hofmann in his tattoo shop in Hamburg as late as 1970, because he couldn&apos;t live without his greatest passion. He lives with his son now, three of his other children haven&apos;t spoken to him since.\n\nIn a truly sincere and heart-moving way this film shows the fascinating life stories of these three men who gave up everything for their passion. Try to catch this if you can, it&apos;s a very rewarding experience.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 9/10"

      "reviewBody": "I was not sure what to expect from this film, but seeing as how I could borrow it for free I would watch it. Turns out it was a really good movie as it featured a fine performance from John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe, a nice kill here and there and a nice mystery to try and unravel. I am surprised that it did not perform better at the theaters as it was a nice change of pace from all the comic book films I usually watch.\n\nThe story has Edgar returning to Baltimore at a time a gruesome murder is taking place. One that seems to be a copy of his work &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;. Other heinous crimes occur, all seeming to be based off Poe&apos;s work. Poe becomes the prime suspect, but the investigator on the case soon realizes it is not the troubled author so he soon enlists Poe&apos;s help to try and find the person responsible. Unfortunately for Poe, this killer soon brings Poe in directly by kidnapping Poe&apos;s beloved and challenges Poe to find her before she dies.\n\nI liked the cat and mouse of the game as the investigator and Poe try to solve the killer&apos;s bizarre and twisted clues to learn his identity before it is too late. I was not sure what to expect from the film, but it turned out to be a very dark and a bit of a sad film. John Cusack did great as Poe, but all of the cast did a fine job. They also did a nice job of recreating Baltimore in the time period this film takes place. I am sure if I really looked I could find a mistake or two, but I never really try to look for anachronisms when watching a movie unless it is like totally obvious or the movie is not good.\n\nSo all in all a good mystery type movie with some horror elements in it. The best death was a bit early in the film, it being the one that copied the Poe story &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;. None of the other deaths were quite as graphic as it. However, the film&apos;s story was good enough that I did not need to see a bunch of over the top brutality.",

It starts with a wild car chase in France, introduces some memorable phrases, adds an attractive woman and antagonist with a very bad hair piece. There is also the required explosions and fight scenes, but they are not over-the-top.\n\nThe plot is not spectacular, but hey, it&apos;s a guy movie. Jason Statham makes a great tough guy, loved him in The Italian Job as well.\n\nI recommend inviting your friends over, grabbing some Orangina, and watching this great movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Three brothers join the Foreign Legion following the mysterious disappearance of a valuable sapphire.\n\nThis movie came out the same year (1939) as that other masterpiece of colonial adventure, The Four Feathers. Both make first-rate use of family bonds and family honor to create a strong emotional context to all the colorful combat. Those bonds really work here, establishing a strong sense of one for all and all for one. Plus the fact that the brothers have been adopted by the kindly Lady Brandon (Thatcher) not only lends poignancy, but makes the central twist work really well.\n\nAs good as Cooper-Milland-Foster are, it&apos;s really Donlevy&apos;s movie. His cruel martinet has stayed with me over the decades—the military haircut, the perfectly squared shoulders, the command voice. He not only commands his legionnaires, he commands the movie, as well. And, when he falls, I still have mixed emotions, despite his many acts of cruelty. It&apos;s a crackling good story, but it&apos;s his imposing presence that makes the adventure memorable. No wonder Donlevy was Oscar-nominated, a near-perfect blend of character and actor.\n\nTwo minor reservations. Cooper&apos;s fine in Beau&apos;s role, more animated than usual. However, at nearly forty, he appears a shade too old for the youthful part. Also, I&apos;ve never been able to reconcile to the relative ease with which the mutiny is put down. There&apos;s like five guys with guns facing a hundred guys who stand to be executed for their planned mutiny, yet they meekly give up, especially after Schwartz (the great Albert Dekker) has so powerfully roused them to action. To me, director Wellman&apos;s staging here is less than convincing.\n\nNonetheless, the mix of mystery, emotion and action remains superbly entertaining, and is ironically, one of the few movies that actually lives up to its title."

You&apos;ll have to get past the silly &amp; inept Vietnam opening-scene, but then this movie turns into an urban tale of virus-outbreak. A cannibal-virus, that is. There&apos;s some violence, there&apos;s some drama, there&apos;s some nudity, there&apos;s some very nice gore and there are four cannibal-fugitives on the run. Awesome mixture that works! Add to that a satisfying ending, and we&apos;ve got a hit! A hit with John Saxon in it, no less. &quot;Cannibal Apocalypse&quot; indeed feels, at times, a bit like Romero&apos;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), but the one movie that kept coming to my mind was David Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Rabid&quot; (1977). So if you&apos;re tired of all those &quot;half naked cannibals eating human flesh and slaughtering animals in the jungle&quot;-flicks, and if Umberto Lenzi&apos;s &quot;Nightmare City&quot; (1980) just made you laugh instead of anything else, then go watch Antonio Margheriti&apos;s &quot;Cannibal Apocalypse&quot; (aka &quot;Invasion of the Flesh Hunters&quot;). And make 100% sure you get a hold of the uncut version.",

Because the movie is in black and white, white subtitles keep showing up on white background and so, unless you understand German, you only catch snatches of important conversations. This is particularly a problem in the last fifth of the movie that involves a scene in a large house where a plot to kill Hitler is being hatched (I think). What that had to do with Dr. Rothe (the Peter Lorre character) killing his fiancee and his subsequent choice about which Nazi to shoot I have yet to figure out. After the movie, I asked total strangers in the audience what was going on in that house and they didn&apos;t know either.\n\nI suggest that any distributor who is looking to make some money from this movie should consider producing a new edition with yellow subtitles that will stand out on both black and white backgrounds. Without those, this will remain a movie that is well-known only in Germany."

      "reviewBody": "A very popular Japanese film called Battle Royale concerns an entire class of bad tempered middle school students forced to fight to the last survivor on a deserted island for their transgressions. Considered too controversial for American audiences, it&apos;s never been released in the states. &quot;The Condemned&quot; is basically a remake of that film. Instead of unruly teenagers, death-row inmates from around the world forced to kill each other for the pleasure of an insane internet magnate&apos;s 30 hour snuff reality program.\n\nSteve Austin joins 9 other on the island where they stalk and eliminate each other in some of the most violent ways imaginable. \n\nThis part of the story is fairly involving, but as the violence becomes more sadistic, it no longer seems entertaining. The sobering effect spreads to the movie characters as well, too late to help the combatants. Self righteously, the producers use this as a podium to speak down to the audience who bought tickets to watch the very entertainment they are presenting.\n\nThe movie is not helped by a stateside subplot involving Stone Cold&apos;s girlfriend who lives on a sprawling ranch and supports herself as a waitress.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been quite a while since I&apos;ve seen the first Santa Clause movie, but I remember being quite surprised by it.  It was a unique twist on the beloved Santa character with great comic timing by Tim Allen.  But that was a while ago, and I didn&apos;t really know what to expect from The Santa Clause 2.\n\nThe movie started off kind of slow when everything is going smoothly. Everybody&apos;s happy and Santa&apos;s meeting with his fellow &quot;legendary figures,&quot; which I admit was a fairly funny scene, but this movie just started off kind of boring.  Of course this is normal with any movie until we&apos;re presented with a conflict.  Santa is reverting back to his civilian self and must find a Mrs. Clause to fulfill the contract and continue being Santa.  So to watch over the North Pole, a duplicate, plastic Santa clone is made, and slowly turns to a maniacal boss over his elves.  I thought this was pretty funny, especially with me being a business major.  I wonder if I&apos;ll act like that after school!\n\nAnyways, back to the story, Santa goes back to his hometown with limited magic.  We&apos;re introduced to a frigid principal that has punished Santa&apos;s son for displaying some Christmas spirit.  More fun ensues as Santa tries to find and woo the next Mrs. Clause.  To seal the deal, his Santa magic gives him the edge and results in some very nice scenes of the movie.\n\nI won&apos;t go any further as you get the idea.  Overall, The Santa Clause 2 is a nice, snuggly movie that will keep you in the holiday spirit.  It&apos;s not groundbreaking material, but it has a nice message and should put a smile on anyone&apos;s face.\n\nMy IMDb Rating: 7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)",

Washington is an angel from Heaven who is sent to Earth to help a struggling inner-city reverend (Courtney B. Vance). Vance&apos;s church is about to fall under the hands of land developer Gregory Hines and his marriage to choir leader Whitney Houston also seems to be on the rocks. Can Washington change everyone&apos;s life for the better or will he just make matters worse? Nice direction by Penny Marshall (a film-maker who just cannot seem to get the respect she deserves) and the appealing pairing of Washington and Houston make &quot;The Preacher&apos;s Wife&quot; one of the better family-oriented productions of the 1990s. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Is it a documentary? Is it a feature? First time writer and director Marten Persiel tells us that it is actually both, more of a &apos;documentary tale&apos; of sorts. This description of the German subtitled feature is quite fitting.\n\nThis Ain&apos;t California introduces us to a group of friends who are gathering for a funeral after-party, following the death of their once close friend &apos;Dennis &apos;Panik&apos; Paracek. What follows is a reminiscence session of old memories and footage showing the rise of staking, hip-hop and break dancing all throughout the GDR controlled 1980&apos;s.\n\nSplit into several subheadings and with an additional back story, this ain&apos;t a normal documentary. It is an entirely fresh approach. Director Marten Persiel describes the films ethos was the keep away from the politics – especially the Berlin Wall. Instead the film fundamentally follows the subjective mind-set of a 17 year old of the era. This is reflected heavily, what with the shaky cam, youths doing a ton of impressive skateboarding tricks. All of that, but mixed with a mash of funky-techno music. Very unique in a sense, however it deeply echoes as just a blend of German sport advertisements merely with the brand logo missing. Sadly it is nothing more than that.\n\nFilled with footage because it can, not because it should, Marten Persiel&apos;s first feature film still stands as an original take on a documentary and it is perhaps the first skating movie ever cared for.",

Much of this is due to Elem Klimovs very conscious use of cinematic methods. The mad monk (Rasputin) as an evil force in russian politics is portrayed with great force. Klimov seems to be one of the great cinematic poets and dramatist who can tell a story of violent and dramatic political events, and also of private and psychological conditions. The actors are first rate in every aspect and make this cruel story a memorable, thrilling and moving experience. Agoniya means of course agony, and that is what the imperial family and the political elite in Russia went trough these years. Klimov had to do some compromises, but this film is in any way a masterpiece."

      "reviewBody": "Are we dealing with Alberto Sordi&apos;s top interpretation? Maybe not, but we are as close as hell...Anyway, superbly directed by Monicelli (once again, excellent job done in Cinecittà Studios recreating the early 19th century Rome), Sordi impersonates eccentric Marchese del Grillo, who actually lived, although not in the same period the movie depicts. Monicelli uses Del Grillo&apos;s myth and his plethora of jokes to expose the hypocrisy of Vatican and noble Romans, while ideas such as &quot;freedom, equality and brotherhood&quot; were slowly penetrating in the conservative Vatican State. Marchese del Grillo is surely a life-lover and an intellectual in his own way, and does not feel satisfied in narrow-minded 1815 Rome, despite (or maybe, because of) his wealth. He befriends frenchmen, enjoys spending time with common people and doesn&apos;t mind to corrupt a whole jury just to show that &quot;justice is dead&quot;. While the first part of the movie may be just biographical (and extremely funny and full of unforgettable punchlines), the movie has its pivotal point when Marchese discovers he has an exact lookalike, who works as a coal seller (also played by Sordi, outstanding in his double role) in popular Rome. By trading places with the coal seller (often drunk, thus not really understanding what&apos;s going on), Marchese gets the chance to get rid of his family, the Pope Rome to join the cradle of European intellectual life, Paris. Sure, Alberto Sordi is by himself worth watching the movie, but nevertheless, Monicelli manages to show us an unusual side of History we often see or read. And by doing this, he also throws in the movie an handful of unforgettable characters both fictional (the coal seller, Don Bastiano, Ricciotto) and actual (Pope Pius VII, a noble family, such as the Del Grillos). Well, in the end, a must see, a movie with a double value: an outstanding comedy and a valid historical film."

      "reviewBody": "After her brother is murdered by a ninja-yakuza clan, a teenage girl seeks vengeance with her gatling gun. First and foremost, this movie has enough blood spray to fill Lake Erie. The death scenes are numerous, highly inventive, and extremely entertaining. The pacing is just about perfect, with the action scenes positioned within the running time in such a way that avoids any dullness. One surprising positive is the camera-work, which shows blood sprays for incredibly long periods of time. This is definitely a movie that soaks itself in excess. The story itself plays out rather seriously, but the black humor is laid on thick during the fights, so some laugh-out-loud moments are almost guaranteed along the way. This is a very satisfying action gore-fest because of its impressively long finale.\n\nI&apos;ve already heard some artsy snobs complaining about this movie in terms of character development. I&apos;m just wondering why these tards even decided to watch this movie to begin with. They should have known exactly what they were going to get. You don&apos;t see the name Tsai Ming-liang on the DVD case, do you? \n\nThis really was my summer blockbuster popcorn flick of 2008. Everyone else can have their little CGI prairie dogs, animated monkeys, and space aliens. You can have your superheros, sequels, and remakes (can Hollywood think of anything new?). The fact remains that THIS movie should be playing on 3,000 screens! That will never happen in the USA though with it&apos;s dumb-as-dirt moviegoers who flock like sheep to see the most derivative tripe dished out by those Californian bloodsuckers. Do you people have ANY standards whatsoever? \n\nOn a positive note, that&apos;s another success this year in terms of my most highly anticipated films. &quot;Chocolate&quot; (a Thai action flick), &quot;The Machine Girl&quot;, and &quot;Tokyo Gore Police were all insanely entertaining. And maybe &quot;High School Girl Rika: Zombie Hunter&quot; can round out a great 2008 for Japanese Horror.\n\nYou don&apos;t get great stuff like this out of the States. Man, is there any reason to watch American movies anymore?",

Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.\n\nThose who are saying how it&apos;s predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren&apos;t predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It&apos;s not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you&apos;ve ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It&apos;s always about how well you tell a story.\n\nI&apos;m grateful there are still directors who aren&apos;t tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.\n\nPan&apos;s Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.\n\nI am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its&apos; original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.\n\nThis is a brilliant movie. Watch it.",

Considering the fact this movie was made under communist rule, this takes very little away from &quot;how people behaved &quot;. The acting is superb in all respects. This movie honors Germans with an active conscience, and they where few. I grew up in west Germany, in a country that had it&apos;s pains dealing with the past. A lot of it remained unresolved. Now it is time, after the iron curtain has fallen, for the movieindustrie to take another look at hidden treasures like this one. I believe the intelligent public should be made aware of this masterpiece of a movie. It definitely deserves restoration and a DVD release. So at least schools and university&apos;s could use it. Because for the powerful content, people might actually learn from the past.",

Fear. And this is delivered through some rather pleasant animation, each one in a different style and also different tone. Those, I would call them somehow modern fairy tales, are located in a different time and space continuum from one another. So you are never at the same place twice.\n\nYou should be experienced in watching independent cinema and maybe be a lover of animated movies.\n\nThese shorts make you think, make you ponder, make you actually wonder, what is it that I fear most? Not really scary but worth a watch for those who have a romantic heart. 6 out of 10 is my vote.",

      "reviewBody": "Unlike Tinseltown&apos;s version of HELLO, DOLLY!, Jay Presson Allen&apos;s screen adaptation of Ira Levin&apos;s hit Broadway thriller couldn&apos;t wait for it&apos;s stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen, so producers wisely decided to make the most of it&apos;s lengthy White Way run! The film&apos;s opening and closing scenes are shot inside New York&apos;s intimate Music Box Theater where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years.  Even the film&apos;s final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay&apos;s famous logo.  (Although marketeers decided to go with a more fun Rubik&apos;s Cube icon for the movie.)\n\nNow on a low-priced DVD release, DEATHTRAP seems just as fresh and inventinve as ever.  The cast is just right (better than their stage counterparts) and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for our &quot;one room, two act thriller&quot; to take place in. Opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely tags any &quot;new&quot; material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin&apos;s wickedly twisty center alone.\n\nThe film&apos;s last scene is a major Hollywood departure from the boards, and slightly undermines one of Levin&apos;s plot points from earlier in the film [Helga (about a dagger): &quot;Will be used by another woman BECAUSE of play.&quot;]. Like Robert Altman&apos;s THE PLAYER, however, our new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage, screen, and (could it be?) real life!",

I think some people might have trouble handling the subject matter and the fact that it&apos;s treated with equal parts seriousness and humor. But uncomfortable laughter to me is the sign of a movie that actually pushes some of our buttons and that&apos;s a good thing. The cast here is wonderful, in particular Elisha Cuthbert, who proves she can act and Katy Mixon, who nails the bitchy teen banter that can be so typical in other movies. The direction is heavy handed at times but the humor does a good job of undercutting the heavy atmopshere. The ending does have some problems which I won&apos;t post here since I don&apos;t want to give anything away, but overall I think any movie that manages to be this disturbing is worth a look. I suspect this film will be re-evaluated when its time has come.",

Tension rises in a little town from Andalucia where find the Rio Tinto mines ( Huelva ) . Then takes place the confrontation between employees and employers caused by contamination and work conditions ; being partially based on facts . A strike asking no more Teleros ( place where emerges toxic gas ) leads a spiral of blood and violence . Later on , in the 50s the British property mines were returned to Spain . The film is dedicated to memory everybody died in square of Rio Tinto.\n\nThis is a stirring drama with romance , betrayal , passion , and historical/political/social events . I don&apos;t understand why the English people are completely portrayed as ominous villains and heinous nasties when they are film&apos;s co-producers , perhaps for that reason resulted to be a flop in England . Casting is frankly cool , formed by British and Spanish actors . As the protagonists , Catalina Sandino Moreno ( Maria llena eres Gracia) as good girl , Sienna Guillory ( Resident Evil II , Eragon )as revolutionary youth and Philip Winchester ( Robinson Crusoe series ) as idealist guy . And secondary cast appears Bernard Hill ( Titanic ), Joaquin De Almeida as the mean magnate , Javier Perugorria as the Mayor , Fernando Ramallo as striker and Juan Fernandez as ominous hoodlum . Colorful cinematography by Javier Salmones ( Romasanta , Butterfly tongue ) and emotive score by Fernando Orti . The motion picture is professionally directed by Antonio Cuadri who was born in Huelva ( Andalucia ) location where are the mines . He is a fine craftsman with some hit , such as ¨La Gran Vida ( with Salma Hayek) ¨ and previously made a documentary titled ¨Riotinto (2004)¨. Nowadays , he only directs TV episodes ( Cuentame, Manolito Gafotas , among them).",

      "reviewBody": "In my opinion, the ratings are somewhat unfair, possibly because they compare the film with current productions. The film is from 1976 and therefore should be measured at the standards of that time and here, I find, it still exceeds the average. The two main actors, Roger Moore and, more specifically, Stacey Keach, are the main reason for this. Some complain about the English dubbing. About this I can say nothing, but I can imagine that a bad dubbing can mess something, or all here. Well, the German Dubbing is very good, both protagonists have the well- known sync voices, Roger Moore, for example, from his James Bond films. Both act as buddies and complement each other excellently, just Keach&apos;s role brings loose the film excellently and humorously. The music is better than the beats from other Italian films of the 70s. Also the production and the existing budget is higher. I often read &apos;low budget film&apos; but as mentioned before, compare it to the standard Italian classic flick and not with an James Bond Production. The two auto- action scenes are very well implemented, also the filming sites was well-considered. Surely we have here no top film belonging to the IMDb Top 250, but in my opinion synonymous not the superfluous film, which is only waste of time. It is a solid, versatile action tiller who can be given a chance. In German its called Abrechnung in San Francisco, meaning Last billing in SF, which suits much better than Street People. A weak 7, but a 7.",

      "reviewBody": "Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ryûzô Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.\n\nWalter Hill&apos;s variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town&apos;s two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration.\n\nThe look and sound is terrific, Cooder&apos;s pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn&apos;t up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen.\n\nIt&apos;s an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it&apos;s unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there&apos;s enough to like about it whilst accepting it&apos;s a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it&apos;s likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;American Harmony&quot; is a first-rate documentary of barbershop quartet singing. I&apos;m not a particular follower of this type of music, but enjoy all kinds. I&apos;ve enjoyed the shows I&apos;ve attended and old films of vaudeville that have barbershop quartets. This film focuses on four groups over a three-year period. It follows them to regional and international competitions. It ends with the 2008 international event held at Denver. It is an interesting documentary about the genre, its history and its following.\n\nOne weakness of the film is that it has too much repetitive dialog. We see similar interviews with the same singers two, three and four times. It could have used more full scenes of singing early and throughout the film. We only see the top three or four groups sing a full number each at the end. The producers might have cut some of the repetitive interviews with the main characters. Adding some short comments from a few other singers would have broadened it a bit. Still, it&apos;s an interesting film.",

He leaves his wife and his grapes in Georgia and travels for a long time by train and wagon to reach the hospital. However, he learns that Goderdzi has been discharged and sent back to the front. Giorgi decides to head to Domidovo to seek out his son but he does not find him. He joins the Soviet Army to fight against the Germans expecting to find his son. Will he succeed in his search for Goderdzi?\n\n&quot;Jariskatsis mama&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Father of a Soldier&quot;, is a touching and beautiful Georgian and Russian antiwar movie. The plot alternates funny moments with dramatic situations in an impressive environment of war. Sergo Zakariadze has a magnificent performance in the role of a family man that needs to see his &quot;tall and handsome&quot; son no matter the price; otherwise what will he say to his wife and friends? The heartbreaking conclusion of this little masterpiece is very sad but never corny. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Pai do Soldado&quot; (&quot;The Father of the Soldier&quot;)",

This is the first one of his movies I have seen, and while I can understand some people&apos;s objections, I cannot really agree with them. I have seen a number of other Olympics documentaries, and while some can be called artistic masterpieces, most fall well short of that. Many of the earlier documentaries show footage of the events but give very little context. The footage may be exciting but there is little human interest. Greenspan (at least in this movie--I can only assume his other movies follow the same template) concentrates on only a dozen or so events, and then singles out an athlete or two from the event and gives their back story. I imagine some people would get frustrated at the sameness of this approach, but it kept my interest throughout the 3 1/2 hour run time. I even got caught up in the suspense of each event even though the outcomes were rarely in doubt. I suppose this approach would seem formulaic after seeing a few of his movies, but if a formula works, why change it?",

The man eats a banana while dangling from the back of a moving speedboat! Then he casually tosses the peel into the water!\n\nIt&apos;s a spoof of other spy films, but it never goes too far overboard with the parody like Austin Powers, which is what I love about it. The main character is not an unbelievable buffoon, but a smart, capable, sophisticated spy—not unlike James Bond but with his own, funny personality—with a few good one-liners and who appreciates a good banana. Sure, it&apos;s very cheesy at times, but that is balanced with a generous helping of action and a decent storyline, topped off with spot-on performances and fun dialogue. There is one stunt in particular, involving a helicopter and a well-known Brazilian statue that had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nThis movie is both funny and tense. It&apos;s never boring, and every scene has something good in it. Mike Connors is great in the lead role, and he&apos;s backed up by some outstanding performances by Susan Fleming and Raf Vallone. However, I particularly enjoyed Terry-Thomas&apos; pitch-perfect performance in the role of an unassuming chauffeur with a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\nI saw this film at a revival house in Los Angeles many decades after its release. I was initially intrigued because of the awesomely hilarious title and the strange but funny trailer I&apos;d seen played the previous week at the same theater. Everyone in the theater laughed and had a good time, but after it was over I overheard some of the other people in the theater say that it was so bad it was good. I didn&apos;t get that feeling. I just felt like it was good. I haven&apos;t been able to find it on home video and I get the feeling that it never received a wide home video release, if any, but if you get a chance to watch it I highly recommend it.",

      "name": "Walking along the docks and reminiscing",
      "reviewBody": "Writer/director/star Woody Allen plays agent/manager Danny Rose in this funny, loving, nostalgic look at the lower and fringe rungs of the entertainment industry, combined with a mob subplot and not a little &quot;philosophy of life&quot; contemplation.\n\nThe film begins with a gaggle of older Borscht Belt-caliber comedians sitting around a table at Manhattan&apos;s Carnegie Deli, trading stories about Danny Rose. Rose loves acts that are a bit &quot;outside&quot; the mainstream, so there is no shortage of laughs from our storytellers as they remember his one-legged tap dancer, his blind xylophonist, and so on.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes or so of general reminiscing interspersed with footage of Rose portraying the stories, one man says he&apos;s got the Rose story to top them all, which launches us into the &quot;film proper&quot;. It&apos;s a tale about Rose and his client Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte), a Louis Prima-styled singer who had one hit, &quot;Agita&quot;, in the 1950s, but who is a has-been when Rose meets him. Broadway Danny Rose is primarily the story of how Rose gets mixed up in a comically deteriorating situation with Canova&apos;s mistress, Tina Vitale (Mia Farrow), while trying to ensure that she attends a career-restoring gig, despite the fact that Canova&apos;s wife is also going to be there.\n\nAllen treats us to some entertaining postmodernist layering in the beginning. It seems like a normal enough film in the first few moments, but quickly turns into almost a mock documentary as our deli comedians talk about Rose. The Rose material is really all flashback, and even when it &quot;takes over&quot; the film during the Canova story, it still has a mock documentary feel at first. Eventually the Canova story proceeds as any film would, but the bookended storytellers emphasize the nostalgic tone of the film.\n\nAllen is drilling in that fact that we&apos;re reminiscing. He wants the audience to reminisce about the tone of the main story, even if they don&apos;t have personal memories of the era or that segment of the entertainment industry. For Allen, the film has strong resemblances to some aspects of his personal experience as an up and coming standup comedian, and he even draws parallels such as a Carnegie Deli sandwich being named after Danny Rose in the film--in real life, you can eat a sandwich named after Woody Allen at the Carnegie Deli. Having characters in the film reminisce about what turns out to be a reminiscent mode in a flashback helps audience members outside of the relevant &quot;nostalgia zone&quot; to get into the proper mood.\n\nInterestingly for this goal, even though Allen goes to the trouble to shoot the film in black &amp; white, he doesn&apos;t attempt to remove blatantly anachronistic elements--as if he&apos;s trying to remind us that this is still artificial reminiscing. For example, a scene that takes place in a Times Square office features a window through which we can see the large flashing &quot;Fuji&quot; sign. On the other hand, Allen also exploits the fact that Broadway Danny Rose was shot just as the recent family-friendly gentrification of the New York City area was taking hold, as there are important scenes on the old, dilapidated West Side docks and in a Jersey City that still looks comparatively like a barren wasteland.\n\nOne of the reasons that this film is so charming is that even though Danny Rose is a loser, he&apos;s a good-hearted loser with an admirable philosophy of life, despite the fact that he&apos;s continually abused and/or given the short shrift by those he helps. Allen is still doing his &quot;neurotic Jew&quot; schtick here, but whereas he tends to draw that character as self-centered in other films, in Broadway Danny Rose he&apos;s almost completely altruistic. He actually tries to persuade other characters, who happen to be self-centered, to change their outlooks. He&apos;s a Tod Browning to a cadre of performing freaks, promoting and embracing them, even if to most eyes it has to involve exploiting them at the same time. But he admirably can&apos;t help seeing the best in everyone, encouraging them and honestly believing that they should be in a &quot;higher position&quot; than they are now. He even does this with the non-performing Tina when she makes some decorating suggestions about his apartment--suddenly, he wants to manage an interior decorating career for her, saying that she should be doing &quot;hotels and embassies&quot;.\n\nAs is typical for an Allen film, Broadway Danny Rose is filled with amazing, often symbolic cinematography, by frequent collaborator (from 1977&apos;s Annie Hall through 1985&apos;s The Purple Rose of Cairo) Gordon Willis. It&apos;s also full of great performances (including Allen&apos;s) and it&apos;s infused with Allen&apos;s trademark pre-bop jazz, in this case heavily depending on variations of the Prima-like &quot;Agita&quot;, somewhat similar to how &quot;In A Persian Market&quot; was used as a theme in the later Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001).\n\nIf you like Allen&apos;s typical style, you&apos;ve surely seen this film. If you&apos;re wondering where to start or dip into Allen&apos;s works further, Broadway Danny Rose is as good a place to begin as any.",

Take three characters of the same sex, put them into a situation where they have to interact for an extended period under stressful circumstances, and then explore the relationships that develop. The formula however tends to lend itself to rapid degeneration into either the ridiculous, if it is being milked for laughs, or the melodramatic if it is played for drama. It is much to the credit of all concerned that Thelma, Louise et Chantal manages to avoid both traps and turn in a pleasant evening&apos;s entertainment.\n\nPlenty of laughs - including some great subtle plays on words and misunderstandings. A tiny bit of slapstick. Some bathos for seasoning. And a plot development that is entirely believable from start to finish, even including the running gag of the frozen dog corpse.\n\nBelievable characters, too. As the film progresses, each of the women is forced to drop her walls of pretense, face up to her own shortcomings, and become open and honest with her traveling companions. If some of the bit parts seem two dimensional, this is almost inevitable given the size of their roles, and only serves to add body to the three middle aged women who are the focus of our attention.\n\nI&apos;ve complained before about the sound quality of French films. It appears that the studios have, at long last, learned how to process their sound tracks properly, because in this film I found nothing to criticize - interior, exterior and &quot;in car&quot; sound recordings were all crystal clear and intelligible. Finally! \n\nEnjoy it. It was fun.",

He couldn&apos;t be mentioned without being made into a character and given a role in the story - which would mean, among other things, placing him on the list of suspected traitors, at least temporarily, which would either be a slur, or (assuming it wasn&apos;t a slur because we&apos;d immediately know him to be innocent) a constraint on the mystery.  Throwing in a clearly fictitious genius was the right thing to do.  (Turing was the most important, but not the only, genius involved.)\n\nThe main problem with &quot;Enigma&quot; is that emphasis is badly misplaced.  I was interested in (a) how the war effort was going, (b) whether Bletchley Park would come up with solutions in time, (c) HOW the process of breaking codes was actually carried out, and (d) when Tom would get over his idiotic infatuation with that annoying blonde chick and fall, as any sensible person would, for the dynamic and twenty-times-more-attractive Hester (Kate Winslet).  I won&apos;t swear that I was interested in these things in that order, but I WAS interested in them to the exclusion of everything else; the mystery subplot involving Claire that for some reason becomes THE plot, was a distraction.  Its twists and turns (they come along like clockwork every fifteen minutes) are of the kind you don&apos;t even bother trying to follow. You just wait for the next confrontation between Dougray Scott and Jeremy Northam, of which Stoppard&apos;s (or Harris&apos;s) mechanical sleight-of-hand is just a means of providing.  A pity he couldn&apos;t have found some other means - or moved Northam&apos;s character to a different movie altogether, where he wouldn&apos;t take time away from Enigma, Winslet&apos;s character, etc.\n\nThe film - and the script, too, all things considered - is well put together (intelligent writing, excellent acting and photography), so the Claire subplot makes it a real missed opportunity."

In other films this would be a drawback because you would feel bored, but here the superb dialogs between characters create so much suspense that you will be far from bored and the slightly slower pace of the film will create a tension that you will physically experience in every muscle as you sit on the edge of your seat and watch the story unfold. This film shows us how when you feel guilty about something, everything you hear sounds like a prosecution. Otherwise this would be just one more of those nothing-special films, but the subtle insinuations in dialogs and an excellent cast led by Rutger Hauer make it a masterpiece. It feels as if everyone involved in its creation did a perfect job while at the same time being careful not to overdo it.\n\nThis is why I rated this film 10 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "DEATH LINE \n\n(USA: Raw Meat) \n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound format: Mono\n\nTrapped by falling masonry during construction of the London Underground, a group of Victorian workers survive in the bowels of the earth for more than a century, breeding amongst themselves and cannibalizing the dead. A hundred years after their ordeal began, the last remaining descendant (Hugh Armstrong) finds his way back to the surface and begins to abduct people from station platforms in a desperate bid for food and companionship...\n\nWith its unique premise and uncompromising attention to grisly detail, Gary Sherman&apos;s directorial feature debut has gained something of a cult reputation over the years, and not without good reason. Dominated by Donald Pleasence&apos;s central performance as a cynical copper who treats everyone - innocent and guilty alike - with equal contempt, the film strikes a precarious balance between eccentricity and horror, reaching its emotional highpoint during scenes depicting Armstrong&apos;s ghoulish underground &apos;home&apos;, strewn with rotting corpses. Art direction (by Denis Gordon-Orr) and cinematography (by veteran Alex Thomson) are uniformly excellent, generating a vivid illusion of ancient decay, and the production benefits from atmospheric location work in abandoned train stations dating back to the Victorian era.\n\nJuvenile leads David Ladd and Sharon Gurney are a dreary pair, and they&apos;re completely overshadowed by Pleasence&apos;s crowd-pleasing theatrics, but the film survives by virtue of its distinctive plot line and extraordinary setting, and there&apos;s at least ONE good scare that will lift viewers right out of their seats! Casual observers may find the opening scenes a little heavy-going, but Ceri Jones&apos; admirable screenplay describes a fascinating narrative arc, and horror fans will be gripped throughout. Christopher Lee exchanges fruity insults with Pleasence during a brief cameo appearance, shot in a couple of hours and intended solely for marquee value.",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s face it, if you&apos;re bothering to read reviews of this film, you are probably going to see it out of a sense of obligation if nothing else. So, it really doesn&apos;t matter what I say, now does it? \n\nThis is a fairly typical early 1950s not-very-scientific attempt to use the genre as a means for moralizing. The morality of this film is certainly worth listening to for its anti-war, anti-pollution, etc, messages, but the film lacks depth, science of any kind, and, basically, a compelling plot.\n\nBeing a fan of 50s sci if, I thought this film started off pretty well. Although there is no obvious crisis looming on the horizon, a scientist and a group of anti-nuke colleagues obtain grant money to explore deep within the earth for the possibility of habitable subterranean environments. Since the film was made in 1950-51, the level of concern regarding nuclear warheads is certainly understandable (too bad some have forgotten about this, eh?).\n\nMuch is made about the vehicle which they will use for this journey. The vehicle looks like a suped-up bullet nose Studebaker with a large drill bit attached to it. This vehicle is apparently capable of drilling through several hundred miles of solid rock, without any visible cooling system. As the scientists explore deeper and deeper into the earth, they are not surprised (though I was) to find that most of the crust and upper mantle (my terms, not theirs) are in fact hollow, and have not only gorgeous stalagmites and stalactites, but flat floors graded properly for people to take walks on. Harassed by noxious gasses, magma and pretty poor acting, the cast dwindles as the story devolves into a simple adventure tale.\n\nThe acting is generally uneven, and is hampered by the occasionally absurd script. I really don&apos;t want to single anybody out, but Marilyn Nash and Bruce Kellogg are particularly off-pace in this one.\n\nThe director, Terry Morse, went on to make a few good films (such as the List of Adrian Messenger), and also a lot of other films (the American version of Godzilla, and the timeless classic - not - Love Slaves of the Amazon). And this is sort of below-standard fare in the context of his filmography.\n\nWell, OK then, go see it... You know you want to, and I am not going to stop you... But don&apos;t say you didn&apos;t have fair warning.",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t really have any desire to see this movie, because of all the negative reviews that I had read. When I was told that I could pick an older movie for free because I was renting a new release, I looked around and Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo was sitting right there, so I grabbed it.(hey, Rob Schneider has always been cool with me) When I sat down to watch it I had low to no expectations, because I heard that the movie was pretty terrible, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn&apos;t that bad. They got me to laugh out loud quite a few times within the first couple of minutes and it continued throughout, I found that the story was actually interesting (for this type of movie), and I enjoyed the characters. The female lead, Eva, is gorgeous and hot, while sweet and innocent at the same time. I thought she was Anna Farris from the picture on the back of the DVD, and was slightly disappointed to find out it wasn&apos;t her, but I really enjoyed Hanna Verboom, my new celebrity crush.\n\nI can do without Eddie Griffin and all the filth, which is on display rather frequently in this movie, but for some reason, I almost didn&apos;t mind it here. I didn&apos;t find that it was the &quot;How many times can we use the F word in 90 minutes&quot;-athon like 40-Year Old Virgin and other films are. Although they do over use the whole &quot;gigolo&quot; verbiage. I mean, are we suppose to still be laughing about it after 2 whole movies filled to the brim with words like &quot;man-whore&quot;, &quot;he-bitch&quot;, etc. being spoken every other minute? \n\nI honestly cannot understand why this movie is panned to the level that it is, with some people calling it the &quot;worst movie ever made&quot;. It is actually pretty good for a cheap, crass, comedy. Be assured that you can do a lot worse, if you do decide to check this film out. It was much better than I thought it&apos;d be, and from what I can remember, it was at least on par with the first movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Billy Elliot is a truly inspirational movie. It reminds us of the human potential to transcend our economic surroundings and the expectations of society by doing something so simple, and yet sometimes so very difficult, as simply being ourselves.\n\nBorn in a socially and economically repressed mining town, Billy is told that boys box or wrestle; boys don&apos;t dance. But Billy loves to dance and does so every chance that he gets.\n\nDoes a love of ballet make you gay? Does it matter if your best friend is a crossdresser? How far will a father go when he realizes the truth about his son? This is a movie of change, growth and emotion, with characters and actors so real and fully developed that they pull your heart forth and place it firmly upon the screen. We literally feel the brittleness of judgement, the despair of lost hope, and the joy of acceptance.\n\nIt is easy to see why this small British film has won so many foreign awards and nominations, and I only hope it will be given the chance it deserves to inspire and transform US audiences as well."

How delightful to find another actor intelligent and flexible enough to range from Melchett to Oscar Wilde!  One cannot help but watch his face very carefully, waiting to see the mask slip.  He seems strangely delicate in his huge, crushing frame...A nice follow-up movie to Velvet Goldmine, especially once you know that some of the dialogue from the latter was lifted from the works of Oscar Wilde."

George Kennedy is perhaps the biggest name actor. The story is so-so and kind of predictable, down on luck race team on the verge of making it big crosses paths with a young woman engineer who has plans to greatly improve race engines, which are stolen along with her. Oddly they&apos;re in the second tier Busch Grand National series rather than the then Winston Cup series, but it&apos;s nice to see clips of those cars in action. Humpy Wheeler and David Pearson have cameos. Appears some of it was filmed inside the DiGard racing shops (if you&apos;re paying attention in one scene the logo appears on a door).\n\nIt&apos;s also clear the editing people had never actually seen a race, as they cut in several scenes of spins that would have brought out a caution but no caution comes out. Perhaps in the interest of time, race starts are skipped past for only a few minutes of race action at the end.\n\nThe soundtrack isn&apos;t bad, it&apos;s pure 1980s.\n\nIs it really terrible, no, I found I enjoyed it, but if you&apos;re not a race fan you probably won&apos;t like it as much.\n\nI found it on the internet, has it ever been released to home video?",

Not that a little info isn&apos;t bad on them, but they come at the expense of the creature attacks as it&apos;s mostly getting a complete history of the locals before stuff starts to happen, and the creature doesn&apos;t start getting in on things until just under the hour mark. Those are really good, with some pretty brutal attacks getting in some pretty decent gore shots and the day-time setting for the whole film is rather pleasant, if only the creature&apos;s costume would&apos;ve looked better. Still, the lowered amount of time spent here on these sections of the film means it&apos;s quite a while before we get to the good stuff, flawed as it is by&apos;s low-budget nature that somewhat hurts it, but overall this is a throwback to the Grindhouse style of shockers so those who enjoy them will find a lot more here instead of more traditional creature-feature fans.\n\nRated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",

      "reviewBody": "I caught this film when it was shown on British television recently and was surprised that I had never previously heard of it, despite the fact that it stars an actor as iconic as Michael Caine and was made by a director as famous as Don Siegel. The &quot;black windmill&quot; of the title is one of the two Clayton Windmills (known locally as &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;) on the South Downs near Brighton; this windmill plays an important part in the plot.\n\nAs in &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, Caine plays a British secret service agent, but his character here, John Tarrant, is very different to Harry Palmer. Whereas Palmer was a working-class outsider, a former Army sergeant who was virtually blackmailed into joining the secret service to avoid a criminal charge, Tarrant is an establishment insider, part of the officer class. (He holds the rank of Major). He is engaged in an undercover operation to counter the activities of a gang of arms smugglers selling weapons to terrorists in Northern Ireland. (The film was made in 1974 when the Northern Irish troubles were at their height).\n\nThe film starts with Tarrant&apos;s young son David being kidnapped and held to ransom. The kidnappers appear to have a detailed knowledge not only of Tarrant&apos;s family circumstances but also of the work he is engaged on; as their ransom they demand a valuable quantity of uncut diamonds which he has recently acquired to fund his intelligence work. Tarrant initially believes that the kidnappers are connected either to the arms dealers or to the terrorists for whom they are working, and confides in his superior, Cedric Harper. As matters progress, however, he begins to wonder whether matters are really as they seem and whether he can really trust his colleagues.\n\nThis is far from being Caine&apos;s worst film. (For an actor of his distinction he made more than his fair share of dreadful ones, &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot; and &quot;Ashanti&quot; being two that come to mind). It does, however, highlight one of his weaknesses as an actor, namely that in the early part of his career he was not very good at conveying strong emotions. Most of his iconic roles, at least from this period, involved him playing characters who, for one reason or another, avoid showing much emotion. This could be because they need to keep up the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; (his characters in &quot;Zulu&quot; and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;), because they hide their feelings beneath a mask of impassivity (Jack Carter), because they deliberately avoid emotional commitment (Alfie Elkins) or because they try and distance themselves from their feelings through cynicism and irony (Frank in &quot;Educating Rita&quot;). Certainly, some of his more mature performances do show greater emotional depth, such as &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot; and &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, but in &quot;The Black Windmill&quot; he is rather wooden, never suggesting the anguish and anxiety of a man whose son is being held for ransom.\n\nSome of the acting is better; Janet Suzman as Tarrant&apos;s estranged wife Alex provides the emotional conviction that Caine&apos;s performance lacks, while Donald Pleasence is very effective as the smooth but unsympathetic and possibly duplicitous Harper. The film as a whole is a professionally made thriller, if not a very original one, but an essentially American director like Siegel was not the most natural choice to direct a British spy thriller like this one. &quot;The Black Windmill&quot; is never going to rank on his filmography as highly as the likes of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;The Shootist&quot;. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "\n* While honeymooning on a train, a couple receives several telegrams of congratulations. But when the husband, Paul Webster (Richard Crane), receives one telegram that seems to change his mood. He refuses to let his wife, Joyce Webster (Beverly Garland), see the telegram or tell her what the problem is. At the next stop, Paul disembarks to make a telephone call. But as the train gets underway again, Paul is not on board. Frantically, Joyce begins her search for her husband. There are few clues to go on. It&apos;s as if he never existed. She finally gets a lead that takes her to a house in the middle of the Louisiana bayou. The people in the house appear to be hiding something. Joyce has to find a way to get past their lies and discover the truth. What is her husband&apos;s secret and why is he hiding in the swamp? \n\n\n\n* Before I saw this movie for the first time, I had read some really bad things about it. I had also seen images of some of the very cheesy special effects. The movie is much better than I had been led to believe. And even though the special effects are laughable, they have a certain charm about them that I find endearing. For such a low budget movie, this is one of the most beautifully shot black and white films I&apos;ve ever seen. I realize that everything is stage-bound, but it has that look that I love about these older films. The sets in The Alligator People are comparable to those from the older Universal classic monster films.\n\n\n\n* For the most part, the acting in The Alligator People is a step ahead of most other low budget films. Beverly Garland is completely believable as the heartbroken wife. She creates a character that I found it easy to care about. On the other end of the acting spectrum, Lon Chaney, Jr. gives one of the most embarrassing performances of his that I have seen to date. His drunken Cajun was a little too close to home and makes watching it that much more sad. The attempted rape scene (shocking for a film in 1959) has to be a real low point for Chaney.\n\n\n\n* The Region 1 DVD features one of the best images I&apos;ve seen for such a low budget, obviously B film. The widescreen print is simply gorgeous. It&apos;s too bad there are no real special features.\n",

It does have potential, but I felt some points in the movie dragged and weakened. Liota&apos;s character, although well acted, seemed to have too drastic a turn around in too short a time to really show the process and allow the viewer to relate. There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, other than it&apos;s ending which was entirely expected, felt rushed, clichéd, and under-developed. If you have nothing better to do on a Wednesday night, then I recommend this movie, but if you have something better to do with your two hours, don&apos;t waste your time.",

      "reviewBody": "2012&apos;s Hotel Transylvania was kind of a surprise. Though it&apos;s still riddled with pop cultural references, but its flavor wondrously resembles to the director&apos;s cartoon shows in the 90&apos;s which brings visual and comedic nostalgia, in the CG animated form (or it&apos;s basically just acknowledging us that this type of animation still exists.) Revisiting the same gang with the same people behind it can be welcoming, maybe a little worrisome when it comes to plotting. The prediction can be somewhat true; the craziness and heart remains, but the narrative is too busy, even without much development, even compared to its predecessor. What exceeds the expectation is the theme it handles is a lot interesting. Overall, it brought enough nuttiness for the fans and brought enough sweetness to everyone else.\n\nWhile the first one was about overcoming the monster&apos;s misanthropy, Hotel Transylvania 2 is about trying to accept humans, even though Drac haven&apos;t fully let go of his old nature. And the setup starts from Dracula&apos;s daughter, Mavis, marrying a human, Jonathan, then transitioned to them having a baby. And the main conflict here is their son not inheriting the vampire gene may lead the couple to live in a normal human town. And just like what the trailer shows, the movie mostly runs with Dracula pushing his grandson to become a vampire, assuming that he may just be a late bloomer. And these scenes don&apos;t exactly make a clever narrative, they are basically just one gag to another, while we occasionally see the kid&apos;s parents trying to fit in the human world. In spite of still being entertaining and funny, the plot doesn&apos;t seem to actually move forward. It&apos;s like it&apos;s just playing around until it decides to proceed or something. But at times, it&apos;s sort of hinting something more heartfelt; like how Mavis feels like she is being somewhat patronized in the human world or how young Dennis is getting tired with Dracula&apos;s demands. And it&apos;s surprisingly more engaging to watch, even though the gags are already pretty fun.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t go deep, obviously, but it makes up a lot after an almost extravagant extent of punchlines. The animation is still crazy looking which brings distinct appeal within their unhinged facial expressions, energetic movements and freely constructed action. Even for jokes where the punchline is just being awkward (for no particular reason,) it sort of perfectly fits with this type of visual. The humor is best when it is spoken by the animation. The voice acting is still delightful, with Adam Sandler still bringing the heart in Dracula. The rest just gave these already lively animated characters more personalities.\n\nHotel Transylvania 2 is pretty entertaining, despite of not handling any subtle narrative, though I don&apos;t think many would be asking for that, but I may be a good suggestion. Maybe the only main disappointment is it&apos;s probably not as outrageous as its predecessor. I mean it&apos;s not totally restrained, of course, you would definitely still find a lot of crazy animation and wonderfully absurd facial expressions here, but maybe not as insane as the first movie did. I don&apos;t know, maybe it&apos;s just my expectations of witnessing more images to delightfully laugh at like the scene where Jonny was trying to scare a rat. And even the verbal humor where they were playing charades with the Invisible Man. But again, it&apos;s just my expectations. It&apos;s still pretty funny. The only worst thing you may find here are the blatant Sony products and I don&apos;t exactly know how you can shrug that off. Anyway, the movie still carries a much better message in the end, about being treated fairly, no matter how different you are to others. It shows it well and it seems pretty sincere. If you&apos;re not into this type of absurd animation, then at least its final note could make everything up to your viewing.",

Most of the editing (90% of it actually, according to their website) was done while filming, i.e. filming scene number 17 right after number 16. I could say that the story was under-developed, that the acting was flaky, etc... but once again: they were 20 years old!.\n\nIf I&apos;m not mistaken, it&apos;s also the first Argentinian zombie film.

      "reviewBody": "The Left Elboe Index considers seven variables--acting, production sets, plot, character development, dialogue, artistry, and continuity--- to measure a film on a scale of 10 (high) to 1 (low). As far as acting goes, there seem to be too many clichés and exaggerations to contribute drama to a historically dramatic event. If anything, it appears that weak acting makes the history less dramatic, thereby earning a rating of 2. Except for the &quot;staight-line&quot; scenes, there seems to be little upon which to measure the production sets, probably because many of the scenes are period newsreels, even to the extent of employing what appears to be something akin to an autobahn promo (another rating of 2). The plot rates a 1, mostly because the end is known and not much else can be done. Character development appears weakened by the stereotypical characters, some of whom seem exaggerated beyond reason. With so many forgettable characters, a rating of 2 seems fair. Artistry gets the highest rank of 4, based almost entirely on the ironic use of music. Continuity also rates a 4 since the docudrama tone is maintained, with occasional weak spots like the soldiers singing on a supply train as it speed through a crossing. This movie was produced in 1961, in the same period as very good films DR. STRANGELOVE and THE LORD OF THE FLIES, two movies that stunned audiences with their powerful drama. In my opinion this film does not measure up to those. In fact, it seems much like the last feature of a three movie night at the local drive-in. Just turn off the sound, cuddle up, and have a real excuse for getting home late. The best the Left Elbow Index can give is a 3.14. Pass the popcorn.",

Quite simply, she brings home the bacon.\n\nThe reason the so-called occult mysticism is dropped early in the movie is explained quite clearly by the unfolding plot. There&apos;s a little celeb skin for those who go for that.\n\nJudd Nelson&apos;s character is a non-entity who feeds the cops information; although it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve seen an FBI priest in a movie. I suspect actor John Rhys-Davies has fallen on hard times; this is not up to the A-list movie roles he has landed so far. He looks like he has lost a lot of weight in recent years; his character was believable, though somewhat thinly-spread (no pun intended).\n\nIt&apos;s a murder mystery, a serial killer movie, and has an interesting twist at the end. If you&apos;re hoping for the next Sixth Sense, don&apos;t bother. But if you like solid made-for-cable cop movies, it&apos;s entertaining.",

Basically any army with this baby in its arsenal will have air superiority. Clint is assigned to steal it from the heart of Soviet territory for the USA.\n\nThe plot is fairly generic and in this day and age most Cold War thrillers have seem to have lost much of their edge, but this is nonetheless an entertaining film from Eastwood. It is not one of his best and not one that he will be remembered for, but no one can deny the slickness of the plane of the title. The final section of the film, which admittedly does take a while to get to, has Clint flying around and raising hell is a fun ride and on par with the final chase in &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; in terms of entertainment. However, the buildup has enough suspense to make the whole movie worth a watch. 7/10\n\nRated PG: violence",

There is a possibility that this would even replace my all-time top favorite, Loha.\n\nI came to watch this movie after another of Karan Razdan&apos;s masterpieces, Ei8ht: Shani (Surrender to the power of Shani). That is also a great movie, but this is way better. Extremely bad (over)acting, ridiculously idiotic dialog delivery, poor script!! Wow! So bad that it is good. No, it is great.\n\nPS. OK, I am done watching it. I loved the acting part the most. Meghna Naidu&apos;s acting is excellent; one loves the stop-animated way in which her emotion changes: She talks, waits for a few seconds and then suddenly outbursts if she needs to change into another mood, be it happiness, sadness, coyness, excitement or whatever. She has only two facial expressions: one is smiling, and the second is squeezing her face. Needless to say, it is a fact that Karan Razdan did not make her a heroine for her acting capabilities, but rather for her bodily assets, which he then somehow does not fully utilize. The other two central characters also have only one expression each: the husband has the expression of a robotic assassin sent from the future, and the lover is perpetually euphoric and carefree, probably a result of excessive and habitual intake of fine grade cocaine.\n\nWatch it. Highly recommended.\n\n10 out of 10.",

Despite the fact that even as a child the dragon (who used to remind me of &quot;the secret weapon&quot; from An American Tale) looked terrible, it was one of my favorite movies for years. If anyone can find a copy of this movie, I suggest you watch it. Also, the synthesized soundtrack is quite good (arpeggios reminiscent of Philip Glass or something)."

About Adam was too &quot;Woody Allen-ish&quot; for most of the UK viewers. In fact, some of the US viewers did not get the ending at all.\n\nThe Korean title was a bit obvious but it helped the viewers understand the ending better. Together with some of Korea&apos;s famous actors/actresses, the film was a sure hit.\n\nWhat I really loved about the two films is that lead actresses apparently sang in each version."

In our world of HD, the film definitely looks dated, and doesn&apos;t do full justice to Warhol&apos;s art. However I do recommend it as a solid introduction to Warhol&apos;s contribution to the art world.",

      "reviewBody": "When we consider many of the novel adaptations made at Ufa in the 1930s when, actually, the Nazi propaganda saw its heyday, it is hard to capture the traces of their literary sources. Considerable exaggeration in fear of any immorality explicitly displayed resulted in altered, distorted content. And that travesty seems to be very noticeable in Carl Froehlich&apos;s movie the title of which, HEIMAT (Homeland), is one of these titles that could be labeled: misleading and meaningful alike.\n\nFrom the very start, with the credits, we are led to the atmosphere of the times and Zarah Leander, the close up of the face of studio queen, a sort of &quot;the Garbo of the Ufa Studio.&quot; Soon we hear her singing &quot;Drei Sternen&quot; (three stars) with her deep voice, something that carried so much charm and magic at the time that even the propaganda leaders could not resist it. Most of that charm, however, has not stood a test of time and, after all these years, we are led to capture just the glimpse of who this woman was and what she managed to evoke in her roles in a short career span.\n\nIn HEIMAT, the movie made by the director the legendary actress most collaborated with, she handles the portrayal of a woman who leads us all to a conclusion that is not so widespread these days: success and career do not necessarily go with inner peace and happiness. Maddalena becomes the sole master of herself, a personality whose life blends art and reality, blissful illusion and bitter consequences that life sets forth. Comedy blends with drama (something very realistic). This aspect of both femme fatale and a woman being emancipated is echoed in many of her later films, particularly, DER WEG INS FREIE where an artist copes with the unexpected &apos;surprises&apos; that conventions and gray everyday offer. All the aura, so to say, around her evokes and intensifies these feelings quite convincingly in spite of highly dated acting style. \n\nThe first aspect in that &apos;aura&apos; is the place where the action is set - a small German town in 1885 where the prefabricated conventions take over all feelings of genuine self. She comes to her hometown as a very famous opera singer, as Maddalena dall&apos;Orto and is going to sing something meaningful, something that may at least call our attention to her inner torments, Bach&apos;s PASSION ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW. But, as it usually happens in such pretentious movies, art occurs to disguise the past. How will she deal with the bitter secret she carries in her heart and is yet to be revealed in the most unpredictable circumstances? The secret of the life in Berlin and one Bankdirektor von Keller (Franz Schaftheitlin)...\n\nAnother aspect in that aura are the visuals. Everything seems to evoke her mental and psychological states. Thanks to heavy influence of the German Expressionism&apos;s tradition and some elements of Stanislavskian method, the viewer is memorably led to the world of changeable moods that the protagonist goes through. In one of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie, Maddalena enters a Gothic church where the shadows, the organ music, the architecture that in a racket like fashion seems to take a &apos;mental and visual&apos; flight, the aesthetic mannerism and extreme emotions subvert our senses. In another scene, she enters her home after 8 years and touches the objects clearly evoking the emotional ties to the things and memories. Mind you the wonderful use of ostentatious, elaborate sets with the dazzling close-ups of Ms Leander&apos;s face.\n\nFinally, a significant aspect is her singing which contributes highly to the merits of the movie supplying it with desirable resonance of the drama. She sings like Ms Dietrich as far as magnetism is concerned and unlike Ms Dietrich when we consider dramatizing. Meanwhile, her songs provide us with a unique artistic experience. The song about three stars as well as the more &apos;emancipated&apos; song &apos;Die Liebe&apos; (Love) work on a creative level of communication even with the viewers of today. Note, for instance, the moment she sings at the harp or the musical and emotional crescendo of the finale.\n\nBut after seeing the film, I had such a feeling that it would be a great exaggeration to say that this is purely a Zarah Leander movie, that it is worthwhile seeing merely thanks to her. As a matter of fact, she may occur too dramatic, too pretentious in her style to many people among modern audiences. Such a portrayal of a woman, an artist and a mother seems to occur one of the reasons why the film may be considered dated. There is, however, one performance that will actually never allow us to analyze it as old fashioned and barely convincing. It is Heinrich George&apos;s portrayal of the father. The actor who was highly underrated in his time achieves something special. His role is not an easy one, he depicts a man deep in his own world-view, an authoritative but affectionate parent (he has his own premonitions - consider his memorable line he utters to his daughter &quot;You have retained a good heart but there is something in your eyes I don&apos;t like&quot;). He is a loyal citizen but, above all, a humorous fellow. Drama and comedy find best balance in him. This role recalls heavily his portrayal in DER POSTMEISTER where he did not play with Ms Leander but Hilde Krahl. \n\nThat is why I consider HEIMAT a great Zarah Leander and Heinrich George&apos;s achievement. Highly worth seeking out.",

I thought that Robert Wagner(Mike Banning),&quot;Hart to Hart&quot;,TV series&apos;79 showed his great acting skills and his charming ways as a golfer who was playing the role with his game of golf and acted like a real LADIES MAN! with all the wives and charming available hot looking women. Jill St. John,(Angela Barr),&quot;Tony Rome&quot;,67,put on the charm for Mike Banning and was pretty hot even in 1967! Gene Hackman(Tommy Del Gaddo)&quot;The Split&quot;,&apos;68 was thin young and just starting out and from his performance, you just knew he would be a super star as he is today! I also enjoyed the great musical theme song that was played through out the picture, which was written by a great musician and composer,&quot;QUINCY JONES&quot;. If you can catch this movie on TV, it is worth watching, and especially if you like the game of GOLF and all the things that GO ON, in the CLUB HOUSE!",

      "reviewBody": "This Rappresaglia(1973) deals with he Ardeatine massacre, or Fosse Ardeatine massacre (Italian: Eccidio delle Fosse Ardeatine), it was a mass killing of 335 civilians and political prisoners carried out in Rome on 24 March 1944 by German occupation troops during the Second World War as a reprisal for the Via Rasella attack in central Rome against the SS Police Regiment Bozen the previous day. The story of a resistance action that provoked a 10-for-one reprisal on the part of the nazis . A partisan attack takes place at a Roman street , and following the attack by the partisan group Lt. Col. Herbert Kappler (Richard Burton) is assigned by Hitler himself to carry out a relentless vengeance , but a kind priest (Marcello Mastroianni) opposing this criminal revenge . A savage act of reprisal - who was to blame? Hitler ordered it. The Vatican wouldn&apos;t stop it. The world will never forgive it. Who Wouldn&apos;t Stop It? 330 Cold Blooded Executions! It happened once...it could happen again! How Many? .\n\nThe picture is a little heavy and overlong , but it does have its moments of truth , particularly towards the final . Interpretations are uniformly decent , as Richard Burton as the Nazi commander officer who must execute hundreds of Roman citizens in retaliation for the death of Nazi soldiers and Marcello Mastroianni as the priest opposing the Nazi colonel and attempting to prevent the massacre . Support cast resulting to be pretty good with notorious British and Italian actors , such as : Leo Mckern overacting as the senior Nazi officer, former Brit matinee idol Anthony Steel in a minor character , John Steiner , Robert Harris , Peter Vaughn , Anthony Dawson , and Latin actors as Renzo Montagnani , Giancarlo Prete or Timothy Brent , Renzo Palmer , Duilio Del Prete , Marino Masé and Delia Boccardo. The motion picture was professionally directed by George Pan Cosmatos . He was a craftsman director who got a great success with ¨Tombstone¨and ¨Cassandra crossing¨ and flops as ¨Shadow conspiracy¨, ¨Leviatahan¨, ¨Escape to Athena¨ . ¨Massacre in Rome¨ rating : 6/10 . This wartime will appeal to WWII enthusiasts and Richard Burton/Marcelo Mastroianni fans.",

      "description": "MASSACRE IN ROME depicts one of the worst atrocities of the War which took place in Nazi occupied Rome sparking a searing political outrage: did the Vatican, then led by Pope Pius XII  (referred to by some as Â“Hitler&apos;s PopeÂ”), kowtow to Nazism? \r\n\r\nAfter Italian Partisans killed 33 German soldiers by exploding a roadside bomb, Hitler ordered the immediate execution of 10 Roman citizens for each dead soldier. When the Vatican withdrew from the matter, a deadly confrontation ensued between a priest, (Mastroianni) and a Nazi Officer Kappler (Burton at his best) who had been ordered to administer what would become one of the most heinous war crimes: the massacre of 335 civilians.\r\n\r\nDirector Cosmatos and writer Robert Katz crank up the tension in this nerve-wracking dramatisation of KatzÂ’s own, highly contentious, 1967 best-seller Â“Death in RomeÂ” in which he blamed Pope Pius XII for the massacre; and for which the author was sued, upon the filmÂ’s release, by the PopeÂ’s heirs and sentenced to jail. The controversy continues to date as the present Pope, Benedict, has just declared Pius XII Â“venerableÂ” - the first step towards Sainthood.\r\n\r\nArgent Films presents THE MOST COMPLETE EVER VERSION, NOW 4 MIN LONGER, RESTORED TO ITS SUMPTUOUS ORIGINAL WIDESCREEN FORMAT.",

      "reviewBody": "Wittgenstein once observed, &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent&quot;. It should follow on from this wearied maxim that all true art is destined to be personal. Such a truth is evident when watching Guy Maddin&apos;s &quot;My Winnipeg&quot;. Apparently inspired by the film he shot of Isabella Rossellini remembering her father, &quot;My Dad Is 100 Years Old&quot; (2005) (a documentary of memories - a hyper-documentary? - rather than realities), with &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; Maddin cine-alchemically recreates the patchwork quilt of his life and history of his city, indelibly stained with Winnipegian fluids and woven with Manitoban heart-fibres.\n\nInfluences become clear as never before, Maddin&apos;s ambisexuality is on display (1995s Sissy Slap Boy Party now makes sense), &quot;La Roue&quot; (1923/Abel Gance) is revealed as his cinematic touchstone (following on from the quotation in &quot;Odilon Redon - or The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity&quot;, also 1995). The movie is almost like a coming out, a cry of freedom, a love letter to all he holds dear, ice hockey, Winnipeg, silent cinema, sexuality, proletarian utopias, family memories. It reminded me of the words of a Portugese man on TV when describing the Carnation Revolution of 1974, where armed forces were conquered by ordinary people wielding carnations, he called it a &quot;giant national orgasm&quot;. &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; is Guy Maddin&apos;s heart nailed to the screen, as fiercely courageous a movie as you will ever see.\n\nThere are blue truths in the film, we&apos;re not spared his mother&apos;s genitalia or fever dreams of childhood sexuality. Here are some quotations from interviews Maddin gave for this film just so you know what you will be seeing: \n\n&quot;Children are sexual beings, just think of your own childhood. In my case, I was far more sexual as a child than I am now&quot; \n\n&quot;Nothing bothers me more than a movie about the innocence of children! What are they innocent of? They might be innocent of murder, but that&apos;s about it! Children haven&apos;t learned to repress yet or anything like that. They&apos;re just teeming with wonderful luridity, from very early on!&quot; \n\nThere is something universal about the film, Maddin incants a litany of opprobrium and indignity that the city of Winnipeg has suffered, from the demolition of an iconic department store, to the closure of two underground swimming pools and the hockey stadia. Modern history is written in the rictus of the agonised city exposed to modernity. Many cities have undergone such outrages, my own city lost it&apos;s old centre to Nazi bombing, a fragile heart torn out. \n\nThe swimming pools of Maddin&apos;s memories are lustful pits, at street level families swim, down one tier the girl&apos;s practice mouth to mouth resuscitation on one another, and on the bottom level the boys cavort naked in the changing rooms.\n\nThe film transcends documentary, even fantastical documentary into mysticism. Maddin uses the imagery of horses, as have many great artists from Raphael, to Gericault, to Marc, to Parajanov. We see Golden Boy parades, a Masonic town hall, and the two forks under the forks, the mysterious underground rivers that feed the mons veneris on which Winnipeg nestles.\n\nMy personal favourite scene was Lorette Avenue where we are show a &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; street where on one side the street has houses facing front, and on the other side the backs of houses. No-one talks about Lorette Avenue (Previously Maddin had made distinctions between alleys where the backs of houses only can be scene, and streets where we only see the fronts of houses).\n\nI won&apos;t spoil the ending for you, you have yet to see the wonder of Citizen Girl! Do not waver or hesitate, make ye to the cinema! Maddin has now taken the step from being a beloved cult director, to being a great auteur. Vive le Cinema! Vive la Résistance Culturelle!",

Most of the dialog is unintelligible.  Much of the action consists of running back and forth in the woods, Benny Hill style.  The &quot;actors&quot; spend a lot of time sitting on sofas reading cue cards.  This may have been an attempt at the kind of &quot;indie&quot; or &quot;underground&quot; look that &quot;Troma&quot; sometimes achieves, but it failed.  And it&apos;s not bad in an interesting way (e.g. _Plan 9 from Outer Space_), it&apos;s just amateurish and dull.  Don&apos;t waste your time.  You have been warned."

One fine day while their bosses, Walter Pidgeon, Yvette Mimieux, and Ernest Borgnine are up top, an earthquake occurs and the lab topples over into an underwater crevice.\n\nThough an atomic power submarine could stay down there indefinitely the problem is that crevice is way too small for one of those big boys. A smaller type submarine able to withstand the pressures of the very deep is needed and that&apos;s where Ben Gazzara and his ship the Neptune come in.\n\nAs disaster films go The Neptune Factor is small potatoes special effects wise. It&apos;s a Canadian production and I&apos;ve seen Hollywood come up with worse films spending a ton more money than was done here.\n\nThe special effects such as they are, are merely movie films of some ordinary species of marine life blown up several times their size, because these are the creatures the crew finds down at depths that man hasn&apos;t been before. It&apos;s beautiful undersea photography just like a trip to Marineland.\n\nIt&apos;s a no frills production, no subplots of any kind, no social interaction of any kind with the crew, just do the mission and go home. That&apos;s why it was given a G rating when first released.\n\nIf you love Jacques Cousteau, you&apos;ll love this film.",

(3 outta 5 stars) Actually, the movie was re-titled &quot;Roboman&quot; for its video release (let me guess... some time after &quot;Robocop&quot; came out?) and has some trashy cover art making it look some kind of killer-robot-on-the-loose kind of movie... which this most definitely is not! It&apos;s actually a very interesting suspense film/character study... kind of philosophical and very low-key. Elliot Gould stars in one of his finest roles... as a US agent who has to decide whether an important American scientist returning from a Soviet country is, in fact, who he claims to be. A nasty car accident on foreign soil almost killed Dr. Lucas Martino (Joseph Bova). Russian scientists saved his life by placing him in a newly-developed robotic body... but he is hardly recognizable as human anymore... so there is some questions as to whether he really IS Dr. Martino... or a Soviet agent pretending to be him to gain access to an important defense project. The entire movie deals with Gould&apos;s quest for the truth... and a very interesting story it is, too. The ending is particularly interesting... cross-cutting a final meeting between Gould and Martino with flashbacks to the medical procedure. Is Martino really Martino? And does it really matter? You won&apos;t know until the final, fascinating moments.",

I was smooth talked by Justin Mark&apos;s assurance that his treatment of the movie was respectful and to be prepared for a new era of gaming films. I was pumped and on board, and then... I saw the film. THE GOD-AWFUL The script from this movie was a joke. When Bison utters something about milk and expiry dates, I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, but it was laughter. This movie makes no sense to me at all. The pitch was it was a Chun Li story about looking beyond revenge. In the end, she gets her revenge and the moral is? Revenge is the answer. THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it. I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene, wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles ( primo top dollar dancing to the unaware) to lure Cantana, a lesbian associate of Bison, into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful, and we are hand-held for every scene, if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us &quot;I was walking..&quot; ... REALLY? Really. THE UGLY The truth is this movie insults movie goers, gamers, and people, in general. Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother? How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega&apos;s threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly, whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat. It just makes no sense to me how the editor could do his job, watch the movie and allow this to enter the theaters. The best parts of the movie involved subtitles, and a sunset. That is it. So there you go, street fighter 2? Most assuredly, not.",

      "reviewBody": "I hadn&apos;t read or heard much about Goon before I went to see it; all I&apos;d seen was the trailer. I didn&apos;t even realise that it was based on a true story. I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be that good, but was pleasantly surprised. \n\nI was expecting that the funny bits in the trailer were all that would be on offer but the whole film was seeped in that simple (albeit sometimes unnerving) comedy that had the audience laughing out loud often. \n\nFurthermore, beneath the usual humour we&apos;ve come to expect from Goldberg, there is a much deeper underlying story to it. It was even endearing in parts. OK so &apos;endearing&apos; isn&apos;t the best word to describe a comedy sports film that has as much gore as it has humour, but the way that Seann William Scott portrays Doug really did something of touching my heart, and it was refreshing to see Scott play the role.\n\nGranted it may not clean up at the Oscars, but the story of a guy who really has no idea where he belongs is both hilariously and sweetly told in Goon, with a great relationship conveyed between Doug and his friend - excellently played by Baruchel - who seems to be the only one who believes in him.\n\nTeamed (no pun intended) with the banter generated with the game of hockey and Doug&apos;s fellow players, this really makes for a must-see for any sports film fan, or comedy film fan, or indie film fan. There&apos;s a love story in there too for the romance fans. Which could potentially give Goon a pretty huge audience. If people ignore the trailer, that is.\n\nYes the whole story is slightly clichéd, but this film does so much more than the trailer gives it credit for, and deserves the word to be spread that this really is worth a watch.",

The whole family saw it at the Dyker Theater in Brooklyn, and we just about fell out of the balcony from laughing so hard! Nobody does the culture clash between Italian-Americans and the rest of the US of A better than Joe Bologna and Renee Taylor. \n\nAlthough some of the humor is a bit dated, most of the gags hold up very well. The interplay between all of the various Vecchio family members is timeless. The whole rap about &quot;they&apos;re STILL together&quot; is classic! \n\nWhile Gig Young is spot on as the philandering father of the bride, the best repartee is by and between Bea Arthur and Richard S Castellano. Joseph Hindy is a stalwart foil for Castellano. Bob Dishy, Ann Meara and Harry Guardino have memorable character turns to flesh out a top-shelf ensemble. \n\nThe characterization of a working-class Italian-American family is perfect. When Mama Vecchio uses &quot;Have some more soup, Frank&quot; as the double -edged sword of nourishing her family while attempting to steer away from conflict, I could almost hear my Nonna (grandmother). She used soup to solve all the world&apos;s problems one bowl ata a time, too! My Mom still thinks that this is one of the funniest pictures she ever saw. I concur.",

      "reviewBody": "The film that did a large amount of damage to Michael Powell&apos;s film career remains as a prime example of an intellectual British horror film.  It has certainly retained the power to shock over four decades later, and leaves the viewer with more questions than have been answered during the fairly short running time.\n\nCarl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, a focus puller at a film studio who feeds his voyeuristic tendencies by filming people everyone he goes.  This preoccupation takes a disturbing twist in his need to kill, and film women as he kills them.  So far, so unsavoury.  Mark appears on the surface as a personable young man who just has this dangerous, psychotic tendency he can&apos;t always keep in check.  The audience is thus invited to have some sympathy with him, especially after the discovery that the young Mark was the focus for his father&apos;s experiments on the nature of fear in children (show in part as the film within the film featuring Michael Powell and his son Columba), and was filmed and recorded for the whole of his young life. No wonder, the film is saying, that he has grown into this disturbed person who has no real life away from either recording things on a camera, or watching the results in his darkened room.\n\nAnna Massey has perhaps the prime female role in the film, as Mark&apos;s downstairs neighbour Helen Stephens.  She is both repelled and attracted by Mark&apos;s movie-making, and perhaps she is closer to him that she would herself admit.  It is a restrained performance of considerable power.  Moira Shearer has a brief appearance as the studio stand-in who becomes his victim, while Shirley Anne Field provides light relief as the film actress who can never get her lines right and doesn&apos;t know how to faint on camera.\n\nPeeping Tom&apos; is a clever piece of work which perhaps came too soon to be acceptable to the establishment.  After all, during Powell&apos;s collaborations with Emeric Pressburger, they often pushed their luck with their subject matter and the way they presented it.  This film was the natural progression of that anarchistic spirit.  It is humorous in places  Mark is not presented as a one-dimensional monster  while being a very dark and disturbing psychological thriller throughout."

I&apos;d really only recommend it to big fans of the first two.  There are some good bits of humor and we see some actual romance between Wong Fei-Hung and Aunt 13, but I don&apos;t think that that sort of thing is the main reason we watch this sort of movie.  And even if it were, there&apos;s just too little of it.  \n\nI really think that Jet Li&apos;s talents are wasted when you try to use goofy camera angles to make it look like he&apos;s doing superhuman feats.  The man is practically superhuman already.  I think you&apos;re better off showing off the amazing things that he can do rather than focusing on trying to make him look like a cartoon.  I&apos;m sure that his work in the movie was very demanding, but it just didn&apos;t come off as too impressive on the screen in my opinion.  \n\nAnd way too much lion dancing.",

      "reviewBody": "...with shades of Moby Dick thrown in. Wild Bill Hickok has nightmares about a giant white buffalo (a foreshadowing of his own death?) which he feels can only be eliminated by hunting down a giant white buffalo that is striking terror in the Black Hills. Will Sampson plays Crazy Horse, also seeking the same creature after it rampaged through his village and killed his child.\n\nIt&apos;s all pure fiction, of course, and Charles Bronson&apos;s casting as Hickok is laughable, historically speaking, but, I suppose, no more so than that of half a dozen other actors over the years being cast as Hickcok. One historically accurate aspect of the film is that, rather than wearing a holster, Bronson wears a scarlet sash around his waist in which he tucks his guns, as did the real Hickok at times.\n\nThe performances are quite good, and there is a colorful supporting cast of familiar faces including Jack Warden in a sizable role as a one eyed Indian-hating frontiersman who goes on the buffalo hunt with Bronson as well as smaller guest star appearances by Kim Novak, Clint Walker, John Carradine, Stuart Whitman and Cara Williams. J. Lee Thompson (Guns of Navarone, Cape Fear, Mackenna&apos;s Gold) was the director.\n\nThe white buffalo is presented as an almost legendary larger than life destructive force, not unlike a lumbering four legged version of Melville&apos;s great white whale, one that causes rocks to tumble down the sides of mountains when it lets out a giant bellow and can charge though walls of ice and snow. At one point, in fact, in a direct parallel to Herman Melville&apos;s tale, Crazy Horse will leap on the animal&apos;s back to repeatedly stab it with a spear.\n\nThe problem for the film, though, are in those pivotal scenes involving the buffalo in which, unfortunately, the creature looks exactly like what it undoubtedly was, some kind of animatronic construction, lacking any sense of reality. It&apos;s far more effective when he frighteningly bellows in the mountains than when we actually see him. No amount of fast editing can hide the artificiality of those scenes with the buffalo. The poster advertising the film said &quot;You Won&apos;t Believe Your Eyes.&quot; That&apos;s true, but, unfortunately, not in a good way.",

The film seems to consist mostly of the characters calling each other&apos;s names out loud and the ghost constantly grabbing people and letting them go like a Scooby Doo cartoon....It&apos;s as if they made up the script as they went along...\n\nThe film is never quite sure what kind of film it wants to be....There aren&apos;t enough scares to make it a &quot;scary movie&quot; (the ghost, a ripoff of Sadako from &quot;RINGU&quot; just keeps popping up again and again...and again and again...). The characters aren&apos;t funny or particularly interesting enough to make it an engaging comedy or drama.\n\nAll in all, it&apos;s a boring film.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; with Humphrey Bogart is famous for being more about the parts themselves than the sum. Valhalla rising in my opinion is very similar. The cinematography and the sound editing trump all the other aspects of the film. It does indeed deal heavily in ambiguous symbolism and I am sure one could draw parallels with a number of sources. The story is really not as complicated as has been made out on these message boards. There is no clear answer to this film but at the same time you will not feel robbed by the this, there is a definite beginning, middle and end. It&apos;s best just to sit back and enjoy the menace that permeates the entire film, even having known the ending from some careless commentator I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching this. I would not however have enjoyed 3 hours of it, but it is only 90 minutes long so is perfect. The violence is really not that bad, there are so many worse films for this...&apos;irreversible, brave-heart and any gore porn movie doing the rounds.&apos; Go see this film, enjoy for it&apos;s stunningly visuals, startling audio and general intensity. Oh, and I did not enjoy his previous film &apos;Bronson&apos; art house British movies just look horrible, this is beautiful. Similar to the thin red line but not as long and tedious."

      "reviewBody": "Mark Twain&apos;s immortal TOM SAWYER flirts with Becky Thatcher, goes rafting with Huckleberry Finn on the Mississippi River &amp; generally makes life a sore tribulation for the law-abiding citizens of St. Petersburg, Missouri.\n\nProduced only seven years after the death of Mark Twain, this rousing, action packed silent film remains faithful to the original classic novel. The fine production values lavished upon it give it the feel of an old photo album. Many of the favorite episodes from the first half of the book are included and filmed with much charm.\n\nJack Pickford gives a hardy, robust portrayal of Tom, the eternal companion of millions of American boys. Although a bit tall &amp; old (he was 21) to be an authentic portrait of the real Tom, he comes close enough. Tattered, begrimed Robert Gordon as Huckleberry Finn also scores in his small role.\n\nThe film concludes with the boys interrupting their own funeral, after being assumed drowned while river rafting. Director William Desmond Taylor decided to film the rest of the book and release it as a sequel, which he did the following year as HUCK AND TOM (1918). Four years later, in 1922, Taylor&apos;s still unsolved murder would give Hollywood one of its most sensational scandals.\n\nAlmost forgotten today, Jack Pickford, Mary&apos;s younger brother, was a movie star in his own right, appearing in 106 films between 1909 &amp; 1928. Lacking his sister&apos;s intense dedication &amp; drive, he gave his life over to riotous living - to the detriment of his career. Personal tragedy &amp; dissipation would haunt him until his death in 1933 at the age of 36.",

      "reviewBody": "For the concerted effort Sienna Miller puts into her searing portrayal of Warhol protégé and underground celebrity Edie Sedgwick, it would have been rewarding to experience a film that matches her unbridled dramatic impact. Unfortunately, director George Hickenlooper, primarily a documentary filmmaker, seems more focused on eye-catching cinematic techniques - a deliberately artsy mix of overtly dramatic images, grainy film stock and slow-motion photography - than honest character development in this highly fictionalized 2007 account of her brief life. The result feels energetic but ultimately rather cursory in the way he depicts the Manhattan party scene in the mid-1960&apos;s, in particular, the Factory, where Warhol let his coterie of drug-addicted fame-seekers gather to make virtually unwatchable films that reflect their constant state of ennui.\n\nWith her big raccoon eyes, pre-punk hairdo and flashing smile, Miller bears such a striking resemblance to the real-life Sedgwick that she carries much of the film by the sheer will of her character&apos;s Holly Golightly-like sense of exalted self-worth. But like Holly, Sedgwick lacked talent to sustain a film career, and the script leaves Miller to her own devices in connecting us with her character&apos;s tormented psyche amid her escalating drug use. On the upside, Guy Pearce accurately captures the discomfiting public image of Warhol down to the familiar narcissistic indifference and manipulative shyness, but his character gradually recedes into the background. At first, Hayden Christensen comes across as amateurish and unintentionally amusing as a Bob Dylan doppelganger, especially since he makes a feeble attempt at capturing the singer&apos;s recognizable speech cadences. Just as he manages to transcend the awkwardness of the character&apos;s intrusion into the story, he also disappears making his impact in Sedgwick&apos;s life feel rather fleeting.\n\nEven though the cryptic screenplay by Captain Mauzner, Aaron Richard Golub and Simon Monjack conveniently paints Warhol and the faux-Dylan as polarizing figures pulling at Sedgwick&apos;s soul, the story really comes down to her own inner demons. The problem is that she remains oddly elliptical throughout, and Hickenlooper seems satisfied with leaving us with an impressionistic view of a person who barely warrants our attention forty years later. Among the supporting players, there are quite a familiar faces - Ileana Douglas as Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, Jimmy Fallon as Sedgwick&apos;s confidante Chuck Wein, Tara Summers as fellow Warhol protégé Brigid Berlin, Mena Suvari as Brigid&apos;s sister Richie, Edward Herrmann as the family attorney, Mary Kate Olsen as a partygoer. However, none of them are given any opportunity to shine.",

Anna Magnani&apos;s corrosive performance absolutely dominates this film, which works well in black &amp; white (the overheated emotions seem to leap out of the b&amp;w more starkly than they would out of color); you can&apos;t take your eyes off her - it&apos;s like watching a train wreck. She makes this insecure, emotionally frightened, self-deluded, yet domineering woman a sympathetic figure in the end. Burt Lancaster is a bit over the top, but the role calls for it. A fascinating aspect is the parallel development of the daughter&apos;s budding sexuality with the release of her mother&apos;s long-suppressed yearnings. Those fascinated by Magnani here should catch her working with Anthony Quinn in &quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot;, made just four years before her death. Once again, thank you American Movie Classics for bringing us this fine film.",

      "reviewBody": "A very knowledgeable online acquaintance recommended this film two years ago. A friend immediately watched it and has been, for the past two years, trying to convince me to watch it, as well.\n\nReceiving a seal of enthusiastic approval from two opinions I value and trust, it&apos;s something of an enigma as to why I&apos;ve been so hesitant to watch the film. Especially when one considers my love for surrealism and general weirdness. Considering some of the films I&apos;ve seen in the past two years and in doing so put ahead in priority over Kingdom (Hostel? Intolerable Cruelty?), it&apos;s downright disgusting of me. But I&apos;ve looked at myself in the mirror, as Grandma asks at the end of this precious Russian gem, and decided to break my bad habits.\n\nI loved this film. As soon as it was over {unfortunately after only around 70 minutes} I excitedly started this article and was ready to learn about the film. Unfortunately, things don&apos;t always go the way you&apos;d like.\n\nThere is sadly little discussion or evaluation of this strange Russian family film on the internet and the DVD itself offers only one special feature of note: a 5 minute talk by an actor in the film (Andrei Stapran) who spends 4 minutes bragging about the films he himself made {none of which are on IMDb, unfortunately} and the other minute making general statements like &quot;Aleksandr Rou was a marvelous director!&quot; No kidding.\n\nSo I&apos;m alone on this one and, as a freshmen in the high school of serious film consideration and criticism, I can only offer small observations of a questionable nature. But even Ebert has had to retract statements he made about films in his foolish youth. Such is life, they say.\n\nKingdom of Crooked Mirrors bears unavoidable similarities to Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland; a little girl suddenly finds herself in a strange world with ruthless royalty who aren&apos;t shy when it comes to executions. There&apos;s also a cat, but it functions more like Alice&apos;s cat Dinah than the Cheshire Cat.\n\nAnd though it may be due to the fact I saw a theatre screening of it just two days before watching this, Kingdom also seems to bear resemblance to Victor Fleming&apos;s The Wizard of Oz. While Kingdom lacks the production values of Hollywood&apos;s masterpiece of surreal family entertainment, it&apos;s as creative in concepts and the limitations in set and costume design only stamp it with the strange and unexplainable vibes I get when watching the films of Jan Svankmajer, as well as my only experience with Jaromil Jires {Valerie and Her Week of Wonderswhich is likely the kind of film that children raised on this will turn to when they are adults.} Interestingly, watching the film today, even the most politically apathetic persons {like myself} can&apos;t help but notice how much it functions like a criticism of the fella in charge. Well, you be the judge: the king in the kingdom of crooked mirrors is incredibly stupid and everyone in the kingdom knows it. He&apos;s also not really in charge  he does what the rich citizens of the kingdom tell him to do. Yeah.\n\nThat is one of the reasons I was excited in researching this film; to uncover some knowledge of the Russian leadership at the time; a figure who, I had to assume, was like the George W. Bush of his time  being the butt of a seemingly never-ending line of jokes about his intellectual shortcomings by the Jay Lenos and Saturday Night Lives of the time.\n\nUnfortunately, I uncovered nothing. Perhaps it is all the better. I&apos;ve never been impressed by Bush jokes (presidents are too easy a target for interchangeable jokes, be it about sex or stupidity). So to uncover that King Torrap {parrot spelled backwardsbecause this is a world of mirrors} is, in fact, a direct criticism of one person instead of a more universal questioning of anyone in charge or  what the hell  just an opportunity to have a farcical character with a parrot-esquire beak for a nose would have only let me down, ultimately.\n\nI should also point out his cowering when facing mean-faced people he fears reminded me of the king of Wonderland in the Disney production, who seems terrified of his wife, who indeed wears the pants in that kingdom.\n\nBut to get to a more typical plot breakdown of the film (finally, you say), a little girl named Olya returning from peaking into a film which children under 16 are not allowed to see comes home to her grandma, realizing she has lost the key to their flat. The grandma scorns her carelessness and sets out to fetch her a replacement key. Meanwhile, Olya breaks into the jam cabinet and splits a jar with her cat while her overlooking parrot threatens to tell on her unless she shares the goods  which she does not do.\n\nWhen she accidentally drops the jar, the mirror in her house begins to talk to her (perhaps this was grandma&apos;s special jar of jam with a few extra ingredients), and she follows her cat into the mirror where she meets her reflection Aylo.\n\nFrom there, the two embark on a strange journey after witnessing a youth being sent to the aptly named Death Tower for rebelling and making straight mirrors so that people can see the truth instead of being fooled into believing the lies of the crooked mirrors he has been enslaved to make (which make the old look young and vice versa).\n\nThey encounter several strange characters with names like Daot (toad spelled backwards; the character himself looks like a toad) and so on as they attempt to free their friend (named Dneirf, of course!) As Watson Pritchard at Something Weird Video put it, this film &quot;at times (resembles) a live-action cartoon from hell.&quot; That simple statement couldn&apos;t be truer.",

      "reviewBody": "For James Cagney&apos;s second costume picture and first in a 19th century setting, Warner Brothers took him to San Francisco&apos;s Barbary Coast for the Frisco Kid. Cagney&apos;s first costume role was in the all star production of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. Unfortunately in production values it was lost in the acclaim for the more expensive Sam Goldwyn production The Barbary Coast. Personally though I think this film is better.\n\nCagney is fresh off a sealing ship in for his first visit to San Francisco and nearly gets shanghaied for another long voyage. Kindly Jewish tailor George E. Stone rescues him and when Cagney kills Fred Kohler, the man who is in charge of the San Francisco shanghai racket, in a bar room brawl he gains a certain celebrity status.\n\nBut no matter how far he rises in power on the Barbary Coast, Cagney can&apos;t get the woman of his dreams, society gal Margaret Lindsay. And the battle lines are getting drawn in San Francisco, isolated as it is from the rest of America pre-occupied with slavery and the Civil War.\n\nDirector Lloyd Bacon had a sure feel for the mood and look of Gold Rush San Francisco. Besides those mentioned, you&apos;ll see some good performances from Donald Woods, Lili Damita, Barton MacLane, and most of all Ricardo Cortez. His death scene and attitude towards the vigilante mob is may be the highlight of the film.\n\nWarner Brothers more than most of the other major studios liked to recycle plots and situations. I think if one watches Frisco Kid, one will see elements of The Oklahoma Kid and The Roaring Twenties.\n\nAnd those are two pretty good Cagney films also.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cohen and Tate&quot; is a reasonably entertaining road movie of the dramatic kind: mismatched mafia hit men Cohen (Roy Scheider) and Tate (Adam Baldwin) carry out an assignment to kidnap young Travis (Harley Cross of &quot;The Believers&quot;), gunning down his parents and the FBI agents watching over them. Travis had witnessed a mob rubout and now the employers of Cohen and Tate want to know everything that the kid knows before taking *him* out. The problem is, nothing goes smooth because of the two opposing personalities in play here. Cohen is the Older and Wiser type, very weary at having to put up with a hothead punk such as Tate, the kind of guy who enjoys violence way too much. Travis soon notices this and realizes that his best chances for survival lie in attempting to pit them against one another.\n\nEric Red, screenwriter of &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and &quot;Near Dark&quot;, made his feature length directing debut with this moderately interesting, very well paced little film, his version of the O. Henry story &quot;The Ransom at Red Chief&quot;. Most of the film takes place inside a car, so he proves up to the challenge of shooting in a claustrophobic environment and keeping the audience involved in what is happening. As Cohen and Tate spend more and more time with each other, things just get more and more grim and uneasy. Tate has shown his capacity for savagery, and his quick temper, and the increasingly more frustrated Cohen finds it harder and harder to maintain his self control. What is often truly disturbing is seeing guns repeatedly leveled at young Cross&apos; head. You really fear for this kids&apos; life.\n\nRight from the start, Red is ratcheting up the suspense, diving head first into the action. In an odd touch, he gets his back story out of the way *very* quickly with a brief expository text. Then things soon get ugly. Red does an excellent job of keeping his tone grim throughout. Much of the effectiveness, however, can be attributed to the acting. Baldwin is a live wire in his part, and young Cross delivers a sympathetic, mature performance, holding his own opposite his more experienced co-stars. Scheider is of course superb; he&apos;s as commanding as ever as the professional killer saddled with a loose cannon partner. Cooper Huckabee (&quot;The Funhouse&quot;) is good in his brief screen time as Travis&apos; father. Talents behind the camera include composer Bill Conti and cinematographer Victor J. Kemper.\n\n&quot;Cohen and Tate&quot; is good stuff and is worth seeking out or rediscovering for the cult movie aficionado.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

We heard what he felt and then felt what he felt. Secondly,he was the only singer I ever heard whose voice sounded like a trumpet. Perfect pitch, clear,crisp and resounding. Hence, we put together those two attributes, add his showmanship, charm and charisma and we end up with the greatest single entertainer in the history of American show business. Larry Parks is truly astounding and gives a performance, including perfect lip synching, that should have earned him the Oscar. Politics came first, apparently. \n\nThe film, even with its occasional flaws, was amazingly entertaining. From the first scene to when his Julie Benson walks out by realizing that she could have never taken the music out of Jolson and vice versa,the entire production was pure hypnotic joy. Unbeatable music, warmth, tenderness and humility run wild. A superb feast for the ears and eyes. A never-to-be-forgotten film.",

It was then that I started buying French records and mostly Brassens, but also Ferre, Brel etc. That scene where they climb the garden wall, I can still see that happening for my inner eye.

He believes his dreams can kill. A kind psychiatrist (Kathryn Harrold) tries to help him. Then his creepy mother (Shirley Knight) shows up insisting he be put in her care--but she keeps disappearing.\n\nThere&apos;s very little violence or blood and guts but it&apos;s very scary and suspenseful. The ending is (now) old hat but was pretty original when this film was released. Any movie that can scare you silly with a shot of a middle-aged mother walking to her son (see the movie to find out why it&apos;s scary) is one hell of a horror movie in my book! Add to that a beautiful music score and excellent performances by Knight and Ivanek (who has gone on to be a top character actor). The only debit is Harrold who&apos;s pretty terrible.

      "name": "A Subtle (but Fun) Parody of Traditional Western Movie Conventions",
      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t like the &quot;War Wagon&quot; when it was first released, I found it rather silly and vaguely offensive. The problem was me, I was not ready to recognize, let alone relate to, a subtle parody of the western genre. I should have been more receptive because in the mid-60s a huge amount of genre parody began to appear on television (&quot;Batman&quot;, &apos;Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;F- Troop&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;), which could be traced back to gently tongue-in-cheek series like &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Zorro&quot;. \n\n&quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965) was the first feature length parody of Western genre clichés. But its parody elements were obvious, even if you were not that familiar with the conventions of the Western genre you could recognize exaggerations and revisions. In addition, up to this point John Wayne films had given the Western genre only very traditional treatments.\n\nBut &quot;The War Wagon&quot; was only the first example of director Burt Kennedy&apos;s tweaking of the genre. He would follow it up with &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff&quot; (1969), &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; (1971), and &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter&quot; (1971). Wayne would toy with parodic elements two years later with &quot;True Grit&quot;, and would stay much less traditional with the remainder of his westerns. \n\n&quot;The War Wagon&quot; is also a genre hybrid as western is mixed with buddy picture and big heist movie. Taw (John Wayne) recruits an old enemy Lomax (Kirk Douglas) as he seeks revenge on a ruthless mine owner (Bruce Cabot) who not only framed and sent to him prison, but appropriated his ranch and personal possessions after a huge gold strike was discovered on ranch property (here we go with the exaggeration-the only things missing are stealing Taw&apos;s wife, adopting his children, and leaving his toilet seat up). Cabot transports his gold in a &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; inspired armored wagon.\n\nThe interplay between Wayne and Douglas (who always seems right on the verge of accepting Cabot&apos;s standing offer of $12,000 to kill Wayne) is clever and sarcastic, working with the many exaggerated elements to provide the film&apos;s considerable humor. \n\n&quot;The War Wagon&quot; finds Wayne on the wrong side of established authority, for at least the third time as his Ethan Edwards character in &quot;The Searchers&quot; also operated well outside the law and Quirt Evans in &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; had to be bad enough that he could be reformed by Gail Russell. \n\nHoward Keel plays the civilized Indian sidekick mostly for comic relief and the characters actually demonstrate an awareness of the movie context when they self-reflexively (deliberately drawing attention to their playing characters in a movie) refer to a tactic as an old Indian trick. Ultimately the joke (and the irony) is on Wayne and Douglas, as their seemingly one-sided deal with the Indians (a few blankets in exchange for their participation) causes the Indians to end up with most the rewards. \n\n&quot;The War Wagon&apos;s&quot; understated parody style would inspire John Huston (&quot;The Life &amp; Times Of Judge Roy Bean&quot;) and George Roy Hill (&quot;The Sting&quot;); and of course many others. \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

      "name": "Surprisingly Moralising",
      "reviewBody": "This episodic film is a close relative of Wolf Hartwig&apos;s schoolgirl report movies, made by the same people, in a similar style, around similar topics. However, this one specifically focuses on the coming-of-age aspects, to an extent that it also touches on delicate issues such as paedophilia.\n\nThe schoolgirl report movies had the habit of occasionally subjecting its audience to some moralising, with the basic message that today&apos;s youth was more misunderstood than depraved.  This was typically delivered in a sometimes fairly and sometimes utterly patronising style - in the former case by the reporter and voice-over, and in the latter case by the character &quot;Dr. Bernauer&quot; (alias Günther Kieslich).  I always had the impression that this moralising was complete bogus, merely a gimmick to pacify censors or press.\n\nWatching this movie though made me think again because the moralising aspects suddenly take centre-stage, to an extent which surely must have annoyed the film&apos;s most likely audience - the raincoat brigade. Thus the makers apparently believed in their message after all, even if the message does not come across very convincingly.\n\nAs a result, some of the episodes are a strange mixture of run-of-the-mill exploitation stuff with issues concerning good or bad parenting.  For example, in one episode Elise (Marie Luise Lusewitz) has Sunday morning sex with her husband, unaware that her young children are already awake and watching them through the bedroom&apos;s keyhole; her hubby finds the subsequent inquisition by the kids regarding the technical details of this weird wrestling match too hard to take and reacts in a way that gives the commentator ample opportunity for more moralising criticism.\n\nBut other episodes are just bizarre.  One episode of rather dubious taste sees a mother (type: loser, white trash) accidentally discovering that spanking her (approximately 11 year old) daughter appears to re-awaken the waning sexual interest of her boyfriend in her - and she exploits that observation like a free Viagra prescription.  When the mother later discovers that his sexual interest extends to the daughter as well she blackmails him into marrying herself.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the abject absurdity of Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, I adored it.\n\nThe film starts off as a farcical story following John Gielgud and Madeline Carroll - two novice British spies - hunting down a German agent with the help of a more experienced man - &quot;The General&quot; - a Mexican hilariously played by Peter Lorre. With these principal players, it should be no surprise that the performances are top-notch. However, given the fact that Lorre was, at the time, at one of the lowest points in his tumultuous but brilliant career, it is possible that his over-the-top and uncharacteristically comedic performance at least began unintentionally (and was exploited by the great director as a last-ditch effort to complete the film successfully). \n\nThe story is based rather loosely on a Somerset Maugham story translated for theater by Campbell Dixon then adapted by Hitchcock favorite Charles Bennett. Quite a bit, as you can well imagine, changes as a result of the translations from medium to medium.\n\nThe drama turns on a developing romance between Gielgud and Carroll&apos;s characters - and the burgeoning consciences which accompany it. Will they be able to carry out their patriotic duty if and when they finally track down their opponent, or will they fail? Furthermore, what will the zealous and perhaps a little psychotic General do if his co-conspirators drop out of the spy business at the last instant? Typical Hitchcock plot devices (i.e. trains, quirky romantic relationships, European ethnic stereotypes) make cameo appearances at appropriate points in the story, and enhance the experience for Hitchcock aficionados.\n\nThe script and general story-line is not one of the best Hitchcock would have access to throughout his career, but it is quite rich compared to some of the plots he worked with earlier in his career, and the director develops the comedy, suspense, and human drama economically and affectively, if not fully. The camera-work is, of course, good, but not nearly as experimental or interesting as many of Hitchcock&apos;s earlier and later films. This is generally true of most of Hitchcock&apos;s excellent efforts for Gaumont British Pictures of America during the 1930s (I.e. Sabotage, 39 Steps, etc) - very British films made with American/British casts and production for an international audience.\n\nThough less suspenseful than many of Hitchcock&apos;s contemporaneous efforts, Secret Agent remains a good and entertaining example of Hitchcock in the 1930s.",

But what I like most is the description of the friendship of college students who, despite emprisonmente and tortures, keep their dignity and their desire to struggle jointly for a better world. A movie which should be watched by every apathic teenager - the shock may really make him/her mature his/her views and attitudes.",

      "name": "pillow talk is not a &quot;lesbian love scene&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "First of all, seeing the fuss of over post-coital fantasy pillow talk being such the focus of the discussion of this film is disturbing. There IS no &quot;lesbian love scene&quot;. There are NO scenes of sex between two women. Jane simply describes a fantasy encounter, even editing it to his wishes, to her man. It&apos;s pillow talk. Anyone renting this for such a scene will be greatly disappointed. Okay, there&apos;s some nudity; but this isn&apos;t soft core porn. It isn&apos;t even Nine and a Half Weeks. The sex scenes are far more subtle; no humping, sorry. I don&apos;t see how anyone with realistic expectations could possibly be disappointed. It&apos;s a delightful, realistic romance. \n\nA married man falls in love with a younger woman; who happens to be an ingénue, his love interest in the film of which he&apos;s the star. Coyote plays to perfection &quot;The American Movie Star&quot; filming in Europe. Set in spectacular locales, it&apos;s more than a love story between the two principal characters. It&apos;s a love story showing the director&apos;s love of the locations where it was filmed. This; and relating with the storyline of a European love affair, is what makes this one of my all time favorite films. Who could possibly complain about the music by the genius that was Georges Delerue? (the sole 80&apos;s synth-pop track aside)\n\nAnd to the previous poster &quot;wondering what Kurys was thinking&quot; - a little research will divulge the film&apos;s semi-autobiographical nature. Look up Kurys&apos; listing here, in her earlier years. You&apos;ll find where she worked on a film with a popular American actor (not his costar as in this film, but it&apos;s obvious enough). She wasn&apos;t just &quot;thinking&quot; - the fact that this is a bit of memoir makes it all that much more endearing.\n\nThis is one of the most highly UNDER rated films of all time, as underrated as Coyote is actor. But expect a romantic film (by all definitions) and watch it for what it&apos;s worth - there is beauty in its simplicity.",

The study of the two main characters is very interesting; you have a rather gruff sea captain, who has led a man&apos;s life and is proud of it. He makes no excuses for himself; he is a man who takes responsibility for his actions. He is an honest man. Marriage is not for him- although he has two demanding mistresses; his ship and the sea. Mrs. Muir is a true product of her time; she has done what society expects of her; she has married, and bore a child. Her husband is a respected man. She has fulfilled her obligation. We see that Mrs. Muir is more than an average fin de siecle woman. She is deeper; we can see from her brief description of the late Mr. Muir that he was mediocre. From here the love story begins; we see the mutual respect and admiration that Captain Gregg and Mrs. Muir have for eachother.The love is pure and true,on a higher plane; not hindered  or comprimised by sexual intimacy.\n\nThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir is a love story that like its characters transcends time.",

      "reviewBody": "This sensation could hardly have come more unexpectedly, but from the minute we see our narrator, director, writer, composer and, if you will, lead of this essayesque autobiography stand before a mirror, all in negative, shaving his blue face - I was captivated beyond belief. Already from the first second he contemplates about life and the function of time, all while turning colors on their head and in his sink, via a magical combination of shaving cream, water and distortion of reality - creates patterns representing not only the movement of time - but also also looks pretty damn dope.\n\nJerome Hill is the perfect narrator, bringing a massive amount of wit - and going to so many different lengths of dissecting the power of time. He hypothesizes his future - all in comic sketches - but then we move away from potential and impossible futures and all the way back to his childhood. It&apos;s incredible what emotions he manages to convey, as instills both nostalgia and the true spirit of childhood wonders, recreating his childhood through multiple animation techniques, from cut-outs, to drawing on film, to more traditional animation - to shooting at the presumed locations, recreating some of his pastimes in real life. Pictures and very early home video also plays an extreme part - and together these all form one of the most unique cinematic experiences I have had.\n\nEach effect and image, coupled with Hill&apos;s own thoughts, wits and insights invokes an ever-lasting sense of magic and wonder - one line that particularly stands out is: &quot;My father didn&apos;t have the skill of a professional cameraman. Result? Avant-garde cinema&quot; - and it was quite true. The off, over-exposed images he shows us are effective in their own right. It&apos;s remarkable how much of the flaws in the material he presents us becomes strengths and qualities in the context he presents it. Soon he himself begins to be in charge of the projects he presents - and he shows how youthful experiments with film directly affected his later cinema.\n\nHe even shows two full shorts, one his largest experiment as a youth, and the second his first true short, the 12 minute La cartomancienne from 1932 - which blends perfectly in, and really shows the magic he had in his heart. Some of the magic withered as the film started to focus on his career and the level of experiments decreased, but he quickly won it back as his contemplations returned to those of the beginning. A unique experience. A wonderful masterpiece. And what a beautiful note it managed to end on. 10/10.",

      "name": "Mediocre Paella/Spaghetti/Sauerkraut Western co-produced by Spain/Italy/Germany with the unforgettable Fernando Sancho as a Mexican bandit",
      "reviewBody": "The film packs Western action , comical elements , thrills , shoot&apos;em up , brawls , and results to be quite entertaining . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with ordinary actors , technicians , decent production values and average results . A card player called Jeff Clayton (Robert Wood) plays a ranch against an owner , as he earns the card gambling and takes his ranch . Along the way, Jeff meets a tied Mexican bandit called Carrancho (the braggart Fernando Sancho who would play the sequel as starring titled ¨Viva Carrancho¨ and acting lots of occasions in similar character) and frees him but he escapes robbing his horse . Jeff , then , goes to the ranch called ¨G. G.¨ where he meets two brothers : Hellen (Maria Sebaldt) and David (Francisco Garcia or Frank Stewart) and helps them . Later on , Clayton faces off Jimmy El Negro (nasty Helmut Schmid who holds a whip and usually lashing) and his hoodlums (Antonio Molino Rojo and Miguel De la Riva) who are under undercover orders a powerful lawyer (Richard Haussler) and all of them want to take over the ranches of the region . After that , the swanky Carrancho assaults a stagecoach but Clayton detains him to utilize him as a crucial witness .\n\nThis exciting tortilla/Ravioli Western packs thrills , shootouts , hilarious situations , riding pursuits and several other things . Furthermore , there are also the ordinary brawls , punches , hits , slaps and kick-asses . Italian-Spanish co-production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , action , exaggerated characters , crossfire and lots of shots and fights . Starring Robert Woods is pretty nice , he ravages the screen , he jumps, leaps and bounds , hits and runs , besides receives violent punches , kicks and wounds . Robert Woods makes a serviceable swift-shooting hero in a role . Robert starred several Tortilla/Ravioli Western as &quot;Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace&quot; , &quot;Seven Guns for the MacGregors&quot; , ¨Black Jack¨, ¨El Puro¨, &quot;Gatling Gun&quot; , among others . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation between Robert Woods and Helmut Schmid with some looks that say it all , including a thrilling ending shotdown . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . It&apos;s a three country co-production : Spain/Italy/Germany but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing their product , though this one has penchant for hilarious happenings and roles , thanks to the boastful Fernando Sancho , playing an illiterate as well as humorous Mexican outlaw , whose role would play a lots of times ,as he starred multitude ¨Chorizo¨ or ¨Pipperone¨ Westerns interpreting the quarrelsome , swanky Mexican outlaw , such as ¨A pistol for Ringo¨, ¨Return of Ringo¨, &quot;Requiem for a Gringo&quot; , &quot;Dakota Joe&quot; , ¨Winchester Bill¨ , &quot;One Hundred Thousand Dollars for Ringo&quot; , &quot;The Man Who Came to Kill&quot; and several others . If you like Chorizo , Paella , Butifarra or Spaghetti or Schnitzel westerns , this &quot;Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace&quot; or ¨Pistoleros De Arizona¨ remains lightly watchable .\n\nThis picture &quot;Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace¨ being regularly photographed by Carlo Carlini in Technicolor , Techniscope , though is necessary a fine remastering because of the film-copy is washed-out . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga , (Huesca) , similar to Almeria , and a Western village located in ¨Spugles De Llobregat¨ built by producers/directors brothers : Alfonso Balcázar , Francisco Balcázar , Juan Jose Balcazar though this Balcazar family went to bankrupt and had to sell the terrains , including the usual General supplies , Saloon , livery stable , wall paper merchandise , dressmaker , billiard parlor , barber shop , undertaker , General store , and other shops and buildings ; it resulted to be the locations where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J. J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch , Xavier Marchal , Jose Maria Zabalza , Manuel Esteba , Ignacio F. Iquino , and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the Fraga landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians , as future filmmaker Romolo Girolami , Film Editing by Teresa Alcocer , nice assistant direction and adequate production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler , the latter creates an acceptable scenario . Climatic musical score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino .\n\nThis motion picture was middlingly directed by Alfonso Balcazar , and with no originality ; he managed to make a fluid and filled with punches as well as fighting Western , though mediocre . This Italian &amp; Spanish co-production qualifies as a low-budget, mid-brow western, a level before the seminal Spaghetti westerns . Alfonso alongside his brothers Juan Jose Balcazar and Francisco Balcázar produced and directed a lot of Chorizo or Butifarra Western , most of them starred by Jorge Martin or George Martin , Luis Davila , Daniel Martin or Robert Woods ; such as 1972 The return of Clint , 1972 Judas... ¡Toma Monedas! , 1968 Sartana no Perdone or Sonora , 1967 With Death on Your Back, 1966 Dinamita Jim , 1965 Doc , Manos De Plata , 1965 Viva Carrancho , 1965 Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace . Rating : 4.5/10 . Average.",

      "reviewBody": "Elegant costumes, beautiful scenery, and piano playing in excess all  add to the sights and sounds of Mira Nair&apos;s film &apos;Vanity Fair.&apos; Her  2004 version is one of over ten tries to put William Makepeace  Thackeray&apos;s novel onto the big screen. Most attempts failed miserably,  lacking the magic of today&apos;s movies and failing to grasp the themes of  the novel. Nair&apos;s version, with its visual and audible pleasures, has  the potential to become one of the few successful attempts.  With humble beginnings as a poor child with a starving artist as her  father, Becky (Reese Witherspoon) was determined to overcome  her circumstance. She managed to work her way into a governess position  in a down-on-his-luck aristocrat. New opportunities arise, and she  hastily abandons her post to become the companion to a wealthy woman  known only as Miss Crawley (Eileen Atkins). Much to Miss Crawley&apos;s  displeasure, Becky wastes no time in her quest to climb the social  ladder and marries into the family. Becky&apos;s new husband, Crawley&apos;s  nephew, is soon sent off to war. Returning after the battle of  Waterloo, their marriage is rocky due to his gambling debts and her  never-ending quest to raise her social status. Meeting a man who  collected her late father&apos;s art, she uses his money and his influence  to continue her rise in the social hierarchy, causing more distress to  their marriage.  Nair attempted to bring something new to the film, using her fantastic  creative talents in the costuming and scenery. Her musical choices  weren&apos;t overwhelming and accented the film rather than hiding behind  its beautiful visual aspects. She tried to cover the expanse of the  novel, but ending up making a summary of the story and leaving the  characters bland and undeveloped. Nair intentionally portrays Becky as  a victim of the social system, showing her as merely taking advantage  of circumstantial events. This contradicts harshly with Thackeray&apos;s  Becky, who is manipulative and cunning, turning circumstantial events  into anything that will benefit her rise up the social ladder.   This movie is beautifully made and had the potential to become  something great, but Nair&apos;s overly eager attempt leaves it as nothing  more than another mediocre film. Had she paid as much attention to the  plot and the characters as she did to the audio and visual aspects,  this would definitely be the best film of the year. But she didn&apos;t, so  don&apos;t waste your seven dollars to see it in the theater. Wait for the  video, or better yet, wait for that one Friday night when you are home  alone and it comes on cable."

Bradley Cooper carries the role well, and he portrays the internal struggle very well. It is a welcomed change that Bradley Cooper portrays a serious and emotionally tormented role. The scene of his attempt to rectify things in the greenhouse is haunting. Zoe Saldana shines as well as the supportive wife, her plethora of emotions is so natural and convincing. They make a good on screen couple. The Bradley Cooper subplot is quite predictable, but the connection between Bradley Cooper and Dennis Quaid is not immediately apparent. This extra layer gives &quot;The Words&quot; more depth. I think &quot;The Words&quot; has many fine performances, and deserves to be seen."

To prove his point, he sets up dive singer Anni (Joan Crawford) as a fake socialite to fool his rich friends. This works but snobbish Robert Young falls for her and wants to marry her. Anni sees the chance to get out of poverty by marrying a rich guy but, at the same time, she has started to fall for poor Franchot Tone. So it becomes a question of whether Anni will choose love or money. Glossy MGM soaper with a nice cast but somehow just misses the mark. It was nice seeing George Zucco in a different kind of role. Also Billie Burke is sort of evil, which is interesting. See it for the cast or out of curiosity. You might enjoy it more than me.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one funky crime-thriller, or Krimi, since it&apos;s a German movie after all.\n\nThis movie and it&apos;s story are both being quite silly. It&apos;s really a product of the &apos;60&apos;s and it does nothing to conceal this. It&apos;s a type of movie Austin Powers used to make fun of. It has silly weapons (a gun that sprays gas, a bible that kills), a stupid evil criminal plot, people who do silly and unlikely things in general, silly James Bond like villains, that live in a lair with crocodiles and other sea animals surrounding the villain, who sits with his back to the camera in a chair and who we can only hear speak. This really seems like the German answer to James Bond&apos;s growing popularity. But luckily the movie also doesn&apos;t take itself very serious. It has fun, almost quirky like characters and some good comic relief as well, from time to time.\n\nThe movie is being based on a Edgar Wallace novel, that were quite popular, not in the very least because Edgar Wallace was also the author of King Kong. A whole series of movies got made of his books. The books were actually a lot older than the movies, so it&apos;s hard to say how much of the silliness actually comes from the books themselves. Probably very little and the books in essence were mostly being serious crime-thrillers, with always a mysterious villain, that inspector Higgins had to unmask.\n\nThe movie is just basically a whole lot of fun. The villains, the silly plot, all of the other characters, it&apos;s funky &apos;60&apos;s style and atmosphere, all make this a very likable movie. This really is the movie its strongest point, since if you have to look at this movie deeper and more serious you really can&apos;t call this movie a good one at all. The story and storytelling is far from likely or well done, so overall you can really call this movie a bad one, if you look at it very strictly. But luckily nobody will be able to, due to the funky silliness of this movie. Everybody will probably get taken by it and will enjoy this movie because of that.\n\nA great guilty pleasure movie.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The other reason I liked it was the music in it, Dean had such a sexy voice and Jerry provided the comedy behind it. The color detail was superb, and the entire ensemble cast was really good. The horse in the movie did a really good job too, it amazes me the way they can train animals to do the things they do. I enjoyed the scenes Jerry had with all the animals he took care of, it was just fun. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Martin and Lewis, it&apos;s a must see.",

Filmed in Denmark, mostly on the same, barren set, with grating performances by its two female leads. Danish comedians Dirch Passer and Ove Sprogøe appear briefly in embarrassingly unfunny scenes and the whole thing drags along despite its short running time. Written by Sidney W. Pink, who was in charge of another Danish disaster you may have heard of: Reptilicus. Director Guldbrandsen had his name removed from the credits, which will give those familiar with his other work a pretty good idea of how bad THIS film is! A strong contender for #1 worst Danish movie ever.",

      "reviewBody": "The previous reviewer summed it up pretty well. I don&apos;t have much to add except that the DVD I watched was in bad shape and Orson Welles, he of the resonant baritone, sounded scratchy. The speaker who imitates Churchill&apos;s voice in the quotations isn&apos;t too convincing, despite the distinctive qualities of both Churchill&apos;s speech and his writing. After half an hour&apos;s practice, I could do almost as well.\n\nThe DVD was part of a 3-disc set. The first disc is a rough history of Churchill and his career, using stills photos and newsreel footage. The other two discs are of Churchill&apos;s speeches, always thoughtful, always rousing in one way or another. They recall the days when statesmen like Churchill and Lincoln could both read and write.",

      "reviewBody": "Alan Rudolph&apos;s MADE IN HEAVEN is a pleasant, sweet-natured romantic comedy with a twist; the lovers meet in Heaven, after our hero (Timothy Hutton) dies, rescuing a family from a car that plunges into a river. It may seem familiar territory to viewers of Robin Williams&apos; drama, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, in it&apos;s depiction of the afterlife and reincarnation, and the Albert Brooks&apos; fantasy, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, which also involves a romance in Heaven (in Brooks&apos; case, with Meryl Streep). Without the budget of the Williams&apos; film (which won an Oscar for it&apos;s visual effects), or Brooks&apos; occasionally caustic humor about Divine Judgment, MADE IN HEAVEN is a simpler tale, weaving in a theme of predestination between lovers &apos;meant&apos; to be together, which makes it a perfect &apos;date&apos; movie.\n\nHutton, dealing with being dead and in &apos;Paradise&apos;, appreciates the support of his Aunt Lisa (Maureen Stapleton), a long-dead budding painter in a heavenly Paris, but finds that he is lonely, and feels out of place. Then he meets heavenly guide Annie (Kelly McGillis), a new &apos;soul&apos;, who had never &apos;lived&apos; on earth before, and the pair soon fall for each other, filling both his need for love and companionship, and her&apos;s, for an understanding of life, and passion. They marry, after being granted permission by &apos;The Boss&apos;, Emmett (an unbilled Debra Winger, who plays the male role very convincingly!)\n\nEverything seems perfectly heavenly...until Anne&apos;s number is called to be born on Earth. Despite Hutton&apos;s pleas that the pair were &apos;meant&apos; to be together, Anne&apos;s destiny cannot be changed...but he does convince Emmett to allow him to be &apos;reborn&apos; on Earth, insisting that the pair&apos;s love would bring them together. With the understanding that his new life may not return him to Heaven, Emmett grants him 30 years to connect with Annie...or else.\n\nIn true soap opera fashion, the pair live wildly different lives, and have unfulfilling relationships with other partners, while each experiences flashbacks of the true love they had experienced in Heaven. Time is running out, however, and Hutton&apos;s 30th birthday is rapidly approaching, without meeting his soulmate... \n\nA modest film, with a great supporting cast (including Tim Daly, Don Murray, Mare Winningham, and Amanda Plummer), MADE IN HEAVEN&apos;s theme, that Love truly DOES conquer all, is irresistible.\n\nGrab YOUR soulmate, and enjoy it!"

That&apos;s where Merli comes in, he beats on them without flinching, his boss doesn&apos;t like it, so he kicks out of the force, but the story continues...( I won&apos;t give away anything, not even the suprise finally.  Anyway, this according to me is a prime example of a classic Italian Pulp/thrash 70&apos;s movie. It&apos;s complete of old ladies, and children being shot in the face for no reason, rapes, angry people shooting each other in broad daylight.  I give 2 thumbs up. You might remember Richard Conte in the movie &quot;the Boss&quot;, here he plays a character that seems to have a heart(not a big heart, but at least he has one).  Ray lovelock should have won an oscar as best supporting actor, and Maurizio Merli should have won a golden globe award"

      "name": "An old school western that more than gets the job done.  It&apos;s a tour de &quot;fource&quot; for Ed Harris",
      "reviewBody": "Films are made for us to escape to a new reality, whether that reality be complete fantasy, present day, the future, or in this case, the good old West. What we have here is a great western that looks and feels like a classic in the making, an old school western with an old school touch of directing (and acting) from Ed Harris. Appaloosa is very accessible in a film genre that isn&apos;t so accessible. It&apos;s a straightforward film that, despite that, never becomes predictable and formulaic. Harris&apos;s wonderful job on all fronts make Appaloosa one of the most complete films of the year. It&apos;s got it all, great writing, killer acting, and a great atmosphere that allows the viewer to get trapped in this old western world.\n\nSet in 1882 New Mexico, Appaloosa follows the fate of the town of the same name, which has fallen into the control of a ruthless outlaw (Jeremy Irons), and the powers that be have hired new hands to take control of the situation (Harris and Viggo Mortensen). However, when a mysterious widow (Renee Zellweger) arrives in town, loyalties will be tested, friendships will be put on trial, and guns will be fired.\n\nThe strong point, as I&apos;ve said, is Ed Harris, who pulls the quadruple threat of acting, directing, writing, and producing. Despite all the work he did on this film, he still manages to turn in an Oscar worthy performance as the steadfast and unwavering commander of the town. Harris is subtle, nuanced, and never out of control. He commands the screen every time he&apos;s on it, without yelling or doing anything too crazy. Viggo Mortensen&apos;s near silent performance is not short on talent either, as one of silent acting&apos;s kings continues to show incredible versatility (the guy is a fantasy king, Russian mobster, and now an old west Deputy Marshall). To complete the trifecta of greatness, Jeremy Irons is the only guy I can imagine in the role of the film&apos;s villain. His freezing stare, mixed with the icy cold voice he is most known for, makes him one of the most memorable villains of the year.\n\nRenee Zellweger really didn&apos;t add anything to the movie, though her character wasn&apos;t too interesting, and just serves as a plot device. This is what keeps the film from getting that &quot;10&quot; from me. The rest of the supporting cast is really a non-issue, as the story really only revolves around a few characters.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about the film is that it really made me feel like I was out west...right down to the little details, such as sandstorms, the presence of Native Americans, small drawls from the actors (thankfully none besides Zellweger had a bad one), and the different kinds of horses &amp; guns in the film. Harris keeps the film moving nicely, and there&apos;s only a few moments where I felt it dragged a bit. Like I&apos;ve said, it&apos;s hard to find a real fault here...the film is just well done all around, from a production standpoint.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I knew how I felt about this film the second the lights went on. I clapped and said, &quot;that was great&quot;. Appaloosa is an old school western that has everything a fan of the genre could want...including a suspenseful and tense gunfight and crazy Native Americans on horses! It&apos;s definitely one of the most complete westerns and films I&apos;ve seen this year, and should be in contention for a few awards come Oscar season.",

      "reviewBody": "In Yellow House,Algerian filmmaker Amor Hakkar captures the beauty of a simple Berber village family living in hostile mountains whose happiness is shattered due to the unexpected death of their only son.Sadness is the main theme of this simple yet poignant film which is characterized by a very eclectic yet haunting musical score.Young Algerian musician Faycal Salhi recreates somber atmosphere in this film by making effective use of Oud,a musical instrument which is widely used in Arabic musical compositions.It can be expected that some viewers might like to compare &quot;Yellow House&quot; with David Lynch film &quot;The Straight Story&quot;.Such a comparison is going to appear as valid only to some extent as the theme of one ordinary man against the system is a common element of both the films but there are a lot of cultural differences too which can be noticed in both these films.So in this manner Amor Hakkar&apos;s film is not at all an Algerian Straight Story.Acting performances are excellent in Yellow House despite the fact that its simple storyline could have induced its lead actors to involve in a bit of over acting.Amor Hakkar is to be applauded for the just manner in which he has played the role of a simple minded family chief who goes to claim his son&apos;s mortal remains from the city. Both Algerian cinema as well as Arab cinema have come to limelight again with the success of &quot;La Maison Jaune&quot; at various international film festivals such as Locarno and Kerala film festivals.Yellow house is a film with a valid reason to be watched as it shows us how ordinary people use all their available emotional resources in order to overcome the loss of their loved ones.",
