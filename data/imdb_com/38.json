      "reviewBody": "A lot of people have bagged this movie since it came out, whether it is because of the predictability of the storyline or voicing disapproval of the jokes. What these people don&apos;t seem to realize is that this is a kids film. A movie not meant to thrill the older members of the family, but to be at least something bearable for them to do with there kids, and in this respect this movie succeeds. I have heard people mention that this film shows how dumb movies think kids are, and that kids deserve to have a movie with thought, but not all adult movies require thought, and most people are OK with that (the sensible ones) and since there is kids movies with thought coming out quite often at the moment (Coraline, Fantastic Mr. Fox) it seems quite reasonable that they can balance this out with brainless fun like this film. For negatives, while Robin Williams and John Travolta do there parts to the best of their ability the supporting cast is lackluster, while there are funny cameos by numerous comedy faces the supporting characters that actually matter (mum and friend) are not very good and don&apos;t add anything to the fun of the movie. This being said, Robin Williams and John Travolta hold it together all the way through with just a couple not very funny scenes. Overall, if you want to take your kid to a movie you could do a lot worse then &quot;Old Dogs&quot;. 5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on a true story, this twisting tale of two second world war folk heroes of the Danish resistance unfolds with noir-ish intrigue. Atmospherically photographed on a fat budget, the film looks stunning but retains a gritty period realism.\n\nThe performances are universally strong and there is a real chemistry between the two central characters; Mads Mikkelsens&apos; quirky Citronen, a twitching, sweaty bundle of amphetamine-fuelled nervous energy and his sole ally, the flame-haired, but relatively cool-headed Flammen (Thure Lindhardt).\n\nThis is a war film - but the war we experience here has a dreamlike, claustrophobic quality. This is a world of lies, paranoia and spiralling violence which threatens to erode our heroes moral certainty and destroy their sanity.\n\nA buddy movie with echoes of &quot;Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid&quot; (without the jokes); &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; (but with swastikas). There&apos;s even a little &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; thrown into the mix.\n\nThe first film I&apos;ve seen by director Madsen has left me intrigued, impressed and hungry for more. Recommended 8.5/10",

I did the same with this one. I have to say that I really liked the general concept of the story, even though it&apos;s not the type of movies I like to watch (I thought that this is mainly a comedy). But I find the execution to be bad. Poor acting, bad directing and the pace is mental. It should have been slower so we can appreciate and better understand the scenes. Of course this would require some scenes to be excluded and there are some (mainly the fight scenes) that could be left out. 4 stars for the story",

A strong and true message, which calls for our humanity. Superb interpretation. Simple direction, valuing the natural interpretation, and decorated with a lot of beautiful film views. Another important point of the message is this distinction between the Somalia tradition and the Coran recommendations. See and support absolutely.",

Sam Neil proves again what a great actor he is as he plays real life Alan Galbraith. Jon Voight does a particularly good turn as skipper Peter Wilcox.\n\nThe French are quite rightly portrayed as the enemy in this film because they are and notably showed how stupid they were leaving trails for the New Zealand police to follow. They after all in particular Galbraith almost toppled the French government with their discoveries a giant killing act indeed.\n\nThere are some good scenes in this film some quite surprising. The scene in which the Rongelap man describes his people succumbing to the effects of radiation poisoning following the 1954 15 megaton thermonuclear &apos;Bravo&apos; shot on Bikini is one of the most disturbing descriptions that I have ever heard. All in all a good film and a good purchase on DVD."

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched Michael Winterbottom&apos;s 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE, where Ian Curtis hangs himself while watching the chicken dancing sequence in STROSZEK. He&apos;d probably done that anyway, but Herzog&apos;s portrait of three eccentric oddballs trying their luck in America, is a sombre film, the most downbeat Herzog made. The only copy I own is a rather dark VHS-copy, which shows some of the interior shots in Berlin even darker than they already are, to the very limit of watchability, so perhaps it&apos;s time I update this beautiful film with a proper DVD.\n\nThe film handles the story of former asylum inmate Bruno S. (THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER) as a Berlin street singer (in a role where he basically plays himself), who joins with his prostitute girlfriend Eva (Eva Mattes) and ageing eccentric friend Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz) to embark on a memorable journey, leaving modern Berlin, for the golden opportunities of America. The &apos;promised land&apos; is represented by the dreary, austere town of Railroad Flats in rural Wisconsin, where they settle in a mobile home bought on credit, but it turns out America is not gonna fulfill their dreams that easily. \n\nShot in winter, Berlin is shown as a cold, forbidden and lacklustre place. Not a ray of sunshine. The dark facades of the battered apartment blocks, downlit bars filled with smoke and shabby characters, the only goal the folks in Bruno&apos;s world seem to have, is merely make the best of things. \n\nOften read as a critique of how capitalist American society destroys the individual, Herzog sees the film as less a critique of the United States than as &quot;a eulogy&quot; in the wake of the American dream, for such shattered hopes could develop in virtually any country (see &quot;Herzog on Herzog&quot;, p. 144). He does throw in some of the eccentricities of American life, but above all, it&apos;s a somewhat surreal account of three simple folks, short-changed in life, desperately trying to make ends meet. From the start it&apos;s clear that these three are made for each other. They simply do not fit in any stratum of society really. They&apos;re too fragile for the world of pimps and low lives that formed the background of their lives in Berlin. Although not dumb, Bruno is too half-witted to be taken seriously by most people. Eva&apos;s background is not fully explained, but she&apos;s emotionally fragile and dependent, while elderly Scheitz&apos;s chances to get ahead in life seems to lay in the past. \n\nIt&apos;s a bleak and uncompromising film, this tragicomic account of this odd trio in pursuit of a better life outside the dreary confinements of Berlin&apos;s lower casts of society, but it&apos;s so intensely moving and honest with its subjects, that alone is something to admire.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 9/10"

Shot on location in what was then Athen&apos;s poorest area, he overwhelms the viewer with the abject poverty of post-war Greece. All performances are noteworthy, especially that of Manos Katrakis. Mikis Theodorakis fans will love this movie for its music. Synoikia to Oneiro has few of the technical problems common among Greek movies of the time. I can&apos;t help feeling it a shame that Alexnadrakis hadn&apos;t directed more films. Let&apos;s not forget that movies in Greece at the time were made on shoe-string budgets. This film is under-rated. In my opinion, it&apos;s on par with Stella, Ta Kokkina Fanaria and other great Greek films made in the mid-fifties to mid-sixties.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Caines first outing as secret agent Harry Palmer is set in 60&apos;s London. This is not the Psychedelic London of Austin Powers or the Beatles, neither is it the sophisticated aristocratic London of James Bond. This London is drab and populated by civil servants &amp; bedsits. This London is still coming to terms with the end of World War II and the advent of a modern world.\n\nWorking Class Palmer is an unwilling Home Office agent with criminal tendencies who is more interested in a pay rise so that he can indulge his true passion, gourmet cooking, than serving his country. His superiors, Ross (played by Guy Doleman) &amp; Dalby (Played by Nigel Green) represent a microcosm of the British Upper &amp; Lower Middle Classes. Palmer is clearly more cultured in his appreciation of food, music(Mozart &amp; Bach) &amp; women, &quot;I like Birds Best&quot; Palmer admits to Courtney played by Sue Lloyd (of Crossroads fame in UK).\n\nPalmers superiors appear uninterested in the fate of their subordinates and this is one reason why the character of Palmer works so well, we are him, he lives our lives and we want him to win through. This perspective is aided by the stunning photography that uses every conceivable camera angle (even views from a light bulb!) to see the world from the characters perspective.\n\nLook out for the supermarket scene between Ross and Palmer, my vote for the most violent use of a supermarket Trolley in a movie.\n\nAs Palmer slowly unravels the mysterious disappearance of top government scientists it becomes clear that there is someone close to the top of the British Secret service acting as a double agent. Who is it, Ross or Dalby? Who is Courtney, Palmers love interest, working for?\n\nIn the background is a rather sinister looking CIA, who always appear to be one step ahead of the Brits. (A reference to the decline of Britian as a world power and its reliance on America?) Wether intentional or not, this film has captured a London of the 60&apos;s that was going through substantial social change, gone are the class paradigms that suggest that the working class could never be cultured, gone is is the unquestioning loyalty to the upper class. This world was forever changed after the war. This is a film I can watch time and time again, if only to watch the title sequence as Palmer gets up for work as if he is going to just another office job.\n\nThis is a stylish movie and one of the greatest British films ever made. If you havn&apos;t seen it watch it now!"

      "reviewBody": "When upon its theatrical release I first saw &apos;An Unmarried Woman&apos; I thought it brilliantly captured the feminist outlook - not the radical feminist viewpoint but the growing awareness of the vast majority of ordinary women of new modalities for living. I just saw it again on DVD and my first impression of the film holds up. But through my having aged my perspectives have matured, and now I also find &apos;An Unmarried Woman&apos; to be perhaps the finest capturing of 1977&apos;s zeitgeist - but only the zeitgeist of upper middle class New Yorkers (Mazursky better captured the wider 70&apos;s zeitgeist in &apos;Harry and Tonto).\n\nHere Mazursky shows that, whatever else he is accused of being or doing or not-doing (with which I don&apos;t always agree or disagree), is a thoughtful director taking a good, long, realistic look at this drama and at more than just its central character. I liked that some scenes ran on for a bit longer than some people find necessary or comfortable, because this is how life&apos;s scenes often play out beyond one&apos;s wanting them to end swiftly and tidily: indeed, the slight overrunning of some scenes contributes what today might be called &quot;value-added&quot; realism to &apos;An Unmarried Woman.&apos; After all, Erica has, involuntarily, been thrust into a new life in which she&apos;s not at ease in every one of its developing, novel situations.\n\nThe saxophone score - probably considered hip in 1977 - is today often more than a trifle annoying; but then it could be said that the score is part of the film&apos;s capture of the 70&apos;s zeitgeist: like all decades the 70&apos;s had its annoyances (not the least of which was the dismal monotony of disco, and all those decor-saturating browns, olives (avocado it was called!), honey-golds, and tawny oranges).\n\nThe cinematography here is quite good, nicely tailored to the film&apos;s intimate subject, situations, and relationships. Throughout the acting is uniformly good; Jill Clayburgh&apos;s effort here is, and will remain I expect, a cinema original and classic. I especially enjoyed - not when I first saw the film but much more so now in 2006 - Cliff Gorman&apos;s portrayal of self-satisfied, on-the-make Charlie. Andrew Duncan in the minor role of Bob lends great verisimilitude with his pre-&quot;hair systems&quot; comb-over but especially with the touch of about-to-be-over-the-hill despair in Bob&apos;s attempt to bed Erica; Bob demonstrates that most men in that decade, beginning as they were to be flummoxed by emerging liberated women and feminism, still clung to the suddenly obsolescent notion that a divorcée would and should be eager to remarry in order to traditionally assure her security and peace of mind.\n\nAt my first viewing I agreed with what Tanya, Erica&apos;s therapist, said to Erica about guilt being a manufactured, unnecessary emotion. But a good many more years of living have taught me that guilt is not manufactured, and that without it a person is doomed to emptiness and isolation, and a society is doomed to decadence, and even to barbarism. Rather Tanya should have held that guilt is natural, and that it is one&apos;s mature management of it that enables one to distinguish, in oneself and in others, venality and narcissism from generosity of spirit.\n\n&apos;An Unmarried Woman&apos; still stands on its own - more as a socio-cultural than as a cinematic landmark. It&apos;s that rare kind of film that&apos;s worth watching every five or ten years, if only to help us to recall where we&apos;ve come from, and to help us to profit from, or to enjoy, a sense of where we might be going.",

This documentary was the academy award in 1960, but when viewed by today&apos;s standards looks like it is full of a bunch of whimps.  The &quot;adventurers&quot; never lift a finger themselves and when any sort of danger arrives they radio for help.  Having supplies airlifted to you at the drop of a dime isn&apos;t very impressive if you ask me."

If One Missed Call had been released before, lets say &quot;The Ring&quot; - the movie would have had a higher rating - and better reviews. But because we have had &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;The Ring 2 &quot;, &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;The Grudge 2&quot;, &quot;Pulse&quot;, etc.. (to name a few) people think they know what the&apos;re already gonna get from the film. I mean, I&apos;m not gonna lie and say One Missed Call is really a lot different from those movies - cause it&apos;s not. But that doesn&apos;t mean to say it&apos;s not good or entertaining. I think If you get passed the whole Japanese thing - you will enjoy the movie for sure. \n\nThe thing I like about these certain movies is, there is a lot of great suspense. There&apos;s no heads, legs, arms flying everywhere - it&apos;s better than that.

I was pleasantly surprised, however.\n\nOverall, Alien Autopsy is a very funny, whimsical film. The script is patchy in places - subplots get twisted and don&apos;t really tie together satisfactorily in the end - but this is made up by the pleasure (and it really is a genuine pleasure) to see Ant and Dec putting in strong performances in the lead roles. This is the sort of film that the critics would be sharpening their knives for. I think those knives can be put back in the drawer.\n\nMake no mistake: this isn&apos;t your traditional British comedy. The cameos fit perfectly into the plot and everyone has a purpose. There are no big faces included for the sake of it. Somehow, it works.\n\nThis is an enjoyable film and good family entertainment. It won&apos;t win any awards, but it&apos;s harmless, clean fun - and very good harmless clean fun at that.",

It is also one of the early films for Yimou Zhang, who also directed Gong Li in Curse of the Golden Flower. He shows the promise of a great director in this film.\n\nThere is not much that is pleasant her. Ju Dou (Gong Li) is bought by an evil man who has beaten two wives to death for not bearing him a son. She is beaten mercilessly and he has constant sex with her to have a son.\n\nThe problem is not his wives, but him, and she has a son secretly with his nephew (Baotian Li). It saves her life, but matters continue to get more and more complicated until the final tragedy.\n\nOne of the really interesting features of the film is the Chinese funeral ritual.\n\nThe film is a great example of the early work of two great talents, but do not think that early means weak, as they were bother strong from the beginning.",

      "reviewBody": "I cannot help be enchanted every time I see or hear Grafin Mariza(Countess Mariza) as an operetta. And this is a great film adaptation if not quite as good as the 1973/4 film with Rene Kollo. I agree that the direction wasn&apos;t always as good as it could&apos;ve been, with some languid and somewhat awkward moments, though there are many more that suits the operetta style quite well. But with everything else so wonderful, this didn&apos;t seem like a massively huge problem. The costume and set design look beautiful here, as does the photography on the most part. The music is among Kalman&apos;s best, especially Tassilo&apos;s lied Wenn Es Abend Wird, and the orchestra do it justice with lively and elegantly textured playing. The chorus are animated and well-rehearsed as well. The interplay and drama between the characters are charmingly played and doesn&apos;t dull the story in any way, and the choreography is choreographed and danced with a lot of infectious spirit. Christine Gorner is a beguiling and capricious in the title role with a well-produced voice, and while Rudolf Schock I agree is not the best of actors he is appealing as Tassilo(here called Michael) and sings Wenn Es Abend Wird with sensitive beauty. Gunther Phillip and Renate Ewert are well matched for each other, but the scene stealer is the uproariously funny turn of Hans Moser. The Kesslers are equally delightful, but you do wish there was more of them. Overall, I found it great, true the story is not exactly the same as that of the operetta but the spirit is there, which is more important to me. Even more important is what a film does on its own merits, and there is plenty to like about this Grafin Mariza. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Farhan Akhtar has done it again, after his first movie Dil Chahta Hai.\n\nHrithik Roshan&apos;s character grows up from being a confused young lad to a man with a mission. Shades of An Officer and a Gentleman, Guns of Navarone, and a little of Saving Private Ryan.\n\nShankar-Ehsaan-Loy have created more of their world music, and it rocks. The first two songs were fabulous; the other songs should be skipped, I thought.\n\nAs in Dil Chahta Hai, the parents are all ultra-supportive. They also dress and decorate in expensive nouveau handlooms, rattan furniture, slip covers, etc. Boston Brahmin did a good review.\n\nVery nice and straightforward; none of the Hindu Family Values reactionary material that Bollywood routinely churns out.",

But this little Italian film is worth seeing, though being lousy, worth seeing because there is no real lead hero character, and that&apos;s not so usual, you can&apos;t focus on one character in particular. And the lost patrol scheme is always interesting to watch. Some details are taken care off, for instance the Simba village attack, during which the mercenaries don&apos;t forget to change the ammo magasines. You don&apos;t see this in every action film, even the best ones. So, that&apos;s a pretty good point to me. Well, I expected far far worse before watching this movie, speaking of racism; but this was the period: late sixties. No boredom at all, and you find here the pure Italian films trade mark, I speak of machismo manners, for instance slapping women for anything, in the most natural way. You have this in nearly, if not every, Italian crime film or western from the sixties and seventies. The village attack by a platoon before getting back thru the jungle has already been made a thousand of times before, the most famous one being PREDATOR. But there were plenty of others, Vietnam topics, mainly Philippine productions. And I also did not expect such character study, for this kind of production I mean. Do not be too hard with this film, OK?",

The movie is at pains to demonstrate her classic symptoms, complete with flat emotions, apathy, seeing imaginary people, and mild paranoia. Her symptom of increased suggestibility, demonstrated by her reactions to advice about shoes and marriage, provides the context for the climax of the film.\n\nThe camera lingers on every shot, creating in the viewer the languid mood of the girl. The cinematography is very good, and there are some visual touches, such as shop names and an image of a leering Colonel Sanders, that accent the film and foreshadow the plot development.\n\nThis is the kind of film that makes a good topic for a college essay, but is not particularly enjoyable to watch. However, it does provide a view into everyday life in Korea, which may be of interest.",

      "reviewBody": "Employing his juggling expertise and visible nuances he carried into his sound pictures one can almost hear W.C. Fields voice as you read his title cards in Sally of the Sawdust. Younger, thinner and with less dissipation about him Fields plays of all things a doting parent to Sally (Carol Dempster) an orphan with a traveling circus.\n\nBefore Sally is born her well bred and off mother decides to run off with a show person against parents wishes and is disowned. With the father dead and the mother dying Poppy (Fields) agrees to return the child to her parents but then he decides to raise her himself. Together they tour and perform into her adulthood when the day of reckoning approaches, further complicated by Sally&apos;s romance with a swell and member of her grandparents polite society who disdain show people.\n\nDirected by D.W. Griffith in the latter half of his career, Sally has a dated look for a 25 silent with many scenes hearkening back to his halcyon period a decade earlier as his famous montage style looks more like a Mack Sennett Keystone short in spots. Once again he focuses on societal hypocrisy and intolerance but it comes across hackneyed. Silent film had moved into its golden era and Griffith remained inert while Vidor, DeMille and Ingram were taking form and content to another level.\n\nFields is both funny and touching as he protects Sally and tries to make a living in a variety of dubious enterprises. Dempster is remarkably agile as she takes her licks in more than one scene as well as have a chameleon like look that goes from homely tomboy to deco sleek vamp. It is the energy and talent of both that carry Sally as they leave D.W. anachronistic style in the dust.",

Original Sin, set in Cuba and filmed in Mexico had the visuals down perfect-throw in the acting of Jolie and Banderas and you have a visual feast.\n\nThe book/script were fabulous vehicles for the acting of the majors as well as a framework that works beautifully for the intrigues that pepper this film. This script should keep viewers interested throughout and I will definitely be renting this film so that I can savour it without interminable commercials. I want to wallow in the beauty of the images and settings at least one more time.\n\nAny viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.",

      "reviewBody": "Having just read LeCarré&apos;s first novel, &apos;Call for the Dead&apos;, I am now appreciating his third novel &apos;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&apos; even more. This film adaptation directed by Martin Ritt is a fine preamble to the masterful BBC series &apos;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&apos; and &apos;Smiley&apos;s People&apos;. One of the joys of LeCarré&apos;s novels is that many characters return again and again. Mundt, the &quot;villain&quot; in &apos;Spy...&apos; first appears in &apos;Call..&apos; and as usual LeCarré wraps up a few loose ends from the previous story. \n\nThis black and white film recreates the sullen atmosphere of cold war espionage in a way that color seems to diminish for some unexplainable reason. Those were black and white kinda times in my memory. Depressing, frightening and dour.\n\nGeorge Smiley makes a small appearance, albeit very important as a character in the plot line, and is nicely played by Rupert Davies, capturing the diffident and wry Smiley as effectively as Guinness did later on and Denholm Elliot even further on in the TV film &apos;A Murder of Quality&apos;. Cyril Cusack&apos;s Control could easily be the younger version of Alexander Knox&apos;s masterful rendition in the Smiley TV shows. The continuity suggested in all of these films is very satisfying. It&apos;s a shame so many of the other versions of LeCarré&apos;s novels are so mediocre... ie &apos;The Little Drummer Girl&apos; with a totally miscast Diane Keaton, and &apos;The Russia House&apos;, too Hollywood by half.\n\nRichard Burton turns in just about the greatest performance of his life here. He is the embodiment of the disillusioned, bitter and down-trodden ego-maniac that seems to be the basic cocktail for a spy&apos;s personality, according to LeCarré.\n\nI&apos;ve seen this film many times but just recently spotted LeCarré himself (at least it certainly looks like him) as an extra in a short scene. As Leamas is making his roundabout way to Smiley&apos;s house at 9 Bywater Street, he is exiting the first of 2 taxis. As he does so a tall, lean man in black is walking towards him. Ritt seems to be focusing the camera on this &quot;extra&quot; actor who actually makes furtive glances at Leamas. It is later revealed that Leamas has been followed by the Communists. Could LeCarré be playing that non-speaking, uncredited part of the Eastern &quot;watcher&quot; trailing Leamas to Smiley&apos;s house? Wouldn&apos;t surprise me in the least. It&apos;s a part LeCarré would have enjoyed playing, I think.\n\nAnd, like Hitchcock, LeCarré has appeared in film adaptations of his books before.\n\nClaire Bloom is excellent as the naive English communist who hasn&apos;t got a clue as to what she&apos;s supporting. The end of this film is always shocking to me. The ruthlessness of the spy-masters, the lies, the back-stabbing.... There is nothing over-blown in this film. It&apos;s all very subtle and intriguing and with the passage of time just gets more and more fascinating.\n\nHighly recommended to fans of this genre, especially LeCarré fanatics. If you haven&apos;t read his books you are missing out on perhaps the finest living writer of the English language. Some &quot;experts&quot; think his writing style is out of date because the plots are so involved and the prose so full of humor and political incorrectness; I read something to that effect in the most recent edition of the &apos;Halliwell&apos; guide. Perhaps the editor of that book has A.D.D. or something, or perhaps he&apos;s just seen to many glitzy, empty flicks designed to entertain the gawping masses, I don&apos;t know.

I don&apos;t get all the negatives posted here--this movie is laugh-out-loud funny and very underrated.  The townspeople are hilarious and the whole sequence at the end where Chevy and his wife are paying people to be on their best behavior, creating a &quot;Norman Rockwell&quot; portrait of small-town life so they can sell their house, is among the most inspired and funny sequences ever.  The whole battle of the sexes between Chevy and wife Madolyn Smith (whatever happened to her?  she&apos;s beautiful and has great comic timing) when she&apos;s successful writing a children&apos;s book, while he can&apos;t get his crime novel off the ground, is more classic material.  Goodness knows Chase didn&apos;t get very many chances to shine--besides Caddyshack and the original Vacation, this is probably his best work."

Shot during a lull in shooting Wong Kar Wai&apos;s &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, this film seems partially improvised on the spot.\n\nThere&apos;s some sort of plot but it&apos;s really an excuse for the stars to run about in crazy &quot;Persian&quot; costumes or to cross-dress. Explosion kung fu, a gorilla, a 6 ft. talking bird, a floating head, flying boots, time-reversing kung fu, a soccer match and lots of unrestrained wire fu. It begins crazy, stays crazy and ends crazy.\n\nDoes it work? The actors are having fun and that rubs off on the viewer, however I found the film&apos;s lack of a real structure tiresome. The scenes comes off more like elaborate TV skits. Lots of obscure HK film references might bore the average viewer. But to the film&apos;s credit every time I was losing interest they do something so silly I was laughing again. The energy is so high that the hit and miss nature of the whole production isn&apos;t much of a problem. The martial arts are done for comedy&apos;s sake and are really sped up.\n\nThis is one of the most extreme examples of wacky HK comedy. Not used to HK comedy? You might be advised to skip this one at first. Or get ready to watch it over the course of several viewings because it can be exhausting to watch.",

On the most recent viewing, I watched the movie much more carefully than on prior viewings, and can now see the motivations of the character(s) more clearly, and how the &apos;situation&apos; portrayed in the film spiralled out of control (click on my username to read my prior review for &quot;At Close Range,&quot; in which I questioned the actions of the villain).  On more careful viewing, the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  \n\nI want to revise my prior comment -- this is a superb film, and I&apos;ve voted again and now give this film 9/10.  If you haven&apos;t seen it, now&apos;s a great chance.  Great acting by *everyone*, especially Sean Penn and Christopher Walken (this is one of Walken&apos;s best parts ever).\n\nThe DVD version of the film just came out (I had it on preorder and received it yesterday), and I have to say how impressed I am with the transfer. Absolutely superlative, clear picture quality, although I can&apos;t evaluate the sound because I have only stereo speakers, no dolby surround.  But the video transfer itself is one of the best I&apos;ve seen for a movie this old, looking like the film might just have been made six months ago.  It appears that quite a bit of work went into restoration.  If you have a DVD player, you owe it to yourself to get this film on DVD, although the only &apos;special feature&apos; is the original theatrical trailer.  The film is offered in both widescreen and pan-and-scan formats (two-sided single-layer).\n\nRevised Review: 9/10",

When three former wives hear a version of the song done by Diana Ross,they want to sue for royalties but first each of the three women must win a court case to prove who was the real and legal wife of Frankie Lymon. The movie &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot; is a shoddy and disrespectful look into the life of Frankie Lymon. The movie is truly about these three women trying to win the royalties of the song, not to prove they really loved Frankie Lymon.  It is bad enough that Hollywood makes a movie about a black male celebrity that Hollywood always brings up the details of Lymon&apos;s drug use and points to him for the audience that he is a loser after his singing days are over. We never get a true look at Frankie Lymon and his life.Where did the movie fail in one big detail?  Lymon was not as short as the actor who portrayed him ,the talented Larenz Tate,he grew up to over six feet tall.His singing voice changed of course,he couldn&apos;t sing those sweet songs of his youth,but he had a decent voice in his adult years. But no one wanted the grown up Frankie Lymon.They wanted this little kid with the falsetto voice,not the adult Frankie Lymon and he couldn&apos;t get noticed in the new R&amp;B market that came to pass in the sixties. His story ,and the story of his former group the Teenagers,was done quite well in a PBS documentary about the group called &quot;I Promise To Remember&quot;.This was shown several years ago and it is worth while to look at about what happen to the group ,where they are now(where they were at the time of the broadcast),and and what happened to Frankie in truth.It is a well done program. The movie is not,however.Filled with profanity,the women come off as bitter uneducated jerks only going for the money.The film and the film makers in essence then to degrade the subject as a three timing drug taking failure.The film lowers itself then as the wives complain about Frankie and start the feminist cant about men in general and Frankie in particular.It doesn&apos;t bother the filmakers that Lymon&apos;s real life family has to watch him being dragged thru the mud and embarrassed and that they have to have him and themselves disgraced in this fashion. The three women got thankfully very little after in the end and the viewers of this film receive the same,very little.Frankie Lymon was not perfect,he was no saint.But this film disgraces him ,just like Bird did to Charlie Parker.In the end of the film we see the real Lymon singing &quot;Goody-Goody&quot; on a TV show.It is the only glimpse of the real Lymon in the movie.But after this film Frankie Lymon shall be looked at in one way and one way only,as a tragic disgrace."

But oh well. After seeing the film, I have to admit that it does fit more properly on a small screen where its flaws are minimized. Robby Henson - the writer/director - has a tendency to use stylish jump cuts, amateurish wipes (no one except George Lucas should EVER use wipes anymore), and sped-up shots that are at odds with the appealingly lackadaisical tone of his story. However, the acting is excellent, especially by Thornton; had the film been released in theaters, it wouldn&apos;t have been unrealistic for Lion&apos;s Gate to push him for an Oscar. That said, Arquette is also good - am I the only one who thinks she&apos;s an underrated actress? &quot;The Badge&quot; reminded me over and over of &quot;The Big Easy&quot; - which is most certainly a compliment - and while it&apos;s not the equal of that film, it does a fine job of standing on it&apos;s own two feet.",

      "reviewBody": "Just discovered this Philippine(My parents&apos; native country)-made horror movie here on IMDb as linked from Hulu. Despite the bland romantic trappings between the triangle of Francis Lederer, Richard Derr, and the buxom blonde from Denmark named Greta Thyssen, this was a pretty effective chiller during the last 30 minutes as effectively visualized by Gerardo de Leon with I&apos;m sure help from producer Eddie Romero. There&apos;s also some nice work from the natives like Oscar Keesee as the villain, his son Peyton as the innocent boy, and stunning Lilia Duran as the other hired help. And then there&apos;s the creature played by Flory Carlos who spends most of the movie wrapped in bandages. His mummy-like performance gets effective treatment due to the music by Ariston Avelino. May be most effective to maybe to those 12 and under who haven&apos;t seen anything gory yet. Certainly the &quot;buzzer&quot; that warns of a 15-second &quot;surgery&quot; scene was nothing that shocked my senses! So on that note, Terror Is a Man is worth a look for fans of old-fashioned Drive-In fare.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;S.E.R.-Svoboda Eto Rai&quot;/&quot;Freedom is paradise&quot; is an extremely bleak albeit realistic portrayal of the tough life experienced by an inmate belonging to a reform school for juvenile delinquents. Tadpoles is the name given by school authorities to young offenders whose criminal parents are also holed up in different Russian prisons. It is in such an extremely biased and hostile environment that an ingenious boy Sasha Grigoriyev undertakes an arduous journey in order to meet his father who is lodged in a faraway prison. Freedom is paradise made its appearance in 1989, a year when all the world&apos;s eyes were set on former USSR as general secretary of Russian communist party Mr.Mikhail Gorbachev had initiated &quot;Glasnost&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot;-two political policies which aimed at more &quot;openness&quot; in Russian society. It was in such a highly politically charged environment that Sergei Bodrov chose to depict the plight of Russia&apos;s undesirable, unloved and unwanted children-young delinquents about which nobody cared as they were viewed by all and sundry as a burden for civilized society in former Soviet Union. Mr.Sergei Bodrov&apos;s film is able to engage viewers as it takes into account different kinds of human sufferings. This is one reason why he did not neglect the portrayal of the suffering experienced by Sasha&apos;s father-an unfortunate man who has been deprived of his right of parenting on some flimsy grounds. However, it is Sasha&apos;s journey to see his unknown father which is viewed as this film&apos;s most crucial element which manages to have a firm grip of viewers&apos; attention. This effect is achieved aesthetically as Mr.Sergei Bodrov gives his film a unique feel of documentary as well as feature film elements. It is precisely this &apos;eye for details&apos; which enables viewers to empathize with all the problems which Sasha experiences in order to embrace his father. Lastly, a word of advice to viewers-in many ways, Freedom is paradise can be put into the same category of films which dealt with young criminals namely Los Olvidados, Pixote etc but this film emerges as a different film as it conveys its message while being entertaining for all.",

He&apos;s at his wits end until, that is, his porcine neighbour and investor &quot;Pauline&quot; declares that she has a cunning plan and that they are all to rendezvous at the railway station next morning. That&apos;s where they encounter the visionary inventor &quot;Albert Einswine&quot; who has developed an highly secret &quot;superseed&quot; that can thrive anywhere. Could this be salvation for &quot;Biff&quot;? Well not when it&apos;s stolen - and he is deemed to be the prime suspect. &quot;Albert&quot; now summons the legendary investigator &quot;Agatha Christensen&quot; who enlists the assistance of the accused man&apos;s children &quot;Clara&quot; and &quot;Gavin&quot; who are keen amateur sleuths - so maybe they can get to the bottom of the mystery before prison beckons for dad? It&apos;s quite a fun animal-animation this. The story, set largely aboard a train, moves along quickly and there are a few twists and turns as we go along. It is clear with it&apos;s message - if it looks too good to be true, then it probably is - and I quite enjoyed it for what is an admittedly over-long eighty minutes that has a friendly and engaging Aardman look to it.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake&apos;s in &quot;Edison.&quot; I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in &quot;Patton,&quot; or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But that is almost beside the point.\n\nTimberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. I used to have problems with Ben Affleck&apos;s acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like &quot;The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors,&quot; he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. It simply will not fly.\n\nHowever, Timberlake alone isn&apos;t to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I&apos;m surprised he was as good) LL Cool J. I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.\n\nThere is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief. A pleasure, if you will. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.\n\nBut enough of Timberlake bashing - words aren&apos;t enough in this particular case to do the trick. &quot;Edison&quot; is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. It&apos;s plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. I do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which I interpret as an homage to films like &quot;Serpico,&quot; or &quot;Donnie Brasco,&quot; or maybe even &quot;Chinatown.&quot; Don&apos;t get me wrong - &quot;Edison&quot; is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.\n\nThe script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. Yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is wasted here) and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawson&apos;s Creek episode. It&apos;s your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let&apos;s-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. This dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like &quot;Edison&quot; wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).\n\nThinking about it, &quot;Edison&quot; is a curiosity. It&apos;s sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply doesn&apos;t work. In film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. Directors must make tough choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don&apos;t seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. And it&apos;s not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.",

      "reviewBody": "RENDEZ-VOUS comes from Téchinés &apos;romantic&apos; period of the 70s and early 80s, comprising of BAROCCO, LES SOEURS BRONTE and HOTEL DES AMERIQUES. Of these four films RENDEZ-VOUS is without doubt the most worthwhile and successful.\n\nIn her first leading role Juliette Binoche is a revelation as Nina a provincial girl who has moved to Paris in order to pursue an acting career. She becomes involved with two vastly different men the gentle Paulo (Wadeck Stanckzac) and the dangerous and intense Quentin (Lambert Wilson).\n\nUnpredictable and provocative this girl bounces between both men. However her whole world falls apart when one of them commits suicide. Cast in a production of Romeo and Juliet by the compelling Scrutzler (Jean Louis Trintignant) this young girl begins to confront her own behaviour and psychology.\n\nTéchiné&apos;s brief film is full of themes about female artistic urgency.\n\nIs there anything this girl will do in life that she will not do on stage.\n\nShould there be? What is the dynamic that drives such an ambitious yet lost girl. the film deals superbly with all these ideas without ever resorting to simplae answers. Aided by Binoche&apos;s fearless performance the film is incredibly emotional and romantic, helped in no small part by a stunning Phillippe Sarde score.\n\nRENDEZ-VOUS is an intense and at time difficult film, but it is worth every effort to begin to explore this girls psychological motivations.",

This film reinforces for me that the answer is &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; -- i.e., &quot;it depends&quot; ... on the cause, on the specific tactics, and ultimately on personal points of view.\n\nIF A TREE FALLS added an interesting angle for me in this notion of the positive/negative net effect of radicalism. I had never thought about the impact of law enforcement&apos;s treatment of the radical groups -- i.e., do their tactics (brutal in many cases toward environmental protesters) help or hinder THEIR cause? As I watched the film, I wondered if there were disagreements about tactics/approaches within law enforcement akin to the disagreements within the ELF and the broader environmental activist community.\n\nAnd that&apos;s what makes this film so strong and effective. It prompts you to ask a lot of questions. IF A TREE FALLS does it in a way that is character driven. The broader story unfolds through the stories of individuals who were involved. The result is that you (the audience) get involved!\n\nI highly recommend the film. And like me, you may want to revisit THE THIN BLUE LINE and FIGHT CLUB after you see IF A TREE FALLS."

As always mentioned the plot does get confusing at times, but then that&apos;s not unusual for giallo movies (repeated viewings can be beneficial).These films are often more concerned with the look &amp; this one does not disappoint. Nicely &amp; stylish filmed, great soundtrack, beautiful women &amp; some gruesome murders, though they aren&apos;t as gory as some other giallos. What I really liked was that it added a lot of gothic horror - much of it takes place inside the castle - and also that there is less emphasis on the police investigation, which I feel can drag some films down.  There are better giallo movies, there are also worse but this is a good example &amp; well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Long Distance starts shakily enough. Monica Keena (who it took me a while to remember as Rachel from &quot;Undeclared&quot;) plays Nicole Freeman, a recently-jilted post-grad Psych major working on her thesis in a run-down former middle-school-now-apartment-building in Boston (great quirky/creepy locale, by the way). One night she accidentally misdials a number and gets a call back from the guy she reached, who happens to be a serial killer on a cross-country rampage headed for...well, you know.\n\nNicole goes through a series of phone exercises at the beginning of the film that are now very familiar to all those who&apos;ve seen Scream and its many predecessors and progenitors. These calls are much of the usual mental torment/mind f*** crap, and they don&apos;t really hold the menace they need to relay. This trope is getting so old, it&apos;s really hard to make this scenario seem anything but a parody. Keena&apos;s acting, which is middling at best --- she seems, if anything, a bit too young for the part --- doesn&apos;t help.\n\nStill, Long Distance isn&apos;t badly written. There&apos;s something vaguely enticing about a woman who&apos;s sucked into playing live &quot;bait&quot; for a wacko on a nationwide trek. It&apos;s worked by the screenwriters with an almost playwright&apos;s inventiveness. It keeps you watching and if you analyze the script in retrospect, it&apos;s actually pretty clever in the placement of clues that set up the plausibility-stretching denouement.\n\nBut that&apos;s really the crux of the problem with this overall earnest, well-intentioned shoestring indie: you shouldn&apos;t *have* to go back and put the pieces together...they should make more of an impact the first time you experience them.\n\nI&apos;m giving this one high marks more for what it could have been than what it is, but I&apos;d caution you...it&apos;s not for the unobservant or those who need a big-picture sheen on their thrills.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was actually made before &quot;Operation: Condor.&quot;  For some reason, they titled this movie as if it were a sequel.  When Jackie decided to make this movie, he was being greatly influenced by the smash hit &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; and wanted to make a movie in that adventure style.  This movie could have been really, really great if it had been made entirely the way Jackie had it envisioned at the start of production.  \n\nThe movie has a great beginning, and then it is destroyed by an agonizing slow middle, and then it picks up again with an action packed ending.  The reason the movie has that horrible middle is because of the stunt that went wrong at the beginning of the film.  As all Jackie fans know, this is the film that almost killed Chan.  In the beginning action sequence, he does this awesome chase scene where he is bounding across the walls of a castle. In the first take, Jackie actually made it across.  But being a perfectionist, he tried for a second take.  The first take partially broke the branch of the tree he jumps on, and on the second take, the branch broke completely, sending Jackie crashing to the ground and busting his head on a rock. \n\nI am mentioning all this because this is the reason the middle of the movie is so slow.  Production could only be halted for a short time.  They could not wait until Jackie had fully recovered.  So, as soon as he was able to get out of bed, they re-wrote the middle part of the movie to exclude all the eye-popping stunts that Jackie had originally planned.  They continued filming this lame, muddled attempt at a romance plot until Jackie was more healed.  \n\nOnce Jackie was back to 100 percent, they started filming the movie the way they had originally intended:  with amazing stunts and incredible action choreography.  The end of the movie picks up with Jackie, his side kick, and the love interest, infiltrating a castle run by monks, and they try to steal a treasure guarded by fiesty amazon women who wear lots of &apos;80s style makeup.  As ridiculous as that all sounds, the fight scenes at the end are among the best that Jackie has ever done.  Its really amazing and a lot of fun to watch just for the choreography aspect.  Check out one of the hardest hits I have ever seen, when one of the amazons comes flying at Jackie from about 8 feet in the air, he kicks her in mid flight, and she spins completely around and slams HEAD FIRST in to the dirt!  I don&apos;t care if there was a stunt pad there, it is a HARD LANDING!  OUCH!  There is no way the stunt person walked away from that unharmed.  \n\nThe second movie &quot;OPERATION CONDOR&quot; was a lot better as a whole.  That is one of my all time favorite Jackie Chan films, and I still watch it over and over again.  But PART 2 (the first of the films) is definitely a must-see (despite the confusing title).  \n\nMy recommendation is this:  Get the movie, watch the first part until he escapes from the natives, then FAST FORWARD through the entire\n\nmiddle, DO NOT BOTHER to watch it, it is totally irrelevant, and start watching again as they infiltrate the castle.  You wont be sorry.  Don&apos;t believe all the other bad reviews about this film.",

He puts an ad in the papers and it&apos;s a parade of wrong music. His Elvis loving dad (Colm Meaney) doesn&apos;t get it. Sax playing Dean Fay (Félim Gormley) is the first brought into the band. Billy Mooney (Dick Massey) is the drummer. Jimmy gets Natalie Murphy (Maria Doyle Kennedy), Imelda Quirke (Angeline Ball) and Bernie McGloughlin (Bronagh Gallagher) as the backup singers. After watching a drunken Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) sing at the wedding, he gets him as the lead singer. Joey &quot;The Lips&quot; Fagan (Johnny Murphy) is the womanizing experienced trumpet player who comes up with their name &quot;The Commitments&quot;. He hires the volatile Mickah Wallace (Dave Finnegan) as their security.\n\nThis is fun. It&apos;s great music. The cast is mostly musicians trying their hands at acting. Some of them would become quite interesting. It&apos;s based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle&apos;s lower class Barrytown trilogy. It&apos;s heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life. The movie could have ended with something predictable but this way it&apos;s poetry.",

      "reviewBody": "This story, set in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, has the look of a very poor television production. The acting is of average TV quality. With their nicely pressed doublets and jerkins, everyone looks set for the big Mediaeval Pageant, put on for the tourists every summer at the local schloss.\n\n&quot;Iron Hand&quot; was theoretically directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner, but he seems to have been napping most of the time. More about him presently.\n\nThe dialogue is so simple, this movie would make a good subject for students in German class. &quot;Listen, and you will understand German&quot; as our old school training films used to say. Optimistically. Stilted acting is actually a boon when you are simply trying to follow what the knights and comely damozels are saying.\n\nDuring the course of the story, our hero Götz is referred to as &quot;mit der eisernen Faust&quot;, that is, &quot;Iron Fist&quot;. That would certainly have made a poorer title for the English version, creating a false impression in fact. Götz is a good guy.\n\nSupposedly, this film is based on Goethe&apos;s play, Goethe of course being the author of &quot;Faust&quot; (with his bargain) and &quot;Werther&quot; (with his sorrows). Reference works call his &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot; a &quot;massive prose drama&quot; and an &quot;attempt to emulate the Shakespearean history play&quot;. His &quot;Götz&quot; is not much in evidence here.\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon world, this film&apos;s director, Wolfgang Liebeneiner, is best known for his infamous Nazi propaganda film, &quot;Ich klage an&quot; (1941), which softened up the German public to the idea of euthanasia for psychiatric patients, and, hence, for other mental patients and surplus people in general. Liebeneiner did not receive any special preferential treatment after the war; most Nazi film directors continued working. Let&apos;s see. A director makes a Faustian bargain with Hitler during the war, so afterwards ... he gets paid to make movies about Goethe. Something in this analogy isn&apos;t working quite right.\n\n(A production note: The costumes and weapons in &quot;Iron Hand&quot; came from a company based in &quot;Rom und Florenz&quot;. Frankly I was surprised that they would have to go all the way to Italy.)",

It is not just charm and whimsy and genuine laughs though it has those in buckets - it is a real plot, and a solid caper movie to boot. By building on an ingenious crime element and real plotting it has turned from a sentimental journey to something more. As an avid reader of the books as a child, the main worry is the spirit of the bear who believes in the good in everyone, while creating untold chaos around him, will get lost to serve the storyline or some idea of updating Paddington. Luckily, none of the spirit is lost, and instead, we have an immensely enjoyable, fun, funny, and charming film. The whole family loved it - and we all laughed, cried, and cheered. Just be sure to stay seated for the credits. A really excellent children&apos;s film.",

I do not know. but I think than Lluis Homer can be more credible in this kind of role and the art of Paz Vegas is not indicated for a shadow - role."

That half hour-plus sequence smacks of generic porn, but watched as a whole the trilogy is invigorating grafting of a sci-fi plot and SPFX onto a porno film.\n\nOne sequence missing from the condensed version (issued in 2009 as Private Classics 4: The Uranus Experiment) is a lesbian tryst between astronaut Siliva Saint an Russian sexology professor Cristina Dark.\n\nOther sexual highlights here include an anal sex scene for Dark and two deleted &quot;sex in the stacks&quot; library scenes where Russian femme spies of the KGB get humped by American officers. These appear only as Deleted scenes in the Bonus section of the newest DVD compilation version.\n\nThe KGB skulduggery climaxing in a sexy waitress spiking the champagne at the party celebrating the return home of the successful astronauts and cosmonauts seems like something out of a crappy Carlos Tobalina orgy movie from 30 years back. Giving the Russians the ultimate victory (and embarrassment to the long-suffering US President, who is cast by director Millerman to resemble Jack Kemp (!)) is one heartwarming touch of this wild and expensive experiment in sci-fi meets porn."

It was amazing!\n\nThe American title is &quot;Magnet of Doom.&quot; Before I saw the film, I thought, &quot;This is the best movie title ever. There&apos;s no way the film can live up to it. And not only does it live up to it, but it exceeds it in every way!\n\nDown and out boxer Jean-Paul Belmondo is hired to drive a disgraced, on-the-run, banker Charles Vanel across the backroads of the US, from NYC to New Orleans, in Kennedy-era 1962, kind of like a proto-&quot;Green Book&quot;... except &quot;The Green Book&quot; sucks and &quot;L&apos;Aine des Ferchaux&quot; is amazing!\n\nI loved seeing the cold/stoic characters of French Film Noir thrown into the over-the-top world that&apos;s also occupied by American films like &quot;Cool Hand Luke,&quot; &quot;Midnight Cowboy,&quot; &quot;Easy Rider,&quot; Tennessee Williams, and even &quot;Hurry, Sundown.&quot; It&apos;s film noir, it&apos;s a road trip, and it&apos;s also a fantastic widescreen/color travelogue of JFK-era US in 1962. Belmondo even visits Sinatra&apos;s home in Hoboken, and he brawls with toughs in a diner, like Rock Hudson does in &quot;Giant.&quot; Much of the dialogue is in English, too.\n\nEuropean directors sometimes pick up on little nuances of Americana that American filmmakers miss. Here, I&apos;m thinking of this film, but also of Wim Wenders&apos; &quot;Paris, Texas.&quot; This film is full of small details that only a European outsider would notice (Melville is definitely fetishizing Chevrolets, roadside motels, lady hitchhikers, and American rock and roll), plus a few comedic set-pieces that seem to be right out of David Lynch or John Waters.\n\nThe score by Georges Delerue is excellent, and it stays in your head, long after the film is over.\n\nThis film is sometimes left out of Melville retrospectives, because it&apos;s less somber than some of his other films, and I guess Melville purists don&apos;t like it. I enjoy the director&apos;s other movies, but I also really liked this one a lot. Entertaining and fun, from beginning to end.",

      "reviewBody": "THE OX-BOW INCIDENT was never considered a success at the time of release, especially by studio mogul Darryl F. Zanuck who never considered a film a success of any kind if it lost at the box-office. However, over the years it has become an artistic success with fans who appreciate good movie-making when they see it.\n\nThe performances are all first rate--particularly HENRY FONDA as the not too bright drifter who opposes the lynching mob, Harry Morgan as his rather slow witted sidekick, Frank Conroy as the General with the weakling son (William Eythe), and most importantly, DANA ANDREWS, who has the most riveting role in the whole film and makes the most of it. His is the outstanding contribution, sensitive and gripping. The story is based on a true incident that happened in Montana in the late 1880s--and, of course, one that could have happened anywhere in the old West.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to see why it was not a commercial success. Except for Fonda, there are no other major stars in the cast for marquee value. Neither Dana Andrews nor Anthony Quinn had yet achieved star status. The story is grim and downright sobering, dwelling, as it does, on man&apos;s inhumanity to man. The Paul Hurst character, who makes various mocking gestures with his hangman&apos;s knot, adds to the grim gloominess of all the proceedings. Hurst (who played the Yankee deserter in GWTW) was almost always cast as a villainous lug.\n\nThe night scenes involving the hanging seem to take place on a studio soundstage but somehow it doesn&apos;t matter. Nothing distracts from the taut realism of the drama once we know that the lynching is definitely going to be carried out. Afterwards, the knowledge that the man they allegedly hanged is not dead, comes as a twist that drives home the senselessness of what their mob mentality has done.\n\nMary Beth Hughes has a decorative role as the only feminine interest in the film--except for an uncredited bit by Margaret Hamilton and an unusually grim and unsympathetic role for Jane Darwell.\n\nWell worth watching, a message picture that delivers without being preachy. My only complaint is that the letter Fonda reads at the end could have been simpler and less eloquent for the sake of realism and in keeping with the naturalness of Dana Andrew&apos;s performance. Complementing Andrew&apos;s work is a nice, sympathetic performance by character actor Harry Davenport as the man who tries hard to prevent the hanging.\n\nOtherwise, everything is right on the mark. Well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Produced as Ronald Getty&apos;s (son of J.Paul Getty) venture into motion pictures it attempted to explore a subject that had up to its point only been explored through the explosion of the German airship Hindenburg.  It attempted to tell the story of loyalties with the then current anti-military fashion (petty drum rolls when the more dramatic and militaristic &quot;We Sail Against England&quot; was originally written would have provided a contrast needed).\n\nSince the general public&apos;s reaction to a philo-German film was unknown it was thought that any overt militarism (such as the &quot;Blue Max&quot;) should be down because the subject matter of Zeppelins without swastikas (i.e., The Hindenburg) was an unknown commodity thus a safe course was taken and downed played and thus weakening the film.  Originally, scenes of epic battles waging beneath the skies of blue were considered and deleted.\n\nIn a story meeting Bob Wise&apos;s underplay of German militarism in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was argued as the public&apos;s desire to see Germania topics -- as fodder for story antagaonists without their significance.\n\nIt remains at least to me an attempt to discuss loyalty, love&apos;s betrayal and history on a very very limited budget.\n\nI remember researching it with dad.  What interested Getty was that his father&apos;s oil company furnished Germany&apos;s airships during the First World War.  His contribution despite his then titanic sums available to him for a variety of reasons was very modest.  Rumor had it J. Paul called Jack Warner and was concerned that his son was investing in movies and what could he expect...  Ronald should however be commended because without his involvement no film on zeppelin would have been made at all (of the very limited collection of zeppelin films thus far).\n\nThe film could have used an injection of drama that was unfortunately out of vogue during the time of its production.  This sounds like an excuss but one must remember it took &quot;Patton&quot; ten years to be produced out of similiar concerns.  It was private money after all...\n\nTo dad... thanks for the memory ol&apos; fella will miss ya...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Volga Boatman&quot; is an interesting film if only for a better idea of the capabilities of William Boyd, an actor known to most only as &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;.  Boyd, as a DeMille discovery and contract player was in many of DeMille&apos;s films for his own studio, after Paramount and before his 3 year stint at M.G.M.  DeMille loved Russian affectations at the time, even to wearing Cossack shirts when on his country home called &quot;The Paradise Ranch&quot;. The long-standing tradition of eschewing accurate wardrobe in order to appeal to a more contemporary audience is very noticeable in this film. The designer, Adrian, chose (or was directed to choose) decidedly late 1920&apos;s fashions for this film.  These are not the high waisted hobble skirts of the period, and do not resemble photographs of the women of the Russian royal family whose fashion sense seemed to be closer to the turn of the century rather than 1914-1918.  The scenes in which the upper class men and women are pulling the wagons through the mud in their evening clothes reveals the short hemlines and t-strap high heeled shoes so popular in the nineteen-twenties.  That the women&apos;s clothes are beautiful is beside the point.  DeMille was a populist and rather liked being in the forefront of fashion so that the &quot;Volga&quot; wardrobe doesn&apos;t contribute to the realism of the film."

The film is absolutely stunning. \n\nNiels Mueller has such a sure and masterful hand in directing that belies the fact that this is his theatrical directorial debut. He directs with a flair that is never gimmicky and the film is pitch perfect without a single false note (helped in part by the tight script by Mueller and Kevin Kennedy and the elegant editing). The scenes hum with a slowburn intensity and gradually build up a momentum that lunges to the film&apos;s explosive final act.\n\nThis young director is one to watch. \n\nSean Penn gave a powerful and nuanced performance that explores the whole range of his acting personas. This IS the towering performance of his career. Excellent supporting work from Naomi Watts, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson and a scene-stealing Michael Wincott.",

A lot of the plot feels like a rehash of Hitchcock, but it&apos;s done incredibly well, and hey, if you&apos;re going to steal from someone, might as well steal from the best.\n\nThe twists and turns really work, and take the viewer along for the ride as well. You&apos;ll find your own mind working along with the script, trying to unravel the mystery.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame this film didn&apos;t receive more publicity, as all the elements are there for this to have been a real hit. Instead, it remains one of my favorite little gems of a film... one of those that few people know about, but when they see it they think it&apos;s a great film as well.\n\nAn added bonus is that the home video version contains a few minutes of extra &quot;steamy&quot; scenes that were cut from theaters.\n\nI think this film is an underappreciated modern-day classic, and I urge everyone to check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite its obvious shortcomings...this early 60&apos;s Italian horror film is compelling for reasons other than ranking high on the fright index. The Vampire and The Ballerina is frankly anything but horrifying for the most part. Although, the expressionistic black and white photography lends the film a surreal and hypnotic quality that can&apos;t be dismissed. This is NOT your classical vampire flick. Thank God. Having endured the relentless tedium of countless Hammer vampire horror films, I can be grateful for that fact alone. No, the performances are not stellar but given the cheesecake Euro-babe thrust of the movie, they didn&apos;t have to be. The convoluted storyline is something David Lynch would appreciate. And so is the fixation on visual imagery such as the storm winds whipping those mysterious trees repeatedly whenever there is a hint of menace. The effective contrasts of shadow and light throughout the film does create a certain surreal moodiness that renders the need to frighten meaningless. It was simply enough for this viewer to be swept away by a tide of tight black leotards and fishnet stockings. A fetishistic confession? Perhaps...although what red-blooded vampire could possibly resist the urge to pray on a troupe of jazz-dancing nymphets posing as ballerinas?",

I personally like the 50&apos;s stuff in it, but I am also a huge 80&apos;s fan (the present in the movie) and the future is just hilarious. Of course...it has been almost two decades since this movie came out, and now we know that the future that is shown in BTTF 2 is a bit funny, but hey...do you remember Total Recall? Now THAT is also a future that would never see daylight, but at least the BTTF 2 future is amusing.\n\nI have seen this movie over a dozen times, and I tried to find things that don&apos;t match, movie mistakes etc. (yes..I am a pain in the ..)but the thing is, I KNOW that there are mistakes (like reflections in window glass) but this movie keeps your mind drifting away, enchanted by the great story and great moments. Of course Spielberg never intended to have more ingredients then the past (50&apos;s), the present and the future. But almost 20 years later...it is also a (another) great movie to see what the 80&apos;s were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70&apos;s)\n\nI recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can&apos;t watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence.\n\nHave fun! (I recommend the trilogy box, you can purchase it anywhere)",

But how long can they keep it up?\n\nOther reviewers focus on the film&apos;s long pedigree. So let&apos;s focus on the movie.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is Fred Clark. This is no insult to Martin or Lewis. Clark and supporting actors like him stole many a movie. Not being leading men gave them more time to think up ways of honing their characterizations to dagger points.\n\nDean Martin does what he has to: look good and sing well. A little Jerry Lewis goes a long way. And this movie is a long haul with him. One wonders what Janet Leigh did wrong to find herself buried amongst the scene stealers.\n\nMartin and Lewis made better movies. They also made worse movies. I prefer their shorter features to get less fed up with Lewis. At least this film&apos;s pedigree means it has a better-than-usual plot for the stars."

      "reviewBody": "(EDIT): As of 2005, this was my introduction to Herzog, and a fitting one. As a documentary I watched by him about a 16th century composer, it was captivating, strange, and of a certain macabre style that is probably in much of Herzog&apos;s work. I&apos;d heard of his films Aguirre, the Wrath of God, and Fitzcerraldo, both with stories that boggle the mind with their approach on life and dark subject matter (he&apos;s also worked with Klaus Kinski, a rather eccentric actor, if one can point out as such). \n\nThis film, Gesualdo, puts focus on the 16th century composer in a fashion like Godard did with the Rolling Stones in Sympathy for the Devil. Half of the film is just music playing, giving an idea of what the musicians had to do. The other half skims the line between fiction and documentary, as the director sets up staged scenes to add to the deliberate atmosphere. It&apos;s still a documentary, but only in that you see it in the documentary style- some of this is scripted (likely).\n\nThe story of Gesualdo in and of itself could have made for a terrifying, awesome bio-pic from Herzog, but hearing the history anyway is fascinating enough. The composer of concertos was a Don in Italy, who in between composing his strange harmonies killed his first wife and child, and lived in exile for many years, including the last few of his life. There is the usual scholarly type who gives information about his life, but then there are also local historians, locals of the area, chefs, caretakers, and the buildings where he once lived and held his grand, renaissance-era parties and gatherings. The climax of the film- a celebration out in the streets, is something to see. It&apos;s not a long film at one hour, but it&apos;s worth the view.",

      "name": "Charming, character driven drama",
      "reviewBody": "Thomas McCarthy&apos;s second film, after the charming Station Agent, is a quiet, hard look at several different aspects of humanity. The Visitor centers on Walter Vale, masterfully portrayed by Richard Jenkins. A solemn economics teacher, he spends his time pretending to write on his book and learn piano. Walter finds himself in New York on business and runs into two illegal immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira who were tricked into renting his apartment. Tarek and Walter strike up an unusual friendship when Tarek begins to teach Walter how to play the drums. This is interrupted by Tarek&apos;s arrest and detention while it is decided whether he will be deported or not. Soon Walter is joined by Tarek&apos;s mother Mouna.\n\nThe Visitor is a wonderful piece that brings together some of the best performances I have seen this year. McCarthy disarms us with wry humor, quiet wit, and a meditative pace and before we know it we&apos;ve found ourselves immersed. When the credits have rolled, however, it&apos;s not so much the plot that stays with us as the characters. The most perplexing and fascinating character is Walter Vale. The transformation undergone by his character is done perfectly, the changes are noticeable but not intrusive. Tarek and Zainab who have only a handful of scenes together, manage to share incredible chemistry. Hiam Abbass, as Tarek&apos;s mother, deepens the connection between the characters, almost filling in the cracks to complete a whole.\n\nAt first glance, the Visitor seems political in nature. Thomas McCarthy has actually said that was not true, the deportation aspect of the film actually came into the script later in the process. The Visitor, instead of political aspirations, merely seeks to show us that anyone can change your life and that change is all around us and is indeed a good thing.\n\nIn the end, Thomas McCarthy succeeds in bringing capturing the humor, tragedy, and change of the human experience in his new film. Brought to life by incredibly stirring performances, particularly Richard Jenkins, the Visitor is the most emotionally powerful film to light up the big screen in a while.",

      "name": "Thrilling and rousing  film in which Rock Hudson is dispatched to a dangerous mission to rescue a spy artifact",
      "reviewBody": "Spectacular film about Cold War filmed mostly in study that won two Academy Award nominations : Cinematography and special visual effects. Captain James Ferraday (this was Rock Hudson&apos;s favourite film of his own, and also of Howard Hughes ; Charlton Heston was originally offered the role but turned it down, saying there was no characterization in the script) , Commander of the nuclear submarine called USS Tigershark, is assigned to the polar ice region on a rescue mission when an emergency signal is heard from a research station, Ice Station Zebra (in real life, there was no &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, but there was an &quot;Ice Station Alpha&quot; which was situated in a Arctic&apos;s Ice Island). On board there is a civilian and possibly a spy named David Jones (Laurence Harvey was originally cast in Patrick McGoohan&apos;s role) , whose orders are dark . Ferraday doesn&apos;t like being kept in the secret but Jones is strongly secretive and doesn&apos;t give much away . Along the way, they collect two additional passengers, a Russian veteran named Boris Vaslov (the recently deceased Ernest Borgnine) , likely also a spy, and an African-American Marine Captain (Jim Brown) . Based on the novel (1963) by Alistair MacLean, Scottish author of Best-seller novels such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; . It&apos;s one of two Alistair MacLean filmed adaptations released in 1968, the other was ¨Where Eagles Dare¨. Changes made from the Alistair MacLean source novel of the same name for this film included the name of the nuclear submarine, the Dolphin, which was re-named the USS Tigerfish and the names of two characters: Submarine Commander Swanson became Commander Ferraday and spy Dr. Carpenter became David Jones . \n\nIt is one of the most thrilling and exciting films set on the years of the Cold War. Great superproduction with all-star-cast , impressive scenes , shimmer photography and a vibrant sound , the time has increased its documentary value. The acting of the interesting characters is believable and convincing, especially by Patrick McGoohan and the Russian Colonel well played by Alf Kjellin . Special appearance by Lloyd Nolan and film debut for Ron Masak .The film&apos;s story has similarities with the real life events, reported in the media in April 1959, of the Discoverer II experimental Corona satellite capsule that went missing and was recovered by Soviet intelligence agents after it crashed near Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean ; Spitsbergen is in Norway&apos;s Svalbard archipelago of islands which is where both Alistair MacLean &apos;s novel and the film of Bear Island is set. The screenplay has eloquent dialogue, continuous tension and surprising twists that keep the viewer&apos;s attention .The soundtrack by singer and French composer Michel Legrand -&quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;- , is full of vibrant sound , brings a solemn score, cutting edge, played by an orchestra of wind . Colorful cinematography in glimmer color by Daniel Fapp. Unique and innovative underwater camera equipment was developed for this movie by 2nd unit cameraman and cinematographer &apos;John M Stephens&apos;, a former U.S.A. Navy diver, who is billed in the credits for additional arctic photography , the camera system enabled the first ever filming of a continuous submarine dive and this technical innovation produced some outstanding photography for the picture.\n\nThe visual effects, despite its quality, not &apos;see that snow is artificial, that the landscape of the polar station is mounted on set ; his picture is the first of two movies based on an Alistair MacLean novel set in rugged icy and snowy terrain , the second would be Bear Island about eleven years later. John Sturges&apos; filmmaking is absorbent and entertaining , a good job , It&apos;s one of two filmed Alistair MacLean adaptations directed by Sturges , the other was ¨The Satan Bug¨ made and released about three years earlier . The production shoot for ¨Ice Station Zebra¨ went for nineteen weeks, from Spring 1967 until October 1967. Rating : Very good , wholesome seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "O.K., O.K., I must take some exception with the two prior reviews in this thread.  Bikini Beach has a lot more going for it those pieces implied.\n\nFirst, Frankie Avalon finally earned his AIP pay in this picture.  While I really don&apos;t care for his 60s greaser college kid character in most of the other beach Party movies, here his dual roles (as &quot;Frankie&quot; the surfer who takes Dee Dee (Annette) for granted and as English invasion artist the &quot;Potato Bug&quot;) are enjoyable to watch.  He shows his reach as an actor far beyond what one would expect in a B movie like this.\n\nSecondly, for anyone interested in the history of drag racing, the strip scenes are interesting; textbook mid 60s drag environment.  Few if any other examples of that are available in American film.\n\nThird, the music.  Much better than what was in the movie that preceded it (&quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; was one of the weakest of the series in terms of music) and many that followed.  In Bikini Beach, you get to hear Annette sing a duet of a Styner-Hemrick ballad (&quot;Because You&apos;re You&quot;) with Avalon that is good (if you have a copy of her Bikini Beach LP, her solo version of this song on it is arguably one of the most hauntingly beautiful recordings she ever made).  The &quot;house club band&quot; at Big Daddy&apos;s in this film is the Pyramids, arguably one of the better now-forgotten west coast groups that played the role of the house band in these movies.  Their instrumental version of &quot;Fingertips&quot; is classic early 60&apos;s surf instrumental.  And a very young Stevie Wonder actually appears at the end.\n\nFourth, the infamous Candy Johnson (the fringe-wearing, wild blond go-go dancer character who, with the swish of her hips, could put a man in a daze and send him flying through the air) finally comes of age in this movie, the club fight scenes actually feature her.  As do the closing credits, where she fractures the camera lens at the end.\n\nDoes all this make &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; a work of art?  Heavens. no, but it&apos;s a heck of a lot better than Muscle Beach Party, Pajama Party, How to Stuff a Wild Bikini and the Ghost in the Invisible Bikini.  In other words, out of the seven AIP Beach Party Movies, this is definitely in the top two or three (only bettered by Beach Blanket Bingo and arguably Beach Party)."

      "reviewBody": "Well, i&apos;m extremely pleased I saw this film when I had the chance. I managed to see it late one night on &apos;Film Four Extreme&apos;, not knowing what i&apos;d be in for. I was expecting a cheap zombie effort that I would have to force myself to sit through. But I was wrong!\n\nFirst of all I have not seen the newly &apos;dubbed&apos; version of this film and do not wish to either. I have seen two different versions which different subtitles. The first was on &apos;Film four&apos; which seemed to have been translated by someone british, I could tell because most of the slang was british. The other version of subtitiling is from the HK region 0 DVD and NOT the newly release US version of this film which I think has the dubbing. The DVD subtitling isn&apos;t great because some of it is translated very poorly, whereas the &apos;Film four&apos; version of this is grammar perfect.\n\nFrom the very opening shots of the film I actually found myself laughing! Could this be!? A horror film that is actually truly funny and isn&apos;t &apos;Return of the Living Dead&apos;! Two characters called &apos;Crazy Bee&apos; and  &apos;Woody Invincible&apos; work at a VCD shop in a neon like indoor mall, and accidently run into this person in their car which is inevitably a zombie. They take the body back to the mall in the trunk of their car only to release that its missing and starting all kinds of trouble in the mall. That&apos;s the basic plot from there without giving anything away. But I assure you, you&apos;ll find yourself laughing! There are some classic moments in it.\n\n Now, for the Zombie genre horror people out there I still suggest checking this out. As far as I know there are few zombie films out there that seem to be able to work with comedy. A couple that spring to mind are &apos;Return of the Living Dead&apos; and &apos;Brain Dead&apos;. Although Bio Zombie may not be as good as either of these in effects, its still an equally great zombie film. There are minimal gore scenes and no truly amazing SFX but it doesn&apos;t let it&apos;s low budget appereance hurt the film at all. Still there are some great gore scenes, such as the &apos;tap in the face&apos; where Bee jams a tap pipe into a zombies head and turns on the fawcett and blood comes out the end! Not to mention a scene with a drill in the mouth! There are good points to be had for the true zombie genre horror fan. If you do get the chance to see this on &apos;Film four&apos; then I suggest you do, because this version of the subtitles are a lot better."

The extraordinary Ponette has a four yr old subject and hones in on one other overriding topic- death- as understood by the 4 yr. old.\n\nBut The Girl has no focus on any one subject other than its heroine; it documents her day to day life as she, through accident(others&apos;) and intention(hers), is left at home to fend for herself during a significant stretch of her 10th summer. While resourceful and independent,this thin pale redhead is also emotionally walled off from the world. She watches, and you watch her watch.Her wanderings around her rural small town Swedish environs- teach her both the negative &apos;lessons&apos; of cruel peers and weak adults, and the joys possible with kind strangers and simple friends. While not a children&apos;s film, it would be excellent for family viewing and discussion.",

Certainly, Glenn Ford, Ricardo Montalban and Joseph Cotton (all then under contract to MGM) were strictly drawing paychecks. This movie SHOULD be seen a reminder of sexual attitudes to which we should NEVER return.

I chose this one because I liked several of the cast members and it sounded like it had some promise. I was right - it had some promise. Unfortunately it never delivered more than a few moments. The uncredited Woody Allen may have demanded his name be removed. A few of his scenes were among those that delivered. Dennis Leary&apos;s scenes delivered most frequently and Alan Cumming hit the mark about half the time. I was so disappointed by John Turturro and Sigourney Weaver. Perhaps it is because they are so closely wrapped around the character played by Douglas McGrath. I don&apos;t know if it is the basic premise (english teacher with all consuming dream to rid the world of bad grammar turned CIA agent) or just his ability to deliver it. I suspect both. I grew annoyed with the premise and in between &quot;comic facial expression here&quot; he seemed to have a cardboard appearance.\n\nIf we had been snowbound for a month we would not have watched this again. As I review Sigourney Weaver&apos;s and John Turturro&apos;s previous films, I know they can be SO much better but perhaps if you&apos;re in a dog you just have to act like one. I don&apos;t know why everyone associated with this film said yes. Were they that bored, broke, desperate, owed someone a favor, being blackmailed? The only person I can see who must have been happy was Douglas Mcgrath - having been given the starring role in a picture. I hope he enjoyed it because I doubt he will be given another."

      "reviewBody": "This sardonic sci-fi cult classic presents the most dismal portrait of the post-nuclear holocaust ever conceived.  Ugly, grimy and scruffy, its characters wander aimlessly across desert wastelands in search of plunder and sex under blazing Saharan suns by day, chilling cold to the bone by night, seeking food where they can steal it, committing wanton rape when they are fortunate enough to find an unwilling victim.  A world without law, order, or God, contrasted by an hilarious parody of Heartland Republican America that co-exists in a nether-world below ground like the Morlocks in H. G. Welles&apos; &quot;The Time Machine.&quot; Don Johnson as Vic (the Boy) is adequately dense; Tim MacIntyre as the voice of Blood (the Dog) is ruefully sarcastic; and Jason Robards as Lou, Dictator of the underground civilization, is an arbitrary, disgusted H. R. Haldeman. DON&apos;T bring your wife or date to see this film.  Women will be offended, men will either smirk maliciously, laugh uproariously or even cheer at the gross ending which takes a few minutes to sink in. Bottom-line theme:  faced with bare-knuckle survival, a good dog is of greater worth to a man than a woman.  A one of a kind film, not to be missed, but NOT for the squeemish or politically correct."

      "reviewBody": "Absolutely love Christmas and have done for a long time, something that has been made clear many times over the years by me here. The idea for &apos;Anything but Christmas&apos; didn&apos;t sound too bad, though it was clear that it was going to be more a drama than the romantic comedy or fantasy sort of Christmas film from as early on as hearing the not so positive title. Sergio Di Zio was great in &apos;Angels and Ornaments&apos; and have always had a soft spot for Christopher Lloyd.\n\nUnfortunately, &apos;Anything but Christmas&apos; didn&apos;t work for me. It didn&apos;t strike me as a terrible film and there are definitely far worse Christmas films out there, but it is hard to warm to a film where the characters are hard to like, where the pessimism is taken too far and where the charm is too far and between. Really hate to sound like a humbug, which is in no way the intent or the want, but when it comes to meeting my criteria for Christmas films &apos;Anything but Christmas&apos; doesn&apos;t meet most of it.\n\nDi Zio does a good job and despite having a character that is over-negative he does bring some charm. Lloyd is always watchable and brings some suitably cantankerous vim to the film when needed even when a little more subdued to usual, just wish there was more.\n\nThe film looks nice, especially the scenery which is magical at its best. The music has moments where it is appropriately festive and nostalgic, despite it being emotionally one-dimensional (melancholic is the main mood). Really appreciated its well intended and sincere messaging too.\n\nElaine Hendrix however overdoes it in a role that is even more over-negative than Di Zio&apos;s. The rest of the supporting cast don&apos;t make much impression and are a mix of forgettable and annoying. Hendrix and Di Zio&apos;s chemistry doesn&apos;t ever properly ignite or grow, got the sense that they didn&apos;t seem to like each other much. Am going to have to agree with those that have talked about how unpleasant the characters are, not every film has to have likeable characters as a rule but it does depend on whether they still manage to be interesting and well developed and whether they are still meant to be rootable. None of the characters are interesting, all are flimsily developed and it is impossible for one to root for any character that has negative character traits taken to extremes. Hence what is meant when saying that &apos;Anything but Christmas&apos; went too far on the pessimism, especially with Hendrix&apos;s character who never really develops and her selfishness is overdone which made her come over as obnoxious.\n\nIt is not a well written film too. The attempts at humour are very thin and not really that funny, mean-spirited in parts. The sentiment gets far too much, even for a drama meant to be sentimental, the anger directed at everybody is even more overboard, and the messaging could have been done with more subtlety. Motivations are too vague and in some cases unexplained, the lead character&apos;s reasoning for treating the others the way she does while being guilty of what she is berating them for herself is too in the air. The whole phobia of Christmas angle is actually a real life issue and was potentially relatable, again that was underdeveloped and the amount of times it&apos;s reiterated made it come over as heavy-handed too. The story can be silly (especially in the latter stages) with a too pat ending that didn&apos;t feel warranted and some dreary pacing, as well as showing a lack of charm, subtlety and a lighter touch was needed. The unpleasantness of the characters and the excessive negativity made it come over as mean-spirited in parts.\n\nOverall, lacklustre. 4/10.",

      "name": "Perhaps Ichabod Crane was never meant to be a movie hero",
      "reviewBody": "For those of us who live in Tarrytown, New York, a town whose northern neighbor is called Sleepy Hollow, Washington Irving&apos;s tale of Ichabod Crane and his encounter with the Headless Horseman is never far from our consciousness. Irving lived here, wrote here and set many of his stories in the area. The image of the Horseman is used in logos for a number of local businesses, and the souvenir shops are chock-a-block with Sleepy Hollow memorabilia, especially since Tim Burton&apos;s &apos;Sleepy Hollow&apos; came out a couple of years ago. The Horseman has decidedly edged out Rip Van Winkle as Irving&apos;s best remembered tale, or at least his most heavily commercialized one. The Disney studio produced a terrific Headless Horseman cartoon in the late &apos;40s, by far the best screen adaptation to date, but when it comes to live action the tale doesn&apos;t seem to lend itself readily to the cinema, and this silent feature film starring Will Rogers demonstrates why.\n\nThe Oklahoma-born Rogers was a most likable screen figure, and on a purely visual level his offbeat casting as Yankee schoolmaster Ichabod Crane works surprisingly well, though he couldn&apos;t have played an Easterner convincingly in a talkie. (Although come to think of it, Will did just that in the 1931 version of Twain&apos;s Connecticut Yankee; perhaps his casting in that case was something of an inside joke). But anyone expecting a comic rendition of this story featuring Rogers&apos; characteristic wit will be disappointed, for the filmmakers followed Washington Irving&apos;s story all too faithfully, giving us an Ichabod Crane who is deeply unsympathetic. We expect comedy when we first see Will dressed as Ichabod, looking so gawky in his 18th century clothes and funny little pigtail, but Rogers plays it straight; his Ichabod is a pompous nerd, just as the story dictates. When the schoolroom sequence begins we expect Our Gang-style gags with pea-shooters or something similar, but this Yankee schoolmaster is self-righteous, prissy and stern. When a boy makes a sassy comment about the local flirt, Ichabod beats him briskly. What humor there is comes from the title cards, generally at Ichabod&apos;s expense, as he makes one foolish, arrogant remark after another.\n\nAll of this serves the story Washington Irving wrote, but it doesn&apos;t serve our nominal star, Will Rogers, or the demands of entertaining cinema. We don&apos;t like our &quot;hero&quot; Ichabod Crane very much, in fact he comes off as a jerk: the title cards make it explicitly clear that his courtship of local belle Katrina Van Tassel is driven by greed for her money and property. What a guy! So if we don&apos;t like the leading man, who else is there? We are told, again by one of those convenient title cards, that Ichabod&apos;s rival Brom Bones isn&apos;t such a bad sort, but the next thing we know, Brom is enjoying a cockfight with great enthusiasm -- and shortly afterward, inflamed by jealousy over Katrina, he attempts to use fake evidence to establish that Ichabod is in league with the devil, and nearly gets the guy tarred and feathered by local hotheads. So much for Brom Bones. And as for Katrina, she prefers Brom.\n\nSo, we&apos;ve got a story with absolutely no one to root for, where even the charismatic Will Rogers comes off as a greedy, conceited little schnook, in a town full of rubes, dupes, and superstitious fools. (I should add that where my fellow citizens are concerned, to paraphrase Monty Python, &quot;We got better.&quot;) This adaptation of The Headless Horseman does have nice period detail and some amusing touches along the way, and the climactic chase is well-handled and stirring. In sum, however, this film suggests that Irving&apos;s Legend of Sleepy Hollow is inherently off-putting material for a live action feature film, and it did so long before Tim Burton proved the point, once and for all.",

      "reviewBody": "If you know anything about the Manhattan Project, you will find &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story. The film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen. The supporting cast, such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, and Natasha Richardson, is fairly good as well. This film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie. Great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie. This one, however, tends to drag a bit throughout, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richardson&apos;s love story) could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much. Nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film. It does not always entertain, but as far as great depictions go, this is very accurate, fascinating, and will leave the audience with something to think about.\n\n*** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "So the apocalypse has been brought forth by ghosts who want to suck the lifeforce out of the living (as the first film sets things up). That&apos;s a pretty neat concept for any horror movie. Except, in &quot;Pulse 2&quot; not too much is done with it. Instead the story focuses on a divorced man trying to protect his daughter from his ghostly ex-wife, trying to get her hands on her. It&apos;s applaudable that the scripts takes different routes, presenting us new protagonists (instead of trying nothing new by whooping up another bunch of teenagers), but it hardly makes up for an exciting movie. The plot is oddly structured too, as the first act exists solely to lead the viewer up the wrong garden (after about half an hour, it gets clear who the real protagonists are). There are a few entertaining moments - like the scene with the naked woman half melted into a black goo on the floor - but they remain nothing more than just moments. The story is pretty thin and the ghostly images are severely underwhelming. Nothing ever gets scary in this film. And what on earth was up with all those obvious green screen effects? A lot of backdrops were used for both exteriors and interiors (the sequences in the cabin were just a bit too much of all this). On the one hand it created a weird look &amp; feel for the film, but on the other hand it&apos;s just too distracting for the viewer (I spent most of the running time figuring out how they composed all those shots, instead of getting involved with the story, acting, etc). So, &quot;Pulse 2&quot; turned out a strange viewing experience: interesting from a technical point of view and a bit offbeat in some ways, but way too average and unconvincing as a scary movie. Still, it&apos;s good the producers didn&apos;t go flat-out for what could be expected in a nowadays sequel. &quot;Pulse 2&quot; turned out something &apos;different&apos;, and while not all of it works like it should, it&apos;s not as bad as most people claim it is.",

      "reviewBody": "---is what many an adult woman might call the result when a man she loves develops a romantic entanglement with what we call a child (in any case, as in this one, a little girl).  Generally presumed to be sexual on its face, such a relationship seldom involves actual sex, but always an emotional intensity which is often, even commonly lacking from the carnal attractions of a man and woman.  It is this the grown woman cannot engender, thus she envies the little girl who can.  Ironically, the younger female is jealous of the older woman&apos;s capacity to possess the man sexually, and has little need nor understanding of the more complex feelings the man might have for her.  Needful of both, the man usually ends up with neither, as the battle of the sexes AND the dictates of society practically foreordain.\n\nSo it is with Hardy Kruger and Patricia Gozzi, star (actually railroad station)-crossed lovers in Sundays and Cybele.  Kruger served as a fighter pilot in the French air force in Indo China (Vietnam), and was wounded and traumatized in a crash in which a little Asian girl was killed.  Gozzi as we meet her is being dumped in an orphanage in a Paris suburb by her harried father, who tells her it&apos;s only temporary but actually plans to abandon her, a fact which Kruger learns from eavesdropping and a letter.  He follows father and daughter to the orphanage from the train station, a regular hangout of his, and notes that the father hurries off before a nun answers the door.  Later he goes back, poses as the father to get the girl out on Sunday afternoons, for outings in the local area and, though it is winter and most uninviting a venue in which to form a friendship, in a park.  The girl, desperately lonely, goes along with the deception, senses wound and need in the Kruger character matching her own, and they form a strongly symbolic and generally childish friendship.\n\nAlas, Kruger lives with a girlfriend, a nurse, and she is a knockout who knows his history and has taken it upon herself to restore the man she loves to health.  Alack, it&apos;s no use.  Kruger retreats from her, steadily and completely, to his fantasy relationship with the child.  He is troubled by dreams and flashbacks, and noises set him off.  He begins to frighten the child on the Sunday outings as she divines the extent of his mental problems, so she decides they should be &quot;married.&quot;  Others in the park and on the street pick up on the liaison, and assume the worst, which sets off a chain of events that turn the &quot;wedding ceremony&quot; into a tragedy.\n\nSundays and Cybele is one of a long line of international movies that misses the boat in depicting adult/child romantic attachments, tailoring the plot elements to conform with popular notions of both the adult and the child which are at best misguided, and at worst, as in this case, a guarantee of unpleasantness and tragedy.  The adult in these films, from Peter Lorre in &apos;M&apos; to the chimney sweep in Emma&apos;s Shadow to the Ian Holm portrayal of Lewis Carroll in Dreamchild to Louis Gossett Jr. in Sudie &amp; Simpson, must either be severely neurotic, a social or racial outcast, mentally retarded or outright psychotic.  The child must be unloved and neglected, because how else (or why) could the adult manage to seduce or coerce the child into a relationship?  &quot;Just another love story&quot; these tales might really be, but we have a deep need to see them as aberrations distinctly outside the pale, needful of retribution, punishments of both adult and child and, as happened to the Kruger character, needful of being put to death to insure the end of the relationship (or, as happened to Dirk Bogarde in Death In Venice, struck dead by the force of his own perversion and lustful iniquity).\n\nSo Sundays and Cybele conforms, and it is to the credit of all concerned in the filming, particularly the 12-year-old Patricia Gozzi and director Serge Bourguignon, that it rises above its imposed cliches and attains the status of something like a bleakly beautiful cinematic experience."

Though the premise is a bit contrived, it becomes a bit touching as Taylor eventually becomes protective and concerned about the girl, who is being victimized by her own family. The film does suffer from several major flaws, most notably the appearance of Robert Mitchum, painfully miscast as Farrow&apos;s lecherous stepfather. Probably one of Taylor&apos;s most daring and least embarrassing roles from this period, she also looks surprisingly good here.",

The main character, who eventually takes power of the boat, arrives on it with no tickets, and gains a position by mistake, but is still able to use it to form a kind of politburo, and then a dictatorship.\n\nThe film manages to do all this whilst being a hilarious comedy, some of the humour could perhaps be difficult for non-Polish viewers to comprehend. Not that much ACTUALLY goes on on the boat, but what goes on can easily be related to external events, and because of the way it is acted, this is a film that never gets boring, against all odds. If this film had gained widespread international fame and distribution, it would probably gain cult status all over the world, and be treated as one of the best films of all time, as it is in Poland."

No Hollywood style crap camera shots, no wasted graphic resources around futile things. HNK is a love story about mankind, but harsh and raw, and painful. Effects in this movie are subtle, beautiful and meaningful. The line of the drawings is the best of any hnk. After watching all other HNK animes this one left me breathless.\n\nBefore watching this movie i still wondered if the manga has untold parts of the story, but now i got the whole plot.",

I only regret that is very difficult to find plays or to purchase any copies, in any format, of this strange gem here in Argentina. I could watch it only twice, in cultural centers at Buenos Aires, which is not my hometown. This is a movie that you can enjoy over and over, as if it were a musical masterpiece.

      "reviewBody": "I was little torn apart with &quot;The Brutalization of Franz Blum&quot;. It had an interesting subject to tackle which is the issue about human rehabilitation of a criminal, if it&apos;s possible or not to make them repent for their crimes, learn new things through hard work and then get sent back to society as functional members of it.\n\nThe time to face the law and pay for his mistakes comes to Blum (Jürgen Prochnow), a young petty criminal that comes from a family of means who is sent to jail after a robbery gone wrong where he was the only member of the gang to get arrested. Completely unfamiliar with the system and how prisoners deal with themselves, with guards and the warden, Blum is tossed around here and there, at times being very obedient to the guards and the warden rules to the point of clashing with other inmates by reporting their schemes and fights, and other times being part of the bargain schemes trading products and sharing working duties, to the point of becoming a cell block leader who competes with the veteran and violent leader Kuul (Burkhard Driest).\n\nReinhard Hauff&apos;s film truly believes that the prison system changes the man, but not in the rehabilitation sense and obvious that it&apos;s about that the change comes from what prisoners can make to improve their crimes when they get out or at least learn ways to survive any prison system possible if they ever come back. Blum goes from a wimp snitch who has only one friend, a man suffering with a sick heart who helped him early on, to a man who has comrades working under him and against their former boss; a man who initially worked along with the guards that later on managed to blackmail one of them when needed.\n\nWhen the movie works through such ideas we have a most fascinating and gripping story to see. But on the other hand, and maybe that&apos;s just me, for the most of what we were shown in this German prison things aren&apos;t so tough and it feels like a summer camp those men are forced to stay in. Instead of the usual violence (which is rarely presented) most of the time the prisoners keep swaping cigarettes, schnapps, medicine and coffee, and there&apos;s a weird hierarchy where group leaders don&apos;t need to perform the hard labor on the outside, they just keep watching the others and they guards allow it.\n\nUnlike the Hollywood cliche of groups divided by race fighting against each other, here the division and the shift of power comes from either the toughest guy or the most intelligent, and those below in the hierarchy can switch from leader whatever they want - except for one guy who&apos;s in love with Kuul, he&apos;s faithful all the way even though he&apos;s always mistreated. Yet they all bicker with each other for small things, some prank that wasn&apos;t well received or just test of force against each other.\n\nIt&apos;s a fine movie, made it a somewhat positive experience due to Prochnow&apos;s masterful performance. His early films as a lead in Germany rather than the typecast villains he played in Hollywood flicks are all something special - most notably &quot;The Consequence&quot; where he also plays a prisoner; and the mega hit &quot;Das Boot&quot; both directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Check them all out if you can. 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I hired this on video in the UK, and was so suprised to find what an excellent film this is, especially as I and everyone else seems never to have heard of it.\n\nI have never seen the original Manga anime, nor am a big fan of the anime genre.  However, I am very interest in oriental culture, and so probably more tolerant and open minded to such things than most people.\n\nThis film is awesomely slick, clear and crisp.  To view it as only a film with violence is to watch it blindfolded.  In fact the more I watch this film, the more I realize that there is not that much action, just that each sequence has a huge impact.  Between the cool, elegant and well balanced cinematography and Gans&apos;s uncluttered and simple direction, the film draws the viewer through a beautiful, dark and rich world of a sino-japanese underworld.  The film revolves around the traditional and formal world of the Japanese yakusa, and the dark and dedicated world of the chinese Triads, both playing for power.  Without any understanding of either japanese or chinese culture this film might well be too remote for the casual viewer.\n\nStrongest point of this film, is without doubt the cinematography.  Superb composition, especially in the slow motion shots, the steralized mono-chrome of the yakusa/triads and the fantastic colours of the wonderful tattoos all contribute to a visually deep and absorbing experience.\n\nI find many modern action films overly converluted and complicated little reason for being so other than they think they should.  It was very refreshing seeing a plot that was simple and clean.  The characters are well construed, if under-developed for many critics.  But this has never been a problem for me, as I think a lot of films tell a story of events and the prying voyeurism of characterisation isnt needed.  One of the nicest aspects, was the obvious nature of the &apos;crying&apos; freeman.  An assassin that is emotionally sympathetic to his victims, but who doesnt really understand it and partially sees it as a curse.  This allows the main character to be softer and more human, without having to pile into the emotional struggles.\n\nThis was the first Marc Dacascos film I had seen, and was immensly impressed by him.  His body movement is exceptionally elegant and he isnt challenged by the very dry exterior of the hitman.  Sadly, I dont think he has been in anything nearly as good since.\n\nAll in all, Christophe Gans crafted an excellent and entertaining film.  He brings us neo-zen, clinical beauty in magnificent depth.  The slick style and soft characters beat anything that Jon Woo has done.\n\n(P.S.  Am a big john woo fan, so hate to dis him.  But must be said that gans hasnt produced anything of similar quality since again... but here&apos;s hoping for a sequel sometime)"

      "reviewBody": "This movie really builds to a climax at the end.  D B Sweeney (Memphis Belle, Superfire, Hardball, 8 Men Out, The Cutting Edge) is such an under-rated actor.  This guy should be getting major movie roles!\n\n I ordered this movie, Blue Desert, because Sweeney was in it.  I was not disappointed.  He plays the local law enforcement officer (Steve Smith) of a small, sleepy, boring desert town.  Lisa, (Courtney Cox), a rape victim, leaves NYC to get away from that madness and settle in the desert where she will feel safer. Boy, was she wrong!  She meets a weird drifter who immediately tries to take sexual advantage of her (Craig Sheffer of A River Ran Through It).  So she finds out fast that this sleepy little town isn&apos;t as safe as she wishes.  She turns to Steve, (D B Sweeney), who is the helpful and protective police officer. Steve is always polite, trusting, and soft spoken.  Sweeney plays this role perfectly!  Steve is there to help the damsel in distress.\n\nThe movie twists and turns.  Evidence mounts against the drifter but Sweeney can&apos;t get enough evidence to put the guy away.  The drifter tells Lisa bad things about Steve and the polite and efficient Steve tells Lisa he is there to protect her and not to believe the drifter.  Who to believe?  After awhile Lisa doesn&apos;t know who is the bad guy and who is the good guy.\n\n The ending is as suspenseful as you can get in a movie.  Like I have said before, Sweeney is wonderful in this role.  He makes this movie work as far as I am concerned because he is so believable.\n\nIf you like a psycho thriller.  If you like suspense.  If you like Courtney Cox and if you like D.B. Sweeney, then this movie is for you.  I highly recommend this sleeper of a movie.  It is well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "The Argentinian film La cámara oscura (2008), directed by María Victoria Menis, was shown in the U.S. with the title &quot;The Camera Obscura.&quot; It stars Mirta Bogdasarian as Gertrudis, a woman so unattractive that her own mother cannot bear to look at her. (Actually, Ms. Bogdasarian isn&apos;t even remotely as unattractive as the character she portrays. Nonetheless, the point of the story is that she&apos;s unattractive, so we have to accept it.)\n\nI knew that some Jews who escaped the Holocaust managed to get into Argentina. However, I didn&apos;t realize that immigrants like Gertrudis&apos;s family had arrived much earlier, to escape the Russian pogroms. They settled in rural Argentina, and became farmers and ranchers. \n\nThe story moves forward 20 years, by which time hope has been lost in regard to a marriage for Gertrudis. Nonetheless, she does eventually get married, to a wealthy widower, whose first wife was beautiful but unfaithful. The plot really begins much later, after World War I, when Gertrudis, her husband, and her family are living on their large ranch. Into this situation comes a French photographer, a former war correspondent, who takes pictures of everyone, including Gertrudis. What happens next is somewhat ambiguous, and each viewer will have to decide the significance of the last scene in the film. (Apparently Ms. Menis has been quoted as saying that the last scene is not ambiguous. Most of us in the audience thought it was.)\n\nAn interesting facet of this movie is the portrayal of Gertrudis&apos;s husband and their sons, who have adopted the Gaucho costume, and who work alongside the hired ranch hands. In the same way, the women work hard at the traditional female jobs. An English squire, in similar circumstances, would have a life of leisure, and his wife would have maids to do the hardest work. Not so, apparently, in Argentina. Assuming that this is an accurate portrayal, I found these facts fascinating.\n\nThe film has some beautiful scenic shots, and they&apos;ll be mostly lost on the small screen. Better to see this film in a theater if possible. We saw it at the excellent Rochester Jewish Film Festival.\n\nP.S. For reasons I don&apos;t understand, this movie has a dismal weighted IMDb average of 6.3. It&apos;s not a great film, but it&apos;s much better than that. The Camera Obscura is definitely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot; is an exceptionally well made film from Disney. It was made to bolster the notion of strategic bombing...bombing factories in Axis territory in order to bring the Japanese and Germans to their knees. It&apos;s told first as a history of military aviation and then a film specifically about WWII and the Allied bombing campaign....along with some portions where Major Alexander de Seversky talks about the program and how it will lead to a victory over the Axis.\n\nThe film is great for history teachers (like me) and WWII buffs. Others will likely find it slow and uninteresting. But for what it is, it&apos;s exceptionally well made...with some amazing animation and a well structured story.\n\nBy the way, SOME of the theory presented in the movie is true, some isn&apos;t exactly....and this was learned after the war ended. In Europe, despite all the bombing by Allied planes, German production actually INCREASED as the war progressed. What actually won the war in Europe was a combination of things....including Allied raids on German controlled oil refineries as well as the work of the infantry.",

This movie has the 3 best action sequences in the history of cinema, PERIOD.\n\nThe story is about a cop named Tequila who, at the beginning of the film, loses his good friend and fellow cop, in a teahouse shoot-out. He goes against all orders in trying to bring down the Triad that caused his friends death. In doing so, he inadvertantly finds out that there is an undercover cop, Tony, in the Triad he is trying to bring down, and eventually teams up with him. \n\nThis isn&apos;t your standard buddy cop fair like Lethal Weapon with tons of cheesey lines, dorky action and sappy side stories. The dialogue is insightful the action is the best ever and the side stories are well thought out, if a bit abbreviated (due to lack of time to shoot John Woo admits).\n\nTequila is trying to deal with a failed relationship and the death of his partner, Tony is torn against blowing his cover and defending his honor and the Lieutenant insists on playing it by the book even though it isn&apos;t fair.\n\nJohn Woo said he made this film in honor of the men and women of the Hong Kong police force and the good work they do. He wanted to make a movie about the good guys winning. What he has done is made one of the most pivitol action films ever made, influencing every action movie since."

      "reviewBody": "This movie attempts to turn something into history. By treating both sides of the intense conflict between the leftist terrorists and the political elite of postwar West Germany in the 70s and 80s with equal respect, its main message is, perhaps, this: it&apos;s all over. The movie shrugs off the ideologies involved and turns its focus on the two biographies of Grams and Herrhausen instead.\n\nSome of the previous comments have remarked that those two really didn&apos;t have much in common. Even their involvement with terrorism wasn&apos;t particularly similar - Herrhausen, the banker, was simply a victim. He had known, of course, that he was a likely target, but only his death, not his life was molded by the RAF terrorist movement. Grams, on the other hand, was a terrorist for roughly two decades, and died, most probably by suicide, during a shootout with the police. I believe that the only way in which these two biographies could be linked (without a tremondous, and strained, analytic effort) was by representing them both as parts of an historical phenomenon. The movie doesn&apos;t really need a clear connection between its two protagonists other than this: they&apos;re part of the same historical constellation. It doesn&apos;t aim at explaining this constellation. It aims at telling us that it IS historical.\n\nHow could this be of interest to German audiences? While I don&apos;t want to reduce the movie&apos;s appeal to this - there&apos;s a lot of intriguing material in it - I think the explanation lies in the German present, not in the past. Mostly unnoticed, overshadowed by the more severe transformations in the Eastern part of the country, the old West has changed quite thoroughly as well. And the changes are accompanied by certain tendencies of framing recent history in collective memory, as it were. We now like to regard all the political conflicts of the years before 1989 as finished and done with. Germany, we want to believe, is totally different from what it was back then. This urge for discontinuity is rather questionable, actually... Anyway, that&apos;s where both the fascination and the problems and perhaps the ultimate failure of the film lie. Or so I think."

This is a movie for strong women about strong women. And we are all strong if only given the right atmosphere and encouragement. All women, young and old, should see this movie. And their men, too. \n\nThis is an excellent movie about the lost art of giving birth naturally in the United States and the world. It is about making birth part of the family experience. It is also about the dying art of lay midwifery. Ina May Gaskin and The Farm Midwives know the truth about the birth experience. They offer us knowledge in the safe, healthy, spiritual practice of giving birth. It is a sacred, family centered experience to be cherished by all involved, particularly our mothers.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie, Suspicious Customers, is not only a comedy but also a human drama. This movie reminds us of the poor people living around us, and the director works their stories out, mixing it with plenty of comic acting. In this movie, one of the best insurance agents, Byeong-Woo Bae(Seung-Beom Ryu), attempts to transfer from a small company to a bigger company. Before moving to a big company, he faces his past a big mistake which he made because of a contest. He accepted 4 people for life insurance, and they all have experience of a suicide. If they commit a suicide pretended as an accident, they can get the insurance money. This is why they keep paying the insurance money even if they are in grinding poverty. Of course, they are not intending a suicide, but are getting bogged down in the swamp of suicide. On the other hand, Byeong-Woo has to prove that their death is a suicide if they pretend their death as an accident. Otherwise, both his company and his careers would receive a setback. Therefore, this movie shows us the two different desires which are colliding into each other.\n\nSeung-Beom Ryu(in Korea, 류승범) is the best Movie Star when he performs in a comedy movie. Who can overcome his comic acting? He is really humorous, and his ad-lib acting seems to be a real. Whenever he acts, he makes the audience laugh and cry. This time, he plays in a movie, Suspicious Customers, 2011, and he tries again to show his talents as a comedian.\n\nIn movie, the customers are going to die, and Byeong-Woo tries to protect their life. This is the main story of this movie. The four people whom Byeong-Woo is trying to protect are a representative of our neighbor, and we can find those people if we are able to pay a little attention. Those people are tempted into a suicide, but one important thing that this movie tries to show us is to give information that a suicide can be healed by our helping. This is the reason that a movie is sufficient to give us plenty of impression.\n\nThis movie is the first work of director Jin-Mo Jo, and he did very well. There are laughs and tears, and if you like Seung-Beom Ryu, I would recommend you to watch this movie."

The documentary ends slightly surrealistic, though not unsuitable, in a drug-fueled Mexican red light area.\n\nWhat probably struck me most were the small rituals, often merely casual habits, that are used by the girls to keep hanging on in their incredibly hard life.\n\nOne can argue (as I&apos;m sure has been done) whether &apos;dramatic&apos; music in such a documentary is fitting. Nevertheless, the film is gripping, beautifully made, and if it wasn&apos;t such a nasty side of humanity the images and music would be enchanting. But without a happy end.",

      "reviewBody": "The King Brothers commissioned this screenplay from blacklisted Dalton Trumbo and, in 1957, it earned an Oscar for Best Story. A claim that the story, &quot;Emilio and Bull&quot; by Paul Rader, submitted to the Kings in 1951, was the basis for the script was settled out of court. Perhaps, inspiration was provided by Albert Lamorisse&apos;s magnificent French short &quot;White Mane&quot; (1953), another story of a small boy, who develops a rapport with a big animal, that adults also claim for commercial purposes. But this Technicolor, Cinemascope feature film, set in Mexico, with a score by Victor Young, received much more attention and praise. It is a pleasure to visit Mexico City in 1956, to see the handsome old cars and enter the ring with the bullfighters. Director Irving Rapper gets good performances from all, including the bull and Trumbo handles the rising suspense masterfully.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is passable at best. It has an interesting plot: some aliens are trying to find a way to survive by building a base on earth. They are seen as hostile because, for heaven&apos;s sake they take over people&apos;s brains and use them to construct their stuff. A scientist who has had brain surgery and has a silver plate in his head, is immune to this. Later, a buddy of his puts a colander on his head with a silver plate and is able to infiltrate the &quot;evil forces.&quot; Along the way, our hero, who suffered his initial brain damage in a car accident, drives around in a classic roadster (he must be trying not to be conspicuous) which he is always parking somewhere and setting the hand brake. He flies in the faces of the aliens who seem to tolerate him a lot more than they should. His girlfriend, who finished in third place in the Lucille Ball look-alike contest is a scientist who is carrying the soul of an alien around with her. There is so much coming and going, we never quite understand what the heck they&apos;re doing. Only that they seem to make frequent trips to the moon. The ending is full of emotion and good will and, yes, overacting. Captain Kirk would have been proud. Sometimes you see a film that has a good skeleton plot and with a few bucks and a little imagination, it could have been OK. What is lacks is the human element.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in June 1984 after a screening at Rialto theater on Manhattan&apos;s 42nd St.\n\nFilmed in 1982, &quot;Girls Nite Out&quot; is a routine slasher picture, offering little entertainment to already jaded horror pic fans. Film was test-released last year by Independent-International Pictures under the tiel &quot;The Scaremaker&quot;, but reverted to its producers and is now playing more widely under the &quot;Girls&quot; moniker.\n\nYawn of a storyline has a mad killer on the loose on the campus of Dwight University set in Westville, Ohio, during a sorority scavenger hunt held at night. Cliche gimmick has history repeating itself: many years ago Dickie Cavanagh was jilted by his girlfriend and killed her during a scavenger hunt, for which he was incarcerated in the local Weston Hill Sanitarium. The victim&apos;s father Mac (Hal Holbrook) is the campus security guard trying to catch the killer.\n\nFilm is divided drearily into about four opening reels emphasizing youthful hijinks (somewhat overage for their roles players are silly rather than funny here), followed by deadly dull police investigation footage, headed by a detective played by Richard Bright. Bright&apos;s real-life wife Rutanya Alda is cast as a friendly waitress.\n\nKiller dresses up in a bear suit stolen from the male mascot to Dewitt&apos;s basketball team, and murders cast members in bloody, repetitive fashion with several knives strapped together as a makeshift claw. Lacking the nudity or special effects diversions common to this genre, film&apos;s only point of interest is a surprise ending. After planting fair clues (re: age and facial resemblance) the revelation of who the killer is proves to be a satisfying switch.\n\nTech credits and acting are unimpressive, with Holbrook&apos;s son David making his film debut as an outsider figure and prime suspect."

      "reviewBody": "31 year old Martha is in a Mexican prison in her wedding dress.  She tells the detectives how she got into this situation and talks back over the past year back to the day she first met Whitman.  They fell in love of course and dated for a while but soon Whitman&apos;s personality began to become increasingly worrying and the relationship came to an end.  However as Martha finds, Whitman won&apos;t let her sabotage her won happiness.\n\nI knew that this film would be a romantic comedy without a great plot and would probably not be that good.  However I had hoped that it would have enough wit and energy to it to be fun if not brilliant.  However it is actually a bit dopey and really drags along with no fun whatsoever.  The film premiered in the UK on channel 5 in the middle of the afternoon schedule of soaps and bad chat shows  that is how much they thought of the rights to this movie.\n\nThe plot is really poor  basically Whitman can&apos;t accept he&apos;s been dumped and starts to freak out Martha.  It does nothing funny with this premise whatsoever and it just gets increasingly desperate as it tries to be `wacky&apos; and `off the wall&apos;.  Instead I found it tiresome and just plain unfunny.  It didn&apos;t even seem to be trying hard  it just seemed content to drag it&apos;s feet as it went along.  Whitman isn&apos;t sold as a stalker of any kind and his actions aren&apos;t ever explained as they finally go a bit extreme.  It ain&apos;t funny, it ain&apos;t romantic and it left me wondering what the point of it was.\n\nI like DeGeneres even though I know she&apos;s rubbish.  She does occasionally get some laughs in a poor vehicle.  Here she did nothing and if anything just made the film worse!  Pullman is usually good in anything he does but he has nothing to work with in a character who is never really given any foundation or basis.  The rest of the cast are simply TV support actors which suits the feel of this film. Oh, and special mention to Joan Cusack  what a terrible performance and a terrible career choice!  Fire your agent.\n\nOverall this was a waste of 90 minutes and it really felt like it was twice as long as this.  It has no natural energy and it just drags along.  It is the least funny thing I have ever seen Ellen in.....and that&apos;s saying something."

This film talks about the myths and lies we are told to maintain status quo and the appearance of stability and normality. It explores the abuse of protecting a child from outside influences to the extreme of denying human instincts and inquisitiveness about their world. Its shows how telling children lies for their own safety makes them fearful of the world and patronises there innate understanding about life. Its amazing because it creates a world with an absurd, fully realised, vocabulary that is completely understood by the members of this family ; its surreal nature forces you to question the oddness and the parameters of your own existence. A life unquestioned and unexplored leads to a stagnant swamp of confusion.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1961 Universal had a popular success, Golden Globe winner I believe, with pairing Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida in the comedy &quot;Come September&quot;. In 1965 they attempted to recreate the magic with &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. Unfortunately this failure just goes to prove that scripts and characters are just as important as actors. Rock Hudson plays a conservative oil executive who impetuously weds bohemian artist Gina Lollabrigida. Given their incompatible natures they separate after a short marriage. Seven years later Lollobrigida wants a divorce to wed newspaper editor Edward Judd while public relations man Gig Young encourages Hudson to portray himself as a happily married man in order to get a big promotion. Hudson proceeds to re-kindle the flame with Lollobrigida, while Judd tries to disrupt the relationship by encouraging Lollobrigida&apos;s bohemian causes and thus embarrassing Hudson. The outcome of all this is Lollobrigida riding through London as Lady Godiva as a protest for one of her causes. The movie fails for a variety of reasons. Hudson&apos;s scene in bed with Judd might have some &quot;camp&quot; value but, although ungallant of me to say so, I&apos;ve seen Lollobrigida look better. The character development is limited, with fundamentally incompatible pair coming together apparently without any change in character. None of the supporting players has any personality in the script. Gig Young does many scenes solo, supposedly on the telephone to Hudson&apos;s character, and could probably been written out of the entire movie. Judd&apos;s acting is unfortunately limited to putting a pipe in and out of his mouth. The producers obviously recognized these problems and brought in British character comedians (i.e. undertaker Terry Thomas and several taxi drivers) for cameos. Much of the Lady Godiva scene requires physical comedy which is not Hudson&apos;s and Lollobrigida&apos;s forte. As commented on by others the Hollywood backlog substituted for London is cheesy. By way of comparison I would note that Come September had strong support from old pro Walter Slezak, energy from a young Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee, beautiful Italian scenery and a coherent plot. Suffice it to say that &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; at 98 minutes seemed dreadfully long while &quot;Come September&quot; at 112 minutes whizzed by."

I&apos;ve met people having the greatest respect for Japanese customs and people who completely badmouth the country.\n\nFrom this perspective, Tokyo Sonata is a bit of a gem, showing me how ordinary Japanese people live and think. There is the family, standard issue of father, mother and two children, and there are the roles: head of the family, respectful housewife, rebellious teenager and confused child. What do they do when the economic crisis and the traditional value system clash?\n\nI thought the actors were good, the soundtrack as well (to be expected given the title), and the plot was slow but crisp. There must have been a lot of expectations on a guy directing movies when his last name is Kurosawa and not related to Akira, because the movie was overall an excellent film. However, given its two hour length and slow pace, I advice you look at it when in the mood for cinematography, not some easy entertainment. Also, it is a pretty sad drama in places, so be ready to empathize with some hard hit people.",

Warner was quick to snatch up the rights, and in 1973 foisted the first black superchick onto the American public: Cleopatra Jones.\n\nThe film opens with a blazing opium field somewhere in Turkey.  Cleo Jones, hap-ki-do expert and international do-gooder, returns to America to report on her success as a &apos;special agent&apos; in her one-woman war on dope.  Lesbian drug baroness Mommy (Shelley Winters, fresh from Corman&apos;s Bloody Mama) is furious her poppy fields were torched, and threatens an all-out war between the Brothers and the Mothers.  One of Mommy&apos;s uppity underlings, Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, best remembered as Huggy Bear in Starsky And Hutch) is getting rich off stealing Mommy&apos;s coke, and provides a cautionary moral aside warning against living as a White Man&apos;s flunky (Cleo points to Doodlebug&apos;s white chauffeur, and asks &quot;What next - two white jockeys on the lawn?&quot;).  With a &quot;whacka-whacka&quot; superfunk guitar in the background, Cleo does her chop-sockey routine on the coke dealers and crooked cops, and kicks Shelley Winters&apos; portly ass for her wild overacting in the final showdown. Tamara Dobson as Cleo Jones reportedly stood 6&quot;2, and that doesn&apos;t include what must&apos;ve been the BIGGEST afro in the business!  Despite her physical prowess, the script doesn&apos;t give Cleo any real motive for her cartoon crusade (unlike the later Coffy and Foxy Brown) and reduces her to a smug self-satisfied cardboard cutout.  Add the sloppy direction by Jack Starrett and you get a surprisingly poor release by a major studio."

My children, too young to remember the original series, also found it very amusing, and, in spots, quite funny.  It is a bit more racy than the average Disney film, but not in any offensive way.  The effects are well done, and the roles played out well.  We may well see it again, and will definitely purchase the video."

Even though I didn&apos;t really know and appreciate his music back then I still thought he was GOD! It was from that point on, I knew that my way of listening to music would change forever! You could say I was obsessed! \n\nAfter traveling to America in July 04 I discovered Dj Tiesto bought out a DVD of his concert! I could not believe my eyes when I saw the DVD, as living way down under can have its disadvantages! I purchased 3 DVD&apos;s, one for myself and two others for close friends back home!\n\nPart of me wanted to wait and watch the concert with my friends but part of me wanted to take a quick preview, so thats right you guessed it, I couldn&apos;t wait and quickly put the DVD on. As i sat on the lounge room floor, the first glimpse of the concert came on! sitting there in silence I hear Adagio for Strings playing in the background, I wont go into to much detail but all I can say is that as soon as Tiesto appeared out of that stage and Adagio for Strings kicked in, I felt shivers down my spine and so did the thousands that were there!!! \n\nFor those of you that don&apos;t know Tiesto, please go out and purchase this DVD and you will not regret it. Not only is he the number 1 Dejay, he is also a brilliant performer and knows exactly how to entertain a crowd."

So, a lot of talking although one of the most important characters does not say one word. It takes some effort of the spectator to follow the film but it is quite an interesting film.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Garage&quot; is a film which you do not get tired to reconsider. It, as well as almost all Soviet comedies of that time, consists all of aphorisms of our cinema which are used till now by people in dialogue.\n\nIn my opinion, it undoubtedly one of the best comedy domestic films! &quot;The Garage&quot; is good such what it is: the brilliant actor&apos;s constellation, the interesting plot, the closed space. The director fairly and with humour says about a Soviet period, about people and things, that in any conditions is necessary to remain people, instead of the animals fighting for a place in the sun The director presents almost all types of human characters. Our country in which it is a lot of discrepancies: meetings of collectives in museums.\n\nThe decision of financial questions which our person does not postpone even in a wedding-day, after all private life — anything before public, and us not stopped even by children, grandsons.\n\nThe film not subject to time. Not losing the urgency on an extent here already many years. Classics of world cinema. Unfortunately, the given masterpiece is a little known in the West.\n\nExcuse, for my bad English",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a timely coincidence that my exploration of British Free Cinema generally referred to as &apos;kitchen sink&apos; dramas made me discover &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; right during Pride month.\n\nFrom my preliminary reading about the synopsis I was expecting a sort of docu-drama about unexpected teenage pregnancy in patriarcal times but I missed an important clue: the original successful play (many British classics derive from plays anyway) was written by Shelagh Delaney when she was 18, which means with no agenda or narrative requirements, only the free inspiration from a young woman in the budding of her independence.\n\nBorn in 1938, she literally served as a bridge between the lost generation and the baby-boomers who -at the film&apos;s release- were teenagers, and before the Beatles would infuse their exuberant adult-defying insouciance through in &quot;A Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot;, before Tom Courtenay would be the spokesperson of angry youth as a liar and a long-distance runner, it was Rita Tushingham as Jo, the tough pint-sized tom-boy-like brunette with gigantic expressive blue eyes who let her anger implode with particles of joy and devil-may-care detachment spilled all over the black-and-white screen. And let me say that after so many &quot;young angry men&quot; films, I&apos;m pleased and not the least surprised that it was the woman&apos;s one to introduce so many milestones one would easily lose the track.\n\nJosephine, aka Jo, is a 19-year old girl, raised by a single mother specialized in the oldest profession, she&apos;s played by a delightful and almost endearing Dory Bryan and that Jo calls her Helen is a little taboo-breaking detail. Obviously, Jo was an accident but Helen -if not the looks of her fading youth- still got the heart and is far from the abusive type. To put it straight, if you expect stereotypes in that film you have another thing coming. It&apos;s not even the most publicized aspect of the story but there&apos;s the romance with Jimmy, a Black sailor played by Paul Danquah; they love each other, their interactions are sincere, and so we&apos;re never left with the feeling that he &apos;abandoned&apos; her, neither is Jo. And Richardson doesn&apos;t let us interpret Jo&apos;s open-mindedness the wrong way, no she didn&apos;t like Jimmy for rebellion&apos;s sake, but simply because she liked him... her feelings precede her choices no matter what.\n\nThere&apos;s just too much modernity to handle in the film that I don&apos;t even feel like praising the artistic aspect. What for? All right, it&apos;s the first British shot on locations and to enhance the realism of the story, Richardson gratifies with details of the street life in England, a day at the carnival where you can see people barely noticing the actors, shots on rivers, docks, shabby houses: the realism feels real. But any passable director can get the right shots in and just let the camera roll when you&apos;ve got the right settings. However, what Richardson does and in my opinion better than his next film &quot;The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner&quot; is to show a certain truth in his characters by depriving them from any narrative guidance.\n\nTushingham brings a quirky freshness and spontaneity switching from joy to anger to sheer confusion in a way that yet never confuses us, she argues a lot with Helen but it&apos;s never played for melodrama, as the mothers points it out &quot;we enjoy it&quot; and it&apos;s true that these characters never seem to have clear ideas of what they&apos;re doing but somehow we understand them. I think I understood that it was inevitable that a girl like Jo would be immune to the traditional expectations: she&apos;s like the male counterpart of Albert Finney&apos;s character in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, the man who made a married woman pregnant and could left her for a younger gal. But Jo might be an angry young woman but she&apos;s no victim and she&apos;s braver, embracing her pregnancy as a fact, not a punishment, only a link to a chain of events that form the path of her life. She deals with it without any hatred or desire of revenge against men.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t shame men but establish two male figures that couldn&apos;t have been more opposite: there&apos;s Helen&apos;s husband (Robert Stephens) who&apos;s the perfect macho and with his mustache looks like an alpha-male version of Walt Disney, ordering her do the laundry, drinking, flirting, belittling and blackmailing her; and there&apos;s Geoff, Murray Melvin as the homosexual who never hid his identity, suspecting that she wouldn&apos;t reject her. Her first reaction is curiosity but they quickly become roommates and friends and it goes as far as Geoff proposing to be the father for the child&apos;s sake, he does love Jo and that says something about his true need for tenderness and a recognition of being. Murray brings a total naturalness in that man not afraid to be who is and with his long face, owl-like eyes and aquiline nose that reminded me of a young Jean Rochefort, he&apos;s got the awkward charm of an effeminate man still proud enough to hide his inner sensibility.\n\nNow, &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; has no pretension to teach a lesson, but only to show people entrapped in their social conditions and forced to be characters rather than people, Helen wants to believe that she&apos;s young enough to attract men, to satisfy her ego, Jo wants to be a good mother but is afraid her child might inherit some traits from her father and there&apos;s Geoff who is who he is and yet tries to find a semblance of &apos;normality&apos; that can englobe his own lifestyle choices ...... Maybe the closest to a bitter taste to that &quot;honey&quot; is that the reality of the world is too much to handle and it&apos;s sad to see these free people becoming characters again, as if they ended up thinking &quot;who are we kidding?&quot;.\n\nStill, on the film&apos;s 60th birthday, one should applaud the extraordinary performers, the gutsy director and the visionary Shelagh Delaney.",

      "reviewBody": "The legendary Jeanne Moreau stars as Mademoiselle, a school teacher, filled with repressed sexual urges, in a small French village. She finds ways to vent her desires, mostly through arson and other destructive acts.\n\nMademoiselle seems like a film that desperately wants to be profound. It seems like a film that wants to say something about repressing desires, and the insignificance of mankind against nature. For the most part, it fails. It is unclear whether Mademoiselle&apos;s violent actions are the product of sexual desire or simple sadism. She sets fires and opens floodgates, but is it a sexual urge? Not really, she just seems to get a kick out of watching the townspeople scramble to save their lives and possessions.\n\nAnd while the film is directed with an interesting visual flair that does often capture the beauty of nature quite well, it never really achieves a level of Lean-esquire glory or magnificence. Sure, it&apos;s pretty to look at, but what&apos;s the point? The acting is also sorely lacking. Ettore Manni, who plays Mademoiselle&apos;s (and everyone else&apos;s) sexual interest, is just not very good. He often unleashes these boisterous laughs, and every time I cringed. It&apos;s not even a little bit convincing. Even the usually wonderful Moreau fails to impress here. Her performance just feels hollow. As she has proved in the past that she can be very good, I blame director Tony Richardson, who, unlike someone like François Truffaut or Louis Malle, clearly doesn&apos;t grasp what Moreau is capable of.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say Mademoiselle is a failure. There are several deeply disturbing moments, one in particular involving a rabbit. The film seems to be trying to say that all human beings can be monsters at times, and we take out our suppressed aggression on whatever innocence may be around us. Still, the film seems to lack a core of genuine emotional depth, and therefore, lacks resonance. It doesn&apos;t help that it tends to move along at a remarkably slow pace, which causes it to try the viewer&apos;s patience at times.\n\nHowever, I would probably give Mademoiselle a mild recommendation, if for nothing besides the attractive visuals and the fact that it contains Jeanne Moreau.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Beijing Bicycle&quot; (Chinese, 2002): This is one of the purest films I&apos;ve seen all year. Don&apos;t believe the blurb written about it: two boys learn sharing through the use of one bicycle. The blurb couldn&apos;t be MORE WRONG. This story has one of the smoothest, most linear, singularly focused goals I&apos;ve experienced in a film along with &quot;The Field&quot;, which I rewatched earlier this year. There are no plot twists, no what-ifs, no &quot;oh my god, I had no idea THAT was happening!&quot; moments. &quot;Beijing Bicycle&quot; is a simple, yet symbolic film about a young man who comes to the big city, gets a job as a bicycle messenger, and things quickly go from uncomfortable, to bad, to awful, to worse it seems. &quot;Guei&quot; (the messenger) wasn&apos;t raised to recognize the ways of a metropolis, which tries to chew him up piece by piece. We get to &quot;know&quot; other characters who we believe (along with Guei) ARE who they appear to be. &quot;Beijing Bicycle&quot; has to be the finest expression of what I would expect to be the current set of fears by those in China who see their future as an unknown, with the &quot;replacement model&quot; being the U.S.A.. This story expresses the huge doubts caused by the loss of Mao and the Communist way of life. Even if it WASN&apos;T perfect, they were familiar with it, and many of these &quot;new world&quot; things did not happen THEN. Those who are (literally) &quot;buying&quot; into the free market concepts, are losing their pride, identities, and souls. Watch for the slow, steady transitions of situations and characters. Watch for the symbols of decadence, greed, unhealthy living, improper greed, corruption, and sadness  all within a small group of teens."

      "reviewBody": "This is a low budget movie, very low budget in fact, but as such i definitely have seen much worse. There are elements that works rather well. The score and the actors are the best parts. Also the camera work is quite solid and the make-up department has nothing to be ashamed of with the gore work being one of the films strongest parts. \n\nOn the negative side is a thin story that can&apos;t fill up the 90 min of running time. The gang of five spend the last 75 minutes of the film at the mysterious gas-station and that is at least 30 minutes to long. As a result the film becomes slow paced, which isn&apos;t something that has has to be negative, but the script doesn&apos;t compensate by developing the characters. The audience actually doesn&apos;t know anything about them when the film is over. In this aspect the film fails completely.\n\nDue to the fairly uninteresting events in front of our eyes with a bunch of strangers running around and shouting each others names randomly, it&apos;s no surprise that the suspense factor drops. There are some moments, but to few to keep me fully interested. The stench that the viewer should understand to be something threatening does not work particularly well simply because that out of all things that scares us, 99% is sensed through our eyes. \n\nNuf said. The ending is clever and answers the questions raised during the movie. I believe the film maker has some talent for this genre and it will be interesting to view his next effort, hopefully with a bigger budget.",

Those were the days: running around without safety helmets and mobile phones, climbing trees, and even catching live chicken --! Well, that&apos;s about it in the action department, and that&apos;s why the movie depicts a great and believable children&apos;s adventure. The young (and especially the elderly) actors did a very endearing performance, and the story unfolds without hectic and really engaging.\n\nMaybe a bit too long for real children, but worth seeing!",

The first storyline is shot in documentary style and follows screenwriters Lars &amp; Niels while they write a script called Epidemic. The second storyline is a lushly photographed production of the film that the characters are writing.\n\nEpidemic is about the process of creation. The screenwriters begin as idealists - their vision is pure and remains so as long as the creation is contained. Once the creation/script/disease is introduced/unleashed to the world it becomes both an object to be corrupted as well as a force which corrupts.\n\nIt all ends, as any von Trier movie should, with a suffering woman and this one&apos;s a little heavy handed even by von Trier&apos;s standards. Gitte&apos;s hypnotically induced wig-out is an obvious foreshadowing of everyone&apos;s demise and although it is difficult to watch her deterioration she is quite a site to behold.\n\nIt is fitting that the most accurate and succinct description of a Lars von Trier film should come from the man himself and it is in Epidemic that he famously proclaims, &quot;a film should be like a pebble in your shoe.&quot; And so it is."

The actors look great, the costumes are fantastic, and the whole production has the feel of the original. Except for the genitalia -- Adam West never whipped his out. I couldn&apos;t stop giggling through the whole production. Sadly, the whole question of whether or not Robin is gay is left unanswered, but his bisexuality has yet to be explored. Perhaps in a sequel?\n\nA worthy addition to any college frat DVD library or a lover of the truly bizarre. Give it a look.",

This film is laden with so much talent I&apos;m surprised it didn&apos;t establish itself as a mega movie. The premise is that of a talented lawyer, Aaron Levinsky, ably played by Richard Dreyfuss, who is forcibly thrust into a competency case which he does not want. His adversary is a formidably D.A, Francis MacMillan (Robert Webber) who has spent a considerable amount of time putting unwanted criminals and mental undesirables, behind bars. Thus he sees no reason why he should spend more time than necessary on a simple case of mental incompetency. Unfortunately for him the woman in question is spirited, independent Claudia Draper, (Barbra Streisand) who is desperate to have her day in court. Arrayed against her aside from the D.A. are her loving parents, Karl Malden as Arthur Kirk and Maureen Stapleton as Rose Kirk, who guard a terrible family secret. In addition, there is formidable Eli Wallach as Dr. Herbert A. Morrison, a psychiatrist who is convinced that Draper is insane. In Claudia&apos;s eyes, everyone seems hell bent on having her locked up in insane asylum. The courtroom drama is superior as Judge Stanley Murdoch, (James Whitmore ) tries to discover why the authorities want Draper incarcerated. A most convincing performance by all to create a memorable film. ****",

      "reviewBody": "What a stunning body of work Wes Anderson has created. I will be honest, when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood. Art is replaced by money, which is replaced by angry fans. I saw the CGI fish and began to feel a sweat break with nervousness. Will he be able to continue the humor from Bottle Rocket, the darkness of Rushmore, as well as the ensemble connectedness from The Royal Tennanbaums? Well, folks, I am here to announce that he has taken the Hollywood money and has not veered too far off his signature course. I always imagine Anderson&apos;s work as a very dry martini. His humor, the most intelligent work I have seen in a long time, is like the liquid itself, creating this bold texture while packing a powerful emotional punch. The olives are the cast, giving just some extra to nibble on while you enjoy the entire drink. Place these elements together, the drink and olives, and you have The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.\n\nTo begin with, this film would not have worked without anyone else in the lead than Bill Murray. His ability to contain himself while also giving us the emotional stress of being a first-time dad as well as loosing his best friend is Oscar worthy. He is the perfect guide for our trip, giving us that knowledgeable laugh as well as those sympathetic eyes that seem to shout, &quot;Everything will work out&quot;. He is bold and smooth as both the Captain of the vessel as well as learning the tricks of being a father. His ability to deliver his lines was both crucial and beautifully timed giving us just enough to make us fall in love with him by the end of the film. Coupled with his amazing performances is the work of everyone else involved. Willem Dafoe proves that he can handle any role, big or small, and make it very memorable. My favorite character during this voyage was Cate Blanchett&apos;s role that nearly stole the show from Murray. Her multi-depth character gave us just the distraction that we needed to see the power of the father/son relationship. Her quirks take us deep into the human soul and give us a mother&apos;s perspective to this mission. It is a beautiful counter to Murray&apos;s passive/aggressive father figure. Goldblum is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine, while Huston proves that she still has the ability inside of her. Both of these guys need to see more work. The rest of the eclectic cast ranges from the hilarious &quot;interns&quot; to the melancholy songs of David Bowie (see if you can spot them!). Even Noah Taylor (of Vanilla Sky fame) turned out a stunning performance. The cast shines through beautifully, playing off each other, giving us some of the best performances of the year.\n\nI will admit, Anderson&apos;s comic narrative will leave this dry taste in your mouth, but for me it was a great experience. His humor is dry, his films are dry, but that is what makes him different than others in his field. He gives us those long pauses and obscure references that will either force you to think or create frustration because you do not understand his meaning. I have grown up on his films since seeing Bottle Rocket, and I love the way this man creates. One of my favorite lines and scenes in this film that I have raved to everyone as the epitome of an Anderson film was when Zissou first takes Ned to the island and Eleanor tells Steve that one of his cats died. After some banter, Ned asks what type of cat it was. Zissou replies &quot;Who cares. A tabby I think&quot; which isn&apos;t funny at first, but then you realize that all he has on the island are Siamese cats, which only make me laugh harder in my seat. That is Wes Anderson humor, and it works perfectly for me. His ability to create these challenging characters and put them in situations that I never saw coming (the &quot;pirates&quot; scene being one of them) was outstanding. It felt as if he was throwing his crew into different troubles daily who in turn produced some of the best work ever. Only Wes Anderson could create beauty out of chaos.\n\nMy fear of the CGI was muted immediately when I saw that Anderson used the technique to create some of the most imaginative creatures ever to lurk in the sea impressed me. He didn&apos;t use it as a central focus of the film (until the end), and used it sporadically so that it really didn&apos;t feel as if it was being used. The creatures that he created are so bold and colorful that skillfully he uses them to counter the life of Zissou, which seems be getting darker by the day. This contrast allowed me to see deeper into Murray&apos;s character and root for his misadventures throughout the entire film.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed. I know that not many enjoyed this picture as much as his previous works, but for me it was a fresh chapter with a stellar cast. Anderson is slowly changing the face of cinema, and soon others will follow trying to recreate his award winning voice, but will not succeed. This man is in the same boat as Gondry, Coppola, Jonez, and Kaufman. These are the imaginative thinkers of Hollywood that continually break the mold and open the doors to new possibilities.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****",

Acted well. It just plain _worked_.

      "reviewBody": "Earnest, well-mounted but essentially dreary epic about the real-life involvement of an American Jew in the post-war struggle for Israel&apos;s independence  thus sharing its theme with EXODUS (1960), and clearly aiming (but failing) for a &quot;Marcus Of Israel&quot; feel! \n\nKirk Douglas stars as Mickey Marcus  perhaps chosen due to the character&apos;s similarities to another historical figure forced by circumstances into leadership, Spartacus, whom Douglas had portrayed in 1960. He&apos;s supported by an eclectic cast which includes Angie Dickinson as his neglected(!) wife, Senta Berger as the Israeli girl he falls for, Topol as an ill-tempered Arab sheik, Luther Adler as a local politician, a plethora of reliable British character actors  and even guest appearances by Frank Sinatra (which doesn&apos;t amount to much), a glum Yul Brynner as a fellow freedom fighter, and John Wayne as a U.S. General whom Douglas initially falls foul of but the two eventually end up respecting one another (still, seeing Wayne at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp is about as incongruous as his stint playing the Roman Centurion at Christ&apos;s crucifixion in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD [1965]!).\n\nDespite a sharp script and good individual sequences, the film is compromised by its necessity to be both a spectacle and a message picture (the WWII flashbacks, for instance, are unnecessary and merely render the film overlong); unsurprisingly, it works best during the action highlights (complemented by a typically fine Elmer Bernstein score). Apparently, the events have been partially fictionalized  I wonder whether these embellishments concerned the romantic complications and the Hollywood-style ironic ending. For the record, Shavelson had started out as a scriptwriter (and later director) of Bob Hope and Danny Kaye vehicles; this was his most serious effort  a brave try, but not quite the &apos;giant&apos; film he clearly intended...",

      "reviewBody": "When Larry Parks uses a Christmas show at the penitentiary to cover his escape, show arranger Boston Blackie (Chester Morris) needs to prove his own innocence -- and to explain how neither he nor Parks had anything do with a murder.\n\nIt&apos;s a typically fast-paced episode in the Columbia series, with the usual cast of character actors: Adele Mara as Parks&apos; sister, George E. Stone as Blackie&apos;s assistant, Richard Lane as the police inspector, and Lloyd Corrigan, Paul Fix, and Cy Kendall rounding out the cast.\n\nBlackie was created by Jack Boyle after he had spent time for kiting checks. A fix-up novel from the short stories was a success in 1918, and there were eleven silent films from 1918 through 1927, with performers like Lionel Barrymore, Bert Lytell and Walter Long playing the safecracker. Columbia revived the series in 1941, starring Chester Morris. In them, Blackie is a reformed crook who keeps having to help out pals and prove his own innocence. He also starred in a summer replacement radio show in 1944. There was a TV show from ZIV in the 1950s, and a graphic novel in 2002.",

Something to pass the time if you literally have nothing else to do. As I mentioned before, I&apos;d recommend watching the Princess Bride if you haven&apos;t, or watching it again, rather than watch this.\n\nI gave it three stars because the acting wasn&apos;t terrible, there were those witty one-liners, and I did manage to laugh once.",

      "reviewBody": "Ek Hi Raasta (1956) : Brief Review -\n\nWidow remarriage, stepfather, and the man who marries a window-BR Chopra solved three issues together. Ek Hi Raasta is 2 hours and 24 minutes long, and the first 1 hour and 20 minutes go into telling us how happy the characters are before the tragedy strikes. Amar and Malti are a happy couple and have a son, Raja. Amar is the manager at Prakash&apos;s company and is a very good friend of his. Amar has to pay for his honesty with his life, and Malti is left as a sorrowful widow. It&apos;s difficult for her to tell Raja that his father is dead. Raja is told that his father is still in the hospital and will come back. Prakash helps Malti take a new start in life and set up her own dance academy. However, his constant visits to her house become the talk of the town, and Prakash and Malti are boycotted for being filthy. To shut their mouths, Prakash marries Malti but is unable to make up with Raja for the place of his father. The second half of the film is focused on three issues. 1) widow remarriage because society wouldn&apos;t accept a helpless woman being helped by a family friend; 2) the man who has to marry her because all he wanted was to help her; and 3) the son, who is unable to accept his mother&apos;s second husband as his father. The people who have suffered through these problems must have saluted BR Chopra for breaking the silence on these issues through his cinematic brilliance. V. Shantaram had already made a film on a widow&apos;s life back in the 30s, so obviously Mr. Chopra had to show some updates. Using the child as the main tool to describe the family mindset was a masterstroke. Though it looks excessive at times, we still believe it since he is just a child-an immature boy yet. The performances are good, the music could have been better, and the technical aspects were grand. Chopra somehow made me believe that even hard-core family dramas can be so big and lavish. Hats off to the master for thinking about society and cinema at the same time.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

Because of that i was pretty excited to see the film, even though i know it couldn&apos;t live up to the book. Sadly, i was correct.\n\nThe acting was actually quite good, as was the casting. The only character i didn&apos;t like the casting choice, regardless of the fact that she did a fine job, was Tibby. Tibby, in the book, is described as small, meek, and undeveloped. She didn&apos;t look/act that way, really.\n\nThe stories themselves were decent. Carmen and Bridget&apos;s were almost dead on (minus the fact that they left out a vital scene in the end of Bridget&apos;s). Tibby&apos;s pretty accurate, but they left out a whole lot. Lena&apos;s was completely changed, which i didn&apos;t understand why they did.\n\nIt&apos;s a teen chick flick so you expect insane cheesy moments. And the film is full of them. The soundtrack was horrible, in my opinion, making the film even more ridiculous at times. There were laugh out loud parts that probably shouldn&apos;t have been that funny.\n\nI think if you&apos;re a 12-15 year old girl, this movie is great for you (or if you like teen chick flicks). It covers the crucial topics addressed in the book, but lacks the depth Brashares originally had. I suggest seeing it just to see it, but don&apos;t expect too much.\n\nAlso, if you&apos;re a guy, stay away. There were maximum 10 guys in the theatre when i saw it and each one looked 1/2 dead in the end.",

Don plays a drifter who picks up a job at a used car lot in a small Texas town. He soon finds himself bedding the owner&apos;s absolutely insatiable wife. And he is soon working on the oh-so innocent Connelly. The lusty trio is ably supported by such veteran character actors as Jerry Hardin, Jack Nance and Barry Corbin, and this his hot-as-hell, steamy production was directed by none other than Dennis Hopper. A great film for adults. The ending is a classic. I wonder how much fun the notorious lothario Johnson had while filming this, since he spends a lot of screen time in the arms of Madsen and Connelly, both of whom are at the top of their form.",

      "reviewBody": "My Soul to Take (2010) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nWes Craven&apos;s return to the horror genre hits with a major thud and turns out to be his most disappointing film since VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN. The story is a pretty interesting one as a serial killer murders his pregnant wife as well as six other people but after being shot and stabbed he&apos;s involved in an ambulance crash. His body is never discovered but it&apos;s pretty clear he&apos;s probably dead so the community moves on. Sixteen years later the seven kids who were born on the day he died are know dropping like flies so is it a copycat killer, the dead man&apos;s son, the killer himself or perhaps just his ghost? There are many, many good ideas floating around this film but in the end it&apos;s just way too uneven, confusing and at times laughable to really work. I&apos;ll start with the screenplay that has a few interesting ideas including the fact that souls can jump from one body to the next. This is an interesting idea and they do a few nice things with it but it really seems like this psychological idea was nixed at some level and some executive cut in saying this was a horror film and needed more murders. The movie, for the most part, deals with the fears of these seven kids and then we have more psychological stuff about them being haunted and cursed. Then, out of no where, the film seems to switch on a dime to turn into some crazy slasher where the victims are being torn apart. The psychological stuff begins to wear thin as the story grows more and more out of whack and while the screenplay gets a lot of the blame you can also point the finger at Craven. The first sequence on the bridge actually contains some of that Craven magic where your pulse goes from zero to sixty in a matter of seconds and this expands to an earlier scene where you just know the killer is going to come back to life and although you&apos;re expecting it when it does finally happen it makes for a good jump. The problem is that Craven really doesn&apos;t handle the psychological stuff too well and this is where the movie really loses its way and in the end crashes and burns. I&apos;d be willing to bet that we&apos;re going to get a couple alternate endings when we finally get a DVD release because the ending has so much going on you can&apos;t help but feel things could have ended in a dozen different ways. One of the worst sequences in the film is perhaps the most bizarre and it&apos;s a big chase sequence in the woods. We start off with a possible sexual assault before things changing up and we&apos;re seeing the killer chase two different victims. This scene really doesn&apos;t make too much sense and in many ways what starts it seems out of place but not a single frame of this long sequence has any suspense to it, which is shocking since we&apos;re talking about a Wes Craven film. The performances are about on par for this type of movie so no complaints there. MY SOUL TO TAKE seems to have a lot of interesting ideas floating around but the ideas never really come together and in the end you can&apos;t help but feel disappointed. This isn&apos;t a horrible movie but at the same time you expect a lot more when Wes Craven is involved.\n\nYou pretty much have to give this a second review in terms of the 3-D. I must admit that I didn&apos;t want to watch a Craven film in 3-D but that&apos;s all that was playing around me. Those expecting stuff to jump off the screen are going to be disappointed and those who put down $12 or more dollars (like I did) for the 3-D are going to be extremely mad because there isn&apos;t any 3-D. Well, there are two small things that jump out at you in the entire movie and the rest of the thing is simply flat. In fact, during the movie you can take your glasses off and it&apos;s a 2-D print being shown. There was one other person in the theater with me and he actually watched the movie without the glasses on. I&apos;m not sure how the studio is promoting this thing but there&apos;s no question this wasn&apos;t shot for 3-D but instead converted to it. This isn&apos;t a bad thing but to charge extra money for just a couple quick scenes is a major rip off so for this reason alone I&apos;d recommend people to save their money and wait for DVD or try and catch a 2-D screening."

It was generally described as a fairytale about tolerance and friendship - ant that&apos;s what it is. A fairytale Paris quarter, with fairytale &apos;putaines&apos;, a wise middle aged shopkeeper, a smart teenager - everyday life goes on with a little happiness, a little tragedy, nice period music, simple happy philosophy. The second half of the movie goes on-the-road - in a fairytale Turkey, though definitely more realistic than Paris. Omar Sharif is good, and Pierre Boulanger is even better. This film is perfect to spend a cheerful evening and it is a little joyful lesson on religious tolerance and friendship.",

This movie was a typical Terence Hill, Bud Spencer movie of that era with just a few things missing. 1: Bud Spencer - replaced by Marvin Hagler,   2: Spaghetti western - replaced by spaghetti Miami vice,    3: Clever humor - replaced by poorly given and written dialogue, ridiculous situations, unfunny attempts at doing or saying something funny.    I had trouble sitting through this movie to the end.   I wish I had left poor old Terence back in the 70&apos;s."

What ? Chiefly the depiction of Pete and Bob characters. In the movie the authors made them muddlers, goofy and for what concerns Pete in particular, too much frightful. In a word, the movie shows comical personas...you don&apos;t find anything similar in books, where the humour is &apos;between the lines&apos; and almost completely limited to Jupe&apos;s meetings with Hitchcock. Speaking of Jupe, I don&apos;t know, maybe it&apos;s just me, but reading novels I never imagined him always so frowned and pensive. Besides these considerations, the movie is not bad at all and can be viewed, but surely it will be enjoyed, as it was already remarked, more by young viewers than old readers.",

      "reviewBody": "Director James Cameron scored, against all odds (and his swarm of nervous auditors) a huge success with &quot;Titanic.&quot;  Not as artistically strong as several predecessor films about the legendary disaster it rocked the box office boat as new generations of Titanic enthusiasts and curious folk flooded the theaters.\n\nPersonally fascinated by the tale of the doomed April 1912 maiden voyage of the era&apos;s seaborne tribute to Mammon, with its unsolved mysteries - technical and human - Cameron dives to the wreck site in this 3-D stunning documentary, &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss.&quot;\n\nRMS Titanic&apos;s grave was discovered by Robert Ballard, the foremost maritime archeologist working today.  Using the then latest technology he first located the wreck and then filmed it with &quot;Alvin,&quot; a submersible of amazing capability.  But today &quot;&quot;Alvin&quot; is to underwater exploration and technology what a typewriter is to a PC.  Basing his expedition on a Russian research vessel, Cameron takes to the depths and launches &quot;Jake&quot; and &quot;Elwood,&quot; two camera-equipped robots that can be guided from the mother ship&apos;s two submersibles through the interstices of the sprawling Titanic.  These robots can and are guided through spaces no person could maneuver in, even at shallow depths.\n\nCameron&apos;s intense nature masked by good humor comes clearly across as actor Bill Paxton narrates much of the film.  Paxton doesn&apos;t seem to be acting as he seeks multiple reassurances from the Russian crew man operating the descending sub that there are ways to escape if something goes wrong.\n\n&quot;Jake&quot; and &quot;Elwood&quot; capture scenes from the ship no previous expedition could.  At one point the viewer is staring up front at a bathroom mirror with water jug and glass eerily standing exactly where the stateroom&apos;s occupant left it before the collision.  The grand staircase is gone but its cavernous space is superimposed by scenes from Cameron&apos;s feature film, creating an almost scary sense of reality. Period music accompanies the changing scenes which alternate the brief life and long interment of the grand vessel.\n\nThis was a scientific expedition with microbiologists on board to assess the continuing and inevitable reduction of RMS Titanic to dust.  But the bulk of the film deals with the evidence of life on the ship during its short journey and the story is told with verve.\n\nThis is a 3-D film that fully and beautifully exploits the medium and it&apos;s a deep sea outing for the whole family.  \n\nAll that said, is there anything negative about &quot;Ghosts from the Abyss?&quot; There sure is: whatever the cost of 3-D cinematography it&apos;s a near crime to limit the end result to a mere 60 minutes!!\n\n9/10.",

But they are there to bring misery and murder instead. Since this carnival people are actually vampires (even the animals are vampires and could transforms to human begins!) getting their revenge of their master Count Mitterhaus (Robert Tayman) got staked in the heart 15 years ago. Which their master, they were killed by the villagers and now this vampires are trying to kill all the woman and children. So, their master could comeback to life.\n\nDirected by Robert Young (Splitting Heirs) made an fascinating vampire horror movie, despite its poor production values. But this movie has some light erotic moments and some arresting scenes as well. It is also amusing Tongue in Cheek as well. But the British cast are good here and actually well written also. But i felt, there&apos;s something missing in the movie. But it&apos;s satisfying enough and die-hard fans of the famous &quot;Hammer&quot; production will enjoy this. David Prowse, who plays &quot;The Strongman&quot; in the movie. Prowse is best known for playing &quot;Darth Vader&quot; in the suit in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. (*** ½/*****).",

      "reviewBody": "It is an open house for the Frankenstein monster, Dracula, and the wolfman again in this follow-up to House of Frankenstein, again directed by Erle C. Kenton.  Though not as polished and exciting as HOF, House of Dracula is by no means a disappointment.  This time round a kindly doctor played by Onslow Stevens agrees to help not only Dracula with blood transfusions and the like but also Larry Talbot, played again by Lon Chaney.  Assisted by his hunchbacked nurse, nicely played by Jane Adams, and his other nurse, the luscious Martha O&apos;Driscoll, Stevens works hard to help both monsters with success and failure.  John Carradine again plays Dracula, and he is enigmatic.  The story deals mostly again with helping Talbot fight the curse of the full moon.  Dracula&apos;s role is larger here than in HOF, and Carradine plays the vampire with subtlety.  Glenn Strange is back as the monster, but his part is smaller than it was in HOF.  As with most of Universal&apos;s horror pictures, there is a generous dose of eerie settings and dark atmospheres. A lot of fun!"

When his old elephant and the baby Kern are stolen by criminals, Kham finds that the animals were sent to Sidney. He travels to Australia, where he locates the baby elephant in a restaurant owned by the evil Madame Rose (Xing Jing), the leader of an international Thai mafia. With the support of the efficient Thai sergeant Mark (Petchtai Wongkamlao), who was involved in a conspiracy, Kham fights to rescue the animal from the mobsters.\n\n&quot;Tom Yum Goong&quot; has a silly, flawed and absurd story, where gangsters do not use guns, but sticks, clubs, rollers, bicycles, motorcycles or whips. Further, they just fight in sequence against the hero, one by one, to have their arms and legs broken. The criminal Johnny simply vanishes without any further explanation. However, the choreography of the fights is amazing and very realistic, making this movie a worthwhile entertainment. Tony Jaa is probably the successor of Jackie Chan and Jet Li, and I believe this movie could be less &quot;serious&quot; and have more humor like in Jackie Chan&apos;s films. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Protetor&quot; (&quot;The Protector&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Marki Bey stars as a foxy lady, named Diana &quot;Sugar&quot; Hill. Her handsome prince fiancé, Langston, owns a Voodoo-themed night club in the deep south. The club is so successful, that the local mobster, Mr. Morgan, wants to pressure Langston into selling the club to him. When Langston refuses, Morgan&apos;s thugs beat Langston to death, in the parking lot of the club.\n\nConsumed with anguish and thoughts of vengeance, Sugar decides to take matters into her own hands. She seeks out an elderly Voodoo priestess, named Mama Maitresse. Sugar explains to her, that she needs Mama&apos;s help, via her Voodoo powers. Mama Maitresse conjures up the ruler of the dead, Baron Zamedi. He then summons an army of Zombies, who were all former slaves, to help Sugar dispatch Langston&apos;s killers, one-by-one.\n\nMarki Bey can certainly compete in the looks department, with that other 70s Blaxploitation goddess, Pam Grier. Ms. Bey is completely convincing as the grief-stricken Sugar, who is determined to settle the score with Morgan and his henchmen. \n\nRobert Quarry&apos;s performance as the suave yet vicious Morgan, is pulled-off well. But it&apos;s not Quarry&apos;s most compelling role. He was much more charismatic, in his past performances in his Vampire films. So if you&apos;re a Robert Quarry fan, be forewarned that he doesn&apos;t shine that brightly, in this film.\n\nBetty Anne Rees plays Morgan&apos;s racist, sex-starved girlfriend, Celeste. Betty Anne has a natural talent for portraying licentious, dangerous characters, with malicious intent. Her wicked-looking, gleaming gray eyes, make your blood run cold. Celeste is a particularly vile character, and Sugar exacts exquisitely appropriate revenge on her, in this film. Viewers will be cheering at Celeste&apos;s utter comeuppance, orchestrated by Sugar and the zombies.\n\nDon Pedro Colley as Baron Samedi, gives an over-the-top performance. Don really chews-up the scenery, emoting like mad. You can tell that he really enjoys his role, as Baron Samedi. The other actors give mostly wooden performances. Especially Richard Lawson&apos;s portrayal of Valentine, the cop who was also Sugar&apos;s former love interest.\n\nLike virtually all the films of the Blaxploitation genre, Sugar Hill&apos;s main thrust is revenge. Only a tiny handful of 70s Blaxploitation films, worked horror into their plot-lines. Of those, Sugar Hill stands out from the rest of the bunch. For fans of 70s Blaxploitation films, Sugar Hill delivers the goods.",

My first reaction was that someone who had not seen Belle de Jours would probably not enjoy this. It is in the cinema what Wide Sargasso Sea is in literature, a kind of recreation of a known theme. De Oliveira builds up an amazing tension round what is finally going to happen between the two characters and that makes the meal at the end an example of suspense based not on action so typical of the thriller, but rather on the word, which in Oliveira&apos;s films acquires the stature of protagonist. A great movie!",

      "reviewBody": "When I started watching all the film noirs I could find, I was a bit disappointed in this. However, after three viewings I now find it decent. It&apos;s nothing super, but certainly better than what I though at first. A big help is having a better print of the film. This is one of those movies that always had a poor VHS quality transfer and many times the same on DVD. Finding a good print is hard, although I finally got a decent one with this Killer Classic DVD set that includes this movie.\n\nThe story, like the print, is not always easy to follow, either, even though the premise is very simple. A man discovers he has been poisoned and there is no hope for recovery. Before he dies, he retraces his steps to find out who &quot;murdered him&quot; (even though he&apos;s still alive when saying that) and why. \n\nThe story gets a bit complicated. Like a Sherlock Holmes or Charlie Chan mystery, there are a number of suspects that keep popping up. Many of them are hard to figure.\n\nThis is an odd film noir for several quirky things in this movie. The lead character, &quot;Frank Bigelow&quot; (Edmund O&apos;Brien), is strange and kind of stupid in the beginning. There are a half dozen of these dumb whistle-like wolf call sound-effects that come out every time he sees a pretty woman. It just doesn&apos;t fit in a tough film noir. Then there is his possessive girlfriend/secretary &quot;Paula,&quot; (Pamela Britton) who is constantly calling him and paranoid about his whereabouts. She acts more like an insecure, nagging wife but she obviously cares a great deal about him. But, man, give the poor guy some space! \n\nThe dialog in this film ranges from incredibly stupid to very clever and solid film noir material.\n\nWe also see one of the most sadistic people I have ever seen on film: &quot;Chester,&quot; played by the sadistic-looking Neville Brand. Wow, is this guy sick or what? He reminded me of &quot;Vera&quot; (Ann Savage) in &quot;Detour.&quot; Those two would have made an interesting couple! Brand&apos;s character is only interested in one thing in life: inflicting pain and the slower and more brutal, the better.\n\nAnyway, if you find a good print, tolerate some of the goofy things in the film, this is an interesting film noir that gets better with each viewing, as you understand the story better.",

      "reviewBody": "Pi is the kind of movie I wished I could&apos;ve seen in one of those dank art-house movie theaters in New York City, as it&apos;s practically gift-wrapped for the crowds. But it&apos;s not done with every shot lingering on the characters, soaking in minimalism in its black and white photography, quite the opposite. Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker I first got into through Requiem for a Dream, which now years after I saw it I want to revisit again upon the soon to be released the Fountain and especially after now seeing Pi. Before with &apos;Requiem&apos;, I did like the movie a lot, but felt a little apprehensive about deeming it that old term &apos;masterpiece&apos; as the editing, while ultra fast for a purpose, almost came off as too &quot;MTV&quot; for me. But years later, after hundreds of more films taken in, I&apos;m ready for a second look. In this particular case, Pi is also the kind of movie that warrants a second look at the director&apos;s other films. His themes run just as much together as does his breakneck style. And it&apos;s not just to show off; he truly does get inside a psychology through subjective camera AND editing, to a degree that might impress Hitchcock, albeit with some whiplash.\n\nMax Cohen played by Sean Gullette is the protagonist of the story, who&apos;s main foe is none other than the universe itself, in a sense, all through one number. Or rather, a series of numbers, one which might unlock the Stock Market secret for him. He doesn&apos;t even want to play the market, mind you, but the point for him- if one can follow- might be attributed to a repeated memory he has of looking at the sun as a boy, and soon looking past the shock of actually looking long at it. This is a very small device by Aronofsky but it works well to establish- and continue- this man&apos;s downward spiral. And spirals, by the way, seem to also figure into the film, as well as a secret technology firm (with a woman who reminded me of Condaleeza Rice look-alike), and especially a near undercover Hasidim ring where they need the numbers *in* Cohen&apos;s head to unlock some big secret to God. But even with all of this pressure, Cohen can&apos;t shake what&apos;s dogging him around, in his own cramped, wire-ridden apartment, with many bugs crawling around.\n\nThe key for this movie really is atmosphere, in the acting (if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes that&apos;s the point too, and it&apos;s probably the strangest performance of a lifetime for Gullette), the production design (that apartment and the subways), the grainy, spectacular photography by Matthew Libatique, the editing to be sure- which here, unlike the breakneck &apos;Requiem&apos;, does take a break from the cuts so quick they almost past subliminally (which isn&apos;t bad)- and the moody music that is so slight you almost forget its there. It even works for me, and this is a big plus, as someone who&apos;s not really interested in mathematics (worst subject in school), and even better as it drew me in to his obsessions with it. I really liked one of the early scenes between Max and his the friendly Hassidic man who explains on paper different numbers and their relation to parts of the Torah. And, in the end, it all comes down to getting engrossed through what the filmmaker&apos;s bringing in with this man. There is a sort of detachment from reality- that most of us would never touch much of this with a ten foot pole- but then again it really isn&apos;t. Aronofsky also makes a point of some hallucinations/dreams adding to the ambiance, skidding almost towards the pretentious, and thus creating a world all of its own in Pi for Max, and for us as well.\n\nA film that I shall certainly seek out again when I can, if only to see if I can understand some things a little more (or maybe not as case might be), and to see such a powerhouse performance from Gullette.

Krpa is a rowdy guy who abuses his wife and fights constantly, and is also a thief who robs stores. He is the first of the wonderful people portrayed. \n\nFilip has just returned from drug rehabilitation in Spain, and his parents attempt to convince him to find a job to stay out of trouble. He would rather hang out in a bar with his friends.\n\nKizo is a drunk who lives with his mother. His father is dead and he is shown buying beer and cat food and feeding a litter of kittens. Peta would love this man.\n\nThe last winner is Dejo, and he has the misfortune of being the only Serb in the group. He is also a heroin addict who owes money to everyone. \n\nThe four buddies get involved in a deal to transport drugs inside a bag of potatoes. Naturally, the merry band of misfits do not have a pleasant journey."

      "reviewBody": "A man picked randomly out of a crowd is made the target of CIA surveillance and pursuit.\n\nAs Tom Hanks himself acknowledges, the movie is not that good. The plot is okay, but a bit convoluted. The comedy is more often of the absurd kind, and I am not sure it always succeeds. Jim Belushi is rather the strong point of the comedy parts. Also, as 1980s movies end to do, a romance is thrown in for some reason... it seems somewhat forced.\n\nWhat makes this movie worth watching, despite the &quot;blah&quot; of the overall plot and comedy, is the ensemble cast. Tom Hanks may be the star, but he probably doesn&apos;t have 50% of the screen time, because he is sharing it with Dabney Coleman, Jim Belushi, Carrie Fisher (in a small role), Charles Durning, Ed Hermann, Lori Singer, Gerrit Graham and more I&apos;m not recalling at the moment. It is a truly impressive cast.",

      "reviewBody": "Bob Hope was at the height of his comedy career and reputation when he did FANCY PANTS. Unlike some of the other movies he made in the forties and fifties he actually had a female partner here who matched him as a comedian. Here it was Lucille Ball. Ball and Hope actually proved to be a good pairing.\n\nFANCY PANTS is based on RUGGLES OF RED GAP. Instead of Hope being a genuine butler/valet he is an actor who is playing a butler/valet. Renamed &quot;Humphrey&quot; or Arthur Tyler, Hope is a dreadful actor. His company is performing a ramshackle mystery where he is the villain. The best part of this is Eric Blore as the head of the family, critically wounded in an assassination attempt by &quot;Humphrey&quot; the butler, who shouts out an incomprehensible and accusingly nasty string of words at &quot;Humphrey&quot; ending with the words &quot;DEMNED LYING SCOUNDREL!!&quot; Hope, frightened at being exposed, looks at the other angry cast members and says &quot;He&apos;s lying!!&quot;.\n\nThe cast is hired by a fortune hunter using them to pretend to be his aristocratic family to impress the Flouds and marry their daughter. But the Flouds are not impressed except with &quot;Humphrey&quot; because he tried to overcompensate with his work as a butler when he kept stepping on the &quot;performances&quot; of the others. As a result, Mrs. Floud (Lea Penman) purposely trips him so that he is fired by the fortune hunter (and so Mrs. Floud can hire him). \n\nDespite the suspicions of Mr. Floud (Jack Kirkwood) and daughter Agatha (Ball), Humphrey accompanies the family back to their western estate in the Arizona territory. The territory is looking forward to becoming a new state. Anything that would speed this is encouraged. \n\nIt turns out that President Theodore Roosevelt is visiting the territory. The townspeople are excited as it might assist them in pushing for statehood. But there is a misunderstanding: word that Agatha had been pursued by an English lord spread around, and when Humphrey showed up it was assumed he was the Earl of Burnley. The Flouds find they can&apos;t disavow this mistake and are forced to treat Humphrey as a potential son-in-law. To add to the natural anger of the Flouds at this error and it&apos;s attending problems of stomaching a now arrogant Humphrey, there is the danger from Cart Belknap (Bruce Cabot) a neighbor who has had a kind of understanding with Agatha about eventually marrying her. Everything comes to a head when the President (John Alexander) shows up. For a change Humphrey manages to portray his role perfectly - too perfectly. He boasts too much about his riding abilities, and ends up involved in a fox hunt with the President and the townspeople. To complicate matters, Belknap is double checking &quot;the Earl&quot; and is physically threatening him.\n\nThe changes in the script improve it, as the original movie had tedious stretches when nothing was happening to Ruggles and the other characters. There is more unity of actions and Hope&apos;s cowardly conniver is quite funny. For example, when he arrives in the west he gets lost and separated from his stagecoach. Suddenly Humphrey refuses to be realistic. Walking through several full puddles and ponds, he convinces himself they are all mirages. There is also a moment when, still believing Humphrey is the perfect butler, Agatha insists he help her fix her hair. Not knowing what to do Humphrey teases her hair upward into a &quot;hive&quot; style, and puts a bird in a cage into the center of it.\n\nThe film&apos;s structure is smoother even though it does not include the &quot;Gettysburg Address&quot; speech. The cast is quite good especially Hope and Ball, Blore (briefly), Cabot, and John Alexander reprising (this time &quot;legitimately&quot;) his &quot;Teddy Roosevelt&quot; from ARSENIC AND OLD LACE.",

It was set on an island and the Komodo&apos;s were crawling around although you could never be sure when or where they would strike. When they did strike, they did it hard!\n\nThere have been quite a few disappointing lizard/snake/amphibian films over the years where the creatures have looked totally fake and the plots have been very comedic. I am pleased to say that Komodo was very different and I would recommend checking it out."

      "reviewBody": "A totally unique film in Danish film history. A post-apocalyptic science fiction film. Only a little more than 3000 people saw the film in the Danish cinemas, but it´s not really that bad. It&apos;s a mixture of Italian &quot;Mad Max&quot; rip off´s, Andrei Tarkovsky´s films, Lars Von Triers &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; and Luc Besson´s &quot;Le Dernier combat&quot;.\n\nThe theme is your responsibility to do what is right, even though you have been ordered to do something else. It&apos;s a film which in many ways are very similar to Kristian Levring´s other films. It´s also about isolated people under enormous pressure, and how they react under these extreme circumstances.\n\n This film tries to both be an art cinema film and an action film, but do not succeed completely in any of the genres. But still it´s not uninteresting. The biggest problem with the film is the really bad sound work, which means that the lips are not in sync when the actors are speaking. Steen Jørgensen, the singer of the famous danish band Sort Sol plays the films bad guy &quot;Gule&quot;(&quot;Yellow&quot;), but Sort Sol has not delivered any of the music to the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Whatever truth about youth is revealed or explored herein is elusive. Youth is foolish, cunning, wise? We are left wondering. Worth seeing because of the cast (Loretta Young at 17, Myrna Loy in her exotic-vamp stage, silent-era relic Conway Tearle, pretty but awkward David Manners). The first minutes of dense and clumsy exposition play like the synopsis of a Victorian novel, which is pretty close to the actual origin of this story (it was a play in London in 1901 starring, among others, Constance Collier in the Loy role). I had to rewind to get a clear sense of the relationships. It doesn&apos;t help that during all this verbiage Young is wearing a gown with a downright bizarre decoration directly on the crotch which seems to shout &quot;Pre- Code Costume! Don&apos;t listen - look!&quot;\n\nThe conflict begins when David Manners, pledged to marry Young, falls instead for nightclub performer Loy whose exotic, cynical, gold-digger comes as refreshing counterpoint to Young&apos;s homespun housekeeper&apos;s daughter. Loy lip syncs a couple of forgettable songs and dances passably &amp; briefly, looking gorgeous at all times. Melodies of two better songs of the day, &quot;Get Happy&quot; and &quot;Miss Wonderful,&quot; are played during nightclub scenes. \n\nYoung&apos;s line readings are smooth and natural, especially considering her age at the time. But they are, in fact, rattled off too smoothly to register the subtleties of thought that her character is experiencing, so that when she reaches certain conclusions late in the story, they seem arbitrary. Loy&apos;s best moment is an outburst of anger while in the arms of David Manners when she finds out he isn&apos;t quite the cash cow she thought he was, but the scene collapses when she hurls a vase at him, and misses by a mile. Manners himself is slightly less wooden than usual, but only slightly. He does manage to get a drunk scene half right.\n\nA few inter-titles illustrate a lingering habit from the silent era, while underscoring in some dramatic scenes reminds us that even in 1930 pure unadulterated soundtrack hiss was not always the case.\n\nTo those who find the ending shocking, tut-tut. Surprising, maybe."

      "reviewBody": "This film immediately captured my attention with the written comments at the beginning of the film. Director Jean Cocteau begins this story by explaining why he wanted to make this film. He talks about the passion behind the picture and all the social unrest at the time. He ends this written dialogue with a comment that will forever remain in my mind. He says, &quot;...and now, we begin our story with a phrase that is like a time machine for children: Once Upon a Time...&quot; This just sent chills down my spine. Why? Because, although he is addressing children, I feel that it is really a phrase meant for all of us. It is used to bring the child out in all of us, to show us that we do not need to be 4 or 5 to fully understand the themes of this film ... we are meant to just sit back and let the film take us to another mythological time. \n\nThe amazing set design also impressed me about this film. Again, without the modern conveniences of today&apos;s cinema, Cocteau had to improvise. This was hard for him to do. Not only were there huge budgetary issues (since it was the end of WWII and France was about to be demolished), but also he was racing against an impending war. Fear was deep in the hearts of the French after WWII, and what a better way to rally your people then with a story about love found in the darkest of places. \n\nThis film also made me very sad. I am sometimes disgusted with the way that Disney ... for lack of a better word ... Disney-fies their fairy tales. I think after watching this masterpiece I will have trouble ever being able to go back to the computer generated &quot;Song as Old as Time&quot; version that Disney plastered their trademark to. Never have I been so impressed with black and white cinematography as I have been with this film. The actress that plays Belle, Josette Day, steals the camera every time it is on her. She looks so radiant with the black and white that to see a colorized version of this film would completely do it injustice. The power and emotion that comes between Belle and the Beast feels so true. Cocteau has somehow grabbed the true feeling of two people that are complete opposites that seem to find true love in the coldest of places. I would be one of those reviewers that believes that if this film were released today, it would still pull the audiences in as it did the first time. Only proving that it was made well before it&apos;s time, it shows so many of the characteristics of the modern day movie. Even the special effects seem perfect for this film. Even with budget being sub-par, we are able to get a true feeling that this Beast is one of the magical kind. \n\nOh, this film was superb. I would have to say that it is the best adaptation of a fairy tale that I have seen today. Definitely my best 40s film (made in 1946), and possibly the best telling of Beauty and the Beast EVER!!\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****",

At times it works, and at other times it &quot;Sho don&apos;t&quot;, but director Michael D&apos;Anna presents it in a visually appealing fashion. &quot;Side Sho&quot; is chalk full of horror clichés and plenty of bloody humor to reel in the low budget horror fans, but the story simply falls apart in the second act. You end up wondering if the funding dried up by the end of the film, because even the makeup effects seem to decline in value, and it almost seems to be rushing toward the climax with no real payoff. The acting is all over the board, some hit, some miss, with the best performance coming from the dad played by J.D. Hart. The scenery and locations look great, but the story doesn&apos;t take full advantage of this, and it just seems wasted here. It is certainly worth an evening&apos;s rental, but don&apos;t expect much more then eye candy without much filling.",

Subplots involving a loveless and abusive marriage between wed doctors (MArley Shelton and Josh Brolin) and rival brothers--one a sheriff (Michael Biehn),the other a BBQ rib joint proprietor (Jeff Fahey,who was unrecognizable to me at first)--seem to be padding to build conflict toward a big,bloody,messy,fiery climax,and if there&apos;s anyone who understands those kinds of film finishes,it&apos;s director Robert Rodriguez,working the usual flourish and flair.\n\nOn it&apos;s own or added to Tarantino&apos;s road menace pic,this is still quite a bit of non-brain-taxing fun!"

The story continues with the familiar inner conflict of desiring forbidden experiences and how each individual reacts to the big city&apos;s temptations. Not to give away the story further, I&apos;ll just say the two girls in question are easy on the eyes and the director certainly knows it. My only criticism might be the understandable yet slightly too frequent lingering on the faces of these lovely girls, but this is certainly a minor criticism.\n\nI highly recommend this beautifully done film!",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Fernandel&apos;s minor and less-known films. It is to be seen occasionally on French TV and I have just ( September 10th 2005 ) managed to acquire a copy on DVD in René Château&apos;s Collection &quot;Memoire du Cinéma Français - Les Années 50 ) but it is indeed a rare item as it would appear to have gone out of print almost as soon as having been edited !! The film lasts precisely 75 minutes.\n\nBasically I thought the first 55 minutes of the film were highly amusing but that the last twenty minutes are far less interesting. It does help, though if, like me you are an unconditional fan of the one and only Fernandel !\n\nJust under the first hour this film is indeed hilarious with Fernandel trying to pass off as the Duke of Miramar ( Le Duc de Miramar ) instead of Luc de Miramar, a simple hotel porter. When he stays at the Cigalière run by the inimitable Thérèse Dorny, hilarious situations arrive. Dorny plays the wealthy aunt of his friend André Duroc, who is a bit of a ne&apos;er do well and a high-liver but whose aunt believes him to be a great inventor in the making ! André Duroc is played by the great French Actor Andrex. He actually has his aunt believing that he has invented a machine to rock hens during their sleep so that they may lay three times more eggs ! His aunt has promised him all the money he wants if he manages to get a Duke to come and stay at her château. This will facilitate her being elected &quot;Présidente d&apos;Honneur&quot; ( honorary president ) of of the &quot;Ligue des Us et Coutumes&quot; ( equivalent of an association which seeks to perpetuate ancient rites and customs ). So Duroc obliges, and there&apos;s also some comic romantic element with Duroc getting his girlfriend to pass off as the Duke&apos;s sister so that his aunt will (financially) bless their marriage ! \n\nIn the last twenty minutes the story changes completely once the cat is out of the bag and he has to exit the château in a hurry and gets caught up in military manoeuvres nearby. It&apos;s not the same kind of humour and tends to drag on. Anyway, well worth seeing for all the fun and antics in the château where the viewer can delight in accents and characters which seem totally absent from the France of today I wonder where on earth he &quot;Cigalière&quot; was actually filmed. Of course most of the film was shot in a studio, but at one point we do see the &quot;Pont du Gard&quot; and the backdrop to Dorny&apos;s La Cigalière bears a strange resemblance to the Mont Ventoux.There are also some scenes with strong winds, which lead me to believe that the area in question was buffeted by the &quot;Mistral&quot; and was probably somewhere in the south of the Rhône valley !",

      "reviewBody": "Spione (Spies) is a Fritz Lang film about spy espionage. The plot is strangely more complicated than more recent spy flicks (which is a good thing). The film focuses on No. 326, a spy that is responsible for investigating leads on a mysterious mastermind that controls a network of spies. The mastermind, known as Haghi, plots to steal an important treaty. It turns out that he leads a double life as the owner of a successful bank (which apparently makes him richer than Henry Ford). Things get complicated when Haghi sends a female spy, Sonya, to prevent No. 326 from interfering. Sonya falls in love with No. 326 while still under the supervision of Haghi, leading to the usual conflicts.\n\nThe acting and characterization was wonderful. Haghi is the definition of bad guy: you know he is evil when you see the goatee. Confined to a wheelchair, he is the perfect blend of intelligence and deceptiveness. Agent No. 326 is an interesting character, although he loses some of his features as the film progresses. Sonya is beautiful and acted wonderfully. Among the side characters, I found that Colonel Jellusic and Doctor Masimoto stood out.\n\nAlthough a little overlong, the film is at no point slow. Mixing fast pacing with well-placed plot twists (which really build up towards the end), anyone with interest in the subject should have no problem enjoying it for the entire running time.\n\nI was not sure what to expect from Spione before watching it, seeing that it is a largely forgotten film. I enjoy Fritz Lang films, and this was no exception. It may not be the caliber of M, but it succeeds anyway. If you do not mind silent films and enjoy the spy/espionage genre (namely, James Bond), then you will enjoy this one.",

Also, as this was the first Dogme film I&apos;d seen, I was also really questioning the whole concept.  The opening scenes seemed amateurish in both filming and acting, with jerky editing and camera movements, and seemingly one-dimensional characters.  But it really grew on me as I kept watching.  The more the characters revealed themselves, the more sympathetic and complex they became.  It actually became quite engrossing as the film progressed.  There were just so many moments of geniune warmth and humor.  In fact, what really struck me about this film after it was all over was its geniuneness.  I haven&apos;t seen anything so heartwarming in a long time.  8/10.",

Rather he is happy floating through life with little direction or ambition.\n\nYeon-hee (Eom Jeong-hwa) is girl approaching thirty who is desperate to find a suitable husband, but is looking for a match based on social and economic suitability rather than love.\n\nThey meet on a blind date and quickly find that they are incompatible intellectually, but have an instant physical and emotional connection. Both are extremely practically minded, and as such decide to explore each other by starting a casual physical relationship, while she continues looking for more suitable husband and he avoids commitment.\n\nThis is a very modern tale, which is romantic, dramatic, smart, sexy and realistic. Turning the romance genre on it&apos;s head, and showing what dating is really like for modern thirty-somethings, who have emotional baggage, preconceived ideals and expectations, and too much self-interest to open themselves up to the possibility of a deeper kind of love.\n\nBrilliantly written, excellently performed, smartly directed. If you think that Marriage really is a Crazy Thing then you will more than likely find a lot to love within this film.",

With more sex and violence this would have been a giallo and we would have worried less about one after the other being made to appear the guilty one. Great start with robbery against the backdrop of Tower Bridge and we proceed with a fantastic little river trip amidst the docks that were. Hard now to recall just how dismal, dirty and downright depressing some of these bits of London were in the early sixties. Great to see now though and contrast with today. \n\nThe story slows as we go to the circus but there are plenty of period vehicles and fairly interesting turns to watch. Klaus Kinski, and Suzy Kendall have far too little to do and whilst not wishing to spoil anything, what a strange part for Christopher Lee!",

I have gotten so much enjoyment from this film i feel i should pay Dolph. I am still curious as to why Dolph flushes the toilet after I think it&apos;s Offerman gets beat up over the toilet. Do not take this movies seriously though because its just worth it to actually think about it.Hutch from the old Starsky and Hutch is the old Nazi guy who you can&apos;t understand a single word he says because he is so crazy. Its also great because Bruce Malmuth stars in it as well in which he also wrote the story for. This was definitely the movie that made Dolph more passionate about making such hilarious films."

      "reviewBody": "The good news is this movie features some gratuitous nudity from the beauteous Italian actress Ornella Muti. The bad news is it features far, far more gratuitous nudity from the not-so-beauteous and quite corpulent French actor Gerard Depardieu. This is another slice of Italo-Gallic insanity from director Marco Ferreti. It somewhat resembles his later, more famous film &quot;Ciao, Monkey&quot;, but instead of a baby monkey, Depardieu&apos;s character has a chubby human baby. But like the monkey in the later film, the male baby is largely a metaphor for the perpetual narcissistic infantilism of Depardieu&apos;s character.\n\nDepardieu plays a single father whose feminist wife leaves him alone with their small baby. This doesn&apos;t slow down his inveterate womanizing,however, and he soon starts an affair with a young daycare teacher (Muti). It&apos;s a little disturbing, especially by modern-day standards, the way Depardieu and Muti engage in naked foreplay pretty much right in front of the baby (although they do have the decency to go into the next room to actually screw). Children that young have little memory, however, so I&apos;m sure the infant actor was much less traumatized by Depardiue&apos;s bloated nude body than I was. Anyway, there&apos;s a lot of melodrama involving the Depardieu character&apos;s continuing compulsive infidelities and his feelings of male irrelevancy in the face of feminism and female sexual liberation. In fact, if the male organ with its insatiable appetites, extreme insecurities, and fickle nature somehow became an actual person it would be just like Depardieu&apos;s character in this movie. (So basically, Depardieu here plays a big chubby dick).\n\nAs other reviewers have said,the end of this movie is quite shocking-- Depardieu is harpooned by Captain Ahab and he drags him, his ship, and his entire crew to the bottom of the ocean. . . Oh wait, that was &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Well, the end of this movie is even more shocking, especially if you&apos;re male. Depardieu does give a very good performance, so I certainly would recommend this to his fans. Muti is not as good (but, oh man, is she beautiful), and this film really marks her transition to the kind of daring art films she is best known for (and without which she&apos;d be a forgotten Italian version of Brooke Shields today) And whatever you can say about Marco Ferreti&apos;s films, they&apos;re definitely NOT dull. This not great, but check it out if it sounds interesting to you."

Even though the segments which comprise the film vary in quality, the film as a whole is a bright, colorful and amusing light entertainment which fit wartime needs ideally. \n\nHighlights include two spirited Benny Goodman swing numbers (&quot;All The Cats Join In&quot; and &quot;After You&apos;ve Gone&quot;) and the unforgettable finale, &quot;Willie the Operatic Whale&quot;, narrated and sung by Nelson Eddy. The animation is generally first-rate and the Technicolor film will dazzle any viewer not expecting a genuine masterwork. \n\nMake Mine Music was successful enough to warrant a considerably better follow-up, Melody Time (1948).\n\nThe undistinguished but harmless &quot;Martins and the Coys&quot; segment, concerning the gun-feuding backwoods families of American folklore, has idiotically been removed from current editions, evidently for PC reasons. It&apos;s scary that Disney may start altering their classics to meet artificial modern standards. (If they had cut anything from Make Mine Music, it should have been the tasteless &quot;Two Silhouettes&quot; ballet, all doilies and valentines and icky fake sentiment.)",

The narrative of the film can easily appeal to the young audience. However, it is best to watch the 2014 Maleficent film before watching this movie so that you will understand its story better.",

They&apos;re thinking in general that these two are making fun from they. Funny situations are based on learning how the things works and misunderstandings of explanations how to solve situations by these two earth incomers. I think this is funny movie, actually by it&apos;s story and also actors and their fine work. You must see it to know what about i&apos;m talking. It&apos;s some time after i saw this movie.

This one is finally on that level. Lots of characters offering their running gags, great cameos, beautiful sets, and a lovely finish. The songs weren&apos;t quite up to par, but I was glad they decided to have musical numbers. That&apos;s the heartwarming Muppets I remember! Thank you Henson studios for bringing them back (and including Pepe the Prawn and Bobo in there)!",

      "reviewBody": "Brad Armstrong is known for his super-productions, the porno equivalent of those lousy &quot;tent-pole&quot; big-budget junkers the mainstream Hollywood studios crank out. &quot;Coming Home&quot; is cited as an epic, but despite the actor-director&apos;s best efforts it emerges as merely an over-stuffed mediocre little film.\n\nViewed a decade later, its intentional topical tie-in to the Iraq war has worn off, and we&apos;re left with a slice of Americana, which Brad did on a far better scale earlier in his career with Stephanie Swift in &quot;Crossroads&quot;. I like that rural genre, citing Michael Raven&apos;s &quot;Adrenaline&quot; and Red Ezra&apos;s &quot;Roadblock&quot; as similar features. But with &quot;Coming Home&quot;, Brad goes for small-town America and war, as he plays the lead character, a reservist called up to go to Iraq, with horrible consequences.\n\nI won&apos;t spoil the contrived main twist, which doesn&apos;t happen until over 2 hours into the bloated 3-hour feature. Many of the 10 lengthy sex scenes are extraneous, typical of porn these days, but not conducive to taking a film seriously. As if that weren&apos;t enough, in the DVD Bonus section, there&apos;s a Randy Spears sex scene with Gianna Lynn not in the final cut of the feature, and Brad even talks in his BTS segment about how Randy, as a tough drill sergeant, is appearing for him in a non- sex role, non-sex either by design or mere hindsight.\n\nDespite its winning knee-jerk acting awards for the two male leads, I was quite unhappy with the casting. Brad as our hero is unappealing at this stage of his career, Woody Allen-ing his way to behind the camera emphasis, but as revealed in the BTS, unable to pass up the role he&apos;s written. Whether this is because no other director would want him anymore or just a selfish attitude toward his own project (he wrote it) -the project evidently doesn&apos;t come first in his pecking order, is a moot point.\n\nIt&apos;s ultimately a vehicle for Wicked contract star Kirsten Price, and she does a fine job as his wife, torn between two loves. But as best buddy, Barrett Blade is lousy as usual, an actor-director who has yet to impress me in either department. As a sexy stud in a porn film, he comes off about as appealing as if mainstream&apos;s Larry the Cable Guy were cast in such roles. On the flip side of that coin, as his girlfriend Shyla Stylez (misspelled here Styles) is fine in bed and delivering anal sex to the package, but her acting is not up to what&apos;s needed for such a big part.\n\nMost of the rest of the big-name cast is relegated to crappy assignments that could have been filled by anybody from Porn Central Casting. Exception is Vanessa Lane as a stripper, extremely well-cast for her close resemblance to star Price.\n\nThe war scene is an uninteresting staging with lots of gun flares and bullets flying but no excitement. Similarly, the basic training is a dull montage of visual clichés. What we&apos;re left with is routine soap opera on the home front, a disappointing ending (Brad proclaims he&apos;s rejecting the Hollywood Ending approach but substitutes something worse), and uninvolving sex footage. Worst acting razzie goes to Scott Lyons as Brad&apos;s brother, reading his lines with so little conviction I was surprised his takes (and the actor in toto) were left in the final print. He&apos;s yet another &quot;award-winning&quot; Adult actor with zero talent."

      "reviewBody": "Heinz Erhardt debuts his television character Willi Winzig on the big screen in this musical comedy based on the stage play &quot;Das Had Man Nun Davon&quot; by Wilhelm Lichtenberg. Winzig and his pal Felix Klein (Ralf Wolter) are two tax collectors who board with Frau Stirnima (Helen Vita), hence the opening number (which doubles as a subtitle for the film): &quot;GruB Sie Gott Frau Stirnima&quot;. As the two jolly penny pincher&apos;s leave on their tandem, we learn that Klein has a crush on their secretary played by Ruth Stephan, who would go on to play Willi&apos;s wife in his next film, but that sequel is only related by the name of the title character anyway. Back in this film however, Willi is a determined bachelor and warns his fellow &apos;Steurinspecteur&apos; about the rigors of marriage. Little does he realize their landlady Strinima wants to gets her hands on a piece of Willi.\n\nStella Mooney co-stars as Winzig&apos;s sexy niece Helga (described in the third edition of the Speelfilm Encyclopedie as &apos;geil&apos;). She is coming to stay with Uncle Willi, though she does so mainly to be close to her singing sensation boyfriend Frank (Rex Gildo). Of course worrisome Willi &amp; Felix fail to grasp this fact and go out in search of her when she goes clubbing. They are pointed in her direction by the hairiest, least attractive and most scruffy looking folk band ever seen on celluloid: The Minstrels. Naturally, both the Minstrels and (especially) Rex Gildo get ample opportunity to strut their musical stuff (and slow the pace of the film down considerably). Helga takes a job as a waitress and soon becomes the object of some misplaced jealousy when secretary Engel gets the wrong impression of Helga&apos;s feelings for Felix. Yes, they couldn&apos;t afford to let that old comedy chestnut rest.\n\nWilli, being a fourth generation civil servant, has been a bit too lenient with some of his nicer (read: female) clients and the powers that be are catching on. So, he first pretends to be a daytime sleepwalker (another tired old cliché), then to have lost his marbles altogether. But, when he decides to check himself into a &apos;Nevenklinik&apos;, the doctor in charge turns out to be nuttier than he is (you guessed it, it was an inmate pretending to be a doctor). Frau Stirnima is getting nowhere with her advances aimed at Willi either. When she invites him up to her bedroom, all he does is grab the opportunity to borrow her late husband&apos;s tux.\n\nDuring a posh party, Winzig starts misbehaving himself in order to be judged certifiably insane in front of the minister of state (Willy Reichert). He only manages to get himself a promotion instead. Now head of the Oberegieringungsrat, Willi can do no wrong with the aforementioned minister, who just happens to be the father of Helga&apos;s boy Frank. When Willi&apos;s seven minutes younger twin (Erhardt in a wig) arrives on the scene to visit Helga, a happy end for all can not be far off. This presumption is proved correct when Willi stops making clever puns and the entire cast begins to sing a reprise of the opening &apos;Frau Stirnima&apos; number. Heinz Erhardt and his alter ego still proved to be popular enough with the German cinema going public to merit another Willi film before the end of the year.\n\n6 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is actually a very good movie. And this is coming from a 16 year old schoolgirl! It is fast paced, not too long, and while the story is a bit confusing sometimes, it is one of the few movies that maintains our attention all the way through. Director John McTiernon ensures that the tension rarely slips, and is fairly faithful to the novel, which needs a great deal of understanding especially in the descriptions of the submarines. Though some of the characters especially Dr Petrov have a more significant role in the book. Speaking of the character, many said that 43-year old Tim Curry of Clue fame, looked young and that it was insane casting. He was only in 15 minutes of the movie, but he is so important, and I was impressed by the depth of Curry&apos;s performance, it&apos;s different to any other role he&apos;s played, and how the character turned out in general. As well as the submarine and the odd visuals, the music was phenomenal as well as the look of the film and the sound, with a conveniently Russian feel to it. It was also very musical with what was going on. The acting is what holds the film together, with a charismatic performance from Sean Connery,(in one of his best post-Bond roles) and a career best from Alec Baldwin. Sam Neill also gives a moving performance, as well as the ever-excellent James Earl Jones, who is in my sister&apos;s favourite film the Lion King. I recommend this movie highly, if you&apos;re a fan of Tom Clancy. I&apos;m not, but I enjoyed it, because I like films that are tense and I like a lot of the actors in the film. 8.5/10.

      "reviewBody": "I first saw Transamerica as the closing film for the Frameline film festival in San Francisco where it won the &quot;The Frameline Audience Award for Best Feature&quot;. The film was obviously a labor of love. Duncan Tucker wrote, directed and wisely cast Felicity Huffman as Bree (before she had been cast as a &quot;desperate housewife&quot;). Huffman&apos;s husband William Macy was executive producer. \n\nThe plot line is certainly the tried and true formula of the transformational road trip, yet the irony of Bree&apos;s concurrent sexual transformation freshens a story that could easily have been cliché. Kevin Zegers and the rest of the supporting cast are superb, but Huffman&apos;s characterization of Bree is Oscar caliber. \n\nSee Transamerica! It&apos;s not tragic like &quot;Boys Don&apos;t Cry&quot;. It&apos;s not about sexuality, fetish, or camp. It&apos;s a movie about otherness, transformation, family, and ultimately acceptance. Felicity Huffman&apos;s Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is absolutely astounding. Her acting skill fills Bree with insecurity, pathos, warmth, humor, and growth which ultimately transforms the audience&apos;s involvement from freak show curiosity to empathy and identification.\n\nThankfully the Weinstein brothers recognized just how outstandingly strong this performance is and decided that Transamerica would be one of the first films they would choose to distribute after their great success at Miramax. \n\nI saw this movie again during it&apos;s limited distribution, again in general distribution and now own the DVD. Each time I&apos;ve watched it I find even more to like. Transamerica is an indie classic.",

It&apos;s funny and oddly disturbing, and so is &quot;Infinity Baby.&quot; Without spoiling what is a slow burn (despite it&apos;s tiny 80 minute runtime), I can tell you that the film is absurd and hard to piece together for the first hour or so, and takes a swift and dark turn for its climax. \n\nThe characters are wonderfully scripted, and all are memorable (although some roles are much smaller than others). A stellar cast full of energetic actors delivers an overall incredible performance, all while preserving a sense of spontaneity that matches nicely with the film&apos;s black-and-white tone. Despite having a plot that seems to be on par with those of &quot;Black Mirror,&quot; the film never loses awareness of its own quirk and is consistently funny (although in more of an Andy Kaufman way and less of a Kevin Hart way, if you get me). \n\nThose who enjoy criticism of social issues, absurdism, and who appreciate a slow-burn should definitely check out this film.

I think he was busy with The Birds when this came out.\n\nSophia Loren is the star both in billing and performance. She&apos;s married to former American GI Anthony Perkins and it&apos;s an abusive relationship. Perkins has to take a flight to Casablanca, but the plane crashes near Bordeaux and miracle of miracles he survives but is not found.\n\nWhat a golden opportunity for a little insurance fraud. And a battered Sophia goes along with it. The rest of the film is the masquerade that Loren plays as she pretends he&apos;s dead like everyone suspects and what she endures with an increasingly unbalanced Perkins.\n\nWhen Sophia Loren won her Oscar for Two Women she showed her acting chops and this film also has a lot more to do with Sophia the actress than Sophia the sex symbol. As for Anthony Perkins he started out playing callow youths with issues. After Psycho he started out playing far more deranged characters with issues although his character here is descending into a bit of madness unlike Norman Bates who was one fully formed whack job.\n\nOther men in Sophia&apos;s life are Gig Young and Jean-Pierre Aumont. Won&apos;t give any ending away because in the end we don&apos;t know what&apos;s to become of the main characters most especially Sophia Loren.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in February 1981 after a screening on Manhattan&apos;s UWS: &quot;From Mao to Mozart&quot; is an entertaining and perceptive documentary on violinist Isaac Stern&apos;s three-week visit to China in June 1979. Filmmaker Murray Lerner, known for his 1967 docu &quot;Festival&quot; on the Newport Folk Festival, has recorded the human contact across different cultures that comes out in the faces and musical exchanges of the tour. Net result emphasizes the universality of human beings rather than their obvious differences.\n\nAs guest of the Chinese government, Stern and pianist David Golub visited Peking, Shanghai and other cities, with impressive young native ballet artists, acrobats and musicians all captured on film. The amazing degree of discipline and concentration among young Chinese is evident in every type of activity observed. Arresting travelogue footage of the vast, green countryside and bustling cities is included in the pic for transitions.\n\nThough brief concert performances by the duo are featured, Lerner concentrates on numerous rehearsals and auditions to give a candid view of what amounts to cultural shock. Stern is no diplomat, but his colorful criticisms of the young players&apos; technique and lack of emotion in their playing pays off in priceless lessons from a truly gifted teacher. The reaction of the huge rehearsal audiences and the improvement in the players&apos; work justifies Stern&apos;s lack of tact. Throughout, his emotional commitment to music is the film&apos;s inspirational hook.\n\nStern and Golub narrate various segments, giving their impressions of the trip, while Tan Shuzhen, deputy director of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, narrates a most revealing segment dealing with his students. Shuzhen reports on his harrowing 14-month incarceration and other horrors during the Cultural Revolution that started in 1966, and concisely discusses the need for openness in music, which is why the tour and film came about in the first place.\n\nThough ostensibly a music documentary, picture succeeds due to Lerner&apos;s visual rendering of human faces. Editing, photography and sound recording are all top-notch. Already nominated, pic looms as a heavy Oscar contender and merits specially-handled commercial bookings based on its entertainment and educational value."

      "reviewBody": "I definitely feel that this film gave me nothing. Really nothing. It was full of clichés, as I&apos;ve mentioned, and there wasn&apos;t a plot twist (at least to me).\n\nFirstly, the clichés. I felt that I was watching a film, that desperately wanted to be better than &quot;Scream&quot; and to get all of its cult following. The concept, although it was about urban legends, something that I appreciated, it had many vibes from other slasher films, so I think that it lacks of authenticity.\n\nSecond, I knew who was going to die, and I could tell easily, during the film, which deaths were &quot;fake&quot;, the ones that wanted to shock you a little bit.\n\nThird, the characters. I mean, they managed to make even the characters to act in a cliché way. There was the serious final girl, the one whom they try to mislead you that he or she is the killer, but he&apos;s or she&apos;s not. The over the top excited person, the idiot prank boy, the blonde bimbo, the goth, and the a*****e! Nothing new, nothing creative.\n\nAs I&apos;ve said, I knew 90% of what was going to be happen, so I haven&apos;t felt any thrilling moment. Except one scene.\n\nLet&apos;s say the things that I liked about this film. First of all, the concept of the urban legends it was cool, and maybe the only prototypical. I also liked the first scene. It was actually very thrilling and gave me a very good first impression. The person who played the killer was cool and had good acting skills.\n\nTo conclude this review, I want to mention that this film is not necessarily bad, but to me it wasn&apos;t good either. It was something between &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know what you did Last Summer&quot;. Plus urban legends. As a person that have seen many many similar Films, I have to say that I kind of knew the flow of the plot, so I did not found it thrilling. If you&apos;ve never seen similar Films, maybe you&apos;ll like it. It&apos;s a fun film to watch, if you don&apos;t have anything to do.",

      "reviewBody": "I always believed that a case needed only reasonable doubt to find people innocent. Apparently I was very wrong. I am in no way claiming my support for the three found guilty, but I for one could never convict them based on this evidence. The film shows just how unstable people can be when faced with those that don&apos;t conform. I was amazed by how much I disliked the parents of the murdered boys. They ramble and scream about killing these three, already convinced of their guilt. They seem more unstable and threatening to me, and not just because their children have been murdered. No real physical evidence is brought up against the boys, whom should probably start training professional killers on how not to leave evidence at a murder site. I know for a fact that a lot of details were left out of this documentary, and the celebrity worship that has followed the accused since is a bit too much. However this film is terrifying. It shows that just because of the way you look, and what people say about you, can take away your entire life. Make sure to check out all the evidence for yourself.",

Does the Mirror of the title reflect (as it were) A. Tarkovsky&apos;s Mirror of 1974? And 2. Is somebody trying to further Perestroika II by putting Perestroika I movies like this one on prime-time Moscow TV so frequently of late, as the reports have it? Isn&apos;t that a nice conspiracy theory to contemplate, for a change?",

While preparing for a royal state reception in honor of the Spanish King, an intrigue is planned behind his back with the intentions of causing his downfall. Private interests and the struggle for political power clash with turbulent consequences, in a dangerous cocktail of political and psychological forces.\n\nBeing currently the Leader of the Global Community, I can relate to this film very well :)\n\nOn that note, as Leader of the Global Community, I assure all Global Citizens that we will manifest World Peace; by manifesting Human Rights, International Law and Equality in the Global Community.\n\nWe also want to emphasize, that Universal Suffrage for all Israelis and Palestinians in one democratic nation, is the only viable option to manifest Peace, Security, Legal Equality and International Law in the Middle East; at least for now. The nation of Israel-Palestine will also entail a constitutional clause, that will allow it&apos;s citizens to refer to the country as either Israel or Palestine - or both, namely Israel-Palestine.\n\nNB: The corrupt Putin regime is responsible for the killings of Human Rights Activists and critics of the oppressive regime; such as Alexei Navalny. We declare Mr Putin and all collaborateurs of the Putin regime &apos;Persona non grata&apos; - and order their arrest by the IPA and Global Community, so that International Law and the UDHR can be restored in the Global Community.\n\nMark - BTB Global Peacebuilding.

      "reviewBody": "The Master of Ballantrae is one of those films that can be enjoyed on its own merits, providing that viewers don&apos;t spend the entire duration comparing it to the book by Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nAs an adaptation of The Master of Ballantrae, the film will disappoint as the book&apos;s story is almost changed beyond recognition, the characters are reduced to stereotypes (though thankfully still likable ones that are enough to make the story still engaging enough) and the tragic elements of the story are sidelined. However, viewing it on its own terms, while nowhere near one of Errol Flynn&apos;s best films, it is decent with its fun and charms.\n\nStarting with the good points, and there are a good many here, what definitely stands out is the vividly colourful cinematography, which captures the elegant costumes and handsomely rendered settings perfectly. William Alwyn&apos;s music score is appropriately rousing and bombastic, it&apos;s no Korngold but it suits the film very well and adds a lot to it. Smart, witty scripting, some slick action (including the very amusing pirate scenes) and an easy-going chemistry between Errol Flynn and Roger Livesey are further things to like, as are the more than able direction and the generally fun and thrilling second half. In the supporting roles, Roger Livesey really comes to hugely enjoyable life in the type of role associated with Alan Hale, and the rest of the cast do credibly, including lovely leading lady Beatrice Campbell.\n\nFor all those good things however, The Master of Ballantrae also has its faults. Despite his gallant charm, twinkling eyes and dashing smile, Flynn is not in his best form here, he looks out of shape from his drinking and fatigued and the action lacks his usual enthusiastic energy. He does handle the more dramatic scenes reasonably well though. Didn&apos;t care for the narration either, the news report delivery felt out of place and it wasn&apos;t very necessary either and ground the first half to a standstill in places. More show and less tell would have made things better. The first half has a good deal of fun and charm but the second half is noticeably crisper in pace. And while one shouldn&apos;t expect another Adventures of Robin Hood or Adventures of Don Juan climax, the climax here was rather anaemically choreographed and lacked excitement.\n\nAll in all, decent with a lot of good merits but a little disappointing for Flynn and Stevenson fans. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

I also liked the premise of the film, about a musician who dies in a car accident and comes back to life in the form of a snowman to spend time with his neglected son. The soundtrack is great, and the film is nice to look at. The performances are decent from Joseph Cross and Kelly Preston and Michael Keaten while he has been better does well. However, I was not sure what the movie was trying to accomplish. What I mean by that is that it seemed as though it was striving to be a poignant father and son type film and a film full of slapstick comedy. Unfortunately due to the weak script, the film doesn&apos;t really succeed at either. The pace is also rather uneven, being slow at times, and the ending is rather schmaltzy. Plus the special effects are in general substandard. All in all, not terrible, but it could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

The plot of the film is a little confusing and pointless; however, the director (Robert Santiago) exerts the emotion superbly therefore the plot goes un-noticed in the end. The characters in this film are played exceptionally well and Oscar Casas is a phenomenal actor and you will definitely see him on the big screen in years to come! The other children equally act very well and make you feel like a child again through their times of mischief and fun. Ultimately the actors and the directors save the poor plot of the film full credit to Robert Santiago. Finally; The film can make anyone believe that with a little hope: anything is possible &lt;3",

      "reviewBody": "Tennessee Williams&apos; gift for exposing the heart and soul - the core - of human experience was so fine-tuned it transcended clumsy handling and Hollywood censorship. &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; captures the essence of Williams&apos; profound understanding. Even the film&apos;s missteps - the fake sets, the beige hair, Warren Beatty&apos;s Italian accent  fail to detract. The surface artificiality contrasts with the underlying truths, making them that much more pronounced. In fact, the curious production values add another level of interest to the proceedings. There are lots of fine things about this film, which far surpasses the later television remake. Vivien Leigh&apos;s tortured persona brought added dimension to every character she played. Here she really &quot;gets&quot; what Mrs. Stone, and Williams, were about. Lotte Lenya&apos;s knowing performance remains timeless. Richard Addinsell&apos;s hypnotic score adds to the strange, foreign atmosphere. This is a rewarding, intelligent, entertaining film for thoughtful viewers. Obviously, it&apos;s not for every taste.",

I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it. It looks cheap, it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way. Some people think it&apos;s so bad it&apos;s funny. I am not one of them.

I would consider it a Japanese retelling of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.\n\nAn eccentric ultra-patriotic World War II Japanese naval genius has built a super sub in secret to restore the glory of the World War II Japanese Empire. However a new enemy has now emerged; an aggressive underwater kingdom called Mu and it&apos;s giant monster god.\n\nThis is a good movie with a decent plot and some very attractive Japanese women! The bikini shot of Akemi Kita early in the movie definitely wins the award for &quot;The Best Bikini in a Japanese Movie&quot;. The Captain&apos;s daughter and the Mu Empress definitely rate a 9+ on the &quot;hotness&quot; scale as well. ;)\n\nThis movie is classic TOHO made during the heyday of Japanese science fiction. Although the special effects doesn&apos;t stand up to today&apos;s standards, for it&apos;s time they were above average. I remember watching this movie as a kid and being mesmerized by it. The musical score is very good as well.\n\nThe American release DVD quality is excellent. It is dubbed in English and about 89 minutes long. The colors are rich and vibrant. A very good presentation for this very good movie.\n\nDefinitely worth a look. I recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "I had this recommended to me a very long time ago when I was first starting to get into and review westerns. It has taken this long because the genre still hasn&apos;t endeared itself to me for the most part, and I watch them sparsely. Still, I have been going through this western pack of late and the middle entry on it is God&apos;s Gun. A western done by Golan and Globus before their Cannon days I am assuming. This meant that the movie is goofy fun at times, and kind of stood out from the other spaghetti westerns I have seen in a good way. Well good for my sensibilities.\n\nGod&apos;s Gun is about estranged twin brothers, one a priest and the other a gambling shoot first style gunfighter, both played by Lee Van Cleef. When the priest is killed, a young boy from the town journey&apos;s to find the brother and get revenge. Sound pretty normal except that for a small amount of the time the gun fighting brother plays it of like he is the specter of the priest to scare and kill the gang that outnumbers him. Those parts were great. In fact, although the movie takes a long time to get set up, the payoff is totally worth it.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t all great though. As I mentioned, the movie takes its time getting going. It seemed to prefer introducing all the characters in long scenes, drawing out everything until the priest is killed. Jack Palance kind of got on my nerves as well. Although it was funny to see his villainous character slap and laugh his way through everything, he seemed more like a joke than anything else. He acted like a drunken fool and laughed at everything that happened. But, for me at least, the laugh looked so fake and weird...I don&apos;t know, maybe Palance just weirds me out. Also, there is a scene where the gang goes into the bar, after stealing two young girls and proceeds to have a sexual assault party that went on way too long. It was off-putting.\n\nStill, flaws aside, I did like this movie. It did feel a bit cheap and fun, while also feeling a bit sleazy at times. The basic premise and Van Cleef&apos;s characters make it worth recommending.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.\n\nSeveral characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton&apos;s unique and sometimes- revolting title character &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..\n\nIt was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the &apos;90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who has almost always played nice, cute people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O&apos;Hara&apos;s comedic talents in this movie. Now, she&apos;s my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a &quot;haunted house&quot; inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.\n\nKeaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.\n\nTim Burton directed the film and so I wasn&apos;t surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.\n\nOverall, a unique and entertaining film. It&apos;s different, to say the least!"

      "reviewBody": "Much talk was in German media on the release of &quot;Die Reise ins Glück&quot; (better known to international audiences as &quot;Journey into Bliss&quot;). Unluckiely this did not show in terms of admissions, which is a really sad thing, as director/writer/producer/etc. Wenzel Storch invested pretty much everything he had into this production. He is probably ruined for life, which would mean that this will be his last movie ever.\n\nIn the nineties, Wenzel Storch was THE most celebrated star of German underground cinema who had then just released &quot;Sommer der Liebe&quot;, which became the highest grossing movie shot on Super 8 ever (well, at least in Germany). Then it got rather quiet around him. From time to time there were news popping up that he was working on something new, but years went by without anything released. Wenzel and his friends went out of money again and again, the rumor even was they called it quits and canceled the whole project, until they somehow completed it in spring &apos;04, after 12 (!) years in the making. I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere here in Bochum at the German Psychotronic Film Festival in June 2004.\n\nTo make it short, &quot;Die Reise ins Glück&quot; is a film you either love or hate, with very few shades possible between those extremes. I consider it one of the most beautiful things I&apos;ve ever witnessed and have seen it four times by now, but I know that there are people who would walk out of it or even yell vicious curses against the screen (I&apos;m not joking here!).\n\nThis is due to Wenzel Storch&apos;s quiet unusual style of movie-making. If you are familiar with his other films, then you&apos;ll know that most of his material feels like it was written on LSD (in fact, it was. Repeat: I&apos;m not joking!). From his three movies, this one is by far the most accessible for a mainstream audience. If your favourite is one of the current box office top 5, you should however handle this piece of information with care...\n\nThe story: Captain Gustav traveled the seven seas for years, but now he, his crew (consisting of some frogs, an owl, a rabbit, a bear and several other animals) and of course his living snail-ship want to retire. They stop at a beautiful island – only to find out that it is inhibited by Knuffi, an old enemy of the captain. In Gustav&apos;s absence, Knuffi went for a career as an evil King and now does what all really evil kings do: he kidnaps the captain&apos;s children. Gustav has to go on a final mission to free his kids and stop the mad dictator.\n\nOkay, you probably see where this is going: &quot;Reise&quot; is basically a fairytale on psychedelic drugs with an anarchic and very anti-fascist attitude that clearly reveals the director&apos;s punk background. But after all, the story is not that important. This is a movie that is neither character nor plot driven, it is the atmosphere which keeps one totally stunned.\n\nEverything in this movie was hand made, from the strategically placed, cute stop-motion sequences to the superb art direction. Open up your eyes wide! In a righteous world, the sets, costumes and props would make this movie a certain nominee for an academy award. Storch delivers a bizarre, postmodern mix of a dream-like fairground and glittering Christmas elements, much too reflexive to be kitsch – every set has it&apos;s very own colour scheme and predominant material. It is incredibly beautiful to look at, from Gustav&apos;s snail-ship to Knuffi&apos;s golden palace, and you will find something new every time you watch it.\n\nThis fits with the brilliant dialog, something you&apos;ll never quiet get if you are not a native speaker. Just like Storch found much of the material for the sets in torn down factories or on disposal sites, big parts of the dialog consist of old-fashioned teenager slang from the seventies and eighties, which is somehow still in our collective mind, just waiting for Storch to pull it out and make use of it.\n\nAlthough the movie&apos;s overall tone is very sweet and uplifting, Storch does not spare out the dark side of fairy tales. There are some pretty hefty splatter scenes and make-up effects, which made me shake my head on the bigotry of the German film censorship board who have cut almost every horror movie known to mankind, but gave this one a &quot;not under 12&quot; – rating, meaning every 6 year old with a parent can watch it. And this is definitely not the only border the film crosses. Wenzel Storch (who, by the way, turned out to be an extremely nice, sympathetic guy when I talked to him) gives you smoking kids, gallons of vomit and sperm, kids being peed onto, horny grandmas, a literal brain wash and other quite somatic moments, so be warned if you don&apos;t dig stuff like this. But if you are willing to confront yourself with something really unique, go for it! No matter if you love or hate it, it is an experience like nothing else. &quot;Die Reise ins Glück&quot; is a trip beyond the rational, a bizarre, postmodern mish-mash of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and the comic book classic &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, a phantasmagoria which seems to come directly from another world – sweet, surreal and completely psychedelic.",

      "reviewBody": "TARZAN AND THE SHE-DEVIL (RKO Radio, 1953), directed by Kurt Neumann, stars Lex Barker making his fifth and final screen appearance as Edgar Rice Burrough&apos;s lord of the jungle. As the writers of the series attempt new ideas with their screenplays, and gearing to another direction from its previous efforts, for the first time since TARZAN ESCAPES (MGM, 1936) starring Johnny Weissmuller, does the fearless Tarzan allow himself to become the victim, losing his savage fight to overpower the villains, who, in this production, are strong enough to gather more attention than to the main characters. While the title reads like a horror movie, giving indication of Tarzan matches wits with Dracula&apos;s daughter, the woman in question is a princess compared to the male hunters she supervises, particularly one enacted by Raymond Burr only a few years before changing his frequent bad guy image to prosecuting attorney in TVs long running series, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957-1966).\n\nThe story begins with routine everyday life as Tarzan (Lex Barker), his companion, Jane (Joyce McKenzie), and pet Cheta, find peace and tranquility in their jungle habitat until ivory poachers, Lyra (Monique Van Vooren), Fidel (Tom Conway), Vargo (Raymond Burr), Maka (Robert Bice), and others enter the scene. They want Tarzan to round up a large heard of elephants for them. Naturally, Tarzan refuses, so Lyra, leader of the expedition, attempts to persuade the lawman of the jungle by having Jane kidnapped. As the hunters carry out her plan, a struggle ensues, starting off a fire that burns down the tree-house. As Jane makes her escape, she is injured, left in a semi-conscious state, roaming about the jungle to face the dangers of the wild, including a crocodile and deadly snake before she is taken in and cared for by a native tribe. As for Tarzan, he returns to find his home burned and Jane gone. Believing Jane has perished in the fire, he becomes despaired. Not caring what happens now, he allows himself to be captured by Lyra&apos;s men, chained like a slave, held prisoner in a cottage, submitted to whippings (with limited scars of his torso), and when all else fails, extreme measures are used by having his arms tied above his head onto a wooden-like door frame structure. The angry Vargo tells Tarzan that if he doesn&apos;t do what they want, he&apos;ll hang there &quot;until he rots.&quot; At this point the nearly unconscious Tarzan continues to be the prisoner, making no attempt whatsoever to save himself.\n\nThe problem with the Lex Barker&apos;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; series is the lack of consistency from one film to another. After succeeding Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan, Barker never played opposite the same Jane twice. He inherited Brenda Joyce in his initial role in TARZAN&apos;S MAGIC FOUNTAIN (1949), followed by Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston, Dorothy Hart and finally Joyce McKenzie. Second problem is having the much younger Barker, who looks very educated, to not be more articulate. In fact, in his last as Tarzan, he has fewer lines than ever before. Those familiar with the Barker/Tarzan series might ask themselves, &quot;whatever became of their adopted son, Joey?&quot; introduced by Tommy Carlton in TARZAN&apos;S SAVAGE FURY (1952). Characters simply come and go, and while Cheta remains, Tarzan and Jane are once more childless. A few years later, Tarzan would go it alone, with Jane written out of the stories, forever absent with no explanation.\n\nWhile the proposed title, TARZAN MEETS THE VAMPIRE, is a misnomer, TARZAN AND THE SHE-DEVIL is even more misleading. As for the scenario, which finds Tarzan enslaved, it&apos;s at times unpleasant, especially witnessing an action hero who never loses to become weakened while submitted to torture. At any rate, TARZAN AND THE SHE-DEVIL which runs at 76 minutes, does have its moments of interest, but not enough for excitement purposes. It may not the best nor the worst in the series, but its action relies mostly on suspense, whether or not Tarzan will be able to regain his strength, free himself from his captivity and do what&apos;s traditionally expected of him other than his ape calls. \n\nTARZAN AND THE SHE-DEVIL, which has never been distributed on video cassette or DVD, did become one of a whole series of Tarzan adventures from 1934 to 1968 to be presented on American Movie Classics cable channel (1997-2001). In spite of the weakness in the scenario, which might have been the reason for Lex Barker to surrender his loincloth, Tarzan, like Ian Fleming&apos;s James Bond, due to its popularity, would continue to hit the theater screens for many years to come, performed each decade by different actors. Next chapter: TARZAN HIDDEN JUNGLE (RKO, 1955) starring Gordon Scott. (**1/2)",

Edward Furlong (T2) plays a horror fanatic who stumbles upon an advert in a horror magazine advertising a CD ROM game called &apos;Brainscan&apos; He decides to play it but is skeptical, that is until he gets a little more than he bargained for. The idea is good and it holds up for most of the way if not all, but it is good for a rental and will keep you amused for an hour and a half. T. Ryder Smith is good as &apos;Trickster&apos;, a creepy character who emerges from the game.",

There is the Bett Davis type housekeeper, the child who sees dead people or something like that; there is the sinister male in the house and lets&apos; not forget the deformed and deceased ugly sister who may still be with us....etc Throw in the illusions being suffered by our main star and add in multi layers of other complications then beneath goes even deeper.

Their newest film from Oscar winning director Nick Park tells the story of a prehistoric tribe that have to work together in order to save their home from the impending doom of the Bronze Age. Aardman once again uses expert sight gags and word play to generate multiple laughs from the audience and, although the jokes don&apos;t always land, they are all genuinely clever and you can&apos;t help but appreciate the thought that has gone into them all. The film is however let down slightly by its somewhat generic and predictable story, but the fast pace and constant humour doesn&apos;t make this into a huge problem. \n\nOverall &apos;Early Man&apos; is a very well crafted, extremely entertaining family film that will appeal to all ages, which includes an excellent voice cast who are clearly having just as much fun as we are. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is one of the most important of all those that I have seen in my movie going, spanning fifty years, for it was the first Bergman film I saw in the early sixties at Auckland&apos;s only cinema for foreign films. I was struck by its humanity, by its clear eyed view of what it is to be human. Not only did it open up the whole body of Bergman&apos;s subsequent work, but I saw the themes first explored in this film deepened and enriched (with a few disappointments to be sure) throughout his career. I first learned here that more difficult and challenging films keep giving long after they have been first seen. Those who say Bergman is gloomy and depressing, all I can say is that the MOST depressing experience in the cinema EVER for me, was being persuaded to join a group of people &quot;just for a laugh&quot; to see the truly execrable &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; Compare the insulting view of women in that piece of rubbish with this gem.",

Carrey was funny as always, and added a lot to the over all enjoyment of the film.\n\nIt is a family movie, starring Jim Carrey with penguins and is rated PG, what really are you expecting ? it is exactly what you would expect from this type of film. Just grab your loved ones, head to the theaters, and enjoy this movie for what it is, don&apos;t take it seriously, and you will have a great time !!",

      "reviewBody": "While Jay Chou no doubt holds court in today&apos;s Mando-pop scene, he gets no love from the movie-goers who snigger at his expressionless performance in Zhang Yimou&apos;s Curse of the Golden Flower. It indeed is quite brave of him (though it&apos;s arguable to strike while the iron is hot) to diversify and have a hand in directing so early in his cinematic career, and coming up with quite an interesting, engaging story, though like any creative work, his story did make him seem quite intelligent, in spite of his usual laid-back demeanour.\n\nJay stars as Jay (yeah, bring back those lazy Hong Kong production days where characters share the actor&apos;s first names, because they were working on so many movies simultaneously, it&apos;s hard to keep track, so why not name the characters after yourself!), a new student in Tamkang Secondary School. He follows a mysterious piano tune and meets with Rain (Kwai Lun-Mei), a fellow student with whom he starts to spend many lovey-dovey moments with. It&apos;s essentially a romance story for dating couples to catch, and it will be a definite test of anyone&apos;s cloy-tolerance, given that the lovebirds share so much saccharine sweet dialogue and behaviour, those with lesser tolerance will have goosebumps all the way.\n\nAnd for the romantic movie fans, it&apos;s time to revisit some of the cliché plot elements like the bicycle ride - who can resist a bicycle ride! - lovely scene setting landscape shots, idle banter, close contacts, dance, kisses, the &quot;third party&quot; Sky (whom I think is more attractive than Kwai, thus providing that additional tension), the list just goes on. Jay has mentioned parts of the story was really based on his own experiences, it is indeed interesting to try and find out just which are. Being a piano student, the movie too was a showcase piece for his musical talents and prowess on the piano, coupled with computer generated graphics which enhanced certain scenes for dramatic effect with great aplomb.\n\nThose who think that Jay Chou can&apos;t act will want to rethink that again. Given Initial D was pop, and that Curse was action, Secret was a perfect dramatic platform for him to do a little more emoting, even though he can&apos;t seem to shake off his signature drawl. And of course some help to make him look good came from thespian Anthony Wong, who had also played his cinematic dad (of similar interest / capability) in Initial D, as he again does in Secret. Here, their father and son characters play off each other a little more in some endearing, comical moments, and naturally, Wong seemed a more believable father figure than Chow Yun-Fat for Jay Chou.\n\nThe strength of the movie however laid in its story. I shall keep it a secret just exactly what it was, and all I can say is it is similar in nature to some of my favourite movies in the past, thus I had taken a natural liking for Secret as well. However, while you think you might have it all planned out how the story will unfold, Jay Chou actually had an added punch to keep it a little bit fresh, and in doing so, raises it to a slightly different level as well, with a fairly intense climax that will have you rooting for a desirable outcome, no less. What worked against it though, would be the verbatim nature in which the story was explained, making it a little draggy and at times, repetitive, instead of allowing the audience to put the pieces together.\n\nJay Chou as story writer (he had someone to script it for him), actor, director and composer, Secret turned out to be a surprisingly commendable, co mmendable effort. If this is any indication of what&apos;s to come from this talented dude, then I&apos;ll be more than happy to be a fan convert, for his cinematic efforts at least. Recommended date movie of the week, remember to bring out those tissues as well! I won&apos;t be surprised if this movie will work its magic into my top ten list for the year.",

Ustinov made a brilliant debut in Death on the Nile, and he shows once again just how good he was in the role. Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith are wonderful in their respective roles in particular, both actually make their characters more interesting then they appear in the book, the interplay between the two is wonderful, so much fun. Nicholas Clay and Jane Birkin are fantastic also, her transformation is sensational, what a beauty!\n\nIt is a lavish looking film, the locations are sensational, and the costumes are superb, they really add a glamorous note to it, Rigg looks sensational in many scenes.\n\nOverall 9/10. It&apos;s a great story, it&apos;s brilliantly acted, and the characters are just magical, it&apos;s hugely entertaining!",

The songs are beautiful, shot beautifully but the problem is they have got very little to do with the narrative and flow of the movie.\n* ensemble cast; it&apos;s a good mix of characters. Bachhan Pandey is the only character that stood in the movie, which isn&apos;t great but relatively better than other characters.\nWhat did not work: \n* everything else; the action scenes are horrible though the set design is impressive. The screenplay is poor so is the execution. The makers could have choreographed the action scenes better which would make it a better watch. We have to say it&apos;s a missed opportunity, a few ones that could have defined the genre in the industry. The narrative is poor and questionable. Cinematography is okay. We expected much more from the movie considering a great cast. Their role could have been written and executed properly. Sadly, the movie is full of plot holes and loopholes, and we can question the authenticity and the reasoning behind many scenes in the movie. On conclusion, poor direction.\n"

      "reviewBody": "Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - &quot;It&apos;s not realism, it&apos;s not naturalism - it&apos;s heightened reality&quot; as Gary Oldman very well put it.\n\n In &quot;The making of The Professional&quot; Besson says &quot;If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think &quot;It&apos;s in me, I&apos;m a beast!&quot; On this part we can&apos;t forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments&quot;. He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda&apos;s nose or Stansfield&apos;s unforgettable &quot;EVERYONE!&quot; are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman&apos;s heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda&apos;s father.\n\nHowever Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don&apos;t be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don&apos;t see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: &quot;everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid&quot; as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in &quot;real life&quot;? I don&apos;t know but this movie can make you wonder.\n\nThen of course there&apos;s the sensuality. It&apos;s hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It&apos;s not sick and it&apos;s not degrading: it&apos;s art, subtle and beautiful.\n\nLeon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It&apos;s a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don&apos;t be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",

She&apos;s mentally disturbed, not in a large measure but enough to keep herself in her own world. She lives with no concerns and she doesn&apos;t care about anyone or anything outside her world. She&apos;s free, she loves to be in touch with nature and she&apos;s very strong on her own way But one day (the film starts at this point) her mother dies and she has no one to take care of her, except her older sister, CLARA (Diane Kruger), which had gone to the city, to study and work, and now lives there, together with her husband PIERRE (Denis Menochet). The way she is LILY can&apos;t live alone, and by her own, so her sister goes to live with her, in the country side (after a failed attempt to put LILY living &quot;closed&quot; in her sister&apos;s apartment in the city). Their relationship will not be easy, because LILY is definitely a force of nature, but her sister will always be there at her side, and that will for sure cause some damage in CLARA&apos;s marriage \n\nI enjoyed this film. What I liked the most was the two main characters (both sisters) and the way LILY is portrayed. She&apos;s like a hurricane, a really strong force of nature, and we see that especially by the way the movie ends You just can be together with her or against her! The acting of Ludivine Sagnier is also superb by the way she plays this character; she really does it very well! LILY made me laugh, made me smile, and made me drop a tear from my eyes too She&apos;s wild and mad but she&apos;s also pure and innocent and completely harmless LILY is as pure as a free human soul can be! \n\nWe can consider this film as a drama, but it&apos;s a drama that makes you feel good! I score it 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was action packed and had a nice plot that complemented its artistic appeal. The fighting scenes were still classical for a martial arts film, and the comic relief really was a brilliant idea that was beautifully executed. The classical appeal of this movie is apparent at the beginning of the movie but comedy was presented immediately after to get you in the mood. At first I&apos;ll admit, I didn&apos;t know what to expect and thought this was a kid&apos;s movie. But once I made a decision to give it a chance and saw that Sammo Hung was in the movie, I couldn&apos;t resist but not to watch it. You will also see some other famous martial art stars in the movie which will make you even more at ease once you start watching it. And though you&apos;ll be laughing throughout the movie, at the end of the movie it will just make you smile.",

      "reviewBody": "1977&apos;s &quot;Battleflag&quot; aka &quot;The Standard&quot; was the first of four Peter Cushing titles after &quot;Star Wars&quot; that sank without a trace at that time. Unlike &quot;Son of Hitler,&quot; &quot;Touch of the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Black Jack,&quot; this co-production between West Germany, Austria, and Spain appears to be an earnest, serious project, which nevertheless never found a distributor outside Europe, neither in Britain nor the US. Set in Belgrade in Oct 1918, during the final days of the First World War, Officer Menis (Simon Ward) does his duty in defending the battle flag of the defeated Austro-Hungarian empire, while his fellow troops, a motley gang recruited from several different countries not loyal to the royal family, simply try to survive by any means possible. The battles are elaborate but far too lengthy, while the romance between Menis and Louise Lang (Veronica Forque), daughter of a wealthy Viennese industrialist, only cripple the pace even further. Considering he was working with three different languages, Ward performs admirably, alongside Jon Finch&apos;s Major Charbinsky, and Peter Cushing&apos;s cameo as the mysterious Baron von Hackenburg, a &apos;strange character&apos; and reserve major, with some influence in Vienna. Entering at the 39 minute mark, the bearded Cushing&apos;s scenes were shot in Spain, his smoking Baron surrounded by his dogs, carefully observing the battles without ever taking part (like Barack Obama, &apos;leading from behind&apos;). His big scene finds him speaking to the standard bearer, revealing him to be a lowly gypsy posing as an aristocrat (a solid five minutes). This was the last time he could be seen astride a horse...just as we first viewed him on screen in 1939&apos;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask.&quot; Peter Cushing was reunited with Simon Ward, his assistant in &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,&quot; and Jon Finch, who had paid his dues in Hammers like &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; and &quot;The Horror of Frankenstein,&quot; before stardom in Roman Polanski&apos;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Frenzy.&quot; Among the other cast members are Lil Dagover (nearly 90), the star of 1919&apos;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,&quot; and Austrian-born beauty Maria Perschy, mostly known for her work with Spanish horror star Paul Naschy, and other titles like &quot;No Survivors Please,&quot; &quot;Kiss Kiss...Kill Kill,&quot; &quot;A Witch Without a Broom,&quot; &quot;Five Golden Dragons,&quot; &quot;The Castle of Fu Manchu,&quot; &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; and &quot;The Ghost Galleon.&quot;",

It&apos;s got no real context. It&apos;s very simple. It&apos;s very easy and it is fun but it is not a great quality movie. It is SUPER low-budget and SUPER low-fi. It&apos;s got some nice sequences on camera stuff and some fun parts but it&apos;s not the best movie and it will never claim to be. It&apos;s just a mad movie of cinema and it&apos;s fun but that&apos;s about it. 5/10.",

Nobody is.&quot;\n\nThat sums up this astonishing movie. I can&apos;t believe A Free Soul is so little known, or that so many viewers don&apos;t get the depth of its meaning then...and now. Throw in three of the most amazing actors of the early 1930s--Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, and Norma Shearer--and you can&apos;t help be impressed, and moved, and intrigued. It&apos;s about strength of character (three or four characters, in fact). It&apos;s about being a modern person, and having modern problems. And it&apos;s about facing them, openly, honestly.\n\nSo what holds it back? Well, for one thing, it has a lot of talk, a lot of simple dialog about some very not simple things. If you accept the characters and their need to talk, you will see a very honest confrontation with alcoholism, and with what is at first a kind of sex addiction, or what is later developed to be simply unbridled love for a man outside of marriage. But the parallel between two temptations is real, and rather powerful, and the sacrifices each of the two afflicted characters make is intense. Barrymore (as the one nipping the bottle) and Shearer (as the one too much in love, or in love with lovemaking) play their parts perfectly. They have moments of extraordinary clarity, and moments of abandonment. And they confront each other in a way that is completely reasonable.\n\nThere are other aspects here worth at least lifting an eyebrow at, namely the very close relationship, almost as platonic lovers, between these two. Gable as a lovable but brutal and deceptive gangster is perfect, too--gorgeous and hard, charming and untrustworthy. The milieu is well developed, from barroom to hotel room to courtroom. This isn&apos;t a Warner Brothers knock-you-out crime film, it isn&apos;t even Three on a Match, for an example of a compromise between a woman&apos;s picture and a gangster flick. It&apos;s a heady drama, beautifully laid out and progressively involving, with director Clarence Brown (famous for a whole string of such interpersonal, romantic dramas over several decades) knowing what makes a film really matter.",

      "reviewBody": "I found Parts II, III and IV of the Saw series increasingly tedious, so much so that I left it six years before watching Part V. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to (eventually) find that the fifth instalment marked a turning point, the plot-line becoming a bit more interesting with Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) taking on the mantle of Jigsaw, the gore being even more graphic, and the makers clearly taking matters with a welcome pinch of salt (the extreme nature of some of the gruesome traps bordering on self-parody). I was having fun at last.\n\nThe series continues to improve with Part VI, which develops the Hoffman character further, ladles on even more revolting splatter, and steadfastly refuses to get bogged down with trifling matters such as the cash, time, and skill required to build such amazing methods of torture. Part VI simply gets on with entertaining the fans, with a twisty-turny narrative and bucket-loads of the red stuff.\n\nThis time around, Jigsaw has assembled a group of despicable life-insurance business-people, and proceeds to teach them that choosing between life and death should not be an easy decision to make. As a result, bodies are blasted, crushed, hung, and, in the film&apos;s most revolting scene, melted from the inside with a highly corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. are closing in on Hoffman, although Kramer&apos;s wife Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) also has a surprise in store for the deviant agent. Rather surprisingly, this satisfyingly sick chapter has left me looking forward to more Saw.\n\n7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",

      "reviewBody": "I originally wrote a review the day after I saw Sucker Punch. I panned it. To me my initial feelings were rather lukewarm at best. \n\nBut then I gave it some time. \n\nAnd as I went through my days afterward my mind would wander back to the story and think about the visual food for thought. \n\nYeah, the girls are hot. Yeah, the action is over the top, but if you look at the emotional landscape that is being explored in a more literal fashion via the action then yeah, this is a pretty cool idea. \n\nSometimes films come along that are a &quot;sucker punch&quot; in terms of originality. The general public usually reacts negatively to it which leads to poor box office results. But later on the audience has had a chance to digest what was given and revisits the film and breaths new life into it. \n\nMy prediction is that such a situation will happen with Sucker Punch. It&apos;ll probably not recoup its initial budget at the box office. People will flood the IMDb forum with reasons why it did not work. We will probably see about a few dozen threads at least where people will vent their reasons why they hate the film and why you too should not see it.\n\nBut given some time it will recoup via video sales and other distribution deals. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause it&apos;s still a solid story. The style of the movie is an Otaku&apos;s wet dream, but overall result is still the same: it does surprise and give ample food for thought. \n\nThink of it as stylized parable about repression, personal will and sacrifice. Because sooner or later after all the negative backlash and reviews blow by those emotional messages will be all that will be left. \n\nAnd people will remember it for that reason.",

The first 20 minutes made little impact and it took a while to get spinning into higher gear. This a typical film that gets better once it gets going and the second half was captivating. The scenario (by Kim van Kooten) is not the brightest, but who cares with this level of acting. Plenty of laughs, some very touching moments and very, very good music in places. (And of course, it is good to notice that Kim manages to keep half her family employed) Center of it all, obviously is Carice. She sulks, she grins, half the cinema (or more) drowns in those eyes.

All I could think of the entire time was WHY would Lauren Graham do this film? Why, why why? If I could give the movie no stars I would of but that isn&apos;t an option. If I could give the movie negative stars I would . The story is awful. The ending was even more awful. The other users that gave it so many stars, I can only imagine were somehow involved with making the film. I would rather spend an hour and a half at the dentist than watch this again.",

In fact, it was nominated for &apos;Best DVD Original Retrospective Documentary/Featurette&apos; by Video Premiere Award in 2001.\n\nAs for the documentary&apos;s content, Arnold and Milius are engaging and charismatic as always in Unchained, and it was great to see the rest of cast and hear their comments after nearly 20 years. It was also great to see others such as Gerry Lopez and James Earl Jones. Lastly, I&apos;m glad they discussed Robert E. Howard, Conan&apos;s creator, and gave some insight into how the barbarian came to be.\n\nNow, if I had to offer some criticism, it would be how the documentary completely neglected William Smith (Conan&apos;s father) and Valérie Quennessen (the princess). I was really disappointed that they didn&apos;t interview William Smith and get his thoughts on the experiences he had making the film. Furthermore, I was saddened that they didn&apos;t mention how Valérie Quennessen died tragically in an automobile accident approximately 7 years after Conan the Barbarian in 1989.\n\nOther than that, I found the documentary insightful and very entertaining. Don&apos;t miss it.",

Also, the central conflict, with a convincing Randolph Scott trying to escape his criminal past and the shadow of his brother, was pleasantly poignant, with a good final shoot-out. The movie has a good pace too, at least in its second half, with plenty of action.\n\nOn the minus side, although very competently-made, it is a bit by the numbers, with the usual comical relief characters, ridiculous Indians, and in general few surprises (other reviewers were surprised by the ending, but in this case I was expecting it).\n\nThis is certainly quite common in classic westerns, but the romance seems to be included out of duty more than because it&apos;s an integral part of the plot."

He dies for a brief moment but is assigned by God to return to Earth and spread peace and truth to the world. While walking in the parking lot, a woman kisses him and mysteriously his image is transmitted to every television in São Paulo and his wife leaves home with their daughter. Sooner he discovers that he lost his privacy and every movement he makes is broadcast to every TV channel, affecting the lives of the viewers and advertising agencies. \n\n&quot;O Efeito Ilha&quot; is a weird movie that criticizes the effect of television in the brains of the viewers. In 1994, the shameful Big Brother did not exist but this film foresees the lack of privacy of this show with a camera broadcasting the life of the lead character. There is also a strong critic in the effect of the Soccer World Cup in the Brazilians; the damaging effect of the brain wash of the advertising agencies; how faith is destroyed in a material world, like a machine gun of harsh criticism. There is also a politically incorrect moment with the comment of a character about the use of condom to prevent AIDS. Last but not the least, the annoying accent of São Paulo is irritating. This film has been released in Brazil only on VHS by Betta Entertainment. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Efeito Ilha&quot; (&quot;The Island Effect&quot;)",

After it was introduced, they never really done anything else with it.The gore was pretty lame. Every kill was almost the same. Maybe a little cherry pie filling coming out of the mouth. The score was pretty nice. The composer did a great job with the 80&apos;s themed music and the use of strings, which really captured the sound of the 80&apos;s slasher. I agree with the other comments with the over use of close ups. It&apos;s like they had a camera mounted Mic and were trying to stay in close enough range for the best audio. I think these filmmakers have some talent, I think they just need to concentrate more on good audio, and developing a solid plot.",

After seeing the prison pictures from Iraq, the film fully explored the reasons for the abuse of prisoners. When I read some of the reviews posted, I noticed how many dismissed the film as contrived and not plausible. I wonder if any of those reviewers would like to modify their dismissal of Das Experiment. Human behavior under stress often declines to the lowest common instinct. It reminded me of an adult Lord of the Flies. Degradation and humiliation seems to exactly follow what happened in Iraq. As a veteran who spent most of time working on Military Mental wards, I witnessed a number of abuses, as force had to be used patients were acting out or lost control, but all those memories seem pale compared to the horrors of the Iraq prison camps. Since life imitates art, this makes the film even more profound."

La fille de D&apos;Artagnan is a lot of fun for the first sixty minutes or so, then the lack of any great imagination in the plot construction starts to be apparent. There seems to be a coded message in a letter stolen from a convent that occupies the minds and energies of many of the characters to the detriment of telling the story.\n\nPhilippe Noiret is great, but the part is so easy for him. Sophie Marceau gets to show off her splendid breasts. Jean-Luc Bideau as Athos is perhaps the most watchable actor in the proceedings; he looks really dapper in that eyeband. If you want a really fine film about pre-Revolutionary France, try Que la fête commence, which has Noiret in one of his best roles.",

      "reviewBody": "I like to watch a non-American horror movie from time to time. Most of them are copies of Hollywood movies, but there is always something in them that sets them apart.\n\nVladenie 18 is a good example: a standard setting of a young couple who move into a suspiciously cheap apartment in a high apartment tower. Strange things happen, they do research and come to the conclusion that a lot of people have already lived in the apartment before them. However, all are gone and nobody knows what happened to them...\n\nThis russian film isn&apos;t original being a Horror film, but I don&apos;t think that should be a problem. Because how many new films are that original? I think the overall package a Horror is very well presented though. The characters arouse sympathy as underdogs and you, as a viewer, are concerned about their fate. Some viewers will probably not like the acting style which comes (in the eyes of us Westerners) across as wooden. But I think this is just the style of the conservative Russian acting school, because our older movies were often acted this way too. In any case, I liked the authentic Russian feeling of this movie!\n\nSpecial effects are by far the weakest point of this film. They look so cheap that given the limited budget of this film, I just left them out altogether. Rest is good news: The plot is very well put together. As been said: It&apos;s not very original, but it&apos;s a very good quality story and it kept me watching the whole movie. The film is not really scary, nor has it gore going on, but there is plenty of suspense!\n\nIn short, for those who would like to watch a thrilling film from another part of the world, this is a good one. It won&apos;t set the world on fire, but I do call this a fun late evening movie. So that&apos;s why the 7/10!",

      "reviewBody": "In my review of &apos;Who Am I?&apos;, I mentioned that &apos;Rumble in the Bronx&apos;, &apos;First Strike&apos;, &apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos;, and &apos;Who Am I?&apos; all followed a similar formula as Jackie tried to capture western audiences. After watching &apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos; again, I was actually kind of surprised to realize that it was almost a carbon copy of &apos;Rumble in the Bronx&apos; - a Rumble in Melbourne&apos;s Central Business District, anyway.\n\nGiancarlo (Richard Norton), Melbourne&apos;s top drug lord is angry because Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) has a tape that incriminates him. Jackie (Jackie Chan), a TV chef and arse-kicker extraordinaire comes into possession of the tape, making Giancarlo angry enough to kidnap Jackie&apos;s girlfriend Miki (Miki Lee). This makes Jackie angry. The end.\n\nWow. It seems like I&apos;ve written out the whole plot and embellished upon it rather than summarized it. I&apos;m just kidding - or am I? &apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos; might be a contender for the thinnest plot in the universe prize, and the so called &quot;supporting actors&quot; don&apos;t even seem to be trying to act. Almost everything that happens in &apos;Rumble in the Bronx&apos; is recycled for this. Unfortunately, the hovercraft was replaced by heavy machinery. Nothing can be an adequate substitute for Rumble&apos;s hovercraft.\n\nJackie kicking arse is the only reason for anyone to watch &apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos;. It doesn&apos;t feature anything new or innovative, but any keen fan of Jackie should notice various &apos;Protector&apos;, &apos;Police Story&apos; or &apos;Rumble in the Bronx&apos; moments. It is a fun and exciting action film though, and that&apos;s what Jackie is all about.\n\nAnd now for something completely different: Yet again, &apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos; features Jackie playing a character called Jackie. I&apos;m convinced that Jackie quit acting for several years, and took up a life as a cop, spy, chef, etc. All the while he had a film crew filming his adventures in order to create easy action movies. It&apos;s the only logical explanation - the writers can&apos;t be that lazy, right?\n\n&apos;Mr Nice Guy&apos; reeks of being direct to video, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from being a fun action movie. Fans of Jackie Chan or Sammo Hung should give this a look - 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "In this explosive, slow burning film Watkins infuriated both sides of the political spectrum in Denmark - which is to the film&apos;s honor! Evening Land is careful and disturbingly realistic near future sci-fi that continues Watkins documentary inspired filmmaking. The film is an incredible study in just how carefully it crafts it&apos;s world, and it&apos;s done to such perfection that many people easily could be fooled by it&apos;s authenticity today.\n\nThe focus of the film is a large scale strike carried out by danish workers who refuse to construct submarines (and ships) that will (likely) carry nuclear weapons and a conference that might determine the future presence of nuclear weapons in Europe. At the same time &quot;non-violent&quot; terrorists strike, leading to full scale orchestrated panic, bad journalism, resurgence of the right and a continuing downward spiral into a bleaker and bleaker reality.\n\nIt&apos;s only true downside is that it can be a bit long-winded, particularly the early portions of the film were we mostly focus on the worker conflict, and we still seem to be in normative Scandinavia (I even had to check if this was in fact a documentary). Put the fact that the path to dystopia is painted by reality (or something dangerously close) only increases the value of the work.\n\nThe rhetoric used by the increasingly oppressive government is exactly the same you&apos;d not only expect to hear today, but likely have heard many times before. You can also understand the rational of all sides, you can understand why the government and the factories want this, you can see why most people wouldn&apos;t even think this was a particularly big problem, and you can see how each event influence the next. 8/10.",

So Mothra heads back in time to the &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; for kaiju-style fighting to stop Ghidora in a dinosaur-filled landscape. If you enjoy rubber-suited men pounding on each other on miniature sets, you&apos;ll very much enjoy this Mothra picture. It&apos;s nothing all the special, but for this type of film the special effects are solid, the story is serviceable, and and there was plenty of giant-monster-action.

      "name": "Study of landscape cannot overcome contrived concept",
      "reviewBody": "Victor Kossakovsky&apos;s &apos;¡Vivan las Antipodas!&apos; documents four sets of antipodes – locations diametrically opposite to each other on the surface of Earth – to unveil the contrasts and continuities that exist in the natural world. The film is more attuned to the drama of landscape than to human drama, relegating its human subjects to bit players in lengthy studies of mountains and bodies of water. Though such an approach is not in itself unrewarding, Kossakovsky struggles to transform his footage into something compelling or engaging. \n\nThe notion of investigating these antipodes is appealing, but ultimately unenlightening. Kossakovsky&apos;s idea provides a neat framework that he struggles to work within; the footage he shoots of the antipodes are non-complementary, meaning many of the global connections the director uncovers feel forced and unwieldy. At worst they become trite and superficial – Ooh, look! A rock in Spain looks a bit like a beached whale in New Zealand! – lending the film a gimmicky quality. This is not helped by the numerous occasions when Kossakovsky tilts his camera upside down to show events on the opposite side of the world, a device that adds little to proceedings. \n\nAside from some woolly ecological assertions, the film lacks thematic drive or philosophical content. Compared with a film such as &apos;Le Quattro Volte&apos;, a film superficially similar in its long takes and focus on landscape over human personality, &apos;¡Vivan las Antipodas!&apos; crucially lacks mystery or drama. Many moments of the film steer away from the poetic into the realm of banality; cynical though it may be to view the film in this way, it is apparent that the repeated images of butterflies and rainbows that come towards the end of the film just don&apos;t cut it as the &quot;life-affirming&quot; images that they are intended as. Many of the film&apos;s money shots come across less as compelling cinematic images than silver screen savers - pretty, but emotionally neutral. In an age when nature documentaries show us jaw-dropping nature footage on a nigh weekly basis, Kossakovsky&apos;s film of elephants and condors feels slightly amateurish, not much more than quality holiday footage on the big screen. Additionally, the animal footage is often used either for comic effect or for sentimental impact, lending much of the proceedings a gratingly twee edge. \n\nThe film&apos;s problems are compounded by uninspiring editing, courtesy of director Victor Kossakovsky. His affection for many of the scenarios he has filmed is apparent and it is perhaps an unwillingness to trim back the less successful moments that cripples the film. As a result, it feels both bloated and rushed, both filled to bursting point and strangely hollow. We are bounced around the Earth with such rapidity that we glean no real understanding of any of the places we are shown. Kossakovsky&apos;s camera travels so far and so fast that the audience is given no chance to settle into the natural rhythms of these locations, no chance to breathe in the surroundings. Some of the antipodes barely register, (Botswana) whilst even the most prominent (Argentina) is hampered by focusing on two men who spout laboured and unconvincing conversations that broadly lay out the themes of the film.\n\nThis is not to say that the film is without its pleasures, often from the moments that are less insistent about their capacity to induce amazement. The changing light of an African sunset, the otherworldly shots of Shanghai, a shimmering mountain seemingly finding a solid body in its reflection – moments such as these prevent the film from becoming entirely unrewarding. Yet even these moments are often lamentably hindered by the film&apos;s bombastic and decidedly bizarre score. Perhaps with a surer hand at the editing desk the film could have been shaped into something more than the mêlée of raw footage it currently stands as, though it is not improbable that the contrived nature of its central conceit would hobble it at every step.",

Top notch photography, emotionally wrenching, dealing with complex issues of today&apos;s society and depicting everything unashamedly, this movie is simply awesome. Every little detail seems to have been worked at, pondered over and hammered out until it was just perfect. Every single character is memorable. Every single shot is beautiful. I could simply find no flaws with it. \n\nWhile some may find the subject of the movie distasteful, I found the manner in which it is approached to be just perfect. There are of course clichés - these are inevitable. But the attention to detail brings this movie to such heights of perfection that you cannot help but twist your face into a satisfying grin while the movie is on, and for much time afterwards.",

      "reviewBody": "IVAN&apos;S CHILDHOOD is a masterful black and white work in which Andrei Tarkovsky demonstrates a complete command of stylistic improvisation, visual experimentation and complex use of symbolism. It is no less than astonishing that this is his first film. The story is a fairly simple tale of a young boy who wants to continue as a dangerous scout on the Russian front during the last days of WWII much to the dismay of the Soviet staff. The director employs an elliptical narrative which oscillates between an inner, dream-like vision, and actual events. Segments of the film are often introduced with extreme closeups which, at first, are difficult to recognize or understand. However, each scene is composed with the utmost attention to detail, and I don&apos;t think many paintings are created with this degree of clinical precision. Compositions begin stark and finely etched, and then seem to explode with meaning after the introduction of light and shadow. Although the film is set within the War Genre, the movie examines how war destroys the innocence of childhood. This masterwork contrasts the difference between an idyllic past where childhood should exist, and the brutal, warlike landscape of the front-lines. IVAN&apos;S CHILDHOOD is a triumph of complex mood and nuanced style, and is truly one of the greats.",

That is the only complaint I have about this film, and that really isn&apos;t a complaint because that is just how all romantic comedies are especially the good ones.  And this is a good one.  Janeane Garofalo goes ahead and proves that you don&apos;t need Julia Roberts as the romantic lead to have a good romantic comedy that people will enjoy and want to see again and again (I&apos;ve watched it at least three times).  This is overlooking the fact that Garofalo herself is gorgeous, and the fact that she doesn&apos;t have any clue as to how attractive she is makes her all the more charming.  David O&apos;Hara, Garofalo&apos;s love interest, is handsome and heart-warming as well.  You can&apos;t help falling in love with these two, and rooting for them throughout the movie.  The story is typical, boy meets girl, they hate each other, they love each other, they fight, they make up, they live happily ever after.  But that&apos;s just as it should be.  It is the banter between Garofalo and O&apos;Hara that make this film along with the amazing supporting cast in this little Irish town.  And Dennis Leary is hilarious as usual.  Rent this instead of Pretty Woman one night, you won&apos;t be sorry."

      "reviewBody": "Farmageddon&apos;s alien-related concept won&apos;t attract as many viewers as 2015&apos;s Shaun the Sheep-based movie did, but it&apos;s definitely worth it. For very young children to even older-viewer fans of the TV show and the first film, there&apos;s always an entertaining and satisfying story. However, it&apos;s best to really appreciate the setting before you see this adventure around it.\n\nAlike the previous film and the episodes on TV, there&apos;s brilliant animation with clay-made characters and effects. Plus, Farmageddon continues to maintain the ability to give audiences an understandable story without any conversations that involve actual talking. It&apos;s well-made and executed finely.\n\nUnfortunately, there&apos;s a fair lack of charm throughout this movie&apos;s plot. It&apos;s really great how the story-creators wanted to give us something different and refreshing, other than just repeating the previous film with a different design. The aliens idea is fun, amusing and delightful, but there could&apos;ve been more ideas through it to spark it up, or there could&apos;ve just been a completely different concept.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

The northern California coast doubles nicely for Nova Scotia from whence my maternal ancestors emigrated.\n\nI have difficult time seeing Lew Ayers not in a German soldiers uniform but he was wonderful in this as he was in &quot;All Quiet...&quot; Bickford is always Bickford but in this he is truly in character.

The photography, too, was wonderful. I think this will go down as one of Martin Sheen&apos;s best ever performances. He underplays his role (due to Emilio&apos;s direction?) which makes it all the stronger. In fact, it&apos;s the understated quality of the whole film that makes it very moving. It never descends into sentimentality but you still feel the grief of Martin Sheen&apos;s character as he makes the pilgrimage his estranged dead son never completed. At the same time, there are a lot of funny moments, which lift it from becoming a depressing journey. The gradual coalescing of the four very different main characters into a unified group works very well. Each of them has a different reason for making the pilgrimage and, to begin with, they seem to have nothing in common, but it&apos;s still very believable when they start to relate to each other. Emilio and his father Martin have every reason to be very proud of this film. It works on every level.",

      "reviewBody": "Sophia Loren is &quot;The Millionairess&quot; in this 1960 film also starring Peter Sellars, with director Vittorio de Sica playing a small role. The film is adapted from a play by George Bernard Shaw. I seem to remember that Garson Kanin and Katharine Hepburn had planned to do this play as a movie, but it never happened. I can&apos;t imagine why they wanted to do it, and I frankly don&apos;t know if their version would have been much better. At least in this production we got to look at Sophia and her exquisite wardrobe.\n\nLoren plays an Italian heiress who falls for an Indian doctor (Sellars) devoted to helping the poor. She is determined to get him, even building a huge hospital for him, but nothing seems to work. Her father stipulated that if she married, she must give her husband-to-be 500 pounds, and within three months, he must have made it into 15,000 pounds. It turns out that Sellars&apos; mother had a similar rule for a proposed wife - she must go out into the world with 35 shillings and the clothes on her back and make a living. Loren takes the bet and hands Sellars 500 pounds. She walks into a pasta-making sweatshop, cuts out the middleman, brings in modern equipment, lets the workers unionize, and makes a fortune for the owners and herself. The Sellars character leaves the money he was given on his reception desk, but no one takes any.\n\nThere is absolutely no action and no pacing in this film, and it fails to hold interest except when Sophia shows up in a new outfit. It&apos;s obvious that it&apos;s a play, and it would have to move a lot faster in order for it to have even a chance at working. Sophia is definitely one of the wonders of the world, and in 1960, she was on top of it, an absolute goddess with a voluptuous body, the kind never seen today. She&apos;s beautifully dressed by Pierre Balman. Sellars is excellent as always, but this would be at the bottom of the list as far as his early films.\n\nDull.",

      "name": "Interesting mix of Gothic horror and police drama",
      "reviewBody": "Spain&apos;s horror film industry had a huge comeback in the 90s with directors such as Alex De La Iglesia, Jaume Balagueró and specially, Alejandro Amenábar; a generation of young directors that demonstrated that there was a lot more in Spain besides Pedro Almodóvar&apos;s famous melodramas. The nightmarish nights of Spain&apos;s big cities, the grim Gothic memories of the country&apos;s past and that characteristic black humor that Spaniards domain very well, have become the ingredients of the dark fantasies of Spain&apos;s new horror films, and started a school that has begun to give fruits. Director Norberto López Amado is one of this fruits as &quot;Nos Miran&quot;, his first film, is an excellent effort in the horror genre that shows the evolution to what Amenábar, Balagueró and De La Iglesia started more than 10 years ago.\n\nIn &quot;Nos Miran&quot;, Carmelo Gómez plays Juan García, an excellent detective who has been assigned the Barreiros case, one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in the story of the Police Department: the case of a man who one day simply vanished without leaving a trace. While at first it seems as an easy case of a missing person, the mystery surrounding brings back Juan&apos;s memories of his own sister Sara (Eva Llobregat), who as a girl disappeared in eerily similar circumstances, and Juan begins to descent into an spiral of madness and obsession. As Juan&apos;s investigation takes him to the field of occultism, his wife Julia (Icíar Bollaín) fears that his husband will face the same fate as the previous Detective in charge of the Barreiros case, Detective Medina (Karra Elejalde), who is now an inmate in the local asylum, unable to say anything else besides &quot;they are watching us&quot;.\n\nWritten by Jorge Guerricaechevarría (famous by his work with Alex De La Iglesia) and based on a novel by Javier García Sánchez, &quot;Nos Miran&quot; is at first a police mystery with noir undertones, but soon it begins to descent into darkness as the plot thickens and the horror elements begin to take over. While it may not be the most original mix, Guerricaechevarría offers an effective and captivating story that toys with the duality of sanity and madness, and where reality is never what it seems. Almost void of his usual black humor, &quot;Nos Miran&quot; is a serious Gothic horror where the very real horrors of the urban nightmare collide with the supernatural.\n\nDirector Norberto López Amado shows an amazing talent for a first time director, as everything seems to be in the right place to create an effective horror film. The remarkable use of the camera to create an atmosphere of dread is one of the film&apos;s main assets, as well as the eerie score (by Bingen Mendizábal) that almost always sets the perfect mood for every scene. While it&apos;s true that López Amado shows the influence of those who came before him (mainly Amenábar&apos;s), the touch of film noir he adds to film suits as a glove the police drama part of the story and truly makes &quot;Nos Miran&quot; to be something more than a derivative Gothic horror.\n\nAs many critics have said before, Carmelo Gómez is truly at his best in this movie, as he truly becomes this troubled complex character in a frighteningly believable performance that certainly is the highlight of the movie. As the film is focused completely on Gómez character, there is little room for the supporting characters to developed, however, some of the supporting actors do stand out, mainly the kids Carolina Petterson and the young Javier González (who is also in &quot;El Espinazo del Diablo&quot;), who give terrific performance for their young age. Icíar Bollaín also gives an effective acting, but she is definitely overshadowed by Gómez. The excellent Margarita Lozano appears in a small role, but her screen time is very limited and it could even be considered as a cameo.\n\nWhile &quot;Nos Miran&quot; has apparently all the ingredients for an excellent film, it&apos;s main problem is the fact that it truly feels derivative and unoriginal. Guerricaechevarría&apos;s take on García&apos;s novel focuses more on the mystery instead of its effects (as the novel does), and the Detective&apos;s madness is an angle not fully explored (a missed chance, in my opinion). While the lack of Guerricaechevarría&apos;s usual comedy does help to enhance the movie&apos;s atmosphere, it also creates some tedious moments where the slow pace of the film feels unpleasant.\n\nDespite having these flaws, &quot;Nos Miran&quot; is another excellent horror film from Spain, and a proud example of what seems to be a Renaissance of horror in the land of Cervantes. Like &quot;Romasanta&quot;, &quot;Palabras Encadenadas&quot; or &quot;El Espinazo del Diablo&quot;, this movie seems to prove that modern horror not only comes from Asia. Hopefully, we&apos;ll be hearing more from both Norberto López Amado and Carmelo Gómez. 7/10",

This leads to the fast, desperate chase through a carnival, where she engages in a running gun battle with prostitutes. The car secured, she continues her murderous rampage. It&apos;s obvious that anyone who comes in contact with this woman is doomed.\n\nThe police are baffled, finding a toy car at each of her murder scenes. Why is she doing this? When one victim asks, &quot;Who are you?&quot;, she replies, &quot;I am not.&quot;.\n\nMs. Tsang gives off an aura of exotic danger like no one since Tura Satana!\n\nBEST SCENES: #1- The &quot;barn fight&quot;, featuring a scythe vs. pitchfork confrontation! #2- The &quot;photo shoot&quot; scene! #3- The &quot;art dealers&quot; sequence! This is Tiki Tsang&apos;s only movie, and she carries it from start to finish!..."

      "reviewBody": "I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nThis is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. \n\nRoman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary&apos;s Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar&apos;s are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a &quot;film&quot; like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.\n\nThe Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.\n\nUltimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I&apos;ve witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.\n\nI think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.\n\n10 out of 10"

Oh is presented is a handsome, amateur poet, but his reason for being a fugitive is not presented well nor his exact role in the leftist protests. He never shows or displays any leadership. Han is happy to provide shelter, and a bed, more as an obligation to school friends. The entire leftist movement is presented with some sarcasm - the group is shown in petty Marxist arguments and victimized by the armed government troops, Han, our eyes in the middle of it all, rolls her eyes and shakes her head. The point of view of the film switches from Oh to Han half way thru and she&apos;s the far more interesting character, and then the old terminal disease deal comes up. There&apos;s some really nice cinematography in this film which matches the mood as subdued from the start and descending into melancholy. Nice film but a bit of a downer.",

Except he&apos;s not her brother.\n\nHe brings a woman, Miss Whitman (Brook) with him, sends Kimberly&apos;s maid away and brings in his own servants. Kimberly is desperate to reach her architect friend Chandler (Knox) who will know this man isn&apos;t her brother, but she can&apos;t reach him. And the local chief of police (Lom) seems to side with the fake brother.\n\nWell, after all, he does have the correct ID, and the photo Kimberly keeps by her bed has suddenly turned into a photo of the fake!\n\nThe question is, what do these people want? Is she safe with them, or do they plan to get rid of her?\n\nThis intriguing, atmospheric drama is excellent, except I&apos;ve seen so many of these things (it&apos;s one of my favorite genres) that I figured the plot out right away. Most people will simply enjoy the ride and the surprises.\n\nBaxter looks lovely as the put-upon, desperate heiress, and the role calls for a gamut of emotions, all of which she delivers. Todd and Lom are terrific as well. Really excellent, with very good performances all around.",

I think it was the star studded appearances in the movie such as Tony Hawk, Gene Simmons of KISS, Vanilla Ice, Tommy Lee, Jurmane Dupree (spell??), David Hasselhoff, Horatio Sanz of SNL, and Jerry and Charlie O&apos;Connell. What A cast! And of course DJ Qualls and Eddie Griffin were a hilarious on screen duo! &apos;The New Guy&apos; certainly stands out from your average teen movie!!",

      "reviewBody": "Simply beautiful...\n\nEdmond Pang is not the next anything, but rather a bright new hope of the next decade for HK cinema. After 4 out of 4 good witty films, Pang dilutes his wittiness for art, yet still capturing the mood of his style. Pang is an expert storyteller and his ingeniousness use of voice over apes Wong Kar Wai, but also keeping a constant mood within the characters while capturing the romantic affairs of Macau. Like Wong, the movie emphasis on time, love and the film music score, but Pang is by far different and far more playful and witty. The film success isn&apos;t exactly due to the storyline, but rather the beautiful performance of Isabella and a career breakthrough role for the unfairly underrated cameo specialist – Chapman To which both combines well with Pang&apos;s romantic vision through the lens into the city of Macau.\n\nPang is clearly an ingenious director, who realizes that calling Isabella the same name would be a cliché, but rather changes the title role to a dog. This in turn gives a further depth to a beautiful piece of painting. Perhaps the most important aspect of Pang&apos;s image is the music score itself. It defines the film, the actors, the director and ultimately the audience. The score is heartfelt and beautiful to endure and perhaps the best fitting film score since 2046. The sense of loneliness, enduring, cheerful, carefree is all combined with the ultimately mood of a romantic.\n\nAfter a career suicide in Bug Me Not, a movie for mentally disabled people, Isabella proves the economic theory about for &quot;every low, there will always be a high&quot; correct. Isabella&apos;s performance echoes Karena Lam in her award winning debut as a natural high school-er in July Rhapsody. Isabella is clearly natural and for the first time, Neo actually reckons she is pretty. Her looks are menacing to resist and her youthfulness is played with a matured and controlled temperament as she pulls off a nomination worthy performance. As for Chapman To, an actor who Neo have found funny and likable in the past proves his potential of being a serious dramatic actor. Chapman is a likable comic genius and is clearly underrated by various critics/audience who labeled him as &quot;annoying&quot;, &quot;filling up space&quot;, &quot;a waste of time&quot;, despite pulling off memorable performances in Moonlight in Tokyo, Infernal Affairs, Colour of Truth and Initial D. Chapman depicts a corrupt cop who slowly resist and accepts the knowledge of a daughter is one of maturity and sympathetic performance.\n\nIsabella is a beautiful movie to endure and while it isn&apos;t Pang most accessible film, it nonetheless fills the most vital ingredients of an art movie – the feel and the mood. Pang tackles upon issues of controversy in a light hearted and playful manner while being serious at the same time. The city of Macau isn&apos;t really that romantic, as it is in fact filled with gamblers, prostitutes, triads and corruption. This is another reason why Edmond Pang hits his marks so cleanly and artfully, despite the fact that most scenes are so clearly staged – think Isabella lying on the bed posing – doesn&apos;t that rings 2046&apos;s Maggie Cheung? Pang also plays with the idea of a probable incest and here he ingeniously filmed the scene with a tone of juxtaposing comic and seriousness – think about it – you just have sex with a random girl you met at a bar and the next thing you realize – she is actually your daughter? Isabella isn&apos;t a film of plot and twists as Pang&apos;s previous ones, but like Wong Kar Wai, it is all about the mood and the feel that it ultimately conveys. It isn&apos;t the most flawless movie, but yet at the same time the flaws are not obvious and frequently hided behind the magnificent mood created by the powerful music score. Overall, Isabella is what I embrace as a beautiful little movie that gives the &quot;feel&quot; (Neo 2006)\n\nI rate it 9/10\n\n\n* www.thehkneo.com\n",

      "reviewBody": "What a good surprise this movie has been ! I just had to let you know about it as soon as possible \n\nAs it might not rings any bell in foreigners&apos; head, know that the Quai Des Orfèvres is the familiar name for the Criminal Investigations Division of the Paris Police, located at no. 36. In popular parlance, &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; means to the French what &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; means to the British.\n\nIndeed we are here in a thriller, a dark one. The director, Olivier Marchal is a former cop and the story of 36 Quai Des Orfèvres is from real facts from the life of Dominique Loiseau (who co-wrote the script), former member of the BRI (Brigade de Recherche et d&apos;Intervention = Search and Action Squad, the &quot;anti-gangs&quot; squad) in the mid eighties. \n\nIn this movie we follow the struggle between two cops.\n\nOn one hand we have Vrinks, BRI&apos;s head. Daniel Auteuil, who is one of the most famous actors in France, offers the audience an amazing performance playing this cop who is found of justice, whatever it costs and whatever the methods are to take down the criminals. To reach his ideal of justice he uses to flirt dangerously with the &quot;dark side&quot; taking risks for his family, his life and his career. Anyway it seems his priorities are still in this order. Like the Vincent Hanna of Heat, he just has two lifes he tries to separate: the one at work and the one at home where he doesn&apos;t say anything about his work to his wife (played by the beautiful Valeria Golino), just because he&apos;s afraid that might make her run away... \n\nOn the other hand we have Klein, the head of the BRB (Brigade de Répression du Banditisme = Crime Repression Squad, taking care of big robberies and so on) played by a very well known actor, in France but also around the world after a few appearance in Hollywood movies: Gérard Depardieu who seems to have reminded the amazing actor he can be. Depardieu is indeed at his top, playing this ambitious and soured character who reaches power and power only. \n\nTensions exist between these two men who used to be friends. They really don&apos;t share the same goals regarding their professional life but it appears quickly that the problem is mostly located on the private front. We don&apos;t know exactly what has happened but it seems that a woman, who is now Mrs Vrink, has been between the two of them, breaking for good their friendship long years ago and creating a scare which is still very sensitive today.\n\nTheir boss Robert Mancini, played by André Dussolier (the narrator&apos;s voice in Amélie, here playing perfectly again a role quite similar to the one he had in Agents Secrets), makes these tensions get worse when explaining them that he is about to be promoted. As they are both equally qualified, they are in competition for his replacement. The one who will take down a gang of very violent robbers currently holding up to ridicule the police forces, will be the new head of the number 36, Quai des Orfèvres.\n\nAnd here you know just the starting plot of this movie which benefits of a really really good script. In addition to this perfect script you have a great casting for the main roles but also for the &quot;background characters&quot; who are for most of them unknown actors who will surely be known in a few movies if they continue to play so well and have the luck again to play in such a great film. \n\nThe rhythm of the movie is also really good and, very unexpected for this kind of production in France, risks have been taken and ... it pays. This movie really takes you in its story and it&apos;s a great journey.\n\nOlivier Marchal is a former cop yes, but more than that he is also a great thriller movie fans. I&apos;ve used a reference to Heat earlier and, according to some interviews I&apos;ve read after having seen the movie, it seems that Olivier Marchal totally agrees with me on the fact Heat is one of the best thriller ever shooted if not the best. He said he wanted to something in the same spirit, all things considered and I had indeed been surprised during 36 Quai Des Orfèvres to think a few times about Michael Man&apos;s work. We are far from a Collateral or a Heat but 36 Quai Des Orfèvres doesn&apos;t have to get redden in front of these masterpieces IMHO. \n\nFan, honest and humble, Olivier Marchal has delivered us a very efficient and striking thriller who deserves to be classified among the best of the genre. \n\n36 Quai Des Orfèvres is letting me hope that maybe France will be back on the thrillers front, which had been quite deserted after a golden age in the 70&apos;s with great directors like Jean-Pierre Melville. \n\nI really hope that this movie will be released in foreign countries and that most of you will have the opportunity to see it. An opportunity that I seriously invite you to not miss",

Slasher pic is loaded with cliches and the running time is padded shamelessly with footage from a porn film and endless end credits (intercut with &quot;highlights&quot; condemning the preceding pic).\n\nA group of graduating high school seniors get together for a party at a remote house and are killed one at a time. Suspects include two vicious escaped criminals prowling nearby, plus the hero, an unbalanced football great who, hint, hint, has left behind his medication. Twist has an unlikely character proving to be the deranged killer, and getting away with it at film&apos;s end.\n\nFilm was edited by noted film doctor Herbert L. Strock and is spiced up by lengthy excerpts of softcore sex footage from a porn feature starring Seka, Honey Wilder and John Holmes. Acting, gore and tech credits are routine."

      "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, the version of this movie that I have suffers from very poor editing. There are a couple of scenes that are so badly chopped that you just kind of have to figure out for yourself what just happened! Confirming my suspicion that this movie was grossly hacked up is the fact that, according to the IMDb, the Italian version of the film runs for 99 minutes. My English language DVD is only 73 minutes long!\n\nWhat&apos;s left of the movie is actually very enjoyable. It&apos;s a decent B-grade revenge story with all the requisite cool action scenes and cheesy emotional flashbacks that make these movies so much fun to watch.\n\nThe music score is decent, but it borrows some parts from another, more well-known, spaghetti western called &quot;The Hellbenders&quot; (I Crudeli). I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the borrowed parts of the music score are unique to the English language version. Perhaps the editing wreaked so much havoc with the original score that some moron in the chopping room said &quot;let&apos;s just stick that Hellbenders song in there to fill in those parts.&quot; Who knows?\n\nThe version that I have probably really deserves a 5 out of ten rating at best, but I can tell that the movie would be considerably better in its complete, original form, so I am giving it an extra point. I hope a good print of the film in its entirety gets released some day, because I would love to see it and rewrite this review. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it turned out to be a 7 or an 8. At any rate, I liked it anyway, so if you&apos;re a spaghetti western fanatic, you may find it to be worth watching, even in its current chopped up form.",

Because of this I have a Kevin Bacon number of 2! How many can say that? When not in the scene we all played poker in a tent and got pretty wasted on that Lone Star. They fed us if we worked over 6 hours I think. Good sack lunches. One take was at night and was a blast. They used the Basque Club on South Union to film in. They had it all decorated like a Texas honky tonk bar which was the setting of the movie. One scene was shot in a small restaurant in town.

This sequel is from writer/director Jim Wynorski and is pretty typical of his output: cheap, poorly acted, but with lots of T&amp;A and a spot of softcore sex.\n\nThis time around, warrior Deathstalker is played by John Terlesky, whose s**t-eating grin, wisecracks and big chin (Bruce Campbell has some serious competition from this guy) really got on my nerves. He&apos;s not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger either, making for a rather lacklustre hero. Thankfully, the heroine of the piece, Princess Evie, is played by stunning softcore actress Monique Gabrielle who gladly shows off her assets and very nice they are too. Also displaying great form are Toni Naples as wicked sorceror Jarek&apos;s evil sidekick Sultana, and Maria Socas as an Amazon Queen.\n\nHot women in various states of undress aside, the film is pretty dire: there are numerous poorly choreographed battles, a really dumb wrestling scene between Deathstalker and an Amazonian warrior woman (played by wrestler Queen Kong), some bargain basement zombies, a few scenes borrowed from the first film to keep down costs, and lots of terrible dialogue delivered unconvincingly by the &apos;stars&apos;.\n\n3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for the dwarf playing a lute.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary is a classic and should be required viewing for every young boy world wide as soon as they enter puberty.\n\nThe reality of our world is that men will seek sexual contact with young boys for a myriad of reasons, many, known only to themselves.\n\nThe boys are the ones that need protection, NOT from the men but from their own ignorance. To decide to sell sexual services to a man is a decision that a boy makes in full conscience. The boy is NOT a victim as these situations depicted in the documentary are of young men who KNOWINGLY and WILLINGLY make themselves available to be sexual objects in exchange for money.\n\nOne could prattle on about the social reasons that drive a boy to believe that his situation is hopeless and all he can do is barter his body parts for money, yet the REAL issue at hand is the naieve and almost innocent ignorance many of the boys, especially the youngest of them, display as to the reality of their situation.\n\nOne said, &quot;I am worried about aids but if the customer insists on anal sex without a condom, I must do it, we are talking money here.&quot; Clearly, this young lad has not a clue as to his right to INSIST that the customer use a condom OR the deal is off.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, I must say that this is an excellent film, well put together and it strips the veil of &quot;secrecy&quot; away from the subject matter, a veil that, at least in the United States, is held in place by the majority of the people in denial about the REALITIES of male prostitution amongst the adolescent population.",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;Godfather&quot; Trilogy, &quot;The Conversation,&quot; &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; – all films by Francis Ford Coppola that DON&apos;T come to mind when watching Coppola&apos;s latest directing venture – &quot;Twixt.&quot; This film recently screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival and I eagerly attended. Bottom line? If you&apos;re expecting anything close to the aforementioned films, you&apos;re going to be disappointed. \n\nCoppola has said in interviews that he&apos;s only making &quot;personal&quot; films from now on - maybe too personal. While there are elements in this film that show the master has not lost his touch, this film borders on the incomprehensible. Is it a comedy? A horror film? A psychological drama? A fantasy? Your guess is as good as mine - and, apparently, the cast&apos;s, as three participants in the film in attendance said as much in the Q&amp;A that followed the screening. Actors Bruce Miroglio, Anthony Fusco, and Don Novello all had the same reaction after screening the film (only their second opportunity.) First, it was nothing at all like the film they saw a few months ago and Coppola was obviously still tinkering with it. Second, it was a helluva lot funnier than they remembered it. \n\nConfusion maybe the theme of the film, but should that confusion have extended to the cast and, ultimately, the audience? One of the things the audience was confused about was that it was a 3-D film. Everyone eagerly played with the glasses until an announcement was made that there were only two short sequences in 3-D, and that it would be clear when those times were. That still didn&apos;t stop people from flipping the glasses on and off in a futile attempt to add some dimension to the film. \n\nCoppola&apos;s choice to use 3-D does say something, though. Consider his contemporary - Martin Scorsese. Scorsese embraced the technology, used it to great effect to enhance his storytelling in &quot;Hugo,&quot; and foresees using the process for all of his future projects. (We&apos;ll see.) How does Coppola use it? As a gimmick. An effective gimmick, but a gimmick none the less. Scorsese used it to draw you into the world of &quot;Hugo.&quot; Coppola&apos;s use actually, and purposely, takes you out of his. Interestingly, only one of the two sequences was filmed using a 3-D camera. The second was added in post-production.\n\nIt really wasn&apos;t necessary, as the look of the film is one of its assets. Visually entrancing, and wonderfully atmospheric, the film has a cinematic look unlike anything else Coppola has done - even &quot;Dracula.&quot; As for the cast, Val Kilmer giver a lead performance that almost redeems him from the trainwreck that is &quot;The Fourth Dimension.&quot; I could have done without his umpteenth Brando impersonation, though. Uniformly fine work from the supporting cast helps. It&apos;s always good to have Bruce Dern back on screen portraying one of his &quot;slightly-off&quot; characters.\n\nThe script is the film&apos;s Achilles Heel, if Coppola even had one. I don&apos;t need every element of a story to be spoon-fed to me, but give me something to chew on, please. &quot;Twixt&quot; leaves too many threads dangling from the seams that are obviously fraying in this film. The parts are all there, they&apos;re just waiting to be sewn together in a much better fashion. Its ending is abrupt and confusing. As Miroglio said when responding to an audience member&apos;s comment that he really didn&apos;t know what happened at the end, &quot;Francis&apos; response would probably be – &apos;GOOD!&apos;&quot; Maybe for him, but not for an audience. Coppola says he got the idea for the film from a dream of his. Coppola&apos;s turned his dream into an audience&apos;s nightmare. Does he even care?\n\nwww.worstshowontheweb.com",

The mother and the daughter are two characters, and the actress who plays the mother is renowned for her great works. The young teenage girl, the grow-up young lady are both pretty to look at and well merged in this a bit numb screenplay. The huge groper, nickname Blueback, is a nice touch and natural wonder, but there is nothing further developed between the daughter and the fish. Eric Bana&apos;s role is not so interesting and meaningful, more like a patch-up to stuff into a hollow movie. Their beach property is constantly targeted by the developer and their sea is also ransacked by fishing company that poaching and killing fish at will. There actually not too much to tell other than the aging mother got a stroke when the daughter away from home in the sea doing research works.\n\nThis movie is like a gourmet food prepared by a great chef, the presentation of the dishes are look pretty, but quite tasteless. Watchable, but need some patience to sit through. I didn&apos;t finish it in fact since it&apos;s not that interesting to me."

      "reviewBody": "For starters - At an unbearable 134 minutes, this 1960, WW2 Drama, directed by Italian film-maker, Roberto Rossellini, was truly something of an endurance test for this frustrated and bored viewer.\n\nEscape By Night&apos;s action (or lack of it) was set at such a deliberately s-l-o-w snail&apos;s pace, and every situation was dragged out beyond reason, that, sure enough, I ended up nodding off to sleep more than once.\n\nOn top of that, this wartime picture did not contain one, single battle scene in it. You can be sure, had a few worthwhile explosions taken place, here &amp; there, that definitely would have helped to alleviate some of this story&apos;s stifling monotony.\n\nIn this tale of cat-n-mouse, all that Rossellini seemed concerned about was dealing with the trifling personal dramas that dogged its characters.\n\nBut, unfortunately, this directorial short-sightedness on Rosellini&apos;s part didn&apos;t go over very well with this viewer, since none of the characters in the story were really all that interesting or worthy of much attention to begin with.\n\nBelieve it or not - The absolute highlight of this mundane picture was when a turkey (that&apos;s right - a turkey!!) escaped from Esperia&apos;s home and this excitement sent all of the delighted, neighbourhood children scampering down the dirty street after it.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; for the 90&apos;s minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero&apos;s (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it&apos;s like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to &quot;score&quot; more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry&apos;s wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990."

At first glance, it may seem crude to some with its nudity and humour, but this first impression dissipates with the consistent touch of silliness (Coluche style) that keeps you smiling. The ignorant, libertine and vulgar lifestyle of that period, intermixing with the influence of catholicism, are well delivered by Coluche and Serrault who make a wonderful team in this comedy. The mood of the movie is quite relaxed, it&apos;s as if the actors were having fun making the film. The dubbing might be annoying sometimes (franco-italian movies were common in the 80&apos;s) but it&apos;s only a minor issue that one can become used to. And finally, the music is quite amusing; the theme song is light and stays in memory for a long time :)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Walk the Line&quot; is a good biopic of the early years in the life of singer, songwriter, musician and actor Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix does a good job playing Cash as he breaks into music. The talented Cash, who became much more known as a quiet, withdrawn man for most of his performing life, had some raucous early years. The film covers his first marriage, road trips while struggling to make a name for himself, and his drug use. \n\nThis also was the time when he met and befriended June Carter who would later become his wife. The film ends before the major part of his career with Carter - their last 35 years together. Reese Witherspoon gives a superb portrayal of Carter. She won the only Academy Award of five nominations for the film. But the movie took the top three Golden Globe honors for the year - best picture, best actress and best actor. Witherspoon also won the BAFTA award for best actress. Ginnifer Goodwin also gives a superb performance as Cash&apos;s first wife, Vivian. \n\nWhile Cash was known mostly as a country musician, he had a versatile portfolio of songs and performances. He played and sang blues, rock and roll, gospel and folk music. He is in three music halls of fame - Country, Gospel, and Rock and Roll. He sold more than 90 million records in his lifetime.\n\nAs so many other musical biopics, &quot;Walk the Line&quot; covers mostly the years up until the person makes it big. This is one when I would have enjoyed another 20 minutes or so to see performances of some of the top songs that Cash wrote and played. Cash and Carter died within four months of each other in 2003. He was 71 and she was 73.",

However, nobody is harmed nor killed in this action movie because what is intended is a small illustration of local dude&apos;s being a hero under an extreme condition.\n\nThe Achilles tendon is the script: too many Korean slangs and cheesy words are used. For Koreans, this movie is a cutting-edge comedy and one of the most brilliant wordy hilariousness; however, foreign audiences are not aware of their context and all rhythmical jokes will be lost out of language barrier.\n\nNevertherless, considering an output of a débutant director, the cinematography and layout of scenes are truly superb as much as can be picked one of the most joyful and tight-structured comedy within the category of action-packed flicks. Another version of English subtitle with finessed touch should be equipped in order for foreign watchers to better catch the lines.",

Do they have polar bears in Sweden,? No. But according to a essay done in the US, more than 50% of the students thought so.\n\nThe movie has beautiful scenery, and the tension keeps you at your toes, though it hasn&apos;t anything really new about it. Does show though that Sweden can produce thrillers, and not only dramas, which may be nominated for an Oscar..."

      "reviewBody": "The Rotten Tomatoes score for this is Shockingly low at 11%. I definitely think it&apos;s time for a critical revisit because the movie has become such a cult classic. It centers around a group of popular teen girls in high school. The Alpha played by a perfectly poisonous Rose McGowan (Scream). Rebecca Gayheart (Urban Legend) the nice one and Julie Benz (TV&apos;s Buffy) as the ditzy follower. They play an unfortunate prank on their girlfriend and she chokes on a large Jawbreaker. They try and cover it up while the Alpha takes it to questionable lengths. It&apos;s a darkly humorous teen flick that&apos;s now better than ever. Filled with quotable dialogue and one hell of a lead performance from McGowan. It&apos;s fun, disturbing and hilarious in all the right ways. Judy Greer (Halloween 2018) stars as Fern a witness they give a makeover, Pam Grier (Jackie Brown) as the feisty detective and Carol Kane (Scrooged) as the kooky principal. Even Marilyn Manson shows up for a cameo.\n\nBudget: $3.5M Box Office: $3.1M\n\n8.25/10",

      "reviewBody": "A brilliant slice of pioneer-era Americana. In no other movie that comes to mind was there such a realistic portrayal of the Old West and its numerous perils than in this faithfully told story of pioneer women crossing the harsh western U.S. wilderness of 1850 from Missouri to California.\n\nThe ladies are responding to an ad placed by a leader (on behalf of several other men) in a pioneer settlement out in California for wives. These tenderfoot ladies may be looking for husbands, but there&apos;s nothing &quot;weak&quot; about them at all. They not only bravely face the hardships, dangers, and tragedies of the journey, but they soon learn how to handle their own with toughness and grit.\n\nThe story unfolds clearly due to a finely structured and developed script. The intertwining stories are well told and well acted. The mostly female cast are all strong, and Robert Taylor as &quot;Buck,&quot; the guide and leader of the wagon train seems to enjoy the task of having dozens of female leads surrounding him. John McIntyre as the patriarchal Mr. Whitman (who hires Buck) is good, while Buck&apos;s friend, confidant, and comic-relief guy Ito is also a well-rounded character.\n\nThe ending is one of the most heartwarming ever in a western; this is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again.",

      "reviewBody": "As seen at the AFI Film Festival, Revanche is a tight thriller that is  at a the same time a mood piece and a human moral drama. Austrian&apos;s  official submission for the foreign language category in the 2009  Academy Awards is likely to this reviewer to get the nomination.  Following the lives of two couples, a prostitute and a thug, a cop and  his wife; tragic circumstances converge their lives when a bank robbery  goes awry. Featuring a stand out performance by Tommy Lee Jones  look-alike Johannes Krisch as the thug Alex, the man creates tension  when out of frame, in the nick of shadows and in front of the camera.  His character of Alex is a tortured soul that the audience is never  sure off; his intentions or actions are hidden behind a mask of  serenity. Not satisfied with being a replica of Jones, he also gives a  very Tommy Lee Jones no-frills turn that keeps the movie afloat.  Director Gotz Spielman creates tension using sound and extremely  detailed camera set-ups. Not show-offy in anyway but including two long  one take shots, he also uses his DP to infuse the screen with pale and  desaturated color tones for nights scenes and natural lighting for  daylight scenes, all used to provide a flat élan on the screen. It  effectively supports the vibe of these revenge melodrama.   What could be hammy in another director&apos;s hands becomes poetry in his.  The sound of the ax smashing a block of wood never seemed more  intimate. When a director uses it in such a way that the viewer feels  inside the innards of a man&apos;s soul, you know the director knows his  stuff.   Intricate and detailed, it is consummate from top to bottom. If there  is any qualms with the movie, it is in the character of Robert the cop  played by Andreas Lust. His character arc is supposed to mirror Alex  but he never earns the audience&apos;s sympathy the way Alex does; yet his  story is geared toward such a response. The character is slightly  underwritten and the actor never engages the character the way Johannes  does.  Playing against our expectations to create an ending reminiscent of  Greek tragedy, it is a worthy movie experience and the best movie I&apos;ve  seen in 2008 along with Mike Leigh&apos;s Happy go lucky.",

This disc was produced in full cooperation with the members of Pink Floyd. The interview segments are informative and interesting, providing little anecdotes that even I didn&apos;t know about. Plus, members of the band perform intimate acoustic versions of &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; among others. As well as giving a demo of how some of the trippy electronic effects were created.\n\nThe documentary gives a track-by-track history of the entire album (all save for &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;). I particularly enjoy the segment on the song &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot;. I must have heard that song hundreds of times and yet Claire Torry&apos;s voice never ceases to raise goosebumps whenever I listen to it.\n\nWe are also treated to snippets of early takes of DSOTM tracks. An early version of &quot;Money&quot; truly reveals it&apos;s bluesy roots.\n\nAll of the interviews are handled individually and each appeared to filmed at different times at different locations. No two members of the Floyd are interviewed at the same time. However, each member genuinely seemed to enjoy recalling the making of this landmark album after all these years, and still appeared to have some fresh things to say.\n\nIn addition to the band, we are treated to comments by Storm Thorgerson, the creator of nearly every Floyd album sleeve to date, as well as Alan Parsons, the producer of the album who uses the mixing board to dissect individual tracks for us.\n\nMy only knock against this disc is that it wasn&apos;t longer. I could have easily watched another hour of this. A definite &quot;must-buy&quot; for any Pink Floyd or classic rock fan.",

      "reviewBody": "François Villon was a real-life poet and rogue who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction--from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century. Whereas in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film. In reality, he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law--not the combination of a patriot and Robin Hood-like character like he is in the film. Provided you know that the film is nearly 100% fiction, then it&apos;s well worth seeing--just don&apos;t assume it&apos;s a good history lesson.\n\nIn THE BELOVED ROGUE, Villon is played with wild abandon by John Barrymore. I was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the plucky dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. Mack Swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of Chaplin&apos;s short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints---even with Barrymore&apos;s rather over-the-top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a Douglas Fairbanks performance. However, the performance I had a serious problem with was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this &quot;unsubtle&quot; would be a gross understatement. He played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical Richard III--skulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature. While Veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both silent and sound) but here he is just ridiculous.\n\nAs for the story, it&apos;s full of lusty adventure and action--like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships. The sets worked out well for all this, as they&apos;d been used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were set around the same time period.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s one of the last great silent films. There&apos;s a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance, comedy and action. Well worth seeing, though it loses a couple of points for Veidt&apos;s overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history.\n\nBy the way, this film was also made twice as IF I WERE KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. However, in total, six films have been about Villon and tell, more or less, variations on the same tale!",

It clearly sets out the chronological history, but what makes it great are the interviews with major players, including Khatami, Vance, Rafsanjani, de Cuellar, Albright and Larijani. These personal accounts of vital meetings, brinkmanship, exasperation on all sides - even straightforward low comedy - are fascinating. Behind-the-scenes negotiations, shifting allegiances and politicians or diplomats being outflanked by unforeseen events put the familiar (and often baffling) news stories in context, together with great use of archive footage. \n\nI can&apos;t recommend it highly enough, especially in the light of current events.",

      "reviewBody": "Famous United Artists film from 1929 with Gloria Swanson in her smash-hit talkie debut. I saw this at the George Eastman House in Rochester last week; it has the only known complete print and it&apos;s a beautifully restored version.\n\nSwanson stars as a private secretary who marries a wealthy man&apos;s son. But their honeymoon is interrupted by the angry father who bullies the son into getting an annulment to &quot;test&quot; Swanson, while they &quot;gussy her up&quot; for their society friends. Swanson storms out but the boy doesn&apos;t follow. Later she reads about his marriage to a &quot;proper&quot; girl in Europe. So she decides to never tell him about the baby from their honeymoon night. Later she reads about a terrible accident and the other wife&apos;s injuries. But by then Swanson has shacked up with her boss and living off him even though he is married. Everything comes to a head when the boss dies and Swanson tries to go straight but can&apos;t make a living to support herself and her baby. Re-enter the first husband, his crippled wife, and treacherous father.\n\nPure soap but it&apos;s very well done and Swanson (with her 2nd Oscar nomination for this gem) is totally great. Opening scene is a long dolly shot moving in toward her office where she has her back to the camera as she types. Her first words are &quot;and how!&quot; as the &apos;can-do&quot; secretary. Up thru the honeymoon Swanson is bright and funny as the happy bride. She was a terrific comedienne. But when the story turns tragic, Swanson really comes into her element as the suffering mother, the high-living floozy, and finally the contrite penitent.\n\nRobert Ames is the husband, Henry B. Walthall is the office manager, Kay Hammond is the crippled wife, Blanche Frederici is the nanny, Purnell Pratt is the boss, William Holden is the mean father, Henry Armetta is the barber, Mary Forbes is the boss&apos;s wife (in fabulous clothes and jewelry), and Stu Erwin shows up as a reporter.\n\nSwanson sings &quot;Love, Your Magic Spell Is Everywhere&quot; and &quot;My Tormented Heart&quot; in the Italian version.\n\nA pity this film will likely never be released on DVD. The Trespasser is a great moment in a great star&apos;s career."

      "reviewBody": "Many people who have claimed to see this film have not. Most of those who have seen it, have not understood. GOODBYE UNCLE TOM was directed by Gualtiero Jacopetti &amp; Franco E. Prosperi, the two men who pioneered the documentary movement that came to be known as the &quot;Mondo&quot; film, a term the two dislike immensely. Hot on the heels of their controversial and still-relevant AFRICA ADDIO, it was meant to exonerate them from accusations of racism. Ironically, it would do the exact opposite. It was developed as an idea to adapt the novel &quot;Mandingo&quot; as an historical, documentary style drama. What emerged was a shocking, difficult-to-watch-at-times, treatise on the horrors of slavery, and the source of racism in America, if not the world, today. It was the filmmakers&apos; intention not to pander to a politically correct theory that slaves of the 1840&apos;s had a 1970&apos;s awareness of their situation. The events are all historically correct. Many of the characters are people who actually lived. The dialogue is verbatim from true manuscripts of the day. The racism is a genuine depiction of plantation life of the day. It was felt that glossing over the African experience in America would be an insult to the pain and suffering of the millions who survived the &quot;middle passage&apos; only to welcome a life a slavery, no different from an animal or piece of property.\n\nYears after it&apos;s initial release, the directors have expressed a regret at not opening the film with an explanation stating that this was a film about the emotions of that bygone era, not of the filmmakers themselves.\n\nThe controversial final scenes, which take place in contemporary America, are based on &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, and are meant to represent an angry, reactionary vengeance on behalf of the millions, with whom the character identifies. Malice for sure, but not unmerited malice. This film should cause strong emotions. Any film that tackles a moral issue must cause debate and conjecture if it is to succeed. What makes the film even more extraordinary is that it succeeds without claiming a moral superiority, or taking a moral stance. What appears on screen are the most graphic, realistic depictions of the North American slave trade of the 19th century, and this film should be required viewing in Black History classes on college campuses, and high schools all over the world, particularly in America. This film preceded ROOTS by six years and stands as a much harsher indictment of the evils of human bondage. This is one of the bravest works of cinema and remains a misunderstood humanitarian masterpiece."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. As a fan of director Ari Folman&apos;s Oscar nominated Waiting for Bashir (2008), I was excited to see this one on the line-up at Dallas International Film Festival. While some will find The Congress a bit messy and difficult to follow, it certainly reinforces Folman&apos;s innovative and creative approach to story telling and filmmaking.\n\nThe first half of the movie is live action and the second half is animated. The best description I can offer is as a social commentary, not just on Hollywood, but society. While &quot;Her&quot; makes the case for virtual relationships, this movie makes the case for virtual everything else! Robin Wright plays Robin Wright, an aging movie star who is offered a chance to stay young and be popular forever. Just sign this contract, and Miramount Studios owns your complete public image. No more acting, just kick back and enjoy your money ... and watch what we do with your image and career.\n\nThe cast is very strong, but the movie has a feeling of having been rushed through production ... at least from the live action side. In addition to Ms. Wright, Danny Huston chews some scenery as a cut throat studio head. His blunt description of Ms. Wright&apos;s &quot;bad choices&quot; since The Princess Bride speak to not only many actors, but for many in the audience as well. Harvey Keitel plays the agent, Jon Hamm appears through voice only in the animated sequence, Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In, The Road) plays Wright&apos;s son and central plot figure, and Sami Gayle plays his sister.\n\nSome will be reminded of A Scanner Darkly, and others of Cool World. The best this movie has to offer is not in its (creative) presentation, but rather in its ability to provoke thought about the look of future society and the impact of technology ... as well as the whole issue of identity and what makes us who we are. It&apos;s a brain-scrambler if you stick with it.",

      "reviewBody": "Joe Dante is a great fan of the horror genre, and most of his films are dedicated to that passion directly, as in his film creations, and indirectly, with his use of inside jokes and references and his use of beloved figures from the genre itself in small roles.  It is this passion and love that makes his films special, and The Howling is no different.  It is a boost for the relatively weak sub-genre of lycanthropy.  It has marvellous special effects which are still quite good by today&apos;s standards, some good humour, well-choreographed chase scenes, and some good acting. The script is weak and laden with cliches, but remember it is a parody in ways.  Dante names characters using the names of great horror directors(his idols I imagine) such as Terry Fisher, Freddie Francis, and Erle Kenton. Forrest J. Ackerman, Roger Corman, John Sayles, Dick Miller, John Carradine, Kenneth Tobey, and Kevin McCarthy make appearances.  Patrick Macnee is quite good in his role, and Dee Wallace is excellent in her screaming way. Overall a fine film!"

His acting is great, even if in the beginning it feels sometimes overacted. Why do I think it a boring film? I haven&apos;t read the book, but I&apos;m convinced it&apos;s very interesting and moving at the same time. You probably can imagine every scene being told by Tiziano in all its colours. In the movie this doesn&apos;t work because you see those beautiful sceneries of Tuscany not letting room for your own fantasy to develop pictures in your mind. Somehow the movie feels like the pages just being filmed one by one. A pity the film wasn&apos;t done in Italian, it would have been so much more authentic. In addition, obviously Elio Germano (Folco) spoke his text in Italian being dubbed over in German which kind of feels strange because his lips speak the Italian words which don&apos;t match the German text in movement. If you like Bruno Ganz and the not worn out pictures of Tuscany go and watch the movie, if not, go for some other movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting. Initially this comes across as something of a &quot;sort of/what-if&quot; story. What if the newly-regenerated Sixth Doctor decided to become a hermit instead of travelling through time and space? That being the case, this story begins a few months (or maybe years) after his regeneration, when a distraught Ms. Brown (an older Peri with an English accent) leaves the Stranger to his self-pitying contemplation. In the true fashion of a Doctor Who companion she immediately falls into some sort of trouble by coming across a surreal cocktail party hosted by an older debonair man (played by Michael &quot;Davros&quot; Wisher). Meanwhile, a young deaf mute&apos;s girlfriend is mesmerized and spirited away to a work party by an illusionist clown (also played by Wisher). After receiving no help from the town&apos;s elder (again Wisher - the guy&apos;s prolific), the mute seeks the Strangers help. The Stranger is initially deaf (no pun intended) to the young man&apos;s pleas, but eventually decides to help him.\n\nThe Doctor Who ties run even deeper when the Stranger and the young man are captured by the primary villain - the Controller, who looks suspiciously like the Master from &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. The Master&apos;s propensity for disguises is echoed in the fact that the illusionist, the town elder, and the party host are all aspects of the Controller.\n\nI&apos;m not knocking the Who-ish aspects of the story. In fact, I enjoyed them. The story was a simple run-around, but it was a treat to see Nicola Bryant and Colin Baker (proving once again what a great Doctor he could have been without the clownish clothes and outside interference).\n\nWorth a look by Doctor Who fans, especially if they&apos;re fans of Colin Baker."

      "reviewBody": "I truly believe that most of the negative reviews are just a result of people jumping on the bandwagon about &quot;the Rankin and Bass special we&apos;re not supposed to like.&quot; One might ask then, why did it &quot;flop&quot; at the box office? It sounds like it was very poor marketing to have released it in July. Just because the story was set in July does not change the fact that it is a Christmas story in every sense of the word and should be shown at Christmas time. That was a tactical error which caused it to fail, obtain a bad reputation, and now everyone just agrees that it&apos;s bad without thinking for themselves. Judged on its content, it&apos;s a great story and the complaints against it make little sense. For one thing, it&apos;s a major mistake to compare this to the earlier Rankin and Bass specials, as if this movie was somehow made to be in competition with them. It was obviously created to complement them and it does an excellent job of it. Secondly, it is a delightful, heartwarming movie that anyone with a soul should enjoy. Thirdly, the movie does a very clever job of incorporating the many favorite Rankin and Bass specials together and reinforces the idea that it is all in one universe. It provides closure to many aspects of the specials, such as Frosty and Crystal&apos;s life and family together, their ongoing friendship with their former advisory Jack Frost, Rudolph&apos;s origin, and many other details. It even subtly explains Santa&apos;s more idiosyncratic behavior in past specials, such as his grumpiness in Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer and self-pity in Year Without A Santa Clause. He says to Mrs. Santa Clause, &quot;I&apos;m not the easiest man to get along with&quot; and she says, &quot;Only when it gets close to Christmas Eve.&quot; It&apos;s really a very significant special and it&apos;s a shame that it&apos;s lost on some. So, folks, watch this delightful Christmas movie, don&apos;t be influenced by the hate that others have directed towards it, avoid holding it to crazy standards that no other fantasy movie would be held to, just lighten up, sit back, and enjoy Rudolph and Frosty&apos;s Christmas in July with an open mind and a happy heart.",

Tom (Kevin Bacon, Sleepers) being hypnotized by his sister in law(Ileana Douglas), then, he winds up with clairvoyant abilities that link to disappeared teen girl(Jennifer Morrison, today famous by House). These faculties also have traumatized his young boy( similarly to kid in ¨The sixth sense, he isn&apos;t only one seeing dead), carrying the fear under his frail shoulders, but he can communicate with the deceased adolescent and presumed missing. Tom and son&apos;s visions lead to have problems with his wife(Kathryn Erbe, Law and Order) and friends(Kevin Dunn, secondary in Gozzilla). It leads to unexpected and breakthrough twist ending about what&apos;s happened before.\n\nThe movie packs suspense, tension, shocks, grisly horror and eerie scenes when the ghoul appear. The film takes accent as the suspense as well as the terror. Provides an imaginative, highly original and well-knit screenplay by David Koepp, also director, and based on novel by Richard Matheson. Sinister and mysterious atmosphere is finely made by cameraman Fred Murphy. Creepy music score fitting to the horror film by James Newton Howard, he&apos;s habitual maker of frightening atmospheres such as ¨Sixth sense, Devil&apos;s advocate¨ and composer of all films by Night Shyamalan. The motion picture is well directed by David Koepp, a famous screenwriter(Zathura, War of the worlds, Spiderman, Mission impossible) and occasionally director(Secret window,The trigger effect). The flick will like to terror fans because gets decent scares and intense sequences of horror.",

I went into it thinking it was some marvelous mystery or noir.\n\n&quot;21 Days Together&quot; has an interesting history. Released in 1940, it was actually made in 1937 but for some reason not released. After Gone with the Wind, I suppose there was a lot of interest in Leigh and the film was released.\n\nThe Leigh role was to be played by Vera Zorina, but obviously she didn&apos;t do it and Leigh won the role.\n\nThe story concerns a young couple in love, but the woman, Wanda (Leigh) is married but not living with her husband. He shows up and attempts blackmail, but gets into a fight with her lover Larry (Olivier) who accidentally kills him.\n\nA man who stole something off of the body is arrested for murder and found guilty. The couple has three weeks together before Larry must give himself up or let an innocent man hang. His brother, who is up for a judgeship, is determined that Larry not admit to the crime.\n\nThis film was not close-captioned and, as I am a little hard of hearing, it was difficult to understand some of the dialogue. \n\nI found this an okay drama, well acted for the most part.\n\nLeigh and Olivier made a beautiful couple, and it&apos;s always nice to see them together, young and in love. Makes you sad about how it ended.",

It was good to see how Jimmy prepared himself both physically and mentally in order to fight against Jose Mendez. Was also good how they portrayed Pete Wright as a Cockney thug hell bent in revenge against Jimmy. Orlando Bloom played this role well! Good on him! I enjoyed how they also portrayed Jimmy&apos;s manager. He was arrogant slimy and showed what it could be like if you were gonna get yourself a manager. Felt sorry for Jimmy as he was turned against because the manager was a bit of a prat and only wanted tension. Poor guy. The fan who went to Jimmy&apos;s house was quite good as well. That showed that there are fans who can do that sort of thing and just appear at their idol&apos;s door. She was convincing! Overall a very good film considering it was a low budget one. I couldn&apos;t pick anything that was wrong about it off the top of my head!"

      "reviewBody": "Brittany Bristow is a wonderful actress (following in the proud tradition of Murphy and Snow), at least for this type of film. She can dance quite well too, and we don&apos;t get to see nearly enough of that. As Sophie she has an adorable personality when that is appropriate, and a strong determination and intelligence. Or what Winston calls being a manipulative &quot;minx&quot;. And someone, probably not her since the face isn&apos;t visible, is quite an acrobat.\n\nErica Durance gives her usual good performance. I like her best perky but she shows she is capable of more. She doesn&apos;t really show her full range here, but that&apos;s okay.\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies makes a wonderful villain. He&apos;s totally convincing when he seems to care about the various people in this film, and I&apos;m not quite certain they should be so suspicious of his intentions. Sure, Winston has a greedy side, but he genuinely shows he is good when he has to.\n\nAnd of course Sheba is quite talented. I don&apos;t know the elephant&apos;s real name or how many there were, or even if some of the &quot;acting&quot; was animatronic or CGI, but Sheba is talented.\n\nThis being a circus, we get to see lots of talented performers. Most of them are only on screen for ten seconds or so, but they are very good. There is one little person whose name I don&apos;t remember who has plenty of dialogue and seems to do a good job with it.\n\nI wasn&apos;t happy with most of the music, but this is what young people like. It wasn&apos;t really all that bad. Sophie&apos;s best dancing, though, was not to classical music, but something like &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;--still good.\n\nThis is a family film, but not necessarily for younger or more sensitive children. There are a few moments of terror and mild violence, as might be expected with wild animals, and with people with the wrong attitude. Nevertheless, Sophie&apos;s claim of abuse is an exaggeration. It&apos;s easy to see how Magnus could have abused Sheba, as frustrated as he got, but on screen he never reaches that point. After seeing &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; the same day I saw this, I say what little violence this has is absolutely harmless.\n\nIt&apos;s not perfect. This is one of those formula films, even including the line &quot;That went well&quot;, and while it&apos;s not overly preachy, the film does seem to take the position that animals don&apos;t belong in circuses.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely worth seeing."

      "reviewBody": "I read the novel decades ago, but from what I remember the major points and most of the minor points of the novel are intact. The novel and the film weave a tale of a 19th century England completely lacking in compassion, and that always went doubly so for orphans such as Pip, yet he does encounter more than his share of good luck.\n\nOf course the most interesting character in the novel is Miss Haversham. In the film as in the novel she is dumped at the altar on her wedding day in her youth and has harbored a grudge against the entire male sex since then and has lived as though stuck in that day for decades, still wearing her rotting wedding dress. What I don&apos;t understand is why the film does not include her being financially defrauded by her fiance as the novel does. The novel weaves a tale of an unbelievably small world, but the film omits a couple of the more unbelievable plot turns to its credit.\n\nThe lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who attends to Pip&apos;s affairs when he is in London, is also a most interesting character. He has a hangman&apos;s noose as a souvenir in his office and also seems to be actively collecting the death masks of the recently executed as a new one pops up every time Pip visits him. Yet when he discusses the matter of the death penalty and criminal justice in England Jaggers truly seems to get the cruel randomness of those institutions.\n\nOne thing I can say without spoiling anything is how completely unrecognizable Alec Guinness is as Herbert Pocket, Pip&apos;s roommate in London. He doesn&apos;t even have that trademark gravelly voice at this point, his first credited film appearance.\n\nI don&apos;t even like costume dramas or period pieces, but I highly recommend this one. The fine acting by the cast and Lean&apos;s direction really drew me into the story.",

Except that I had no idea who Adam Marcus was. Given his track record, justifiably so. The depressing part isn&apos;t so much the plot (which was written by your little brother in crayons), as much as it was watching Val Kilmer sink to new lows in his otherwise mostly storied career. When I tried to rationalize why Val Kilmer would stoop to the level of this ostensibly lost A-Team episode script directed by appointed directors like Marcus, all I could come up with would be his contempt for the real world equivalent to the radical right-wing Minutemen-like goons littering this pseudo-entertaining steaming pile of straight-to-vid. As it turns out, I was at least partially right, Kilmer did this movie for personal/political reasons (according to the related trivia).\n\nI would write a summary, except I&apos;m loath to spending more than the 90 minutes I already wasted watching it. You&apos;ve seen it before, except this time it isn&apos;t Steven Seagal fighting for the rights of Native Americans, or Billy Jack fighting for the hippie commune, it&apos;s Val Kilmer fighting against a shoestring budget, and implied Halliburton employees as laughably stereotypical rednecks for the sake of immigrant rights and liberal ideology. A great cause, but ill-conceived and poorly executed here.\n\nBut don&apos;t take my word for it, no really. I want someone else to have to endure what I did.",

      "reviewBody": "Those hoping to see a direct translation of the stage show might be slightly dissapointed. It has lost some of it&apos;s wit and charm, but has replaced them with an exuberance reminisant of the old time film musicals, where everyone looked as if they were having the time of their lives. This is what shines through mostly about this video. The feeling that the people involved knew they wanted it to be special, and they have succeded.\n\nThey have opened the show up slightly, with the opening set in a school and all the main cast as the teachers.  They&apos;ve added some rather snazzy special effects which on this occassion don&apos;t overwhelm the whole film, but help to draw the viewer into the world which they create. There are some wonderful cameos from a few familiar faces and the largely unknown cast of Brothers and Wives shine, with a few stand out performances from some of them. One of the girls reminds me of a young Joyce Grenfell.\n\nThen we have our Two principals Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman. There were a few raised eyebrows when it was announced that Donny would be playing the lead role, but all misgivings are swept away as he makes the part all his very own, with a mixture of playful charm and vitality. Maria Friedman is a screen star in the making, with a charisma that makes her seem a natural for the screen. She has been wowing audiences in the West End for sometime now, but I&apos;m sure that soon Tinseltown will take her and make her the star she should be.\n\nThere is very little wrong with this production and I&apos;m sure that it will have been in many peoples Christmas stocking. So while it may not be a gem, you can safely say it is a rough diamond, which in many cases shines much brighter.",

Very hard to describe and follow.\n\nIt starts out with a priest and then cuts to these guys who appear to be editing or adding special effects to a movie.\n\nThe rest of the movie shifts back and forth between the asylum and voice over of these two editors making dumb funny comments about the movie which, BTW was supposed to be found footage, and the producer back in the US.\n\nIt&apos;s nearly impossible to watch. Nothing makes sense.\n\nStephen Rhea has really dropped into the abyss.\n\nWords cannot describe how bad this movie is.",

She falls in with Eric Portman, who seems terribly rich and terrible arty.... but is obsessed with a 300-year-old painting of a young woman and reincarnation. When he gets around to showing it to Miss Romney, it&apos;s the spit and image of her, and he thinks he&apos;s the reincarnation of the Borgia she left for another man.\n\nThe remainder is part 18th Century Gothic literature, part war-weary spiritualism, and part obsessive behavior that Hitchcock would revisit in VERTIGO. Young directs it as a movie about madness, but it could have easily been tilted in favor of spiritualism, especially given the ornate palace sets, a wild medieval party, and the shafts of light that cinematographer Andre Thomas lays among Serge Pimenoff&apos;s Cyclopean sets. It&apos;s French realism gone mad, and the film makers knowing it. It&apos;s terribly arty, and almost self-congratulatory in its excesses. While it takes itself too seriously for my taste, it will certainly appeal to many people.",

So I was sitting at home on a Saturday night looking through the &quot;New Arrivals&quot; section of my Netflix account when I stumbled across this movie.\n\nIt&apos;s funny, and a bit quirky at times. I loved it! Would be a great one to watch with my wife and the lack of noticeable profanity was very very appreciated. \n\nUnlike other reviews, I enjoyed the plot thoroughly. Found the acting to be very good, especially Sally Hawkins, Tom Riley and Sinead Maguire. With Sinead totally stealing every scene she was in. Was a blast to watch and I am very happy I gave it a shot. Can&apos;t wait for my wife to see it!\n\nGreat job by all involved. I highly recommend this one for it&apos;s quirky chuckle factor. Fire up some microwave popcorn and enjoy!",

Only they figure out before the end that it is earth about 500 years into the future where an atomic war has pretty well decimated the planet. \n\nFortunately for them the world is not just the savage mutants they inhabit outside. There is a civilization kept alive in earth&apos;s caves. But they&apos;re a pretty pacific lot and frown on these 20th century types with their weaponry which simply consists of handguns.\n\nThe four astronauts are Hugh Marlowe, Nelson Leigh, Christopher Dark, and Rod Taylor who would soon star in his own film about time travel. In the end it turns out that these guys and their knowledge of weapons come in pretty useful after all.\n\nThe director of this film Edward Bernds who did this for Allied Artists. Bernds who started out working on Frank Capra films was a director of several Bowery Boy features for Allied Artists formerly Monogram Pictures. This was a man used to working with minuscule budgets and realizing that the film didn&apos;t turn out half bad.\n\nAnd unlike Planet Of The Apes it ends on a somewhat optimistic note.",

This film was directed by a great figure of Jewish culture Iprahim Keshon.This comedy is different from those by the likes of Marx brothers,Buster Keaton, Max Linder,Charlie Chaplin and Laurel &amp; Hardy.",

      "reviewBody": "Thanks to Miranda July and her movie called The Future, we are offered a complex and peculiar story surrounded by an environment of insecurity that makes us wonder about our personal life expectancies. A couple in their thirties decides to adopt an abandoned cat. The cat has an injured leg, and so, they have to wait for a month until it is recovered from its illness to take it with them. Meanwhile, they start to think that they have to enjoy their last month of freedom, because the cat would not allow them to do so any longer.\n\nThe cat only appears physically once at the movie, but it has much more importance than that. In fact, it is the narrator. It helps the audience to be put into context, and it sometimes gives sense to some parts of the film that seem to be incoherent. A part from having an important leading role, it will be the one to break out the whole action; the fact of having decided to adopt it will be the turning point of a story that, at first, seemed to be set in a calm atmosphere.\n\nSome important aspects of life are tackled. For instance, the uncertainty of the future is clearly shown. We have to assume that that is the way it is, we are in control of it, but we are not able to know about it. So, life would not be all about wanting to know more about the future, but to be ready to face what comes next. If we stop to think about the future we do not have enough time to live the present. We spend our daily life worried about the future, and what if that future does not exist? \n\nThe entire film is enveloped in an enormous pessimism. The way in which the characters act makes us predict that there is no energy in them and they are likely to lose. Instead of taking into account the advantages that life can offer to them, they only see problems around. They even see the fact of taking care of an abandoned animal as a problem, when that should be taken as a satisfaction. That offers the audience the possibility to decide if that behavior is right for you or not; it is a film that would make people think. Furthermore, it is a movie that favors self-reflection. Although the development of the movie does not make the moral to become evident, one can use the film as the starting point of a personal thought with a clear moral: It does not really matter what will happen next, we have to enjoy the everyday and make the most of it."

But in my 13 year at the time there was nothing inevitable about it. The great Kennedy machine as it came to be known flexed its muscles first in the Wisconsin primary in 1960. \n\nThe traditional first primary of New Hampshire was disregarded that year as it was conceded to New Englander John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Wisconsin  which had the oldest of primaries with a mixed population, but next door to JFK&apos;s challenger Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota was the real test.\n\nCould a Catholic be elected President? That was the issue, the only one nominated by a major party Alfred E. Smith took a shellacking in 1928. However there were lots of differences between Al Smith and Jack Kennedy too numerous to mention. \n\nFrom 1956 to 1960 the wealthy Kennedy family organized a 50 state machine second to none. Poor Humphrey never had a chance.\n\nThe film without a word of commentary shows the glamorous Kennedys and the excitement around them and Humphrey talking to small knots of people  trying to retail votes. When JFK passes his first real test before the voters it&apos;s pretty obvious why.\n\nPrimary is a real must for any student of the period.",

Well, yes, but not in a too-terrible-to-be-enjoyable way. In fact, this movie is one of the best &quot;serious&quot; efforts in FM&apos;s catalog.

It might have been that it was edited and released to the public after the war, as was the case with many films which were shot during the last year of the war, but knowing that it dates from 1945 makes watching of this film so much more interesting and the film in itself more remarkable, since it contains no trace of war or propaganda of any kind. If you are a collector of Third Reich movies (or Johannes Heesters), be sure to have this gem in your collection."

      "reviewBody": "If you watch &quot;Elephant Boy&quot;, I strongly recommend you use the closed captions along with the movie. This is because it&apos;s Sabu&apos;s first movie and his command of English isn&apos;t great and his accent quite thick. With the captions, this shouldn&apos;t be a major problem.\n\nThe story is based on a Kipling tale and is set in India. Toomai (Sabu) is the son of a mahoot--an elephant driver. And, Toomai looks to follow in his family&apos;s footsteps and become a mahoot just like his many ancestors. When a white hunter arrives, Toomai&apos;s father and his elephant join in the expedition...and Toomai, though only about 12, is allowed to come along with them. This film is about the many things that occur during this hunt...things that force Toomai to grow up very quickly.\n\nWhile this is a decent film, it also is a product of its times. Paternalistic, presenting the British control of India is rather idealized terms as well as a few natives who are just Brits in dark makeup! My attitude is DON&apos;T toss the film in the trash bin but just learn from it and understand its shortcomings. Sure, it&apos;s not exactly realistic but also represents Sabu&apos;s first film...a film which would end up changing his life radically.\n\nSo is this a great film? No. At times, it seems rather plotless and meandering. There also were a few scenes which shocked me, as you could NEVER make scenes like it today...such as the elephant walking around the baby!! Worth seeing and better than a typical jungle picture of the day--with animals from all parts of the globe stuck haphazardly into the film because they films were made on the cheap. &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; is no cheapo jungle flick and only offers a few ill-placed bits of stock film (such as occasionally showing African instead of Asian elephants).",

You&apos;d expect the regular, mediocre servings of Asian horror taking place after that. Not in &quot;Inner Senses&quot;.\n\nHer psychiatrist, played by Leslie Cheung, doesn&apos;t believe in ghosts but is eager to help. Only problem is that he apparently has some psychological issues as well.\n\nTo say more than that would be a crime. Suffice it to say that this is a wonderfully crafted movie, that is almost Lynch-ian in its unweaving. Are the ghosts real or just in our minds? Watch and decide.\n\nThis movie deserves a second viewing and a lot more praise than it got. I would classify it as a psychological horror, but labels don&apos;t do this film justice. Don&apos;t expect much gore (thankfully) but there&apos;s tension and jumps in all the right places.\n\nThis gets extra creepy points because Leslie Cheung actually killed himself a year later. In a way, this movie it is incredibly fitting as his last work - a great one.\n\nThis is an above average Asian horror that challenges you to think.\n\n7/10.",

The first of these adverts is when the film lead stops to buy a drink of coke for no reason and proceeds to slowly drink it with the can taking up most of the screen, really just like an advert.\n\nThis was a little annoying but I kept hope that this was a small issue in what could become a very good film. Unfortunitly it didn&apos;t and car and phone adverts continued through the film. The script was poor and events unbelievable. Most of the action scenes you will have seen copied from Bourne or other action movies but made laughably similar but much worse. The acting from weaver was poor, although I am not sure if the blame lies with sigourney or the director. To be honest Bruce Willis is by far the best actor and carries the film for the first 20min giving some hope it will become a good action film, unfortunately it did not.\n\nI have never walked out on a film but after a number of laugh out loud moments ( at the film ), I was seriously contemplating it. I may be wrong but i think we have a nomination for a rotten tomato award.\n\n3 stars is being kind,",

      "reviewBody": "The project &quot;All the Invisible Children&quot; has the intention to disclose through seven short stories, the terrible situation, with the lost of innocence and lack of perspective of abused children in some countries in the Twentieth-First Century through the eyes of seven directors.\n\n1) &quot;Tanza&quot;: Mehdi Chafer shows a boy called Tanza in an undefined country in Africa fighting in a civil war with machine gun and explosives, and dreaming on having his home and going to school. This theme could be very powerful, since there are many civil wars in Africa and use of children as soldiers, but this short never works and is completely boring. My vote is three.\n\n2) &quot;Uros&quot;: Emir Kusturica shows a gypsy boy called Uros in his last day in a juvenile prison in Serbia-Montenegro without any other perspective but returning to the place. The black-humor never works and the story is pointless and pretentious. My vote is four.\n\n3) &quot;Jesus Children of America&quot;: Spike Lee shows a HIV positive girl called Blanca, daughter of junkies&apos; parents with Aids and the cruelty of her schoolmates in school in the best episode of this film. My vote is nine.\n\n4) &quot;Bilu and João&quot;: Kátia Lund gives an optimistic approach of two homeless children that fight to survive working on the streets, collecting beer and soda tins and paper to sell in a junkyard, and transporting shops in street fairs. Kátia Lund lost the chance to disclose the terrible situation of street children in Brazil, and how our society is indifferent to such a social problem. My vote is five.\n\n5) &quot;Jonathan&quot;: Jordan and Ridley Scott show a photographer correspondent of war in pain for his past experiences. This tale is simply awful, empty and shows the absolutely alienated vision of the childhood problem of these directors, actually the worst story. My vote is two.\n\n6) &quot;Ciro&quot;: Stefano Veneruso shows a young boy in Naples that pickpockets to survive. This short is interesting and has a good conclusion. My vote is seven.\n\n7) &quot;Song Son and Little Cat&quot;: John Woo shows a beautiful, but shallow tale of fantasy, with a homeless orphan and a spoiled wealthy girl. The short is beautiful and probably the most elaborated one, but does not reach the objective of this collection of films. My vote is six.\n\nTherefore, in spite of the good intention of the producers of &quot;All the Invisible Children&quot;, the result is irregular, flawed and only reasonable. My (global) vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Crianças Invisíveis&quot; (&quot;Invisible Children&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This movie had a difficult task, trying to top &apos;Days of Future Past&apos; which in my opinion is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, while this film was good, it fails on many aspects that made the previous one so good.\n\nThe acting here is very good, there is not one bad actor here. Michael Fassbender is the star performer here, the scenes in which he was the centre of, always turned out great. But I would go as far to say, we did not see enough of him. The movie follows the heroes more, but does do a great job at showing the threat of Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as the main villain was a brilliant choice. From the trailers and posters, I believed that he would be over the top, but instead he is intimidating. \n\nThe story on the other hand, is not too compelling. X-Men, X-Men 2, First Class and Days of Future Past, have all had great stories. They were all perfectly paced, with enough going on to keep you both, invested in the main characters and everything else that&apos;s going on. This film is a mess. Some characters were a complete letdown, we were made to believe that they would be kick-ass, but instead they stood in the back not uttering a word. I would say that I was not greatly disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence character here, while she was important, I believed that she did not suit well in the hero role. Mystique is a villain, and she should stay that way. By having her being an hero this time around, does seem right.\n\nThis film is not bad, the critics, yet again don&apos;t know what they hell they are doing, with their ridiculous reviews, but this is not even close to being as good as the other X-men films we have had. With the exception of Origins: Wolverine (shivers). Go see the film is you are a fan of the series, and you will possibly like it, but don&apos;t expect it to be as good as the last one.\n\n7.4/10",

      "reviewBody": "Of all the kaijyu movies Toho has produced in the &apos;50s, this probably is the least well known. It was originally available in United States in a super 8 format under the title &quot;Varan the Unbelievable&quot;, and sported American actors. The one reviewed here is not this Americanized version but the original Japanese version called &quot;Daikaijyu Baran&quot; (Literal translation: Giant monster Baran). Being a kaijyu eiga fan, I used to hear about this monster a lot and wished I could find a copy for a long time. I&apos;m happy that it is now available on DVD.\n\nBaran gets its inspiration from Japanese flying squirrel called musasabi and it was intended to be a flying monster from the start. What makes this movie little weak is the lack of character of the monster itself. In most Japanese kaijyu movie, there&apos;s a subplot that justifies the character of the monster, but in this movie this is lacking. He&apos;s supposed to be some sort of god to the village people, but when he shows up, he&apos;s just a giant reptile out for destruction.\n\nThis is a cult classic kaijyu movie, and definitely worth a watch before it disappears into obscurity again.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make &quot;The Cell&quot; a memorable and above average movie.\n\n&quot;The Cell&quot; is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it&apos;s real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly &apos;dreamy&apos; sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.\n\nThe story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn&apos;t always make sense. Because of that the movie isn&apos;t always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.\n\nVincent D&apos;Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D&apos;Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I&apos;m not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn&apos;t suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn&apos;t strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D&apos;Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn&apos;t fit the role well enough and no, I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.\n\nThe musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of &quot;Se7en&quot; like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene&apos;s some extra mood and atmosphere.\n\nIt&apos;s a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still &quot;The Cell&quot; is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Famous musical numbers are presented by some of those legends including Fred Astaire, Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra. I just don&apos;t like the way they brag and flatter each other. Is it really necessary to tell the viewer how good they were? The audience should be able to judge for themselves. And the numbers are great, no doubt about it. Fred Astaire&apos;s tap dance with Eleanor Powell is awesome, Donald O&apos;Connor&apos;s &quot;Make&apos;em laugh&quot; is funny, Gene Kelly sings in the rain and Judy Garland sings over the rainbow. It&apos;s also fun to see dramatic actors like James Stewart, Clark Gable and Cary Grant sing and dance. That&apos;s entertainment! Rating: 4/5"

Jackson) takes the law into his own hands and kills the two. Now the small town becomes a hot-bed of controversy as a murder trial starts that gets national attention. There is the defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) and his bright-eyed assistant (Sandra Bullock) against prosecutor supreme Kevin Spacey. A really solid film that works because of a screenplay that pulls no punches and revolutionary direction by Joel Schumacher. A great ensemble cast all excel here and the film captures a place that has turned into a media circus very well. A film that you will watch with clenched fists. An intense experience. 4 stars out of 5."

The camera gave me the whole time the feeling of being part of the crowd on the screen, just there in the school building, between all the funny people - the guy who plays flamenco guitar, some Manu Chao song, the pop-up band, people just dancing - all of them who want to make the world a better place. A lot of languages are used all over the movie, people act like like real people do, it&apos;s just fine. This is the first part. Everything afterward, as we know, is of extreme brutality, and I was happy that I had never been part in that leftie mass event. I really liked the movie how it was make, technically. It&apos;s only a pity that a lot of answers are not given. It would have been helpful to work out more of the backgrounds. The extreme force of the police, where did it come from? There must have been a lot of hate and fear a long time in advance. We don&apos;t get to know much about the really violent left wing and how far the police was able or willing to make a difference between them and the average wild-haired, guitar-playing and further peaceful demonstrators. So, I missed some different points of view besides just the picture of peaceful lefties. But when you realize that everything really has happened like this, the the world is maybe less subtle some times. And that makes me shiver.",

Towards the end of the movie, after the beachhead and Mount Suribachi are secured, Sgt. Stryker calls for a squad to raise a flag.  Watching from behind Stryker, we see three young men squat down in front of him.  Stryker hands them an American flag and directs them to climb to the top of Mt. Suribachi and raise it.  The three men playing the roles as themselves are: PFC Rene A. Gagnon, USMC; PFC Ira H. Hayes, USMC; and, PH3 John H. Bradley, USN -- three of the five original famous flag raisers captured on film in the famous scene atop Mt. Suribachi, and forever etched in stone in the Iwo Jima Memorial at Arlington, Virginia. The other two flag raisers were shot and killed later on the island."

      "reviewBody": "Loosely based on a Manga,City Hunter is by no means Jackie&apos;s best on an artistic level. However,it might very well be his most sheerly entertaining.\n\nAlthough the plot is similar to Under Siege,the similarities end there. City Hunter is played almost entirely for laughs and manages to be consistently funny throughout while having more inventive ideas in 20 minutes than all three Austin Powers movies put together. Director Wong Jing {the same Wong Jing who made Naked Killer and God Of Gamblers!}absolutely crams the film with sight gags and slapstick,all filmed in a bright cartoon-like manner. One sequence involving Jackie being chased around a ship while hunting for food is an absolute masterpiece of silent-movie style comedy. Many of the best gags are very quick,such as Jackie crawling out of a bag hardly bigger than his head. Some are extremely sexist though,such as the woman holding a gun and falling forward because of the combined weight of the gun and her large breasts {this happens more than once}.\n\nDespite all this City Hunter still manages to be crammed with action scenes,except of course in this film rather than simply staging a fight in a cinema we have Jackie taking guidance from an on-screen Bruce Lee! A Streetfighter sequence where the characters morph in to various game combatants has to be seen to be believed and the end showdown between Jackie and Richard Norton,although not one of his best in terms of martial arts technique,is easily his funniest.\n\nAdd some great characters,a terrific score,and for the male viewers,some gorgeous Hong Kong &apos;babes&apos;,and you have 90 minutes of sheer,non-stop FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Peter Van Eyck as a jungle doctor trying to save natives and animals alike.....this was very weak Tarzan film and rumor had it that Scott only made $50000 for the whole film.... His other Tarzan adventures turned into classics, such as &quot;Tarzan and the Lost Safari&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&apos;s Greatest Adventure&quot; and &quot;Tarzan the Magnificent&quot;....in those films Scott&apos;s role as Tarzan reached new heights as an intelligent thinker......Greatest Adventure the best Tarzan ever in my mind....",

Joan Crawford as played by Jessica Lange - the best performance by an actress in many, many years - is a totally recognizable person, crazy or not. When George Cukor tries to convince Joan not to be so vindictive &quot;you&apos;re better than this Joan&quot; to what Crawford/Lange replies: &quot;No George, I&apos;m not&quot; Fantastic!

Maybe on the hit (good) side is the general set design and atmosphere. It feels like a slightly simplified and cleaned up 1942 Manhattan (where most or all of this occurs). And Barbara Hershey as the leading woman (not quite a femme fatale, it seems, but she has that look) is solid, especially with her hair up. You&apos;ll see, a good strong look. And the cameras are pretty right on (I&apos;m a photographer, and I shoot with one of these 4x5 Graflex press cameras all the time), though at a glance it seemed that at least one of his Graflexes was a post-war model. We&apos;ll let that slip. And on the plus side it has to be said that Mark Isham&apos;s last minute hiring for the score was inspired, because it gives the movie the depth it needs.\n\nThe misses on the film are deeply integral to enjoying it all the way--the plot, the secondary actors, the direction. The latter is hard to pin down within the obvious and almost purposely clichéd plot, but you feel all along that the movie is put together functionally, as if the director knows most of all that these pieces have to go in order. But giving it flow, elegance, power, and even a convincing mise-en-scene is not just a matter of logic. It feels off, as it out of tune. It&apos;s especially noticeable because so much of the film is going right, including Pesci.\n\nThere is the question of why did they take Weegee (a.k.a. Arthur Fellig) and turn him into Bernzini (a.k.a. Leon Bernstein)--apparently it was a rights issue with the original story, but certainly the new story could have still been based on Weegee. The images in the film look like pseudo-Weegee moments as much as Pesci looks like Weegee, and Wikipedia says that some of these are actual Weegees. (I have my doubts, but who knows?) Both men had outrageous rubber stamps for the back of their prints that are almost identical--Weegee&apos;s said &quot;Weegee the Great.&quot; The car is identical, for sure, and even the pace and the world are Weegee&apos;s.\n\nBeyond all of this, the movie is entertaining if never commanding, and quite beautifully photographed--I&apos;m talking the cinematography, now. My copy was VHS, and it doesn&apos;t sound like the DVD service through Amazon called the Universal Vault Series has very high standards (one user said it looked like VHS quality). I would think a full widescreen version would be worth the trouble--maybe try an Amazon instant play for $3. This says specifically that it is widescreen."

      "reviewBody": "A BEDTIME STORY (Paramount, 1933), directed by Norman Taurog, is a cute and simple story about how fate steps in and changes the life of a Frenchman playboy for the sake of an abandoned baby. The Frenchman in question is Rene (Maurice Chevalier), whose introduction to the story being the focus of his straw hat twirling on top of his cane, exiting the train onto the station in Paris after spending some time away big game hunting in Africa. Because no one is aware of his early arrival, Rene makes arrangements to spend an hour with not one, but three attractive young ladies at separate times: Suzanne (Betty Lorraine), a florist; Gabrielle (Leah Ray), a night club singer; and Paulette (Adrienne Ames), now married to the ever jealous Max (Earle Foxe), who makes no qualms about remaining &quot;friends&quot; with him. Although engaged, Rene does not let his arrival be known to his fiancé, Louise (Gertrude Michael), so to have a little fling before getting married. As he telephones the aforementioned ladies, Rene&apos;s luggage is being packed into his car while at the same time, a poor couple (Frank Reicher and Ethel Wales), formerly maid and butler, find they are unable to care for their now deceased employer&apos;s child, attempt to find him a good home by placing the orphaned baby (Baby LeRoy) in the back seat of Rene&apos;s car. That night in Rene&apos;s apartment, the baby is brought to the attention of his servant, Victor (Edward Everett Horton). Rene decides to unload the child by calling the authorities, but rather than having the boy placed in an orphanage, Rene decides to keep the child he calls &quot;Monsieur Baby.&quot; By doing this, Rene forgets about his ladies in waiting, all awaiting his arrival that never happens. With the baby in the care of the two men, Rene calls for a governess/nurse, who turns out to be a stranded American showgirl named Sally (Helen Twelvetrees), whom he hires. All appears to go well until Rene attends a function hosted by his fiancé, Louise, who becomes humiliated not so much by the presence of Sally and Victor, but with the baby, and makes it known that she doesn&apos;t want that &quot;M&apos;sieur Baby&quot; into their lives.\n\nA musical that might have played as either a straight light comedy or drama, the writers inserted some songs into the scenario, all sung during the first hour so not to take away from Chevalier&apos;s image. Unlike some of his earlier works on film, Chevalier doesn&apos;t sing directly into the camera, but to the ever attention of Baby LeRoy. With music and lyrics by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin, songs include: &quot;Look What I&apos;ve Got?&quot; (sung by Leah Ray); &quot;M&apos;Sieu Baby&quot;(sung by Chevalier to LeRoy); &quot;In the Park in Paree&quot; (sung by Chevalier as he strolls LeRoy in his baby carriage); and &quot;Home Made Heaven&quot; (sung by Chevalier to Helen Twelvetrees). With &quot;Home Made Heaven&quot; being the film&apos;s best liked tune, the most memorable happens to be the one not sung by Chevalier. &quot;Look What I&apos;ve Got&quot; might not sound like a familiar song title, but the score is, having been used as background music in one of the funnier scenes of the most revived comedy of INTERNATIONAL HOUSE (1933) involving Peggy Hopkins Joyce and W.C. Fields taking separate showers in the same hotel room. &quot;M&apos;sieur Baby&quot; as sung by Chevalier to Baby LeRoy, might have been inspired by Al Jolson&apos;s lullaby of &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; to his three-year-old son in THE SINGING FOOL (1928), but &quot;M&apos;sieur Baby&quot; never became noteworthy. Unlike THE SINGING FOOL, A BEDTIME STORY is geared more towards comedy than drama. There is a touch of sentiment, however, in a scene where Chevalier kisses his new found son, followed by him lifting his head up proud and holding back tears of joy.\n\nBaby LeRoy, making his movie debut, is best remembered today as the comic foil to comedian W.C. Fields in such notable comedies as TILLIE AND GUS (1933), THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY and IT&apos;S A GIFT (both 1934). His career ended by the time he reached the age of four in 1935. Helen Twelvetrees, in her only performance opposite Chevalier, has charm but lacks the sort of charisma found in some of his other leading ladies as Claudette Colbert and Jeanette MacDonaldt. Gertrude Michael steps in once again on screen playing one of her many unreasonable, jealous characterizations, a sort of role she specialized in at that time.\n\nVirtually forgotten today and a lesser achievement to some of his best films, especially those under the direction of Ernst Lubitsch, A BEDTIME STORY, is Chevalier&apos;s movie from start to finish, though Edward Everett Horton and Baby LeRoy come close to nearly stealing it. Baby LeRoy gets all the cute closeups and dubbed-in baby sounds, as well acquiring watches to break by crashing them onto the floor. When being taken for a stroll, the baby looks directly at the big clock attached to the street pole, leaving Chevalier to reply, &quot;Be reasonable! Be reasonable!&quot; Horton as Chevalier&apos;s manservant, brings all his familiarity into his role. One amusing scene has him giving Rene a shave, and during their conversation, learns that one of his employer&apos;s many girlfriends happens to be his wife, leaving Rene to sit motionless as Victor coldly uses the razor blade shaving around his neck, leaving Rene to sit back and wonder if he&apos;ll do anything drastic. Cleaver touch of suspense comedy.\n\nThere have been several movies over the years bearing the title of A BEDTIME STORY, but while the story has been revamped in different ways, this screenplay by Waldemar Young has never been remade nor has it ever been distributed on video cassette. However, it did have limited revivals on the American Movie Classics cable channel from February to November of 1989. With this being the only pairing of Chevalier and Baby LeRoy, this is their story captured on film. (***)",

The movie does not offer much in terms of action: it rather sets out to be a &quot;slice-of-life&quot; piece, taking a look both at the events and the changes occurring in all the lead characters. I can understand this kind of approach can be disliked by some viewers; still, I found this movie interesting and somewhat underrated (picked it one evening on the cable). If you like a movie that emphasizes the mood instead of the actual action and with a strong cast ensemble (watch for Northern Exposure&apos;s Darren Burrows!), this is for you. 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "An Eastern European (Tom Hanks) from a fictional country literally gets stuck at JFK Airport in New York after his landing coincides with the point at which a war causes his nation to no longer exist. Thus his paperwork and passport are no good. Hanks is in the U.S. for a mysterious reason and that reason becomes the hook in this wonderful picture. While stuck, Hanks sees more of America than he could have ever imagined. However he constantly has trouble with airport supervisor Stanley Tucci (in a perfect role). Runway worker Diego Luna makes a deal with Hanks so he can learn about passport officer Zoe Saldana (a woman who Luna has loved from afar) via Hanks&apos; attempts to have his passport accepted. Also Hanks meets an elderly Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana) who has been in the states for decades, but the reason he is there also becomes a key point. While all this goes on, Hanks falls in love with 30-something flight attendant Catherine Zeta-Jones (perfectly illuminating and beautiful as usual). Zeta-Jones is sad and disillusioned with men (Michael Nouri of &quot;Flashdance&quot; in particular) and past relationships that have failed for one reason or another. Director Steven Spielberg has never really been known for romantic pictures (&quot;Always&quot; in 1989 is an exception), but he proves that he can definitely handle a production like this. The cast is excellent with Hanks making all those around him better. This story was co-written by Andrew Niccol (even though he strangely did not pen the final script), an under-rated screenwriter who struck gold in 1998 with &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. By the way, the art direction/set decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio. Spielberg was not allowed to film any airports due to obvious security reasons. From top to bottom, &quot;The Terminal&quot; flies high. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "The key to understanding the movie and profiting deeply from its hidden insights is to notice, to analyze and to reflect on the scenes in which a mirror is used by the director in order to tell a hidden story behind the apparent one. Any good comedy is just the communicable surface of a deep tragedy, and this is true for this movie, too. While Sonja Ziemann was 31 at the time of the reeling, she plays a girl about 10 years younger than that. Rudolf Prack plays a person who could very well be his true age, i.e. 55. This alone should warn one to take the story at its surface level. The most revealing scene, though, is the opening one which shows the first and biggest mirror, namely the street and sidewalk, whetted by rainfall, which image the cloudy sky above. The earth is the location that is capable of imaging, or capturing, the heavens. The mirror scenes can be categorized into 4 categories: Dany (Sonja Ziemann) alone with the mirror, Pratt (Rudolf Prack) alone with the mirror (only 1 scene which is very decisive), both of them separated by a mirror that makes up an axis through the scene, both of them being together by being located on the same side of that axis. Also, consider the figure of St. Martin in the rear of Pratt&apos;s studio. Whether director Borsody knew what he did is doubtful. The more astounding is the achievement accomplished: He did everything right, even if one relates the mirror scenes to theories of symmetry breaking in nuclear physics.",

      "name": "Brilliance in experimental anime",
      "reviewBody": "Before X, before Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, before Akira, there was Neo Tokyo, a fine blend of high-end animation and artistic expression, as well as experimentation.  This is far from the typical &quot;big eyes, small mouth&quot; anime with big guns, big robots, and girls with big, um, &quot;talents&quot;.  In other words, this is not your younger siblings&apos; anime.\n\nThe first selection, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; by Rin Taro, is a child&apos;s imagination run wild.  If Cirque de Soleil was animated, it would be this.  A little girl and her faithful cat cross over into a bizarre world via a mirror and are entertained by a mime-like clown, a traveling circus, and a surreal world of high walls and mindboggling imagery.  Much like the imagination of a child, this is not a short to be analyzed, picked over, and dissected. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; is meant to be simply enjoyed.  Other than the basic storyline, the short bounces around at a moment&apos;s notice from one scene to another and doesn&apos;t seem to fit together at all, but in the end it does.  This piece is what I like to call &quot;moving artwork&quot;.  Several of the scenes could be plucked from the screen and hung on a wall.\n\nThe second short was a favourite of MTV&apos;s &quot;Liquid Television&quot; in the early 90&apos;s.  Yoshiaki Kawajiri&apos;s &quot;The Running Man&quot; tells the story of a driver who has been surviving death-defying form of racing for ten years.  It&apos;s a brilliant accomplishment and unfortunately, one that&apos;s been wearing on him, since other drivers are dead in a year.  A reporter begins covering the driver&apos;s unstoppable career and accidently discovers why this man always wins.  Finally, the stress of tempting death night after night breaks him and in an instant, all hell breaks loose.  The design of the characters is very realistic, atypical for early to mid-80&apos;s anime.  The speed and look of the racing vehicles is fluid and the piece is never boring, even sticking around with you after the very end.  Despite the morbid nature of this short, I honestly believe that &quot;The Running Man&quot; should be part of Speedvision&apos;s Lost Drive-In collection.\n\nThe finale could easily be subtitled &quot;The Akira Experiment Project&quot;.  Three years before he would reshape the world of anime forever, Katsuhiro Otomo wrote and directed &quot;The Order To Stop Construction&quot;, the tale of a hapless Japanese executive sent to shut down an overblown project in a tropical rainforest powered by robots and void of humans.  Unfortunately, what stands between him and his orders is a foreman robot on a strict work schedule that it is hellbent on keeping, so much that the last human sent to supervise the place has disappeared without a trace.  Despite the fact that the worker robots and the machines they operate keep exploding day in and day out, the foreman is convinced that if the others work just a little bit harder, it can meet the ever important deadline and nothing is going to stop that, including the human sent out to do so.  Every element of &quot;Akira&quot; can be seen here, from character and vehicle designs to pipe movements and mud bubbles. It&apos;s like watching a mini-version of &quot;Akira&quot; without any psychic goings-on. Also like &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;The Order To Stop Construction&quot; is also a bit of social satire, making fun of the important and somewhat overbearing work ethic of the Japanese.  My only complaint is the dubbing.  The original Japanese language with subtitles would have added a bit more to this instead of the weak English voice-acting.  This short would have been a fun addition to the &quot;Akira&quot; special addition recently released, as well as an important one.\n\nThis fine, yet brief, collection of mid-80&apos;s animation from Japan is definitely worthy of DVD consideration and it&apos;s a shame that it hasn&apos;t received one as of yet."

      "reviewBody": "Well, at least for a little while! His last of eight Poe films as director is (loosely) based on the Poe work of the same name and is a solid metaphorical ghost story. Lady Rowena (the wonderful Elizabeth Shepherd) falls in love with Verden Fell (Vincent Price) despite his strange behavior and questionable past. Soon after their marriage, he starts disappearing, she&apos;s menaced by that old Poe stand-by (the evil black cat) and plagued by horrific nightmares involving Verden&apos;s deceased former wife Ligeia (also played by Shepherd), whose ghost seems intent on ruining the union. Price, in top hat and strange sunglasses in many scenes (his vision being &quot;dangerously acute&quot;), seems a bit too old for the role, but still manages to come through with an effective performance. Corman has always been underrated for effectively capturing period detail on a limited budget and it&apos;s his keen eye for the crumbling ruins, lush green countrysides, oceanfronts and shadowy castle corridors that make much of this film work. Screenplay by future Oscar-winner Robert Towne (CHINATOWN). LIGEIA was Corman&apos;s last horror film as director until 1990&apos;s FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND.",

This movie was obviously super low budget. I kept wondering if I was watching video. The sets were extremely cheap looking. I want to see hood movies that are different. Character driven. I loved Deborah Cox. I don&apos;t understand how she to is not in more better quality juicy roles. Come on how can Craig Brewer get it perfect with hustle and flow and Directors from the hood can&apos;t? Cowboy director...keep trying. We need better quality stories!

Attenborough gives a standout performance as Pinky and is surrounded by a sterling cast working at the same high level. The film is beautifully photographed in a way which gives texture to the story and reality to the characters. This must be one of the top British films of the Forties and can stand beside anything Hollywood was doing at the time (or any time for that matter.) \n\nThe script is credited to Graham Greene (based on his Novel) and, the unlikely seeming, Terence Rattigan (Separate Tables, Winslow Boy et al). Without knowing who contributed what to the final screenplay, I can say that it is a beautiful and coherent piece of work that has character development as well as terse and atmospheric dialog that keeps the viewer engrossed and the tension high.\n\nRecommended (especially to fans of film noir)",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw Toy Story 2 an hour ago and I must say that, despite all the great reviews, I was still surprised about the quality....It started absolutely marvellous; one of the greatest and humorous opening sequences ever. The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I&apos;m NOT exaggerating. It seems impossible to imagine the fun the writers must have had, because this is a true film-fest whether you do like  Disney-esque films or don&apos;t.\n\nHaving this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter &amp; Co. exploited it to a maximum. Cameo&apos;s from Pixar-characters (Geri&apos;s the coolest), unexpected and obliged references to other big films (really love the Jurrasic Park one), great new characters (Wheezy!!), and more jokes and gags rammed in an animated feature than you&apos;ll ever see and of course the out takes.\n\nThe action-department is also greatly represented in some astonishing sequences with great, original shots and angles. The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.\n\nO.K., I know I&apos;m raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the &quot;Vote&quot; button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.\n\nA few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.) These are minors things and my decision is final, Toy Story 2 is certainly included in my top 20.\n\nO.K., now you may stand up and ring a friend to go and see it, come on!!",

      "reviewBody": "An admirable film, both in intent and execution, but one which somehow never had the devastating impact it&apos;s tragic story would seem to deserve. \n\nPart of a long line of films showing the incredible hardships kids who are orphaned and left to the streets face (e.g. &apos;Pixote&apos;) in this case there is a powerful political facet as well. A middle- class Kurdish journalist and his wife are gunned down in front of their young children (a boy, a girl and an infant) by Turkish paramilitary troops seemingly bent on silencing political opposition. The children are left to fend for themselves, ending up out on the street before long. They are ignored by most before finally settling in with some other street kids, and a prostitute who treats the young girl with kindness. This leads to a plot twist I won&apos;t give away here, but one with considerable punch. \n\nSo why wasn&apos;t I more blown away by this well-meaning film? I think it&apos;s because I felt a sense of slickness and manipulation. The film is shot with a certain reserve. Instead of hand-held camera, or a feeling of verite, there&apos;s a distance in the pretty, but almost Hollywood like cinematography. Unlike &apos;Pixote&apos; or DeSica&apos;s best work, I could feel the strings being pulled, and so found my heart resisting. Also, while the 10 year old Senay Orak is truly amazing as the sister, much of the other acting in the film feels stiff and unnatural. I was always aware I was watching a movie, not real life.\n\nI feel awful not loving the film more. It&apos;s heart is surely in the right place in bringing a tragic social and political situation to light. I wish it could have moved me to the tears it seemed trying so hard – too hard – to do. None-the-less, it&apos;s good enough that I would urge people to see it and judge for themselves.",

This desolate mansion is then, in the words of one of the members of the Ghostly Trio of Whipstaff, &apos;intruded&apos; by Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and her eccentric father Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a ghost therapist. Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) had hired Dr. Harvey to exorcise the ghosts, including Casper the friendly ghost and his three obnoxious uncles, Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie, aspiring to gain Whipstaff&apos;s &apos;buried gold&apos;.\n\nIntertwining humour, all-time fun and a modern Cinderella story, &apos;Casper&apos; promises to please as a movie which is compelling, hilarious, captivating, heart-warming, witty and above all, truly &apos;fleshtastic&apos;.\n\n&apos;Casper&apos; is recommended for any audience, regardless of age. At the time I am submitting this review I am currently 17, turning 18, but &apos;Casper&apos; still manages to appear endearing and ultimately special. The magic of Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci as well as that of director Brad Silberling, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and other producers weaves between each and every scene to eventually lift us off our feet. Above all, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Casper is my all time favourite character. Truly fantastic. You won&apos;t BOOlieve it until you see it."

I&apos;ll start with the drawbacks.... It&apos;s rather obvious that there was not a &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;-amount of money put into the movie. Maybe more people in some scenes would make them more powerful. But most of these drawbacks are only cosmetic. It&apos;s a great idea to only use the Bible-text. They used the NIV (New International Translation) for this movie, and I believe it must have been a true challenge to make the words come alive so much. But they REALLY do it. I love the way Jesus is showed here. The way he laugh with people, and the way he cries when he speaks of the ones who will not hear the call. It is a Jesus that is close to the people. See it!"

It felt like it could have been made in any time period, it was so simple and relatable. The pacing was actually rather quick, I don&apos;t think there was a single scene over 2 and a half minutes. I didn&apos;t want it to end. Everything felt so tangible, the sights, the sounds. On certain shots the exposure is completely bonkers and I don&apos;t think it was intentional. Like some shots look like complete garbage, grainy, but for the most part the movie was actually gorgeous. Almost every scene was a static shot, and the movie did not need anything more than that. They don&apos;t harp on any one thing too much, and almost every shot has a different, and well thought out design. I didn&apos;t feel like a lot of the shots were repeats, except for where it was deliberate. A lot of beautiful images and scenes in this film. I watched it completely randomly while browsing Mexico Netflix (have no idea how that even happened lol) and it was just a treat. If you&apos;re a fan of film in general and want a nice relaxing watch, with little conflict, and the main character making friends this is the movie for you.",

There is no big surprise, no overly brilliant acting, no twisted story, no well known producer (you all know who I&apos;m talking about..)..\n\nBut it&apos;s a very well made, nice to see movie. Acting is good. Or better, it&apos;s like it should be in any movie. Photography seems sometimes a little bit careless, but it&apos;s OK- it does the trick. Directing is well done.\n\nTo get to this conclusion, I compared that flick to Last Boy Scout, because it&apos;s basically almost the same background. And I have to say: while LBS is supported by the acting of Bruce Willis, this movie is founded on the acting of each actor. They all do well, the evil guy is convincingly evil (flat character maybe, but hey- it&apos;s a popcorn flick, don&apos;t forget!), the effects are pleasing, the story is neat, and the director does his best to put all of this on the screen so you can enjoy the picture.\n\nWhat do you want more?

      "reviewBody": "A review I have put off for far too long....\n\nBluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I&apos;ll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can&apos;t think of another film where you can&apos;t here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.\n\nAside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man&apos;s journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.\n\nThe story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It&apos;s not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.\n\nWhile it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It&apos;s not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.\n\nLast but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick&apos;s genius.\n\nAll in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.\n\nVery highly recommended.",
