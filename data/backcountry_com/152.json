        "reviewBody": "If you have any kind of tubeless tires, you need this tool, even if you do not have liners. Tires that were impossible to remove from the rim will come off in a snap with these pliers. They grip the sidewalls like a steel vise and do not let go. They allow you to pull the tire and bead off the rim shoulder and into the rim bed so the tire can be removed. These literally work flawlessly where Visegrips have failed. The pliers are also helpful with installing tires since you can pinch the beads together into the rim bed while moving them toward the valve to create some slack in the beads.\n\nThe tire levers built into the ends of the handle are, by far, the best in the world. Regular plastic levers of all brands will break in half on a stubborn bead, and steel core levers will scratch and mar the finish on the side of your rims. But these levers work perfectly on even the most obstinate tire bead. The handles are much longer than a regular tire lever and provide much more leverage. Since they are connected at the hinge, they work in unison. Due to their shape and material, they will not damage your rim or cut your rim tape. They&apos;re made from a very hard and stiff plastic that does not flex or break under load.\n\nThe included plastic clips also do a great job of holding the bead on the rim while you leverage the other end of the bead. You just need to jam them between the tire and rim where the bead goes into the rim bed, perpendicular to the rim. Unlike another reviewer, I&apos;ve had no problem whatsoever with the rubber grippers on the pliers coming loose.",

        "reviewBody": "The Essential:  If you&apos;re running air liners in road or cyclocross tires, I think this tool is required to unseat the bead if you value your hands and time.  It can cleanly unseat the bead on one side, then flip and do the other in a few minutes time.  The built in tire levers in the handle are also awesome as they give you a good base area to pry next to with another lever to unseat a tire.\n\nThe Frustrating:  The rubber protector tips on the ends that contact your tire and rim and super loose and just fall off constantly while you&apos;re repositioning the tool (or just moving it at all).  The really are needed to get enough grip on the tire to unseat a stubborn bead, so you need to just keep putting them back on.\n\nI intend to superglue these on before the next time I need to use them, but it feels like a really poor design to have loose fitting high contact parts.\n\nMy experiences with these were using Vittoria Terreno Mix tires on Mercury M1 and American Classic TCX wheels.",

        "reviewBody": "I own a couple pairs of Columbia fleece pants that I love but they no longer make. I was looking for a similar product when I came across these pants from Backcountry. I was really skeptical about buying their in-house name brand but took a gamble on them as they seemed like the only pants in existence that were somewhat similar to the Columbia ones I own. These pants ended up being even better than the ones I was trying to match. Super comfortable, excellent stretch, just the right thickness and warmth, and has a zipper fly. These pants are like if sweatpants and hiking pants had a baby. Exterior material is a woven soft shell material that feels nice and looks durable. There&apos;s plenty of stretch in these pants that you could use them from yoga, to rock climbing, to the gym, and possibly even to the office depending on where you work. I&apos;m a 32 waist in most clothing so I purchased a medium. The fit is good but it&apos;s a bit looser than I prefer so if you like your pants more trim maybe size down to a small. There&apos;s plenty of stretch in the waist to allow for adjustment with the built in cord to tie them. The pants fit loose on me but not to the point I feel like they will slowly fall down when I have things in my pocket. If you want a comfortable pair of pants for cooler weather activities these are pretty great. Thank you back country! I bought 2 of the 3 colors and am really wanting to get the green color as well.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been a boater since 1996 and this is by far the best PFD I have ever had.  The clamshell pocket is ample in size and by design very easy to access.  The profile allows for unimpeded movement while delivering 16.4 pounds of floatation.  The placement of the straps allows for a fit that feels as comfortable as it secure.  I especially appreciate the design of the shoulder strap adjustments that make it easy to adjust from the lower front of the pfd rather than the awkward top of the strap standard. The build quality of this vest is industry unmatched IMHO. Thanks Astral!",

I’m an Instructor and teach safety in my classes so often play the rescue victim so know how effective it is when in the water and out of your boat. I also serve as a safety boat for paddling events so have towed a number of Kayaks, Canoes and SUPs for exhausted or injured paddlers as it performs well. I enjoy sea kayaking and surfski paddling so paddle often in rough conditions and confident the Green Jacket adds additional safety. It has plenty of flotation and appreciate the extra protection it gives my rib cage. I did some open water rescue training on Lake Superior in windy conditions there was never a problem with the Green Jacket it stayed secure and in place. I recently purchased a second one as we spend the winter paddling season in Texas so want to always have one handy.",

Yet, the front clamshell stay’s slightly away from my body, even when its separate straps are pulled down tight, making it feel roomy and freeing. And the cut up top leaves plenty of room for every movement. It’s really a brilliant, innovative design. \n\nThe small, side gear pockets and the large front storage pocket (with really smart and convenient sun pockets) is also definitely a huge plus!",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this about a year ago specifically because I liked the fit of the green jacket but wanted the hydration bladder as well as a side entry.\n\nThough the hydration bladder (not included) takes some practice getting the loops connected so it hangs properly, I’ve never had a problem with it “falling out” while I’m wearing it even when I’m swimming class III/IV rapids. That just sounds like user error. It does fall out once you take the jacket off though, which is annoying. I think the ability to access to water outside of my spray skirt highly overcomes that annoyance though. My only gripe is that the tube doesn’t fully secure to my shoulder strap and so I need to tuck it into my hand sleeve and tighten the sleeve down when I’m not using it. The mag clip that comes with the bladder does not fit the connections on the shoulder strap.\n\nWhen the bladder is full, you have a snug fit so if you’re right on the edge of sizing, I would suggest sizing up if you plan to use the bladder.\n\nI would also like to see newer models of the blue in the cool custom designs that they make the green in each year.\n\nFix the should strap attachment point for the tube, make sure the bladder doesn’t fall off when you toss it in your gear bag, include some cool designs and I will totally purchase again when mine wears out.",

        "reviewBody": "Yes, I am going to be a bit harsh on this review. I would give this pfd five stars if it had an adequate a hydration option.  Regrettably it does not.  It meets all my other needs as a sea kayaker and instructor, but one. I find this to be a major failure. I have been using either the older Astral Sea Wolf or my newer Blue Jacket as my PFD of choice for the last ten years, but I have always had to jerry-rig my on water hydration system.  Astral claims the BlueJacket is compatible with the Camelbak Crux 1.5 L H2O bladder, but I have yet to find a kayaker that uses the Crux with the BlueJacket.  I just purchased said bladder to give it a try.  It really does not work. Didn&apos;t anyone test this out? You might be able to mount the Crux inside the BlueJacket, but you will not want to wear it for any length of time. It&apos;s difficult at best to hang the Crux off of the two recessed web straps in the BlueJacket. They are located way-up and behind the pfd‚Äôs mesh back panel, but it is possible with patience and dexterity. What I cannot tolerate is the large hard plastic of lid of the Crux jammed against my spinal column. This set-up is not tolerable just walking around the house.  I cannot image trying to paddle while wearing it. It‚Äôs back to a jerry-rig.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is without a doubt the most comfortable pack that I&apos;ve used! I chose this pack because it&apos;s light, has enough space for all the gear to do multi-day backcountry climbing, and is women specific, and it did not disappoint. Went on a 4 day climbing trip and experienced no discomfort when wearing the pack (my load probably weighed 40ish pounds). I&apos;m excited to test it out with even more weight in the future. The material seems really durable and I was impressed at how much stuff I could fit in the convenient hip pockets. It was great to have snacks and a light jacket at the ready! The only features I really would love to have added are a bottle pocket and front stash pocket. I did end up adding a bottle holder to the shoulder strap which was really nice as I&apos;m not really into bladders. Also, as a side note, I used this pack for cragging and it does take a little extra effort to get the rope bag in there because it&apos;s a little narrow, but not a big deal. I&apos;m really happy with this pack and cannot recommend it enough!",

And at 50l its perfect for most shorter multi-day trips, or long distance hikes where re-stocking is possible every few days. \nI also love the front opening, while keeping the features such as two compartments. Overall I&apos;m really happy with the pack.",

        "reviewBody": "On a recent trip my MSR Reactor stove shut down; completely stopped working. When you are on an extended trip this is a big deal. I was frustrated, mad and disappointed in MSR. But in a world of sophisticated high-performance outdoor equipment things happen. Such incidents are unfortunate and leaves user no choice but to find a work-around when they do happen. Afterwards, with an expensive piece of unusable equipment in hand, the question becomes, will the company who sold me this product stand behind it? I buy MSR products because they have a reputation for doing just that. In this case MSR replaced not only the stove but, because the unit was out of stock, they went the extra step of replacing the entire system. In my experience paying a bit more for quality is never a mistake",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this product in Korea and am extremely satisfied with its performance. It&apos;s incredibly lightweight, durable, and boils water rapidly. During my hiking trips in Korea, all of my cousins were impressed by its capabilities. This product is like magic, enabling me to prepare kimchi stew or budae stew within 5 minutes, even in the cold mountains. Korean culture includes enjoying grilled bbq even in remote locations, so in my opinion having a lightweight and portable grill that complements the reactor would be fantastic. Thank you for consistently producing outstanding products.",

No field repair was possible. When I called MSR I was told &quot;this happens sometimes&quot; and was reminded that I could always soak my food and eat it cold. I had to purchase a new cooking unit. I continue to use the system because it works so well but will never again take it on an extended trip without a backup system.",

This is great when melting snow because you can put the canister in water and keep the fuel from freezing. The 1.0L needs a similar (smaller) nesting bowl! I would love it if MSR made a Deep Dish cup/bowl that nested on the bottom in the same way as the 1.7L does. Please, MSR, if you’re listening, make a Deep Dish cup/bowl for the 1.0L Reactor!",

However these pants run large, I am a 29&quot; waist and usually always TTS Medium in any brand, however with these I use up the entire belt and could still do with more fabric to further tighten them. Because of this they look baggy as well. I would size down if you are right on the edge of a size difference.",

I wore them for 8 days straight while backpacking the Wonderland Trail around Mt. Rainier and they were perfect.  So nice to be able to easily switch between shorts and pants during a long trip! The zips on the ankles also make it so easy to take one and off over your hiking shoes! Fit was great, maybe a little loose for my usual size but I didn&apos;t mind the extra room.",

        "reviewBody": "Overall, the Gregory Jade is a durable pack. But, after hiking the 350-mile Pinhoti Trail, I&apos;m going to look for a lighter pack. A couple of days before I left, the grap strap broke and I had to take it to a shoe repair shop to get it sewn back on. Then, while I was on trail, the chest strap broke off of the sliding ridge and I had to use paracord to tie it to the shoulder strap. And, even after 4 weeks of hiking, my back and shoulders were sore from the 25-ish pound pack weight. It could also benefit from larger hip belt pockets and a much larger back pocket.",

I love that it zips around so that I don&apos;t have to remove everything from my the bag to get the stuff on the bottom. I also really like the bottom zipper as an extra compartment. In my old bag, I had to dangle everything on the outside off of carabiners, so this is nice. It is also very comfortable to wear and adjusts easily. All in all, this is an awesome backpack!",

I understand that poles break, but the design of this requires lots of pressure that causes the aluminum pole to bend over time, eventually leading it to break. Instructions even note to &quot;watch your eyes&quot; when installing the pole due to the high tension. I assume the replacement pole will eventually break as well. \n\nIf you are using this to camp in your backyard this might be an okay option.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve been putting miles in on this liner for probably 6 months now. I wear these under my baggies and have had absolutely zero complaints. From quick after work rides to all day excursions, these are the liners I’m consistently reaching for. \n\nHere’s what I love about them:\n1. Pockets - three pockets in the small of your back to hold phone, wallet, keys. No need for a pack. \n2. Chamois - I’ve yet to meet anyone (and most of us Gearheads have ridden in Giordana’s shorts) who don’t like the Cirro S chamois. Just padded enough but not bulky, antimicrobial, and BREATHABLE.\n3. Materials - great 4 way stretch, less compressive than their road FR-C line, and stays in place. Straps are super comfy, and the laser-cut, hemless bottom cuffs are not noticeable. No silicone leg grippers, but I’ve had no issues with the legs bunching or slipping up even on my scrawny chicken legs. \n\nFit: I’m 6’2”, 145 lbs, built like Gumby, and I wear a medium. Giordana, even though they’re an authentic Italian brand, fit more true to size than similar options from Santini and Castelli, for example. I bounce between medium and large for those brands, but between small and medium for Giordana, Pearl Izumi, etc. They are not that compressive (which I like for mtb), and the studio images for these are a tad misleading in that they’re not quite as sheer of a material as you may think. I’ll even consider riding gravel/road in these if I haven’t done my laundry like a responsible adult. \n\nCare: official recommendation for Giordana shorts is to cold wash right after a ride and hang dry. No need for chamois cream. These things hold up.",

There is no way the 10 would have fit comfortably, while the 12 feels great. The stretch makes them easy to move in. And I appreciate the longer inseam, which feels flattering while preventing the dreaded thigh chafe of shorter shorts.",

I chose this color for the fun eye pop that makes the style stand out.  I love the heel - comfortable and stable. The soles are thick enough to keep you warm and tread is helpful in the wintery terrain so you maintain traction. I did size down from my wedge but I could have gone with the 1/2 size bigger if I needed to. I can sometimes vary between sizes anyway. I needed to wear longer socks to break in the cuff at the top of the ankle- I would expect this though - it is an easy work around.   \nI think I will purchase these in a black and I will not need to own any other casual shoe!",

I just used it for travel for the first time to carry my laptop, cables, travel documents, and glasses. I really really like that it doubles in function, since I also used it as a conventional laptop briefcase for a work meeting in the same trip (so I don&apos;t have to carry more bags than the necessary). The number of pockets is just about right for carrying all essentials. I would highly recommend it.\n\nI only found a couple minor details that I wish were different (none of these deter from the value of the product, although a change in the zippers would be really nice). 1) I would really like it more if the zippers were designed to be lockable (with loops), 2) The backpack connectors are made of a plastic that looks like it could easily break. Time will tell. 3) The backpack sits a little bit high, perhaps a little more room to adjust the straps would be useful.",

The biggest problem to me is the side bottle holder is all mesh material. I put my thermo bottle there. Mesh can be easily damaged with holes over time. The previous version solved this problem by using the same nylon material as the backpack at the bottom of the bottle holder, and mesh material on top to give the flexibility. Very disappointed and decided to return.",

        "reviewBody": "This is my favorite backpack I’ve had. It’s lightweight, easy to get stuff in and out of and the water bottle pockets are actually a decent size! My 40 oz water bottle can fit in them! I really like the strap that helps hold my water bottle in place. My 12.9 in iPad Pro with keyboard case easily fits. I don’t use the removable sleeve as the laptop pocket has decent padding to it and the sleeve just adds bulk. My only complaint is that I wish there was a pocket for smaller items. I think since they have a mesh one on the laptop sleeve, they didn’t put one in the backpack, but I don’t use the sleeve. I had a North Face Recon backpack and I hated it. It was heavy, tipped forward all the time no matter what I had in it and was difficult to get stuff in and out of since the zippers don’t go down far. Sold it and got this one instead!",

        "reviewBody": "First off, I love the look of this new RS Jersey. I have the torpedo grey colorway, and it blends into the black RS S11 Bibs seamlessly and adds a subtle touch of color and style to the top that looks amazing. I&apos;ve worn this jersey on gravel, road, and mtb rides and it has held up great. The durability is what has absolutely blown my mind and makes this jersey stand out to me. Recently, I washed out in a corner on a gravel ride, going about 20 mph, and slid quite a ways. I was wearing the RS S11 jersey and bibs, and both are still fully in tact with no cuts, or even abrasion marks. Every other kit I&apos;ve owned would&apos;ve been shredded to pieces. If you&apos;re looking for a new jersey that looks great, functions exceptionally well, and will stand the test of time (and crashes) this jersey is for you.",

        "reviewBody": "I was able to wear this for the first time on this morning&apos;s ride and was pretty happy with it! Compared to last year&apos;s Equipe RS jersey, the sleeves are the most noticeable change. This jersey seems to have improved in minimizing any excess fabric or wrinkling around the shoulders that I started to notice in the previous version. The arm openings also seem to grip the skin just right so that everything stays put. The fabric itself looks cool and feels sleek.\nThe ride this morning was super humid and warm, but the jersey felt airy and kept me very comfortable.\nPaired with the RS S11 Bibs, it makes a kit that fits my body perfectly without feeling too tight or restrictive, which is exactly how you want cycling clothes to feel.",

You could even bring a ramen packet in the side pocket for lunch. The pass pocket on your wrist is always appreciated, as I cruise through the pass gate, while others are rubbing their chest up and down sensor. The pit zips come in handy for the warm days, as well as the helmet hood for those blustery days. The other day I was on a lift, that was dripping water on me the entire ride, and was protected by the waterproofing. \r\n\r\nSlightly heavier and warmer than my Gore-Tex jacket but the pocket placements remind me so much more of my Marmot Alpinist jacket from the 90&apos;s.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great jacket. As far as I can tell, it&apos;s water proof. The main zipper and left chest pocket zipper are seam coated. There are 7 pockets total. Four pockets have covers. They are the two normal outer side pockets, the right chest pocket and there is a pocket on the left fore arm that has a cover. The chest left pocket next to the logo is seam sealed. There is a inside right chest pocket, all of which are zippered. The last pocket is mesh on the left inside that is like a big pouch that has an elastic edge. Also on each side there are long vent zippers that start almost from the elbow and come up to the arm pit and then down part way of the sides. On the inside lower part of the jacket, is an elastic that goes around to the front zipper, that is designed to keep drafts and snow powder out. It is held to the sides by 2 snaps on each side and on the right side there are two more snaps to be able to make it more snug.  The cuffs have velcro to make them snug on your wrist. On the inside of each sleeves is an elastic material that extends and has a hole you can put you thumb through. Note: the sleeves are long and this is to be able to protect you hand from the elements. On the back of the hood there is a cord to adjust the hood size. Also on the inside bottom of the jacket is a cord to adjust it to keep it snug. This jacket is lined on the inside that also extends into the hood. It is not an insulated jacket. The hood beek has something to give it some stiffness. There is an old saying, you get what you pay for. You certainly are getting quality and comfort plus more.",

I do not shove my feet into my shoes, I use a shoe horn. These are my 4th pair of hokas in my life and I never had problems until now. When exchanged, the new ones do the same thing but I can&apos;t exchange them again. The design is awful not having the cushion connected. I take really good care of my shoes so there is no reason for the cushion to slide down just from basic daily walking. Especially shoes MEANT for walking! These are extremely expensive to be so useless and feel unstable when walking because there is no cushion to help keep it over the heel. There has to be a better design",

I love this type of garment over a mid layer in shoulder season and as lightweight insurance on long rides in case of a chill. Roadie fit so size up from your normal T shirt size unless you wanna look like a middle aged sausage link. I’m  6’2” and 175 lbs. The large was comically snug, and I’m pretty slim. Returned it because I wanted more of a trail fit. If that’s what you’re looking for, I recommend the Fox Ranger. Yeah, it’s heavier, less packable and less breathable, but it’s still plenty light to carry along.",

        "reviewBody": "I first purchased the 9” give-no-go boxer briefs back in 2017 when they were known for being ultra breathable, and even odor resistant - I remember going with them because of the reviews I read/listened to from backpackers that suggested a single pair could be worn for multiple days without odor buildup.  The 5 pairs I ordered in 2017 lived up to that reputation.  They’re fantastic - while I don’t wear them multiple days in a row, I know that I could, even during hard working days, without having to worry about odor buildup.  They remain very breathable to this day.  I decided recently (late 2024) to order more and wear them exclusively, and immediately recognized that the material is different.  After wearing daily for a week, I’ve noticed they’re not even close to as breathable as my older pairs, and after a day of work I know that these newer pairs could not be worn multiple days in a row while preventing odor buildup - likely boils down to a lack of breathability compared to the older models.  Can’t say I recommend the newer version.  I wish they’d switch back to the older ones.",

        "reviewBody": "Over the years since their introduction I’ve probably bought atleast 15 pairs of these. They have been for me years my go to, old reliable workhorse. Comfortable, well designed and durable. But now I have come to the reluctant conclusion that they have gone the way of many great outdoor brands. Submitting to utter profit seeking and declining quality.\r\n\r\nA pair of these that formerly would last 4 years of heavy use barley makes it to two. Stitching fails and comes unraveled within the first few wears. The material pills instantly. The waist band stretches prematurely. The fabric wears threw and forms holes. I still have pairs from the old days to compare, and its quite stark how many corners this company has started to cut. The formely breathable yet durable material has been replaced with thinner, and in every way inferior fabric. Especially in the crotch area, which used to be indestructible and yet the best fenting boxers on the market. Not anymore. This company simply\r\nno longer cares about offering a good product. Only a cheap to make brand name that they can still charge rip-off level prices for.\r\nI just purchased my last pair of these. As its gotten to the point where exofficio underwear is now decidedly inferior to it’s competitors. Oh well. The way things are going this company will likeley be out of business soon anyway. \r\nGood riddance. If you are looking for a comfortable, well made pair of underwear, go elsewhere.",

They are very comfortable and plenty warm enough for the winters here (average lows in the teens, lots of ice, average 3-6&quot; of snow). I don&apos;t do any winter sports but I am out several times a day walking the neighborhood with the dogs. Not everybody shovels their sidewalks so I walk through a lot of snow. These boots have great traction and they keep my feet warm without any issues.\n\nI normally wear an 8.5 in shoes so that&apos;s what I initially ordered. But they were pretty snug and hard to get on and off. So I returned them and ordered a 9 and those were much better. Also, I recommend wearing tall socks that will stay up. I was shoveling with these the other week and my socks ended up falling down my leg below the boot line. I ended up with some red abrasions where the boot cuffs were rubbing against my bare legs. Just something to keep in mind. The wool cuff is generally comfortable but it&apos;ll give you a friction burn on bare skin.",

I&apos;ve been wearing Sorel Caribou&apos;s as my go-to boot for the last decade or so. My biggest issue with them for activities was just how wide/sloppy they are. I love being able to slip them on to shovel the driveway, but less so when i&apos;m brapping/riding technical terrain. And snowboard boots are just too stiff.  I haven&apos;t used these yet on the sled/surfer, but I can already tell the fit and sole stiffness is doing to be PERFECT. they were easy enough to get into, but with a firm fit once zipped and laced up. The liner seem comparable to the Caribou so I have no concerns about warmth. \nI&apos;m really really excited to get out into some pow with these! I&apos;ll try to update this review mid-season. \n\nI wear an 8 in Vans shoes and most other footwear. Got the 8 in these and the fit is consistent.

        "reviewBody": "I purchased a pair of these over a year ago and put roughly 6,000 plus miles on them with no flats.  I&apos;m in Northwest Arkansas which has a fantastic paved trail system.  The trails have areas where fine, very sharp flint rock is deposited, usually following a rain shower.  The roads are OK, but the bike lanes typically are not cleared allowing a lot of road debris to accumulate.  \n\nI was a devout user of Continental GP4000 IIs, but was constantly getting small, pinhole punctures from the tiny shards of flint.  This was especially true of the back wheel where most of the weight is.  After installing the Gator Hardshell I have found flint stuck in the tread, but have yet to have a flat.  My latest find was a 4mm shard stuck straight into the tread. \n\nThere are those who will say &quot;well just get tubeless tires and you won&apos;t have to worry about it&quot;.  I&apos;ve ridden on tubeless tires on a mountain bike and had a puncture that was troublesome to fix.  I also tried to help someone that had a flat tubeless tire that ended up calling someone to pick them up because the tire wouldn&apos;t hold air.  That said, I think I&apos;ll stick with what&apos;s worked best for me and these tires.",

        "reviewBody": "I originally ordered this shoe in a size 10.5 which is what I typically wear.  When they arrived and I put them on, I could immediately tell that they were too small.  I did live chat with Backcountry who made the exchange process very easy and I got size 11.5 instead.  When these came in they felt tighter than I expected but still pretty good.  I did a few warm up runs and then ran a 25k in them.  By the end of that run my feet had swelled a bit, so the shoes definitely felt too small.  Since then, I&apos;ve noticed that even with the non-swelled foot, the shoes are slightly too small, almost to the point of discomfort.  \r\n\r\nIf I could do it again, I would order a size 12 (which is 1.5 sizes up from normal).  Otherwise, I like these shoes.  My favorite part is the grippy Vibram sole.  I also like the support of the heel cup, which seems to custom mold around your heel.  The shoelace cover is so minor that most people miss it, but very helpful to protect from snags when you trail run.  Overall I&apos;m pretty happy with these shoes outside of the sizing issue.",

They feel like they are built for the mountains-- rugged uppers, good protection under foot, and killer soles. The precise fit has worked great for technical runs with any sense of scrambling, and I&apos;ve been comfortable into low 5th class terrain. I was between sizes and sized down for a tighter fit, and am happy I did so. Can&apos;t recommend these enough for technical terrain and short/moderate distance",

They are super comfortable, responsive, light, grip is insanely good on rocks and all surfaces. They fit me perfectly and are true to size for me, especially when I break them in after around 100 km they widen a bit in the front and wrap my foot nicely, I know for a lot of people it runs very small, I don&apos;t have that experience. I swap the laces, as these don&apos;t tighten the shoe as well, because they are too soft and stretchy and are easy to snap. Otherwise the shoe is very durable and high quality, first pair hold up to 1200 km with a lot of use in high alpine, no delamination of material, the mesh is holding up to all the rocks, even the sole is very durable despite it&apos;s gripiness. Now on my second pair after 350 kilometeres it looks like it will hold up a lot as well.",

The description of the gloves doesn&apos;t mention this, but I think it is a very important feature that makes them not true mittens and that should be mentioned in the description.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been mountain running and scrambling in Boulder&apos;s Flatirons using the Mutants for several years now. Recently I decided to give the Kaptivas a try as a lower-profile alternative. I find that they feel much lighter and more minimal, which encourages speed, but they&apos;re significantly less cushioned, requiring more precise foot placement and providing a lot of ground feel. In terms of scrambling, they seem quite similar, with a slightly better lug pattern (shorter lugs) and the same ultra-grippy material. They also have more of a slender profile, which allows for a little bit higher precision in your footwork. The forefoot is slightly less stiff right out of the box, which could be an upside (for smearing) or a downside (for what little edging these sorts of shoes can do).\n\nI like the sock-style upper, and much prefer it to La Sportiva&apos;s thin tongues on similar shoes like the Bushido II. I haven&apos;t experienced any discomfort, and the tongue can&apos;t migrate around during a run like I&apos;ve experienced with the Bushidos.\n\nThe final note is that the toebox allows a surprising amount of toe splay considering how slender the shoes are overall. That&apos;s a pleasant surprise.\n\nFor me, these are short-distance mountain shoes for runs where I know I&apos;ll be scrambling. For a more straight-forward trail run or on a longer outing, I&apos;m going with my Karacals for the added cushioning and comfort.",

I&apos;ve been running in the Bushidos for a long time but wanted a rock plate for some of the fast rocky downhill races I do, figured I would try these!\n\nAfter reading the reviews this shoe seemed perfect for me! I either got a bad batch or the wrong shoe... \n\nThe heel cup is pretty poor for my heel - a lot of friction and blisters. Blisters. Tried a different orthotic and it made it worse. When I&apos;m running down uneven rocks I&apos;ve felt my heel almost come out the side at times when my forefoot and balance feel in control.. felt weird. All the pictures in the reviews show a different shoe with a better looking heel cup, similar looking to my bushidos but look different from the Kaptivas I bought.\n\n\nThe lace system is either too tight or too loose, which is super frustrating. Plus it already started to rip! Only after 4 weeks and maybe 50 miles on them. \n\nI also had issues with my feet cramping for the first 3 weeks when wearing these shoes. I didn&apos;t notice the cramping this week but my blisters were so painful I may not have felt it. \n\nOverall, these shoes are a huge disappointment for me. After one month they are already looking ripped and worn. I&apos;m going to try and get a return or warranty for them because of the rips but am buying the Bushidos for my race in September because the Kaptivas are a no go for my foot. \n\nI&apos;ll upload photos if it let&apos;s me. Proper fit overall though. Unsure why these do not get along with my feet when they seem similar to the Bushidos.",

As far as packing it through the airports, it was easy to put on and take off (I&apos;m 76 with bad shoulders), rests comfortably on my back and not a strain to carry through the airport. Has lots of room plus very accessible side pocket for may laptop and some magazines and another smaller outside pocket for small items. Very pleased with this pack, and received compliments from others in our group.",

As I live in Hawai’i and enjoy traveling to the mainland and foreign countries such as Japan, Italy, etc. I wanted a big enough backpack that can accommodate jackets, etc. for colder weather so I can wear them as soon as I arrive at my destinations. This backpack has multiple slots and pockets for my iPad, iPhone, chargers, keys, passport, pen, etc. I can easily get them out. I have four other backpacks, but this one is so far the best one for my short and long trips. Would highly recommend it for avid travelers.",

This backpack meets both the carry-on requirements of both domestic and international overhead bin measurements . It fits nicely on the overhead compartments of Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines on my recent trip to Scotland. It packs nicely with ample room for my clothes for 9 days. You can hold a lot of stuff in this backpack and it’s very comfortable to carry as a backpack. I got the Nutria color and love the waxy look!",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased the black/charcoal version. This is a great carry on pack that is versatile and not to much to manage once you reach your destination.  The bag has room and depending on how bulky your items are can carry quite a bit but be cautious not to overpack as it will not fit without extreme force in smaller planes overhead.  The ONLY thing I would cautious buyers is the look of the bag after use and when you receive it.  The texture THULE mentions of having a weathered look if factual and when you use it will get more &quot;weathered&quot;.  The look is not bad just looks like you have used the bag for multiple trips after your first one.  If you expect the bag to have a &quot;fresh&quot; look all the time this is not the bag for you.  Durability is excellent, definitely recommend it.",

        "reviewBody": "Some things I would like to see in the next update…\r\n\r\n1. Load lifter straps above each shoulder strap to redistribute the weight closer to the body.\r\n\r\n2. Side compression straps to compress the pack when not fully loaded, and to reduce the outer dimensions when you’re trying to fit the bag in an overhead compartment or other tight space. When this thing is fully loaded, it has a tendency to look like a turtle shell on your back; compression straps would help with this.\r\n\r\n3. Slightly more interior volume. 42-45L would be perfect for one-bag travel\r\n\r\n4. Include the hip belt pack instead of forcing people to purchase it separately. It’s an ingenious idea, but it should already be included. A travel pack this size NEEDS a hip belt in order to redistribute weight off the back and shoulders and on to the hips.",

It is easier to use than I expected as I was concerned it would kind of leak out the sides when using my much thinner coffee hydro flask. It’s also super easy to clean. No issue with just a quick rinse. Love it. The spouse even confiscated from the gear closet and stores it in the kitchen for when she doesn’t want to make a whole pot of coffee.",

Works well and is lightweight making it easier to keep things in my bag organized and where I want them in my bag. I&apos;ve only used it 3 times so far but i don&apos;t see any issues of wear and tear for many years as i don&apos;t usually beat up a compression sack. I don&apos;t store my quilt in it when it&apos;s not being used, I just hang it on the hanger with the quilt.",

Regular was a couple inches long for my 5’4” height, even  with hiking boots on unless you want them to graze the ground with boots. Also – got the camel brown and is indeed brown and not more coral like the picture showed to me.",

I’ve been wearing Columbia pants for several years as they fit so well and never look like athletic wear. But these All Season Bootcut Pants are the BEST yet! The size medium in navy blue are so comfortable and look great with a tee shirt as well as with a dressier blouse or sweater creating such versatility to any wardrobe. The fit, the length, the feel of the fabric, and the overall look are amazing! I highly recommend these pants!",

This pair is a full half size smaller if not more.  One other side note is that these clearly had been worn before I bought them.  The other colors are my favorite choice of foot wear.",

When my last pair wore a hole through the sole I ordered my usual size of 42.  When they arrived I threw out the box before trying them on as I expected them to fit just fine.  Wrong! The size 42’s I received are a full inch shorter than all my other 42’s. This must be a factory error.",

I do a lot of trail running and this is ideal as an extra &apos;emergency&apos; layer or for the end of an event or a break to prevent me from cooling off too quickly. I like hiking in the hills and it&apos;s been ideal as a lightweight jacket when I am working hard too - nice design touches, eg the extra articulation for scrambles / reaching high. Seemed expensive but I have never regretted it. I have the hoodless version in orange/black. True to size.",

I have noticed less back pain since running with these although my Achilles tendon has been more sore. They are flatter than my gym shoes I am use to but get the job done and for the backcountry price are a great buy. The colors are fun too. \r\n\r\nI am usually a size 10 and the 10s were way too small. I recommend sizing up.",

But after debating it I decided to get another dropper. I don’t use it that much but when I do it’s nice to know it’s there. Hopefully it lasts a while but I’m happy with it so far.",

        "reviewBody": "We are traveling to Europe next fall for several months. We ordered our new wheeled backpacks now because we wanted to try them out so that we know we made the right decision. We have recently retired, 60+, healthy and will be traveling to multiple locations via train, plane and foot. After multiple reviews of different companies, we both decided on different Osprey products. I chose the Osprey Sojourn 60L Wheeled travel backpack. My husband chose the Osprey Farpoint 65L Wheeled Backpack. We both like our wheeled backpacks for different reasons. Concerning the Sojourn, I love the adjustable straps, the density of the fabric, the zippers that have a loop for safety, the inside straps for compression, mesh pockets and how large it is. The only drawback is it weighs a little more than the Farpoint and does not have enough exterior pockets to throw additional items in such as small purchases, maps etc. You need to open the large interior zipper to do this. The Farpoint, is lighter to carry, has so many more exterior pockets for a simple insert of purchases, maps etc. We understand, this gives easier access, but there are options for locks to be added. The fabric is not as dense and heavy as the Sojourn and is lighter to carry. Filling up both bags is easy and hold about the same amount of items in the large interior space. The wheels on both products are different, but appear heavy duty. If you are looking for a durable rolling suitcase that has multiple straps in the interior of the suitcase with adjustable straps for backpacking, nice rolling wheels, large interior space, the Sojourn is the answer. If you are wanting to save $ but get a great bag with lots of accessible pockets, less weight to carry on your back and also has large interior space, the Farpoint is your answer. Prior to choosing which bag best suits your style of travel, go watch the video on any bag they have available. This made our options of what we both chose easier.",

They hang down loosely so that any little bit of breeze will blow right in. If you&apos;re the sort of person who does not get very cold, then perhaps it will be fine for you. Personally, my ears are very sensitive to the cold, so this was no good. I tied a bit of elastic around the back, connecting the two ear flaps together so they would stay down tightly around my head, which works decently. Overall, I like the hat very much. It just needed a bit of engineering on my part.",

I was thrilled to see this and orders a large right away! Love the colour and the lining is very warm. It was perfect for late fall kayaking on a sunny day! The fact that the brim folds is useful to take up less space when packing.

I&apos;ve been wearing the purple synthetic Hiangles and also the pink leather Hiangles in size 6 and 6.5 for a while now. My street shoe is generally a 6, and I bought these in 6.5 (women sizing) and also have a narrow forefoot and heel. \n\nI&apos;m really glad I took a chance on the TN Pro LV because they have all the minor modifications that I really was looking for in my old shoes. These feel not as stiff and a bit more sensitive than the Hiangles. I could really flex my foot and power through my toes with precision. Heel cup stays on snug and does not cut into my ankles. Right out of the box, they were comfortable, no hotspots and I was able to climb a full session with these. I would buy the TN Pro LV over and over again. \n\nI just hope Backcountry keeps these in stock!",

The set-up took all of 7 minutes. The first 10-minute workout left me assured I will be able to avoid starting from scratch at the start of my 2nd season on 2 wheels. \n\nThe unit isn&apos;t loud, and I&apos;ve spent the first couple of workouts in easier gears, as the resistance is more than enough.",

I have used Stans in the past, but then purchased this because I was using it along with specialized tires and rims so I thought maybe it would be better to use their formula. That was a mistake. So far I have had two punctures while out riding with it and it didn&apos;t seal either of them. In both cases I had to limp home, stopping to put more air in every couple of kilometers which would then slowly bleed out. I then put Stans sealant into one of the tires that the specialized sealant had been unable to seal, and it sealed it quickly and with no problem. I will never use this again.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve used numerous PI gloves in the past. Always the gel type, and always size medium.  These are pretty snug, but still have a great feel and I think will stretch more after more hours.  Really hard to get on though.  I ended up cutting the thread at the seam 1/2 inch and sewing a few stitches to keep it from separating any further. Have found over the years that no padding actually helps prevent numbness, as opposed to the gel palm style. Seems to be made of high quality materials..",

        "reviewBody": "I have owned almost every version of the Pro air gloves Pearl has dropped over the last 6+ years. They, without a doubt, are my favorite gloves. \n\nThis most recent iteration having the synthetic leather palm is a bit of an adjustment since the seams need a ride or two to break in before being as comfortable as the prior versions, but I already notice a difference in durability for the better.  \n\nThe previous versions would only last me 3000-4000 miles before I had to replace them. cleaning glass off tires while riding downtown doesn&apos;t help 😅 ( Bike delivery life on a campus) \n\nHonestly, I didn&apos;t even care about the durability/longevity. I would happily pay full price for a fresh pair 1-2 times a year, as they are simply the best-fitting glove I&apos;ve used.",
