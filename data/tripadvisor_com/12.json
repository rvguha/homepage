Disappointed not to see orcas that day, but nature is unpredictable. We took a zip car from downtown Seattle as 25-30 mins away. Easy parking, comfortable vessel, great lunch and very welcoming and knowledgeable staff, with good on board resources to identify the whales.  Highly recommend this trip. \nTo PSE - I wish the mug for life was a travel mug, so I could share the experience with all."

The boat was clean and comfortable, with great views from both inside and outside. The crew was friendly and shared lots of interesting facts about the animals we saw.  \n\nWe were lucky enough to spot a pod of orcas and a few humpback whales, which was absolutely incredible! We also saw sea lions, porpoises, and even a bald eagle. The scenery of the Puget Sound and the surrounding islands was stunning, making the trip even more special.  \n\nThis tour is perfect for anyone who loves nature or wants to see whales up close. I highly recommend it—it’s a must-do if you’re in Seattle!"

I just wished we got to see more different whales and it would be cool to have the videos of them coming out of the water because they (the minke whales) were fast and it would have been cool to have that as a souvenir! It was also a little hard traveling solo because the seating up on the open decks get filled quickly and most people who had another person with them got to save their spot. There were a bunch of kids running around but I learned to shut them out and stayed in my own peaceful space lol. But it got cooler in the end and people eventually moved back to their assigned seats. I didn’t even sit in my assigned seat the whole time & when I went back to it in the very end, someone was sitting there. \nOverall, I absolutely enjoyed my time and I am glad we stayed out longer because we had to go out farther than usual to find them. I love seeing the birds & the harbor seals too! The tour guide speaker was very knowledgeable and I enjoyed the commentary during the trips and when/where to look. \nI was definitely looking forward to this tour because this was the reason why I booked the flight to Seattle and it was their last tour date of the season and I am so glad I made it! Although it was pricey & I would have paid premium to have the best seats, it somehow amended the tour option I got and maybe it’s because it was only for me. The kids getting a whale toy in the end is also cute that they cater to kids but it’s like paying for a sports event and the kids who know nothing about the sport are the ones getting the souvenir lol. Maybe it would help to borrow someone’s child next time to go with me jk lol. I still highly recommend this tour and I would definitely do this again and again! I will never get tired of watching animals! I also love that they follow the animal welfare guidelines and know that I am not contributing to harming any animals along the way. These animals are fascinating and this was such an amazing opportunity to see some animals & I already can’t wait until the next time."

We were able to encounter a family of 3 orcas, and some sea lions and seals. I really liked that the team of FRS Clipper chased the wildlife for us so we didn't miss the chance to see them. And I also loved all the facts they shared with us regarding these animals. In parallel , seeing those islands from afar was a delight. Highly recommended."

    "description": "Get a unique view of Seattle on a private yacht on Lake Union. This is a great way to see Seattle in a way that a bus or car tour cannot. Trips are customizable based on duration. These trips are 100% private and available for up to 6 people. You will not be mixed and matched with other clients (it will be your group and a USCG licensed captain of the vessel only). Feel free to ask the captain what your options are upon boarding and he will discuss the best way to maximize your trip. Feel free to bring food aboard and you can make it a meal on the water that very few people get the opportunity to enjoy. Again, please note that this service is available for 1-6 guests only per coast guard regulations. While the tour is outside in open air, if you wished to have a mask worn by the captain to help with any concerns related to COVID, they will be happy to wear a mask during the cruise.",

She picked us up in a dilapidated old van that sounds like it's breaking down, the tour involved pointing out the window at trees along the freeway, and there was only one winery stop. Then a trip to the falls where we demanded she take us home. Nope, she refused. Instead drove us around for another hour. Seriously considered calling 911 at one point. Huge waste of money and time."

That is not what we experienced. \nWe were picked up in what felt like the guide’s personal vehicle, a dated Dodge Caravan. We were driven to Chateau Ste Michelle, which was the highlight of the 3.5 hrs we were with Susan, the tour guide. \nWe still had to pay for the wine tasting, which is clear in the booking. We were then driven by other wineries but stopped at none. After some weird parking lot circles nearby the trek began to Snoqualmie Falls. Water and snacks were offered, as highlighted in the tour description, however the water was in plastic cups, not sealed bottles. The snacks were pulled out of a backpack and seemed like they came from the guide’s pantry. They were previously opened bags of pretzels, etc. which felt unsanitary and unsafe to us. We asked to be taken back to Seattle from the falls because we were annoyed and done but the guide still took us through her predetermined route. \nHad all this been communicated clearly in the tour description, and the price adjusted to max $30 per person, we would have no complaints. At this cost and only being taken to one winery, it is absurdly overpriced for what could be a cheaper Uber ride to and from your accommodations in Seattle. Save your money and drive yourself or Uber to the chateau. "

The 4 wines we were brought in our tasting, neither of us cared for, but they didn't seem interested in helping us find wines we did enjoy.  Which both of us thought was odd, as we both drink wine.  We were also told that the day of our booking other wineries were closed, so I don't think they should book the tour if there aren't more options than 1 winery.  \nOn the up side, we were able to stop and pick fresh blackberries along the side of the road, which would not happen if you were in a large group.  We saw some beautiful sights.  \nAll in all, it was average, but probably not worth the price we paid."

Goosebumps ran up and down my arms as I listened to him unfold the lives of these men and their families in gripping detail. \n\nThank you, Richard, for your knowledge and passion!

Don't  even think about acweekend tour if you want to actually move or breathe. Weekdays are even too crowded for me."

A couple of the items were samples that were available to anyone walking by.  The most substantial portion was a turkey sandwich.  I didn't really understand this one.....it came from a bakery so the bread was good but it didn't really strike me as an item related to Seattle.\n\nWe enjoyed the tour and, again, James was great.  We recommend, especially if you've never been to the Market."

    "description": "\"The mountains are calling and I must go.\" ~ John Muir\n\nIf you've ever felt the pull of the mountains or a need to get into nature - we get you. We feel the pull every day which is why we wanted to create an opportunity to share the beauty and experience of nature with you. \n\nWe know that each person is different - perhaps the roar of a waterfall soothes your soul. Or the quiet stillness of the deep forest brings you peace. Or perhaps you love the physical challenge of the trail. \n\nYou traveled to Seattle because you heard stories of it's beauty - of the land and water. We take care to craft the perfect hike that will be the highlight of your trip. Wallace Falls is a delicate balance of the awesome power of water that helped carve the landscape, and the peacefulness of our Washington forests full of ferns and moss. ",

She supplied light breakfast, snacks, lunch, drinks, sunscreen, backpacks, and trekking poles.  The 6 mile hike is definitely moderate but we loved the challenge.  The views of the falls are stunning.  So beautiful! Highly recommend this adventure and this tour company!"

    "description": "Pike Place Market has had a long and scandalous history that includes brothels, coffee shops, Chief Seattle, and mischievous ghosts. Come join me to hear the market's stories, and explore the market.\n\nPike Place Market is the heart of Seattle. The market is nine acres packed with local farmers, artists, wineries, buskers, specialty businesses and fish being thrown. I have extensive experience being a market tour guide and I am a retired chef. My goal is to get my guests familiar with the market layout, vendors, foods and history.",

I love how she wove the interesting history in the wonderful sights and sounds of Pike Place market. Especially interesting was the history of the vendors of the market, how they take care of each other, what the best spots are, more things we are able to do on our own, and how Pike Place was integral in the formation of Seattle itself, along with famous area businesses. Carolyn's knowledge of the vendors was also appreciated - it gave us an \"inside\" to the people and area. She's obviously on great terms with the vendors, and that closeness made it a better experience for all of us. Plus, as a former James Beard award winning chef, she knows food, and gave advice on the best places to grab a bite. Thank you for the fun afternoon!"
