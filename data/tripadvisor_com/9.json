    "description": "Nestled in the heart of Seattle with a clear view of the skyline and Mount Rainier on a clear day, T-Mobile Park makes for one of the most picturesque game day settings anywhere in the MLB. The ballpark’s state-of-the-art retractable roof means you will never be rained out—huge win in the PNW!\n\nAfter breaking their play-off drought in 2022, the Seattle Mariners are an exciting young team on an upward trajectory. That being said, the Mariners are still the only active MLB team to not appear in a World Series. No one can deny the loyalty and hardcore nature of the Mariners support, this is your chance to be a part of the Mariner family and join them on their journey for a World Series title!\n\nThe Pacific North West vibe is unique and authentic in the MLB, away from the flashing lights of New York and LA, you will feel the true heart and essence of baseball. From breathtaking nature and scenery to warm, artisan breweries, a trip to Seattle and T-Mobile Park is a baseball purist’s dream!",

We sat quite high up and behind the batter.- row 15, seat 22 & 22, section 333) - decent view of game.  Unfortunately, one of our seats was broken (big long crack that could catch your skin on leg if not careful). There was no attendant to deal with it.  Would have like to switch seats.  \nWe didn’t like that people kept getting up to leave for concessions, etc as they would block view of game.  \nStrict security policy regarding purses- must be very small ( check their security policy ). I brought a large clear freezer bag to put wallet, bottle of water and some snacks in it).  Didn’t want to purchase a transparent backpack or purse to get thru security."

Tickets were simple to download, not cheap but hey, it was a treat.  Security was a bit annoying, I had to buy a clear bag from a vendor (in the UK security still searches one's own bags, no problem!)\nThe seats we were given were fine, but in fact there were empty better ones nearby so we moved for a better view.\nIt was our first ball game since we lived in Chicago and attended Wrigley Field regularly, since which time T20 cricket has become our fun, action packed, sporting outing of choice, this was tame and slow in comparison but still a lovely way to spend the early evening"

Apparently we are not the first to encounter this.  The attendant referred to it as the Twilight Zone.  We were parked in the South ramp, but coming up the steps from the street to the top level, only the North ramp is visible and we couldn’t see the South ramp where our car was parked at all.  \nWe had the most stressful 1-1/2 hours of our vacation waiting for the police, thinking our medicines and electronics were gone, and trying to figure out how to get back to our hotel.  \nMaybe the “local yocals” knew there were two ramps, but it is seriously inconsiderate to the Mariners guests to have it set up this way.

Spent a lot of time on the history of the market and walking up and down the stairs/ramps.\n\nThere were some older people in the group that kept getting left behind. He’d roll and just expected everyone to keep up.\n\nWe took the tour to sample the food. This is where I’m on the fence. Several of the places have free samples that you could have gotten yourself (dried fruit stand, spice shop). Others didn’t provide anything (o-mart & crumpet shop where we met), and others gave you a huge amount of food - half a pizza slice, 2 Piroshky to split between 3 people. \n\nI’d taken one of the other tours before in the market and I got significantly less sample size, but it included the cheese store and the chowder shop, and provided something everywhere.\n\nIf you want a more in depth tour of the market, this would be the tour for you."

The tour included fascinating historical tidbits about the market's 100+ year history and insider knowledge of the best vendor spots.\n\nChef John's connections with the vendors meant we got special tastings and behind-the-scenes insights you wouldn't get exploring on your own.

Our deckhand has been sailing since before she was walking...loved that aspect :-) The heeling of the boat was intense, and so fun to experience compared to seeing it on TV. My wife and I had a beautiful sunny evening and sunset, and that made all the difference. Would highly recommend to do in the middle of summer when you can almost guarantee a sunny evening."

I checked in an hour early and they told us when to be back and gave us a boarding card. When your number is called you board. \n\nWe got to see the porpoises jumping and the sun setting infont and behind us. We left around 6pm and got back around 8:10pm. There Is a bathroom on board the vessel as well. \n\nByob is a wonderful addition if wanted. Other passengers were great as well as staff. \n\n10/10 reccomend this trip for anyone! Reasonably priced for 2 hours."

We set sail on a perfect early September day, and nothing beats summer on the Seattle waterfront. The excursion was reasonably priced and allowed for spontaneous planning. The crew even let us steer the boat for a short distance, which was a remarkable experience. Plus, unlike many other excursions, this one was BYOB! We brought a delicious picnic and enjoyed some wine. We highly recommend this experience for your Seattle trip!"

However, what made it exceptionally fun, was Chef Noah. His interests, love for the city and food, were all infectious. We had an amazing time and really did not want it to end."

Liz, the owner, was very communicative on changes with the day tour and Sean still did the happy hour, even though others rescheduled and it was just me and my husband. Highly recommend and will do again next time we’re in town!"

The pace of the tour was fantastic where I didn’t feel rushed, and also felt like we spent the perfect amount of time at each place. We went to a lot of hidden gems in an area that doesn’t see a lot of foot traffic on the weekends, and I now know some pretty amazing food and drink places in SLU. Sean is a fantastic tour guide where you immediately feel welcome and comfortable with how personable and kind he is. This is truly an amazing tour, and I truly hope more people get to experience it!"

Cocktails are awesome, food is awesome, and our tour guide, Sean, also is so fun and knowledgeable about food, drinks, and the city of Seattle!! I can’t recommend this tour enough!! I was so consumed with having a good time that I only snapped a couple of photos!"

    "description": "Whidbey Island is the perfect day trip to experience the beauty of western Washington. On your private driving tour from Seattle, you’ll travel through forest, field, and water for unforgettable scenic views, quaint island towns, and iconic Pacific Northwest nature. \n\nYour Whidbey Island tour starts with a drive and ferry ride (time and availability may vary) from Seattle. Once there, we’ll visit charming towns situated high on the island’s coastal bluffs and where you can explore, shop, and grab lunch.\n\nThe island has several natural areas where we can stretch, spot some wildlife, and enjoy incredible views. We can include a tour stop at a historic state park, a picturesque lighthouse, and a farm serving up a specialty of the island, marionberry pie!\n\nYou won’t want to miss Whidbey’s top tour attraction, Deception Pass. Brave the 180-foot-high bridge walkway or enjoy exceptional views from below. After a full day of sightseeing, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride back to Seattle.",

Explore Seattle's historic Lake View and take a journey into the past through an array of stories of true crime and tragedy in the city's early decades. Life was tough in Victorian era Seattle and often ended quite unpleasantly. \n\nLearn how Seattle's pioneer generations survived...or didn't...under the constant cloud of unexpected death and tragedy. Real stories of real people drawn from Seattle history from the 1870's through the early 1900s. \n\nSensational murders, axe wielding killers, shipwrecks, desperate family tragedy, gory accidents...this tour has a bit of everything. \n\n(***Note -this tour takes place in historic Lake View Cemtery in September and October - NOT in Pioneer Square****)",

    "description": "Come join us on a historic tour through Pioneer Square and pair it with one of the best things to do in Seattle: see the city from 35 floors up! \n\nYour Seattle tour starts with a walk through the historic neighborhood, where you’ll easily be able to imagine the city’s early pioneer days with the help of your local tour guide. Top Seattle attractions we’ll pass by include Klondike National Historical Park, Waterfall Garden Park, and the Seattle waterfront. \n\nAs you take in the neighborhood’s charm and architecture, your Seattle guide will narrate the fascinating history of the area, from indigenous settlement to Pacific Northwest pioneer town. Learn the surprising background of the city’s founding, immigrant influence, and the vice that gave this neighborhood a certain reputation. \n\nWe’ll then take our tour above the streets to enjoy incredible 360-degree views of Seattle, the Sound, and the distant mountains from Smith Tower, a stunning building with a fascinating history of its own!",

We were extremely lucky as there were just the two of us on his tour this morning, so we got to take it at our own pace with Sam’s undivided attention…. We came away with so much knowledge of Seattles history… Who knew how quickly it grew! And how many companies grew from humble beginnings!! Sam was very sensitive to include what the growth meant to the indigenous peoples of the region, which we appreciated as it often gets missed from the history books… we ended up oat the top of Smiths Tower, with great views of the area and beyond… Thank you Sam for your recommendations during our flying visit!! \nIf you’re thinking of doing this type of tour, don’t hesitate it’s a couple of hours well spent"

It’s obvious he loves his hometown of Seattle and did a fine job of sharing stores and history and anecdotes with us! We won’t soon forget Skid “Road” and I particularly loved seeing the Raven Skyriver blown glass “carved” sculptures and hearing about the Gold Rush and Native American influences. William definitely helped us understand how and why Seattle grew and bettered itself over the last 175 years. The walkthrough of Smith Tower exhibits, art deco and ornate embellishments and the capstone outside balcony walk around the building’s 35th floor observatory was awesome! What a vantage point of wharf, Mt. Rainier, and the Seattle skyline! Finally we sincerely thank William for so kindly finding some water mid-tour for us unequipped and dehydrating tourists."
