They must have some deep rooted personal reasons for this i guess.\n\nI nearly didn&apos;t watch this film for all of the negative reviews. I would have so missed out on something good.\n\nThe film was excellent! Great plot. Creepy bad guy and a reasonable amount of suspense. I have never read the Jack Reacher books, so cannot compare Cruise to the title character. I imagine that some people might have been disappointed at the lack of huge explosions and transforming robots etc etc, but this was a fine old school action thriller with many new tricks which i haven&apos;t seen before (check the buss stop scene. Classic!). I loved the pacing and the great interaction between players. Sure, some of the one liners seemed a tad forced, but they were not so common. Well done Cruise again.\n\nDo yourselves a favour. Ignore the negative reviewers and give this a go.",

Each gamer gets a textmessage with the message: &apos;&apos;Stay in the building, play the game, and win 1.000.000 euros&apos;&apos;. They stay in this big dark building, not knowing what the game is about. As the film continues the gamers find out that the game is to kill each other, knowing this they find each other and the killing begins. This movie is really the worst Dutchhorror movie ever.

      "reviewBody": "With a title like &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot;, I certainly was expecting a lot worse. However, this film is actually quite clever, suspenseful and worth seeing.\n\nThis film begins VERY strangely. The voice of Paul Frees (who provided the voice of Boris on &quot;The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; and the Haunted Mansion at Disney) announces that there is a demonic curse embedded within the film and he is going to neutralize it with an incantation that is made up of a lot of words for the Devil! Following this, the film begins. The story concerns Professor Taylor (Peter Wyngarde)--a successful professor at a small medical college. One day by chance, he finds some voodoo-like charms hiding around his home. It seems that his wife is a practitioner of some sort of dark art. When he confronts her, she insists the magic has contributed to his career success AND is protecting them from those who wish him harm. Not surprisingly, since he&apos;s a man of science he gathers up all her mumbo-jumbo and burns it...and then his life begins falling apart. Apparently someone IS trying to do him harm and without his charms, his and his wife&apos;s lives are at stake. But who and why?! \n\nAside from one brief scene involving a stuffed bird that is clearly suspended by a wire, the film is very intelligently made. The story is constructed well, is genuinely menacing and is quite enjoyable. And, although the bird is done poorly, just a moment later they make a hawk APPEAR very large and menacing in a very convincing manner. Well worth seeing--nearly earning an 8.",

I really recommend this film for Japanese Horror movie fans and weird movie fans like Eraserhead and stuff that plays with your mind, the movie is a little slow and has no start nor ending to the story, actually the ending is kind of stupid but the whole thing works. Check it out.Ill give it a good 9 out of 10 on Scare factor on J-Horror movies."

      "reviewBody": "A daft, but entertainingly modest low-budget late 70s haunted house variation with horror comic lashings (intentional or not) in what becomes a traditional battle between good vs. evil. Nothing surprises, as no cliché is left untouched, but director Gus Trikonis&apos; able execution is quite well done for what it is. Some creepy or outrageous moments and there&apos;s a solid cast led by the ever-reliable Richard Crenna, as he plays a psychologist along with his wife (a doctor) buy an abandon mansion (which does have something of a gloomy past) to hopefully restore to use as a clinic. So some friends and students of his go there to help fix it up, but unknowingly to them a devastating satanic force is unleashed and they find themselves trapped inside trying to survive.\n\nThe raw atmospheric make-up emit&apos;s a dominating presence, from the grand vast secluded mansion to the eerily placed music score, imaginative camera placement and cue in the cackling evil laughter of the evil entity. It constructs an ominously nightmarish strangle-hold, as it grows claustrophobic but at the same time the whirlwind becomes a random schlock-fest with its climax being the tip of it. It&apos;s not as unnerving as it could have been and the ending it feebly done. The story dynamics are old-hat (a stormy night) and it&apos;s slow to get going with some plodding opening dialogues, but soon that&apos;s made way for impulsively staged deaths / encounters --- consisting of spirit manifestations, possessions, fires, self-mutilation and bodies being thrown about. When these strange occurrences transpire, it&apos;s even mentioned for no one to go anywhere on their own, but do they listen of course not. The dedicated cast also features lively performances by Andrew Prine, Joanna Pettet, Cassie Yates and a memorable sequence with Victor Buono.",

Sutherland&apos;s depiction as the Warden &quot;Drumgroole&quot; also was excellent. As always, Stallone seems to epitomize struggle in movies very well. In the movie Stallone is a convict just trying to ride his time out, but the warden makes it very hard on him. John Amos also depicts the caring but hard as nails Prison guard &quot;Micon&quot; very well. In my opinion Lock Up is a Top Level Stallone film, and didn&apos;t get nearly the credit it deserved. I certainly would recommend this film. One word that can describe this film would be &quot;EMOTIONAL&quot; If you like a tough, gritty prison movie, then you will certainly like Lockup."

The guy is pure sleaze, like a Yakuza boss. It is funny to think how it is the same actor, because we never doubt him.\n\nThis contrast of danger with innocence is Somai&apos;s best theme. Youth exist in an island shielded from the worst of things. At the start we cannot anticipate she is an immature 17-yesr old girl. She&apos;s so glamerous and composed, she rehearsed her line for the cameras, told by adults what to say, who to be.\n\nThe film then sets out to deconstruct the forces creating the facade.\n\nYou realize it is not death that took her youth from her but these adult world bureacracies.\n\nHer teenage job in fast food, a place she wasn&apos;t allowed to work growing up. Who will be so excited to work such places?\n\nThere is constantly a heartbreak along its edges it never indulges that we always feel. It can fall there any time, and would earn it. Yet she is all smiles. She never pushes back too hard. She never goes into self-pity. All things she could.\n\nSo it makes me think of why the cricket is so playful. I realized he does not offer this to just anyone who dies, but that he feels horrible for her. All her excitement, energy, enthusiasm, and her life ahead. So he entertains her and plays along. He lets her decide at every point.\n\nThe world broke its rules to protect its kids so death will break its rules too.\n\nSuddenly it is playing two movies at once, the tragedy as well as her getting her youth out of her system. Occasionally it dips into both places where the film achieves its power.",

This is the best movie out of the olsen twins collection and i would recommend you see it giving it a 10/10."

I undertsand that foreign - not French - audiences would avoid this, because of the language and the translation. The duo Lino Ventura and Michel Constantin is terrific, and it is even better the same year 1966 in Jean-Pierre Melville&apos;s LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE. Both actors, former international athletes - wrestling for Ventura and volley-ball for Constantin - those two bring enough testosterone to fill up a tank wagon. And Jean Lefebvre, in one of his many Michalon character performances. Let me explain, in several movies of this kind, Jean Lefebvre was Michalon, but not the same character, with different first names."

      "reviewBody": "I ordered this film last month from the us because i need to have every backwoods horror film in my video store here in Vancouver ( yes there is still a video store left in this city ). It&apos;s a guilty pleasure for me to engage and embrace a new backwoods film regardless if it is horrible. Madness had all the ingredients to be one of the worst backwood horror films of all time ie.. low shoe string budget, horrible acting, Swedish film pretending to be an American film with Swedish actors speaking with a British accent etc etc but instead i watched in awe and suspense one of the best backwoods horror films of the last decade or so. First of all we have an opening that will jade the most jaded horror fanatics. Wow, the start would give Carver&apos;s ball crunching scene a run for its money ( well maybe not ).After this we are introduced to the four leads which end of being stranded in the middle of nowhere and than the mayhem ensues and never lets go. The film has a longer than usual running time for films of this ilk but that didn&apos;t matter at all. The two main antagonists speak only in Swedish and they are creepy as hell especially the one with the screwed up eye. The bandannas on these two freaks of nature only added to their macabre decor. What makes our protagonists so likable in this film is that they seem to go through just as much grisly chaos ala ash ( Bruce Campbell ) from the first two evil dead flicks. Even though the budget of this film might remind you of some other basement fodder flicks like machined and reborn, this one on the other hand wears its low budget like a decayed badge of honor.... Fantastic stuff and not for the squeamish....",

Set in Alaska, Limbo comments incisively on a variety of complex issues concerning the vast state -- the relentless tourism, the scarcity of meaningful employment for the working class, and the careless abuses of irreplaceable natural resources by the wealthy, to name a few.  All of these interesting themes, however, are discarded half-way through in favor of a thought-provoking story of human survival that will undoubtedly light a fire for some while irritating and alienating others.  Sayles has not always connected with me, but I was deeply moved by Limbo (especially the rich characterizations provided by Martinez, Mastrantonio, and Sayles regular Strathairn) -- and I absolutely loved the gutsy ending, which continues to occupy my thoughts."

This movie takes you to the underground world, where the chaos bellow the calm surface is uncovered. It is in Spanish mixed in with several dialects and all with subtitles. The movies themes are loyalty, adventure and what exactly will you do when you life is on the line.

      "reviewBody": "Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone&apos;s &quot;World Trade Center&quot; - I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass&apos; &quot;United 93.&quot; Greengrass&apos; film was lean, stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply, it told what happened that horrible day on the plane - though he used some license - and didn&apos;t wallow in needless sentimentality.\n\nStone, on the other hand and rather surprisingly, seems to have gone out of his way to make something that would be so palatable and inoffensive that it would turn out rather bland, above anything else.\n\nThe 45 minutes of &quot;World Trade Center&quot; are terrific. After offering us quick glimpses into the lives of Port Authority cops John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), Andrea Berloff&apos;s script gets us right into the attacks on the Twin Towers.\n\nThe crumbling of the towers, which still is incredibly difficult to watch, let alone fathom, is handled with taste, but also is awfully gripping. We get a real sense of the terror and panic and then Stone gets the claustrophobic atmosphere right. With close-ups of Pena and Cage amidst the ruins, he gets us so close, we can almost taste the rubble and concrete dust.\n\nBut that&apos;s the last time we really see or feel any sense of genuine, gripping storytelling in this film. I realize criticizing a film about 9/11, especially one that displays its American stars and stripes so blatantly, is tantamount to treason these days. After all, as this administration and its minions love to point out, if you disagree with them, you&apos;re not only unpatriotic, but also an appeaser of the villains. It&apos;s poppycock, of course. Dissent is undoubtedly American, but these chaps so love draping themselves in the flag that jingoism overwhelms all reason. Why bother with rational thought when you can scare people?\n\nWhat struck me while watching the film is realizing how much goodwill was channeled toward the United States after the attacks and what&apos;s ultimately sad is how this president took all that goodwill and squandered it by launching an utterly pointless war in Iraq. We could have done so much good in the world, instead of now being one of the most hated nations in the world. And Bush has now turned 9/11 into a political slogan for political (and personal) gain.\n\nThe problem with Stone&apos;s film isn&apos;t so much the story, but how Berloff chose to tell it. According to Berloff, cops, rescue workers, even family members tend to enjoy speaking in exposition. There are moments that surely someone of Stone&apos;s calibre should have realized needed to be rewritten because the dialogue seems mediocre at best.\n\nWhere the film suffers is when the story cuts between the two trapped men and their families, especially their wives. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and the always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno never get much to do with their sorely underwritten roles. It&apos;s a true testament to Gyllenhaal&apos;s talent that she turns a rather sour role into a passionate, moving performance. Poor Bello, on the other hand, isn&apos;t that fortunate. She&apos;s relegated to spending more time than she should weeping.\n\nThe trouble with these scenes is not that Berloff tries to wring some emotion out of them, but that they come off as unabashedly sentimental. And the emotions are entirely unearned.\n\nPena proves, just as he did in &quot;Crash&quot; (2005), that he&apos;s able to be something special on screen. His character is far more engaging than Cage&apos;s; Pena&apos;s emotions come off without any artifice.\n\nI can&apos;t help but feel that &quot;World Trade Center&quot; could have been the gut-wrenching experience Stone intended it to be had he and Berloff approached the story much in the way Greengrass did &quot;United 93.&quot; Stone&apos;s movie is far from lean. It&apos;s padded with needless sentimentality and moments that just try so hard to earn some emotion, any emotion, that they come off as utterly false. And that&apos;s unfair to the people whose story is being chronicled here.\n\nWatching Cage and Pena trapped should be gripping stuff. But even their dialogue is reduced to exposition. And when Berloff finally leaves the two men and their families, we get Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man so moved by what he saw that he came down to the Twin Towers and proved to be McLoughlin and Jimeno&apos;s miracle. We all know Karnes is a real person, but I very much doubt that he speaks in bumper stickers. But that&apos;s exactly what Berloff has him do.\n\nThe first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing. The rest is rather tepid. And unbelievably forced. Who knew that Oliver Stone, of all people, would resort to formulaic storytelling. Perhaps he&apos;s been so stung by conspiracy accusations and was so keen on appeasing his critics and forgetting the execrable &quot;Alexander&quot; (2004) that he opted to make the kind of movie Ron Howard would make. That&apos;s not a compliment.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a truly wonderful film from the guru of directing, Mr Steven Spielberg. This great director has suffered much criticism throughout his career. He was slammed by a lot of the press for &apos;never really growing up&apos; and it took SCHINDLER&apos;S LIST to quiten these critics. However almost ten years before his remarkable account of the Holocaust Spielberg directed this gem.\n\nIt is the moving tale of a young black girl born into a male-dominated world, and tells the story of her gradual loss of identity followed by her defiance in reclaiming the life she lost. This was Whoopi Goldberg&apos;s remarkable screen debut that assured her of major stardom, and it is not hard to see why. Her fear towards her husband is frighteningly real, as is her silent rebellious side that ventures outwards in the last section of the film. Danny Glover paints a horrific image of a cruel husband, and still manages to give us a valid reason why he acts the way he does, before a moving conclusion to his character&apos;s development. The part of Sofia is also expertly played by Oprah Winfrey, especially during the Christmas reunion scene when the viewer can&apos;t help but share her pain through to joy. A special treat is an appearance by Laurence Fishburne (then Larry) in a small role.\n\nIt is cinema such as this that proves Steven Spielberg&apos;s genius. You will often forget that it is him you are watching (not least by the lack of another genius, Mr John Williams), but it only adds to this director&apos;s credit that he is so versatile. If anyone passed over this film as a possible blip in Spielberg&apos;s career (as I shamefully did!) watch it now! You will not be disappointed."

      "reviewBody": "From the very start of this film there is an underlying tension. Between the script (And who can write better than Tennesee Williams in this genre) the editing, score and direction, we have the feeling that Fisher is bringing a nasty storm our way. She may not mean to, but she is a selfish and spoiled girl. She meets and falls in love with Jimmy, a working class young man with a deep loyalty to his father, an alcoholic who survived the Spanish American War and his mother, who has been locked up in an asylum.\n\nJimmy&apos;s mix with the rich and disloyal world of Fisher brings about a series of events and though they were foreshadowed, we never knew exactly what was coming.\n\nthe film is filled with terrific performances but none compare to that of Chris Evans, who plays Jimmy. From his authentic Tennnsee accent and the way he handles a filter less cigarette (not bad for a Boston boy) to the things he is able to say with his eyes. He fights his way through the film for what is right; for the dignity of his parents and every word he speaks is free of any sort of &quot;acting techniques&quot;. When he stands in the rain and cries, we are barely able to keep from crying as well.\n\nThis film will be a classic and should have caught the eyes of the Golden Globes, the Accademy and Cannes. The fact that Tenesee Williams didn&apos;t win best original screenplay (he was not even nominated) nor Chris Evans win best actor is a travesty. But Hollywood prefers Chris pumnped up and suited as Captain America. This film (along with London) is proof that this young man is the next generation of brilliance.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; is the story of the kidnapping of Gram Parsons&apos; body by Phil Kaufman, his friend and road manager, to fulfill the country music legend&apos;s wish to be cremated in the California desert. Thanks in large part to terrific performances by Johnny Knoxville (as Kaufman), Christina Applegate, and Michael Shannon, and side splitting cameos by Mary Pat Gleason, Jonathan Slavin, and Clint Culp, writer Jeremy Drysdale and director David Caffrey manage to pull off the rarest of feats  a factually based black comedy that not only succeeds, but triumphs, hilariously yet tastefully.\n\nThe tale begins with Parsons&apos; drug overdose in the cheap motel in Joshua Tree, California. Kaufman dupes the reluctant Larry Osterberg (Shannon), a drug addled, yoga practicing hippie, to drive the latter&apos;s psychedelic hearse to the LA airport to pick up what Osterberg thinks is an empty coffin. The comedic chemistry between these two, as they encounter crisis after crisis trying to snatch the body and bring it back to Joshua Tree, is perfect - reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. Among the obstacles they have to contend with are Parsons&apos; gold digging ex-girlfriend (Applegate), who needs a death certificate to cash in on an informal will leaving her everything, and Parsons&apos; father (Robert Forster), who has flown from New Orleans to pick up the body.\n\nThe movie is not without flaws. The Applegate role is purely fictional, and Parsons&apos; real father died when he was a boy. But these characters add humor to the plot and depth to the characterization of Parsons (like all 70s rock stars, he was considered something of a womanizer), so they can easily be overlooked in the name of artistic license. And, there are some parts of the story that are not credible at all. I doubt that a body could be loaded for transport without a valid death certificate, and I&apos;ve never seen a hotel bathroom that could be locked from the outside. But these are minor cavils.\n\nWhether you&apos;re a Parsons devotee (like me), or have never heard of him (like my father, with whom I watched the film), I can just about guarantee that you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "As someone who grew up on the American trilogy, any international adaptations made me wary. At least then. Now, many years later, as I do an annual triple feature to relive my childhood, other previously unseen versions are welcome. The Mexican incarnation of the Argentine film of the same name, the plot borrows from the Tales of East High book Battle of the Bands.\n\nCristobal is the captain of the soccer team, the Borregos, at High School Mexico (yes, it&apos;s that obvious). His best friends and teammates, Jorge, Juan Carlos and César, have more in common with the T-Birds than the Wildcats. In fact, the filmmakers may have taken some inspirations from Grease and Grease 2, the latter only for the first song in El Desafio, a repetitive &quot;Back to School Again&quot; esque crowd number. Cristobal, being the most popular boy in school, is admired by all but he only has eyes for his neighbor Mariana, who balks at being the resident brain for another year.\n\nMeanwhile, the wealthy Luli plots to steal Cristobal&apos;s attention while being the best. Her brother Fer&apos;s only character trait is to be her put-upon assistant. When the school announces a Battle of the Bands, the students split into groups: Cristobal and the Borregos; Luli and her cronies Pau and Caroline, along with only sane woman Faby; but Mariana has no one to perform with, until Fer, whom she&apos;s tutoring, encourages her to be his duet partner.\n\nBy no means is El Desafio amazing but, let&apos;s be real, neither were the originals. High School Musical was a Disney Channel Original Movie that happened to feature enough catchy music and talented stars to go big. I still love them well into my twenties but its camp value is through the roof. El Desafio doesn&apos;t have much by way of memorable songs (the &quot;Get&apos;cha Head in the Game&quot; expy features extremely unsubtle lyrics along the lines of &quot;I don&apos;t like singing or dancing/I just wanna play soccer&quot; in the middle of a choreographed musical number). But hey, who knows, I might end up adding it to the yearly marathon.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1984, &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; is a coming-of-age beach flick. What occasionally draws me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the oceanic locations and the women. It brings one back in time to the carefree era of his/her coming-of-age years. Thankfully, &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; shoots for something deeper than just a shallow beach flick, which the best ones do, e.g. the original &quot;Gidget&quot; (1959).\n\nThe story takes place in 1963 where 18-year-old Jeffrey (Matt Dillon), a plumber&apos;s son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club on Long Island called the El Flamingo. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blonde and becomes fascinated by a new mentor, a fast-talking businessman and card shark, Phil Brody (Richard Crenna).\n\nBrody convinces Jeffrey that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Jeffry cancels his college plans and moves out of his house it naturally creates friction with his father (Hector Elizondo). Will he go on to become the next generation&apos;s fast-talking businessman/card shark?\n\nAlmost the entire film was shot on location at a Queens&apos; beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Jeffrey&apos;s girlfriend in the story, Carla played by Janet Jones, whose body is so well sculptured she could&apos;ve been Wonder Woman (the movie even jokes about this). Carole Davis also shines as Brody&apos;s brunette daughter, Joyce, a low-key part. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.\n\nThe bottom line is that &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; offers everything you&apos;d want in such a film and more, including an interesting story where you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there&apos;s NO RAUNCH (well, maybe a flash). In addition, the soundtrack includes numerous early 60&apos;s hits like &quot;Runaround Sue,&quot; etc. What&apos;s not to like?\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B+/A-",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s Christmastime in Norway and members of a family and all their relatives near and far are renting a log cabin to celibrate the happiest time of the Christian year.  Family members from Poland are joining them too for this great family reunion.\n\nThe cabin is unexpectedly small and immediately one gets a claustrophobic feeling.  Beds are tiered prison style and there is scarcely room around the communal table.  Men and women and children seem to tumble over each other and a family dog adds to the confusion especially for an asthmatic sufferer.\n\nOnce the liquor starts to flow (it is so cold outside in the crisp snow) tongues are loosened and arguments start.  At last we are beginning to find out who these people are, who is related to this one or that one, what their grudges are and the numerous family problems.  Father it seems is the biggest problem of all. He just keeps drinking. And when he drinks he becomes abusive.\n\nThis is a DOGMA film. Understandably it would be difficult to hold the camera steady amid so much confusion in so little space.  It has a theme similar to the Danish &quot;Festen&quot; also about a family celebration, but &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; is not as good.  I think the characters of &quot;Festen&quot; are more interesting. However, I am glad I watched &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; to the end because it is in the closing scenes that the drama really takes hold.  Father collapses after too much liquor and a bump on the head and is chucked out into the freezing night.  In the morning he he he has vanished. I then begin to feel sorry for the harmless old man.  Family members scream and burst into tears.  What has happened to father?  I think to myself the poor old chap is unconscious under the last snowfall....\n\nA redeeming feature of the film is the scene where the joyful Christmas carollers burst in on the noisy quarrelling families.  It is a truly beautiful and uplifting moment. Another nice scene is the bursting into song by the Polish family.  The songs and music give something special to an otherwise dreary movie.",

And he&apos;s right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It&apos;s a film lover&apos;s dream movie. As with many of Scorsese&apos;s films, it&apos;s an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children&apos;s fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family&apos;s with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone."

      "reviewBody": "THE SINGLE STANDARD (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1929), directed by John S. Robertson, stars the legendary Greta Garbo in another one of many love triangle melodramas most associated with her during her reign on the silver screen. Coming at the tail end of the silent film era, for her third of four film 1929 releases (a busy year for Garbo), THE SINGLE STANDARD ranks one of her finer efforts with a familiar theme. Acquiring the support of John Mack Brown (who later achieved fame as a western movie hero through the 1950s) and Nils Asther as her leading men, each having previously appeared opposite Joan Crawford in OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS (MGM, 1928), the winning combination for this production happens to be that of Garbo and Asther.\n\nThe story opens quite amusingly with its introductory inter-title: &quot;For a number of generations, men have done as they pleased - and women have done as men pleased,&quot; followed by an opening shot of a group of married men coming out of their cars bidding good night to their lady friends, then returning to their prospective spouses as witnessed by débutante, Arden Stuart (Greta Garbo), one of the guests at the social function. Although Mercedes Stuart (Dorothy Sebastian) loves Tommy Hewlitt (John Mack Brown), his interest is on Arden, a modern day woman not only believes in sexual equality for men and women. but prefers living her life honestly. That evening, Arden goes on a moonlight drive with Anthony Kendall (Robert Castle), a family chauffeur. Upon their return, Kendall is immediately dismissed by his employer regardless of Arden assuming the responsibility. In despair, Kendall takes his own life by speeding out the car of the estate and crashing it into a nearby tree. Three months after the scandalous tragedy, Arden, coming out of the rain, enters a museum where she encounters Packy Cannon (Nils Asther), a prizefighter turned artist, during one of his exhibits in an art gallery. Their courtship and travels on his yacht becomes a romantic and happy one until Packy decides he cannot marry Arden until his work is completed. After sailing out on his venture to the Orient, Arden encounters Tommy once more, this time accepting his marriage proposal. During their three year union, the Hewitt&apos;s are blessed with a child (Wally Albright). All goes well until Packy returns to Arden&apos;s life, leading jealous husband and former lover to come to terms fighting for her affection with &quot;coffee and pistols for two.&quot; \n\nOther members of the cast include Lane Chandler (Ding Stuart); Mahlon Hamilton (John Glendenning); Kathryn WIlliams (Mrs. Glendenning); and Zeffie Tilbury (Mrs. Hindley). Those familiar with actor Joel McCrea will easily recognize him as one of the three suitors during the opening sequence.\n\nRegardless of THE SINGLE STANDARD being taken from the novel by Adela Rogers St. John, the plot seems to borrow certain structures from Garbo&apos;s earlier works and recycling those taken from 1927s LOVE (based on &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;) where the Garbo character, with a son she adores, finds herself torn between husband and lover; FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) where two men consider settling their differences for the woman they love by having a duel; or her most recent WILD ORCHIDS (1929), also featuring Nils Asther, where husband (Lewis Stone) schemes on a hunting trip with wife&apos;s lover, hoping for a convenient accident for one of them. Unlike these selected titles, Garbo&apos;s character is pitted between two men of equal age status here instead of middle-aged husband versus young lover. With these mixtures involved, THE SINGLE STANDARD survives on its own merits, resulting to a satisfying story equipped with original music score. Had THE SINGLE STANDARD been produced as a talkie, the locale, being San Francisco, might have been changed somewhere in Europe considering its leading players being of Swedish heritage with spoken accents. Their character names, Arden and Packy, unfitting for their personalities, might have served better for American MGM-types as Norma Shearer or Joan Crawford and John Gilbert or Conrad Nagel.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting to note how the word, &quot;Alone&quot; long associated with Garbo&apos;s image, turns up here. Many credit the line, &quot;I want to be alone&quot; from her 1932 classic, GRAND HOTEL (1932) as her most famous quote. Yet, in THE SINGLE STANDARD, coming three years earlier, includes an amusing sequence where she finds herself annoyed by a masher (Wade Boteler) while walking in the rain. She ends his persistence by telling him, &quot;I&apos;m walking alone because I like to walk alone.&quot; The name of the yacht where Arden and Packy venture alone together is revealed to be &quot;All Alone.&quot; The only thing missing is the Irving Berlin song &quot;All Alone&quot; as its underscore.\n\nDistributed to home video through MGM/UA in the 1990s, THE SINGLE STANDARD, at 72 minutes, turns up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.(***)",

      "name": "a black comedy of manners; stunning performance from Chaplin",
      "reviewBody": "It would be hard to imagine anyone else playing Monsieur Verdoux; Charlie Chaplin was the only one who could pull it off in any form or style or way that wouldn&apos;t make the character as just an unlikeable killer of women. As it&apos;s written on the page the character, if played by someone with less charisma or charm or comic timing, would just be another character actor playing a villain. But Chaplin taking the part is inspired on his part, and it&apos;s a good thing too (and I never thought I&apos;d say this) that he didn&apos;t let Orson Welles direct. With Welles it obviously would have been a visually awesome picture, but would the comedy be the same? Or the emphasis on the social message blending in with the ultimate sanctimonious attitude of the character? It would be interesting to see Welles script, if it exists, but as it stands he&apos;s mostly a footnote in his tale, if a thankful one.\n\nUnder Chaplin&apos;s direction and writing Monsieur Verdoux is timed with finesse and glee and with a repetitive transition of the train going by quickly with Chaplin&apos;s piano key strokes, and it&apos;s often devilish fun to hear how Chaplin&apos;s Verdoux gets around and about (or sometimes not) killing and robbing his victims. And yet, I&apos;m inclined to say that it&apos;s above all else a triumph for Chaplin as an actor, a performer who&apos;s iconic appeal, even past the Tramp character, makes us (or at least me) almost cheer him on or feel awkward or cringing during a scene leading up to a murder, or, as does happen once or twice, not. He knows how to put on an air that&apos;s genuine, even as it&apos;s the most blatant con, and he does it with a gentleman&apos;s manner hiding his desperate-times-call-for-desperate-measures ex-bank clerk. While I wouldn&apos;t go as far as James Agee in calling it the greatest male performance ever, it might just be my favorite Chaplin performance, full of ranging subtleties and over-the-top expressions and just lingering looks of contempt and malaise and sorrow and outright lying and etc that are just a knockout.\n\nMonsier Verdoux is a peculiar character, as his crimes are meant to be for the good of his wife and child who, of course, have no idea of what he&apos;s really doing (in an acidic touch, his wife is also crippled). Is it wrong what he&apos;s doing? In the legal sense, of course. But Chaplin sets up a moral code for this character that makes things trickier, a little warped in thinking. If the woman has lots of wealth stored away- and maybe, as with the one who keeps getting away via wine glass and fishing trip, almost deserving in the perception of the character- why carp? But then there&apos;s the woman who&apos;s just out of prison, her husband&apos;s gone, nothing to her name, and... he just can&apos;t bear to do her in (especially, as should be noted, as a &quot;test&quot; run for another victim). It becomes curious to see her later on, sort of as the not-quite Chaplin heroine of the story, and how saving the right one for Verdoux is what counts, despite forgetting her until she reappears.\n\nSo there&apos;s this twisted logic, but in the set-pieces that Chaplin sets up are some of the finest, most brilliantly timed comic moments of his career, filmed for a dark suspense tinged with a near sweetness that we know and love from him. It&apos;s satire on a level that is no more or less sophisticated than Chaplin&apos;s major silent works, and yet it&apos;s just a little sharper, more pointed at the ills of man in turmoil than a simple psychopath, all in the realm of delightful crimes in the upper class. While the end may seem derivative of the Great Dictator with a speech and message chocked forward like spray-paint on a wall, it&apos;s a mixed reaction one might have; the sanctimonious attitude, of being accepting and pointing the finger back on society, is haunting and obvious and also, importantly, speaks to the nature of the character. Would a man somewhat comfortable in his own mortality face the end any other way?",

First of all let me say this is one hell of a terrifying movie, i think i don&apos;t have to repeat the synopsis (several people already did that before me)...the story doesn&apos;t seem to be very original, we all have seen zombie movies before. But because of the claustrophobic setting this is totally different after all. It&apos;s a brilliant move to let it take place in an apartment building, with limited space. Also the first person way it&apos;s shot (which has done before as well) adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. That and quite few great scares (which you really won&apos;t see coming from a mile away like a lot of (Hollywood) &quot;horror&quot; movies) and the great (and shocking) ending, makes this movies one of the best horror flicks i have ever seen. Literally. And believe me, i have seen a lot of them. Hollywood...watch and learn ! You don&apos;t need gallons of blood and body parts flying around to make a movie that will scare the living hell out of you !",

If they fail, they fail by not going far enough. Trouble is you need the audience to believe in reality and truth, at least for a while, if only to mess with them in new and exciting ways. In his attempt to reconcile illusion and revelation, director Chatchai Yodsaranee walks a wobbly line. Imagine a kidnapping in which both the napper and the kid are victims, each in their own way. The basic plot idea of an unintentional crime is intriguing, but it doesn&apos;t carry for a whole week (in real life) or feature length (in a movie). Despite an interesting twist about half-way into the movie, this one should have been a short. Watsana Chalakorn, in the part of the witch, is overacting, grimacing like she&apos;s in a silent film. Interesting portrayal, by Thanavate Siriwattanagul, of a cold-blooded medical student who believes he can observe without interfering. As it stands, &quot;The 8th Day&quot; is a promising, but immature debut. Cool website though.",

It features Tom Hanks in an early comical movie role and it actually is sort of a shame he doesn&apos;t do movies like this anymore, since he certainly was very talented at it. Not that I mind the movies that he does now days of course but it at the same time is also a waste of his comical talent.\n\nThe movie also tries to feature some more serious elements, that concentrated on what it means to be married. Not that this works out horrible for the movie but it of course is also distracting a bit from what the movie is really truly about; simple immature comedy. Further more there is very little story actually and it simply features on the events during and around a bachelor party.\n\nThe movie is so silly, simplistic and immature that you just can&apos;t help being entertained by it all. No matter how bad and cheesy it all gets, you can&apos;t help laughing at this movie. Some comical moments are just plain great.\n\nA real enjoyable silly &apos;80&apos;s comedy, starring a young Tom Hanks.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "The Lonely Guy is often quite funny but unfortunately sometimes dreadfully dull. Like Jim Abrahams and later Mel Brooks movies, this is classic Neil Simon where he throws rapid-fire jokes at you. Some hit and some miss, but you don&apos;t have to wait long for the next one. The scene where he dines alone in a fancy restaurant was one of the funniest. Somebody else seemed to think so, too, as it was copied almost verbatim for an Australian TV commercial two years later. Imitation must be the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nAs a New Yorker, I liked seeing the city in this movie. It&apos;s a somewhat dirtier but more variegated New York than in movies like &quot;Ghost&quot; or &quot;When Harry Met Sally,&quot; which spent too much time in tony neighborhoods like Tribeca, the Village and Midtown.\n\nUnfortunately, the definitive home video version does not exist and probably never will. The laserdisc is marred by a bad transfer and excessive, very objectionable video and audio noise. This may be the dreaded laser rot in action or just bad production. The DVD is beautiful, with a crisp transfer and no noticeable noise. But its 1.85:1 widescreen presentation is in the form of matting/masking the 1.33:1 Academy Frame, so instead of showing more picture, it actually shows less than the cassette and the laserdisc. The matting makes the &quot;widescreen&quot; frame feel distractingly cramped, with characters&apos; heads continually butting up against the top. One joke in particular suffers badly: When Larry is laying on a bed talking to a woman, he&apos;s bare-chested in his fantasy to imply they&apos;re in bed together. But the widescreen version shows only his head, so the joke is weakened. Too bad a full-frame DVD will probably never be made as this is one of the few times when a full-frame presentation would have been preferable.",

It made you realize that this kind of &quot;drama&quot; - coping with the aftermath of a Vietnam KIA - played out in tens-of-thousands of homes throughout the country during the &apos;60s and &apos;70s. The sum of all that pain and anguish makes me cringe. I served in South Vietnam from the summer of &apos;68 to the summer of &apos;69 in the USMC and I am glad to see this kind of message portrayed in a movie. It keeps alive the suffering endured by family and friends from that time. Maybe that sounds morbid but I think it&apos;s important for the here and now to acknowledge and remember that suffering. We can use it to give us perspective on how fortunate we are to be able to flourish and live to a ripe old age. For me of course it has special meaning. I could have ended my life at 19 and would have missed so much.\n\nBut that&apos;s what happened to so many. A horrible shame.",

      "reviewBody": "Early 2016 I purchased four very low cost DVDs as a speculative purchase. Would they be fun second childhood food or not? One was Mean Girls 2, which I was not expecting much of. However the price was low and I do remember a review that suggested that it was a lot better if one did not expect it to be a true sequel. This is made to very different production values and is much meaner than the original, but that could be the direction rather than the script.\n\nThe others were Die Wilden Kerle 1 to 3. The DVD boxes were fully in German, but the distributor was Buena Vista so I assume that there was likely to be an English language alternate soundtrack, or at least subs. The first feature turned out to be German only, but the other two had English subtitles.\n\nIf I had read the IMDb reviews before purchase I would have avoided these. As is I found both 2 and 3 to be fairly typical of average quality features for kids. Technically weak but interesting none the less. I accept that such stories often get poor IMDb reviews. Personally, I found these imaginative Wilden stories to be a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe second feature involves a feud between a mostly boys sports team and its banker. The story flow is based on a pseudo vampire luring the team&apos;s best player away by careful use of romance, something that the team itself does not have a clue about. A quality story.\n\nThe third feature centres on a feud between the team and someone who left them in the early years, friendship destroyed, a different sort of love being central. All good stuff even though the acting feels weak. A nice extra for me is that this is a transgender story.\n\nI was impelled to get the disk of DWK5 and that is up to the same standard. In this the love theme is the bad guy having a type of love that sucks the victim into eternal chains, eternal death. It also does not get good reviews, but some should be able to get a lot of fun out of these stories, despite that.\n\nIn comparison, Mean Girls 2 felt weak. It also reminded me of Disney stuff such as Camp Rock 1 and 2, but weaker. I can still find entertainment in Mean Girls 2, though.",

      "reviewBody": "**SPOILERS** Kicked of of the faculty of the prestigious Oxford University because of his off-the-wall theories Prof. Timothy Flyte, Peter O&apos;Toole, now writes for the supermarket tabloid Wide World News. You could imagine the surprise he had when one evening he was visited by these two FBI agents Hawtthorne &amp; Wilson, Bo Hopkins &amp; Robert Knepper. \n\nIt seems that Flyte was on to something in his writings of mysterious disappearances all throughout history since the beginning of life on earth. The disappearance of entire civilizations like the Mayans in 610 AD the English colony of Roanoke in the new world in 1590 and even more recently the 3,000 Chinese soldiers who vanished without a trace outside the city on Nanking in December 1939. This thing that was responsible, according to Flyte, for these strange phenomena has struck again and this time in the small town of Snowfield Colorado.\n\nSisters Jennifer &amp; Lisa Pailey, Janna Going &amp; Rose McGowan, traveling to Snowfield, where Jennifer runs a medical clinic, from L.A. they find the town eerily deserted. When the two sisters check into Jennifers home they find her maid Helda dead. Looking from house to house and store to store in Snowfield they find that everyone in town had either died of some mysterious disease or were hacked to death. It wasn&apos;t until the local sheriff Bryce Hammond, Ben Afflect, and his two deputies Stu Wargel &amp; Steve Shanning, Live Schriber &amp; Nicky Katt, came on the scene that they all realized that something out of, or under, this world happened to the people of Snowfield. The only clue that they had was a message scrawled in lipstick on a locked bathroom mirror stating &quot;The Ancient Enemy, Thimothy Flyte&quot;. \n\nEven though the story is a bit hard to follow the film &quot;Phantoms&quot; does have it shocks and thrills with the human race battling this ancient enemy that has resurfaced again to claim it&apos;s share of victims like it did over and over on earth since time immemorial. Living off life on earth these &quot;phantoms&quot; are not only able to wipe out whole towns cities or even civilizations they can even mimic their victims and absorb their minds and memories as well as their flesh and blood. Which makes them almost invincible even in the face of modern scientific and military technology. \n\nThe ending of the movie &quot;Phantoms&quot; was even more far fetched with Prof. Flyte coming up with this chemical component that has to do with cleaning up oil spills that does in the &quot;Ancient Enemy&quot; of all Mankind once and for all, or does it? \n\nThe movie has a very young and teenage-looking Ben Afflect playing not only the town&apos;s sheriff Bryce Hammond but also being a Harvard graduate as well as a former FBI agent who quit because he killed a little boy by accident and never wanted to touch a gun again. You wonder why Bryce would later get a job as a sheriff where he&apos;s obligated to not only carry but very possibly use handguns if he&apos;s so spooked by them?",

The characters were all stereotypes. Some aspects didn&apos;t make sense and some twists were predictable.. The moralistic scenes tended to drag a bit. Finally, the demons and the devil were kind of a let down from a European standpoint; however this movie is from Thailand, so maybe the scariest things the writers could drum up were barbarians.\n\nThis movie did show interesting mythology, and hell is truly a loathsome place to be. The torture was hard to watch, and the boiling oil effects were extra neat. Some parts were truly inspired, such as the scene with the ghoulish children. The fun in this film is the campiness, which is bad because a truly terrifying and nightmarish film on hell has yet to be made, but is good because the film does deliver entertainment. You get the feeling that if the movie was taken seriously it would suck just by how the dramatic scenes are so hammy. Anyway, I thought this film was pretty entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;WINNEBAGO MAN&apos;: Four Stars (Out of Five) \n\nA documentary exploring &apos;viral stardom&apos; (sudden internet fame by accident) focusing on one man, Jack Rebney, and how it&apos;s affected his life. The film is co-written and directed by documentary filmmaker Ben Steinbauer, in his feature film debut. Steinbauer&apos;s past experience has been in the camera department on other films and he&apos;s directed two short films as well. He sets out, with no real plan, to find this man, Rebney, who was made famous by the internet in hopes of finding out who he really is and how he feels about his &apos;youtube&apos; fame. Once he finds him he sort of aimlessly records video of him in an attempt to get him to open up to the camera, desperately hoping there&apos;s a story worth telling.\n\nRebney is a former CBS news broadcaster who quit when he got fed up with what he believes was the decay of the network. He later took a job on an RV commercial for Winnebago and was fired after a video of him circulated to his employers, by angry co-workers, of him constantly becoming frustrated on the shoot and swearing repeatedly in colorful ways. Copied VHS tapes of the video circulated to the public and Rebney became notorious for them, which later made their way onto the internet, specifically youtube, and made Rebney a star infamously known as the &apos;Winnebago Man&apos; and &apos;The Angriest Man in the World.&apos; When Steinbauer finds Rebney he&apos;s calm and living a peaceful life in a secluded mountain home in California. Steinbauer leaves and after some time passes Rebney begins contacting him and admits to putting on a show for him and is actually upset about the youtube video. When the director returns he finds Rebney blind and wanting to leave the world with a better reputation and has a lot to say.\n\nThe film is extremely funny as well as touching, a tearjerker in ways. Jack Rebney is a fascinating and lovable character who is extremely intelligent, honest and full of colorful dialog. When he really has something important to say he&apos;s often cut off by the director though who says no one wants to hear it (I wanted to hear it though and I&apos;m sure others would as well). Steinbauer insists that he needs to open up more and talk about himself when in fact anything he has to say is interesting and entertaining. The film works despite it&apos;s flaws because of Jack Rebney and his performance. It could have been so much more though at the hands of a more talented director.\n\nWatch our review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntCQhhQwsc",

      "reviewBody": "Curtains heralded the directorial debut of Richard Ciupka, a cinematographer that had worked on various cult-movies throughout the seventies and was the main camera operator on the excellent gialli, Blood Relatives from 1982. Peter and Richard Simpson, the Canada-based team responsible for Prom Night were the producers, marking their second joint venture into the kingdom of slash and explaining the healthy budget and strong casting decisions. It&apos;s no secret that it suffered a nightmare production that was riddled with problems, which began when lead actress Celine Lamez refused to play a full-frontal nude scene a fair way into the shoot. She was consequently fired and blacklisted from working in Canadian motion pictures for four years. Linda Thornson replaced her, but obviously all the parts that had already been filmed had to be re-shot with the replacement, costing more money and putting a dampener on the set&apos;s general atmosphere. After that, things just spiralled further downhill, resulting in various script changes and complaints from the financers that were unsatisfied with Ciupka&apos;s work as director. (That came as a big surprise when I found out; I thought he did a superb job!) A lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, which explains the studio stills showing screen-shots that never appeared in the final print when it was finally released after being shelved for three years. I&apos;m fairly sure that some of the conspicuous plot holes that can be found throughout the runtime are most definitely resolved on a roll of film that&apos;s stashed away somewhere in a Canadian office, waiting for someone to uncover and re-edit it into a &apos;director&apos;s cut&apos;. Those sorts of on-set complications usually and quite understandably completely ruin most efforts that are unfortunate enough to be plagued by them. Just look at Steve Miner&apos;s Texas Rangers. As a filmmaker, Miner usually always manages to deliver the goods, but after one too many accidents involving careless horsemen and an uninspired crew, it reportedly created an atmosphere of laziness&apos;. The film was first rumoured to be unreleasable&apos;, before it slipped out silently some months later and bombed like a dysfunctional torpedo. Despite all that worked against it, Curtains is still one of my favourite genre-pieces from the early eighties. Ciupka directs with an exquisite style and confidence, and Paul Zaza&apos;s superb score creates a relentlessly foreboding environment that has rarely been matched to such a great effect. \n\nThe story resolves around a mysterious director that is trying to produce a film, which he feels soulfully passionate towards. Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon)&apos;s lover and lead actress, the well-respected Samantha Sherwood (Sam Eggar), bought him the rights to the movie, in return for the lead role. She was hoping to play the central character, Audra, whom is an infamously psychotic and eccentric woman. Like the best Method actors, Sherwood discovers that research is the essential key to performance, so she fakes insanity to have herself sectioned into an asylum, so that she can become emotionally closer to the persona that she wishes to portray. Stryker visits her constantly at first, but as time goes by, he becomes concerned that the actress is looking a little too convincing and perhaps she really has gone doolally.  So what does he decide to do, tell the doctor that it was all a farce and save the woman from impending delusion? Of course not, instead he just abandons her to rot with the rest of the whacko in the institute, and decides on a casting weekend at his remote New England mansion to find a new Audra! Hmmm, I&apos;m betting that someone&apos;s going to have to pay dearly for that endeavour, don&apos;t you agree? The auditions consist of six actresses spending forty-eight hours away from civilization and undergoing vigorous dramatic examinations. Stryker himself sums the tests up perfectly, making himself sound like a military instructor, when he says, `The next two days will be unlike anything that you&apos;ve ever seen before.&apos; All the women have their own unique talents, and they&apos;re all attractive and unattached, proving that the crafty mogul has truly got his head screwed on correctly! When they all meet up over dinner for the first time, they discuss what lengths they&apos;d travel in order to win - what would surely be - the role of their careers. The mood is decided when one budding thespian says that she&apos;d ...kill for the part&apos;. The atmosphere gets all the more tense when Sherwood turns up unannounced and looks as if she&apos;s going to do just that! As sure as night becomes day, a masked killer makes an appearance and begins working his way through the cast-list one at a time, leading me to believe that he&apos;s auditioning for the crown of most creative slasher movie massacre inflictor! As is the thread with the multitude of genre entries from this point in the cycle, we have to decide whom we think is under that impressively creepy mask...\n\nCurtains certainly has more than its fair share of noteworthy moments. The awe-inspiring second killing, which can best be described as skate and slash&apos;, ranks alongside The Prowler&apos;s late night swim&apos; as two of the best from the genre&apos;s peak period. Christie (Lesleh Donaldson) sets out early in the morning, skates in hand, to practise her forte in the bright snow-laden woodland. She finds a fitting pool of ice and places her beat-box down, before treating us to a corny eighties love song and some visually credible skills that were indeed polished enough to rival those of acclaimed Olympic-twosome, Torvil and Dean! After a good couple of minutes watching her whiz around in circles, her performance is cut short, when the tape that she was listening too is mysteriously stopped. (It was a shame cos that cheesy old ballad was actually quite catchy!) She looks over to where the stereo is placed, but sees no one, so heads over to get a closer look. On inspection she discovers a bizarre and spooky-looking doll buried under the snow beside the radio. As she cleans the frost away from its woe-be-tired face, we see the first shots of the mysterious killer as he begins skating towards the hapless female from a distance. Christie looks up to catch the assailant charging in her direction, which is shot in superb slo-mo and backed with some perfectly orchestrated work from Paul Zaza. She soon realises that this uninvited guest doesn&apos;t have her best intentions at heart, when he raises a scythe above his head and decapitates the dolly that she was clenching in her hands! After an apprehensive pursuit through the snow-coated trees and an unexpected jump-scare, lets just say, that the world has one less season ticket holder to the local ice rink! It truly is a brilliant experience watching the superbly deranged psychopath in the old-hag mask skate up in slow-framed shots, while the victim struggles to make sense of the situation. The tension was literally impeccable and Donaldson&apos;s decent performance as the petrified youngster made it all the more realistic, somehow. You&apos;ll be hard-pushed to find a more memorable sequence anywhere in slasher cinema. It&apos;s genuinely terrifying.\n\n The final chase was equally as suspenseful, utilising a superb use of lighting and claustrophobic trappings to create a fitting final to a competent offering. The prop-room location gives Ciupka a chance to shine as he makes the most of his previous experience, chucking in tonnes of striking moments. These include, flashing lights revealing the killer hiding in the back of a beaten up Mini, then disappearing when the camera returns, and the quick cuts through shots of strung up mannequins (and even a corpse), which are accompanied by the dieing screams of an unfortunate female. The patent credibility allows this to stand alone as privileged to possessing its own unique environment that separates it from the rest of its production-line counterparts. It&apos;s hard to describe, but Curtains has a matchless ambience that remains unparalleled, even today. It&apos;s hard to maintain whether it&apos;s down to the constant haunting shots of spacious corridors ending in spooky bright lights, the above-average editing or Zaza&apos;s terrific score, but one thing is for certain, it&apos;s definitely huge on atmosphere all the way through. Even the weaker points of the feature aren&apos;t all that bad, although admittedly, the artsy ballet scene and the rape sequence were overlong, somewhat random and fundamentally inexplicable.\n\nAnother bonus is the good work from the cast, which is filled with actors that have more undiscovered talent than any kind of reputation or A-list credibility. John Vernon makes a competent - if a little theatrical lead, earning kudos for expelling any pleads for sympathy, while Eggar does a good job as the essential red herring (or is she?). But it&apos;s Lynne Griffin that really steals the show more than anyone else does. The dynamic little Canadian actress gets the chance to make up for her disappointingly brief role in Black Christmas, in which she spent most of her screen-time playing a corpse in the attic, with a bag over her head (no fair!) Here, she gives a fantastic portrayal, switching between emotions of anxiety, fear, insecurity and anger, even taking the time to include a stand up comedy routineseriously! I&apos;ve already mentioned the tremendous use of music, but it&apos;s also worth noting the final piece that plays over the end credits. It&apos;s a beautifully composed melody that makes the most of the talented musicianship that was on offer.                \n\nThe flaws are all mostly due to the problematic production. Even though we&apos;re unable to tell exactly how much the shoot was affected by the unfortunate occurrences, Ciupka having to use a pseudonym when the film was released proves that it certainly wasn&apos;t a rose garden. Some of the characters are far too under developed and one or two of them even remain nameless. It&apos;s impossible to pick your choice for surviving girl, because not one of the actresses was on screen long enough to display their individual characteristics, which also had a devastating affect on the mystery. It is a surprise when the killer is revealed, but to be honest, it could have been absolutely anybody, we&apos;re not offered any real clues or motives. What&apos;s really needed is a total rehash of the picture from the raw footage or the dailies&apos; - so to speak, so that we can get a true look at how it really should have been. Anchor Bay has worked wonders with movies like Maniac, Terror Train and Dawn of the Mummy, putting them to DVD with commentaries and decent extras. It&apos;d be nice if they could raise similar interests to get this flick redeveloped with a commentary explaining exactly what&apos;s missing and why. Unfortunately, it&apos;s doubtful that anyone would bother funding such an exercise for an effort that wasn&apos;t all that successful in the first place. What we&apos;re left with, is a half-finished print that still manages to kick up one hell of a storm. Turn the lights down low and prepare to enjoy this decent offering with some of the most plausible directive decisions since Halloween first surfaced in 78. The evident brilliance easily outshines the few not so good moments and that one aforementioned murder alone, redeems the often budget-friendly asking price. I say give this one a go, it certainly gets my vote and is probably a good contender for the all time slasher top-ten."

That&apos;s about the height of his creativity here.\n\nElsewhere we have Jessica Drake miscast in the lead Susan Sarandon role -she&apos;s too old. The musical production numbers get some emphasis, as Brad later did in his Magic Mike ripoff, merely indicating his unfulfilled aspirations to go mainstream and be appreciated as a real filmmaker. Not going to happen.\n\nVery lengthy cast list includes many extras, and it was nice to see some of them given sex roles, like the great Lucky Starr who appears in many a Wicked picture in NonSex bits. James Bartholet is uninteresting in a quite pedestrian reading of the classic Charles Grey host &amp; narrator assignment, and typical of so many bad movies the inclusion of Ron Jeremy as a cameo is wasted footage."

      "reviewBody": "It has been observed in the field of cinema that the depiction of theater in films is no easy matter neither for actors nor the director. The problem has a lot to do with the fact that most films about theater go beyond the realms of mere theatrical art in order to portray quality material about plays. This is why such films do begin confidently with lofty ideas about plays and the art of theater but lose their sense of artistic purpose once they find themselves on the trails which bear inimitable marks of actors&apos; personal lives. I am self sufficient is one such film about the seemingly difficult yet cheerful lives of actors and a theater critic. Although Nanni Moretti is not exactly a protagonist in this film, he does manage to add tremendous substance to his role as an unlucky theater practitioner who is facing tough times as he doesn&apos;t know how to raise a single child when the mother has left &quot;Le Foyer&quot;. Assaults of known as well as unknown facets of Italian culture are regular features of most Nanni Moretti films. This film is not an exception to the rule as Nanni Moretti takes casual potshots at &quot;Il Cinema Italiano&quot;. The film is replete with innumerable scenes of this kind which help to establish the doctrine of &apos;mirth is girth&apos;. Lastly, I am self sufficient is an excellent piece of entertainment which does not purport to be a film providing cheap thrills.",

      "reviewBody": "A comic, space-cowboy musical that follows the adventures of Stingray Sam and the Quazar Kid. Forced to repay their debt to society, this duo must rescue a young girl being held on the affluent planet, Fredward. It is like a 1950s tv serial, broken into several episodes, complete with tobacco advertising. Each section has some wonderful Monty Pythonesque animation and a song. The original soundtrack is diverse and catchy; from rock, to crooning, to rap and even a sweet, ukulele lullaby.\n\nWriter and director McAbee, also stars as the singing space cowboy, Stingray Sam. &quot;Stingray Sam is not a hero, but he does do the things that folks don&apos;t do that need to be done.&quot;\n\nNarrated by David Hyde Pierce, the series has Stingray hook up with the Qasar Kid (Crugie, from McAbee&apos;s band). Although creatively a one man show, The Qasar Kid is the quintessential sidekick in this smart/clever/wise buddy movie. The miniature robot is not even weirder than the rest of the great ideas.\n\nIt is a film with a world-view, too; subtley political without sounding a false note.\n\nStingray Sam is exuberant and charming storytelling by an audacious film maker. Cory McAbee is a saint, if not a genius.",

It is everything one would expect from a man who is known as one of the premiere stylists of the cinema and more. It is poetry, it is art, and it is almost ruthlessly compelling.\n\nWhereas most sports documentaries are relatively cut and dry in that they focus mainly on the winners, Ichikawa has almost no regard for winning or losing at all. For him, it is about the event, the preparation and the movement embodied in Olympic competition - and the film follows both the winners and the losers. The film is incredibly textural. Sight, sound, and movement - even the most imperceptible - all weave together to form a remarkable tapestry that is as much about the director&apos;s own concerns as it is about the Games themselves. It is for this reason that the film initially had a rather stormy reception from those that had commissioned Ichikawa to make the film (and given him an army of cameramen to do so), though if my recollection is correct it went on to break box-office records in Japan. &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; is not a film about the victory of winning, it is about the victory of attending - of being amongst the awesome crowds, the athletes, the bodies in motion. Being there is it&apos;s own victory, which is why Ichikawa focuses so much on the athletes from the newly formed African nation of Chad who, although they do not come close to winning any medals, are the first representatives of their country to appear in the Olympic Games. For Ichikawa their story is just as triumphant as that of the Ethiopian long-distance runner who unflinchingly leaves all his opponents in the dust and goes on to win his event by a mile. &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; is not just about the realm of athletic or Olympic experience, it is about the human experience and about creating cinema out of it. At nearly 3 hours in length it is neither a minute too short or too long, and I personally feel privileged to have seen it.",

      "reviewBody": "Is there any other film that sums up &apos;Divine Decadence&apos; as lusciously as this? Better films, perhaps. Deeper films, most definitely. Yet for succulent visual splendour, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi&apos;s tale of decaying 1920s nobility takes a lot of beating.\n\nAs a womanising aristocrat who falls prey to a hopeless love, Terence Stamp bears an eerie resemblance to Boldini&apos;s portrait of Robert de Montesquiou, the real-life model for Marcel Proust&apos;s doomed aesthete the Baron de Charlus. The story too unfolds along Proustian lines. Meeting a &apos;respectable&apos; middle-class girl (Laura Antonelli) and her none-too-bright fiance (Michele Placido) Stamp loses his heart - only to learn she is really a high-class prostitute.\n\nThis being an Italian film, his growing obsession takes on a darker and more melodramatic tone than anything in Proust. Stamp makes an abortive bid to poison his lady-love, infiltrates her brothel as an anonymous client and manoeuvres her into a twisted sexual triangle with his unsavoury, Fascist-sympathising cousin (Marcello Mastroianni). As we may expect, the emotional decadence of these three characters mirrors the political decay of Italy itself. The final orgy concludes with a group of jaded voluptuaries drunkenly singing &apos;Giovinezza!&apos; - the anthem of Mussolini&apos;s blackshirts.\n\nA dark and faintly nasty story, yet one that is overpoweringly gorgeous to behold. The walls of Stamp&apos;s villa glow with Art Nouveau paintings by Klimt and Moreau, and these set a visual style for the entire film. Every single frame shimmers with exotic colours, voluptuous flowers and jewelled surfaces. Intertitles (as in a silent movie) spice up the narrative with quotations from Pushkin and Stendhal, Baudelaire and Mallarme and, of course, Proust. Costume designer Gabriella Pescucci may, in fact, be the film&apos;s real star - her clothes are so elegant and atmospheric, they could act out the story with no help from the actors.\n\nNot that such a cast would ever get lost amid the costuming. A famous dandy in his off-screen life, Stamp seems to exude anguished elegance from every pore. Mastroianni is wondrously sleazy and reptilian. As for Antonelli, she has only ever been famous for her looks - yet her ruthless man-eater in this film, followed by her role as a wronged and virtuous wife in Visconti&apos;s The Innocent, mark her out as an actress of range, subtlety and depth. For an added touch of glamorous depravity, the demon-eyed Tina Aumont - as seductive and fragrant as a poisonous orchid - plays an unbilled cameo as a lady of the night.\n\nIt pains me to realise The Divine Nymph is a largely-forgotten film, that Patroni Griffi is an unsung genius who now directs &apos;live-action&apos; opera broadcasts for TV. Like his 1971 film &apos;Tis Pity She&apos;s a Whore, The Divine Nymph is as visually gorgeous as any piece of cinema ever made. As a study in high-class decadence and decay, it holds its own with the best of Visconti and Ophuls. As a portrait of the 1920s - a particularly sick and seductive era in Italian and world history - it may be the best of its kind."

      "reviewBody": "Christmas has always enjoyed its fair market share of holiday comedy horror themes, and it&apos;s clear this unique genre shows no signs of slowing down. Fortunately, for those of us who occasionally enjoy this eclectic category, there&apos;s no lack of Holiday Horror films to choose from. Certain standout offerings include American films like Santa&apos;s Slay (2005) and Krampus (2015), Finland&apos;s Rare Exports (2010), and the Dutch holiday horror treat, Saint (2010).\n\nSaint (aka &quot;Sint&quot;) fits into this extraordinary film category quite nicely, blatantly ignoring the benign traditions of steaming cups of strong hot chocolate, knee shaking bowls of almond-flavored marzipan, and even the holiday Elf himself, jolly old St. Nick. Instead, we must fend ourselves against a malignant, ancient and deadly Spirit who rides a pure white spirit horse and seems unstoppable. For you see, in this Netherlands holiday tradition, it&apos;s not about December 24th, nor Kris Kringle&apos;s annual supersonic flight to magnanimously deliver toys to all the good children of the world. Instead, the focus is the Dutch Sinterklass, or more accurately, Bishop Saint Nickolas, a murderous pirate-spirit who returns every 23 years to mercilessly slay anyone who does not honor him with the proper homage. And instead of Santa Claus&apos;s helper Elves, the evil Bishop is accompanied by an equally barbarous crew called &quot;Black Peters,&quot; where, on December 5th, and specifically, on a night where there is a full moon, bad things happen to nice people.\n\nNo spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that the spectacular scenes of the Bishop atop his white steed speedily charging over the rooftops of Amsterdam is something you will never forget. For me, this well executed film has sparked a new interest in foreign holiday movies (especially when they are nicely dubbed in English).\n\nI hope the film&apos;s director, Dick Maas, will consider either a sequel or a new film in this genre. His own stardom awaits him.",

      "reviewBody": "A relatively surface level documentary directed by Fred Weintraub that gives an overview about Bruce Lee&apos;s life career. With people like Kareem Abdul Jabar, Chuck Norris and James Coburn among others who knew Lee personally, this doco looked to have plenty of material to take an interesting and in-depth look into Lee&apos;s life or philosophy. Instead, it goes for a fairly shallow angle, giving a chronology of his life and scraping the surface of his development as a martial artist, as well as a few tales from the sets of his films.\n\nHowever, the true sin of this film is its horrendous editing. It constantly fades out from one interviewee (often in the middle of a sentence) and begins fading in the next before the first has finished. This renders some of what both are saying indiscernible as there will be an overlap of them talking. It also too quickly transitions between interviewees, often only having someone say a couple of lines before fading them out and feeling like the interviewees aren&apos;t really given the chance to say their piece.\n\nEven worse, there are sequences in which both of these flaws manifest, with an interviewee getting faded out mid-sentence, a second interviewee being faded in, only to be faded out (sometimes literally after a single line), and having a third interviewee be faded in. Its frustrating that this documentary clearly had access to people that knew Lee closely, yet doesn&apos;t let any of them say anything for more than a few seconds before rushing them out the door.\n\nThere&apos;s also a somewhat tacked on 5-10 minutes at the end which mentions Brandon Lee&apos;s death and the alleged &apos;curse&apos; on the family. While obviously relevant to Bruce, it seems awkward to suddenly shift focus onto Brandon&apos;s death despite his only prior mention being far earlier in the film and only to mention his birth.\n\nIf they still had all of the interview material, they could probably recut a great film, but as far as this one goes, it&apos;s really nothing special.",

      "reviewBody": "It so happened that in 1968 I was asked to escort Major and Mrs Anderson around prior to the showing of the film that evening. I hated the war (and still do) but I liked Anderson a lot and found that his college-educated wife (UKansas) was opposed to the war. One fact came out in the discussion after the film. One of the U.S. soldiers killed was killed by a grenade tossed by one of his own men. The narrator began the film by saying &quot;The Vietnam War is a tragedy.&quot; It remains so. The audience that evening was entirely male college students, with the exception of an occasional veteran like me. The film gave its audience a better sense of what it was like to fight and die in that faroff jungle than any experience other than being there. I recall being very sad that we were doing this to our young men and to a country that posed only a fictional threat to our well-being. But I also recall having great respect and even love for the kids we&apos;d sent there. I&apos;ve often wondered what happened to Major Anderson and his lovely wife. Anyone know?",

Hari&apos;s storyline and his mixture of action,drama and romance fit perfectly in the movie . Two thumbs up for Saran ,Hari and for the professional actor Surya . This is just a movie that should not be missed . Truly this film was a masterpiece !!!!!!! I heavily look forward to films made by the same team in the future . Even though the violence was just too realistic at some points , they caught the audience&apos;s attention so hard that everyone would be glued to their seats. A brilliant original action story .....",

      "reviewBody": "Italian horror supremo Sergio Martino managed to persuade Ursula Andress into this now notorious jungle adventure and moreover got her to display her boobies! Back in the days when animal rights activists were just a glimmer in their fathers eye, film makers were able to shock audiences by showing gratuitious scenes of animals being killed. In this case, a giant snake eating a monkey, tribesmen slicing open a large lizard, and a number of others - intense imagery but it does go to show how brutal nature can be.\n\nAndress plays Susan Stevenson, the wife of a scientist who has become lost in the New Guinea jungle, and mounts an expedition with the help of her brother and another scientist. They soon meet up with the mysterious Manolo who helps in the search and discover that Susan&apos;s hubby has gone in search of a secret tribe living on a remote mountain called Ra Ra Me which translates as Mountain Of The Cannibal God.\n\nMuch of the group are killed on the way by members of the cannibal tribe and when they do arrive at the mountain, it is the Uranium in the rocks that Susan seeks for financial gain rather than locating her husband. However, her plans are quickly scuppered when the tribe capture her and the last remaining scientist and take them to their mountain lair. They believe that Susan is a goddess and create a living monument by smearing her naked body with fluid and putting ceremonial items on her. How sweet.\n\nThe jungle locations are rich and vibrant, and the cannibals are genuinly scarey looking characters - especially the midget one. The flick does over use shock tactics in parts such as the frenzied sex scene which includes a large boar as far as I can make out. That said, I personally enjoyed the whole 70&apos;s exploitation experience but that may be due to having something wrong with my head.\n\n7.75 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "SPOILER: The last gore film of Herschell Gordon Lewis is perhaps one of his goriest and remarkably one of his funniest..intentional and unintentional.  Lewis has eyeballs squeezed, nipples cut off of breasts with scissors(one breast has white liquid flowing while another has chocolate), a woman&apos;s rump bludgeoned and then salted, a host of throats slit, a woman being run over by a truck, and a woman having her face shoved in a boiling bowl of french fries(you might have noticed in this scene that the pot was tall and not very wide in the first shot prior to the actress having her face embedded in the pot then in the close-up the pot is short and wide to accomodate her face).  No question about it, the film definitely has a misogynistic edge to it.  Women are beaten and killed senselessly(isn&apos;t that every Lewis film?). The story about an amateur detective being paid by a newspaper to solve the crime was not THAT bad...certainly better than most plot constructs used in other Lewis vehicles.  Frank Kress as Abraham Gentry certainly also is one of the best actors ever used in a lead in a Lewis film.  His acting style was fresh and he could convey irony and wit.  The rest of the cast was so-so, with lots of naked girls jiggling(none of them particularly attractive and looking in that sleazy, has-been 70&apos;s kind of fashion). Henny Youngman, the only big name to grace any of Lewis&apos;s horror films, stars as a night club owner and talks so fast you will have trouble hearing what he says!  Lewis wants to sicken you in this film, but he also goes for the laughs and some of them work.  The photographers in each murder scene are hilarious as is the general mood of the film when some poor girl isn&apos;t losing appendages, skin, or having her eyes gouged out.  The score is like some sleazy jazz theme and Lewis even has the temerity to use pieces of classical music and opera such as the Anvil Chorus.  Despite all the twisted killing, the film kind of grew on me.  Now, maybe I am the sick one.  Watch out for the ending...it is Lewis having some more fun...and the revelation of the killer is one of the most ludicrous explanations put on film.  Look fast too because the killer meets his/her end so fast you&apos;ll have to rewind it to see what happened."

      "reviewBody": "We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British.  Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America&apos;s own Imperial age.\n\nAmerica&apos;s projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (Politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of &quot;native&quot; peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.)  What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.\n\nThough The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery&apos;s noble brigand, Candace Bergen&apos;s feisty heroine, John Huston&apos;s wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly&apos;s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt&apos;s &quot;Big Stick&quot;.  There is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing Moor on his white steed.  This is high adventure at its best.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a good, tense drama that builds up an interesting &apos;noir&apos; story that includes some rather creative story elements. It has several strengths, but most of all it features three fine performances by Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea. It&apos;s also easy to see Fritz Lang&apos;s skilled hand at work in the story-telling, mood, and pacing.\n\nRobinson shows his skill and versatility in portraying a mild-mannered bank cashier who really wants nothing more than the chance to dabble in his painting, before getting caught up in a complicated situation. Bennett is quite effective as the opportunistic young woman who befriends him, and Dan Duryea adds his presence and ability to very good effect - Duryea had the knack of portraying this kind character as well as anyone. His appearance in any film-noir always seemed to make an average movie good and a good movie even better.\n\nThe story is developed carefully, as Robinson&apos;s character slowly begins to realize that he has gotten into a situation beyond his control. By the time that things come to a head, the tension is considerable. The ending is also rather resourceful, in being carefully written so as to satisfy the stringent requirements of the production code of the era while also ending the story in a way that seems appropriate and fitting to the tone of the movie as a whole.\n\nAll of this adds up to make &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; a fine movie that is well worth seeing, especially for fans of film-noir."

I&apos;ve read some people&apos;s thoughts on how this film is better suited and better liked by people who understand dry humour and British comedy and they are absolutely right. This film is British through and through, funded by the BFI and starring an all British cast. As someone who is British, I can tell you if you understand that sort of dry and often off colour humour you will love this film like I did. \n\nIf you&apos;re American or are used to that sort of conventional sugary sweet Hollywood style Christmas film then this film will probably be harder to understand. While it does conform to the traditional narrative and plot points many Hollywood Christmas films do (Christmas isn&apos;t coming this year, a broken family saves Christmas and ultimately their own issues and relationships - the film after all is made by Warner Brothers and so the film does still hold some of that conventional Hollywood magic) its uniqueness is found in it&apos;s darker and often off colour humour that is iconically British. The film not only showcases a perfect blend of Hollywood and British humour with the help of Warner Bros and BFI but the film also has a brilliant cast with some fantastic British actors. I couldn&apos;t help but smile when I saw many actors I recognise from other British TV shows or films. Not only Jim Broadbent but Warwick Davis and Matt King who I know better as Super Hans in the very original and hilariously British sitcom Peep Show. Like it or not this film is certainly worth watching at this festive time of year. Now, it&apos;s certainly one I think I will watch every year at Christmas. 🙂🎅🎄",

      "reviewBody": "I have never had an experience quite like Richard Linklater&apos;s It&apos;s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books. Intentionally alienating yet undeniably fascinating and innovative. The title was at first a mystery but after watching the film (equipped with a fantastic commentary by Linklater himself), I began to comprehend its meaning which is sort of saying, &quot;you don&apos;t learn how to do something by reading books.&quot; The only true way to learn something as unique as filmmaking or plowing, one must put down the book and pick up a camera. Or a plow in this context.\n\nA plow is never seen in this film. Nor is anything resembling a book. The film is a plot less excursion following an unnamed character (played by Linklater) leading a mundane, uninteresting life in Austin, Texas. He gets up, dresses himself, points a shotgun out the window and fires it a few times, wanders around town, goes on multiple train trips to travel up to Montana, and basically goes about his unconventional day.\n\nOne must see this film to truly comprehend it. Because the film has little to no dialog (and when it does, it&apos;s usually unimportant rambling), I turned on Linklater&apos;s commentary middle of the way through and listening to him speak is a very reassuring touch to a film already so unique and baffling. He provides us with not much backstory as to why the events are occurring, but dives into topics such as why he made this film in the first place and how he sympathizes with the youth of today who are trying to break free of typical life conventions.\n\nI mentioned in my review of his official directorial debut, Slacker that by defining the word itself as, &quot;people who are ultimately being responsible to themselves and not wasting their time in a realm of activity that has nothing to do with who they are or what they might be ultimately striving for&quot; he is giving adolescence a tremendous amount of reassurance and confidence in their minds. He took a word, often equipped with a negative connotation and turned it into a positive definition about being true to one&apos;s self and one&apos;s personal goals.\n\nSlacker was a picture that, the more I think about, the more I truly adore it. It is uniquely structured, stably paced, and very thoughtful and innovative. It&apos;s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books is a different breed of plot less filmmaking. It offers no insights, no coherency, no drama, and no real message or purpose. It does however erect a soothing and primitive aspect from its Super 8, home video cinematography and its focus on the smaller aspects of life (a wobbly 7up can that makes a &quot;cool&quot; sound). It&apos;s fun, lightweight, sometimes frustrating, mostly unrewarding, and yet I kind of dug it.\n\nStarring: Richard Linklater. Directed by: Richard Linklater.",

This film had a sequel called Safari Express with the same cast as the original, but is harder to find. To add to the confusion, some distributors released both this movie and the sequel as &quot;Tropical Express&quot;!! I still recommend this as a great family film. Kids will love the animals and parents will appreciate  the intelligent humour. Then the parents might kill the kids if they don&apos;t stop saying &quot;Maeba&quot; around the house.\n\nToo bad there were only two in this series. Maybe it&apos;s not too late for a reunion? :o)",

      "reviewBody": "Oscar Wilde reputation is set for all time. He was a brilliant, witty writer of graceful style. He was also a bi-sexual, whose affair with Lord Alfred Douglas led to a tragic final fall when exposed in court. What most people forget is that the trial where he was exposed was a libel suit against Lord Alfred&apos;s brutal and mad father the Marquess of Queensbury (the one who gave us the rules for boxing). Queensbury hated his sons and their mother, and his antics helped lead to the suicide of one of the sons (the private secretary of Prime Minister, Lord Roseberry). Queensbury disliked Wilde for his influence over Lord Alfred and his unspeakable homosexual affair with his son. He sent him a note on a card, &quot;To Oscar Wilde, disguised as a &quot;somdomite&quot;.&quot; The Marquess presumed that by misspelling sodomite he was protecting himself but smearing Wilde. Wilde had an opportunity then to ignore the slur and go abroad for awhile (which most men in his position would have done). He decided to sue - goaded into it by Lord Alfred (who saw this as a safe opportunity to hit at his father). Never has such a critically important legal decision been made on such a stupid basis. \n\nThe barrister for Queensbury was Edward Carson, one of England&apos;s greatest lawyers. He is the model for the barrister played by Robert Donat in &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (based on Carson&apos;s defense of young Archer-Shee in the 1911 legal action). Carson was a master of cross-examination, and he had plenty of information that Queensbury (and Wilde&apos;s many enemies) had gathered about his sexual activities. But Wilde was able to fend off the attack for hours, until he reached a series of questions about a telegraph boy who was available for sex for hire. Carson had been unable to make a dent into Wilde&apos;s hide so far, and then out of sheer desperation asked, &quot;Did you kiss him?&quot; Wilde was amazed - the question did throw him. &quot;Did I kiss him?&quot;, he repeated. &quot;Yes&quot;, answered Carson with a lack of real interest. Wilde had been trumping Carson with one-liners that left the court in stitches. Instead of saying, &quot;Of course not!&quot; or &quot;How dare you!&quot;, which would have helped, Wilde quipped the sentence in the summary line above. And Carson saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Wilde never recovered after that.\n\nThe jury was able to absolve Queensbury of libel (after all, it was shown that Wilde was homosexual). The authorities now held back for nearly twelve hours from going after Wilde. They simply hoped he would flee to the continent. Instead, Wilde decided to stay and fight. It is the second trial that really demolished him. He was now on trial of committing sodomy, and the evidence was too overwhelming. Found guilty, he was sentenced to three years in prison. He left prison and lived in France until he died in Paris, a broken, impoverished wreck, in 1900.\n\nIf you are a homosexual, Wilde is one of the great martyr&apos;s to the cause. If you love good writing his end is a dismal tragedy. All the films of his life retell it&apos;s denouement. It never gets any better in the retelling - there is no repaired last act. Even (historically) a &quot;reformed&quot;, right-wing supporting Lord Alfred rejected the image of his &quot;Bosie&quot; period in later years - claiming he never was a homosexual. One ends just pitying Wilde, unless one is just a reactionary type or a mindless idiot like Queensbury.\n\nRobert Morley never gave a better dramatic performance on film (as opposed to his comic performances) than in this film. Witness his moment on the witness stand, when he realizes the result of his blunder. The cast of John Neville, Ralph Richardson, Edward Chapman, and Dennis Price do equally well in this tale of talent that was shot down so stupidly. I certainly recommend watching it...and then reading &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of the Reading Gaol&quot;, to get a glimmer of the talent that was smashed beyond repair."

For this movie, he chose to adapt a fairy tale written by Charles Perrault during the seventeenth century and he wisely chose. This movie is a real treat, an absolute enchantment and rare are the movies that succeed in recreating the wonderful atmosphere of fairy tales. Everything, here, reaches a level of perfection rarely reached: sceneries and costumes are marvellous, especially the rooms of the first castle that you see at the beginning of the movie. Moreover, a part of it was made at Chambord. Then, the music is really gorgeous and the songs ravishing. I also noticed that Demy introduced a contemporary humor which contains numerous anachronisms. For example, near the end of the film, Jean Marais appears in a helicopter! However, the story takes place in the seventeenth century. How strange it is... Don&apos;t forget, a performance of quality. Catherine Deneuve is an ideal and delicate princess but Jean Marais is probably the best actor in the movie. He&apos;s very convincing in his role of tormented and jaded king. Besides, it was his last role for the cinema. After that, he&apos;s given over to painting and sculpture. Even if certain special effects are a little kitsch, the movie is impregnated with a lot of poetry. So, at the end, a movie that seduces the eyesight and the hearing and this is one of Demy&apos;s masterpieces.",

      "reviewBody": "Set in nineteenth-century Finland, this is situational comedy at its absolute best. A grumpy village wife sends her husband to borrow some matches from their next-lake neighbor. On his way, the poor fellow meets an old drinking buddy and gets completely sidetracked, forgetting all about the task at hand in order to help his friend marry the girl of his dreams (which he ultimately does in the end - never mind it&apos;s a totally different girl). A bitter-sweet confusion follows, resulting in a drunken brawl, a prison sentence, a ship sinking on its way to America, several weddings being arranged then called off, finally culminating in the hero&apos;s own &quot;funeral&quot;. Side-splitting but done with great taste and style.\n\nThe film - and the novel of the same name it&apos;s based on - offer a rare sympathetic glimpse into the life of rural 19th-century Finland. The movie succeeds in conveying the novel&apos;s biggest strength: its characters, uneducated but amazing men and women whose simple hearts are bursting with love and hope. A rare gem worthy of being on the &quot;Best ever&quot; list.",

      "reviewBody": "Batman is not technically as &quot;good&quot; as other serials such as most Republics, but I do like it better and enjoy it more than most others. Sure it is too long in the middle with 15 chapters and all, but there is just something about it that really appeals to me. \n\nFirst of all it is Batman. Second, it just drips with atmosphere. All of the scenes in Daka&apos;s hideout are done so well that I can hardly imagine them being improved on. There is a darkened smoky atmosphere to the hideout with its walls covered with Japanese paintings and designs. Can anyone possibly think of a better way to have that set look? The theme music and the scraping sound heard when the door to the hideout opens are very distinctive - though minor elements of the serial, they add incredibly to the sum total of my evaluation.\n\nJ. Carrol Naish&apos;s portrayal of Dr. Daka is amongst the best acting ever done on film. The character and his dialog are just so fitting as the epitome of a villainous &quot;jap&quot; spy. Credit needs to go to the scriptwriters for dreaming it all up and to Naish for the brilliant execution of it. His lines and the trance like expression on his face as he talks about the emperor being the &quot;heavenly ruler and prince of the rising sun&quot; and freeing the &quot;enslaved people of America&quot; are just unbeatable acting.\n\nSome of Daka&apos;s underlings are &quot;zombies&quot;. They wear a radio headset receiver which has a wire connected to their spine so he can control them. Sure - that makes sense. This is the best example of serial logic and science I&apos;ve ever seen. Its the perfect thing to describe to people in order to explain how things work in serials.\n\nOf course Daka&apos;s scientific devices are powered by radium! Is it just me or do a lot of super scientific devices in serials run on radium? Saying its powered by radium somehow makes it all make sense.\n\nDaka and Emperor Ming are the two ultimate serial villains. Sure there are some others that were really cool, but no one really even come close to them.\n\nNuff said!",

It becomes personal when one of the abductees is his niece, and he enlists local doctor and former victim Kate McTiernan (Judd) who escaped the same perpetrator and is the only living person who can identify him. Stylish, atmospheric, well-crafted thriller holds your interest, with some effective twists and strong performances from Freeman and Judd, but it builds to a climax that doesn&apos;t quite payoff. Still, a respectable showing for all those involved. **½"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; is not a film about the Vietnam war, as it is wrongly said in many cases.\n\n&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; is a film tells the story of 3 friends within about 5-6 years, during which their friendship is repeatedly put to the test.\n\nIt is primarily a picture of the contemporary life of a group of people around 30 living in a small American town during the Vietnam war.\n\nThe first hour of the film portrays the every day life of three friends Mike (De Niro), Steven (Savage) and Nick (Walken), who look forward to Steve&apos;s wedding but at the same time have to prepare for their commitment in Vietnam. The main actors (above all De Niro and Walken) perfectly picture the character&apos;s inner conflict between their easygoing home town life and the forthcoming assignment in Vietnam. Despite this conflict the characters don&apos;t show their concerns to their environment.\n\nParticularly Nick is worried about him and his friends leaving his home town and perhaps never coming back, but he only tells his best friend Mike of his thoughts, who is much more resolute and sees their engagement as a strong masculine act.\n\nCimino manages to show the simple irrationality of young men, going to a senseless war from which they might never return for the only purpose of glory and approval, and abandoning their settled and happy life for it. The spectator just can&apos;t understand why those young men voluntarily sign for the army and give up everything they have. The passage from the small-town-idyll to the war cruelty is greatly pictured. Cimino does not show the three friends&apos; way to Vietnam or the training, he immediately switches from a happy get-together to the cruel war captivity of the Vietcong. This passage perfectly underlines the contrast and the inexplicability of the three men&apos;s actions.\n\nAlthough the passage that is set in Vietnam is only about one third of the whole film long, the war is omnipresent at any time, which is probably the best benefit of the whole film, Cimino does not need to bomb the spectator with pictures of crying children, mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields in order to illustrate the cruelty of war. Far from it! The changed behavior of all characters after the friends&apos; returns tell more about wars&apos; capability of changing someone&apos;s life, than anything else.\n\nAnd the fact that the many dreams that these three friends had before they went to Vietnam didn&apos;t come true, because of their longing for recognition by becoming an acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings.\n\nCimino&apos;s great directing and the cast&apos;s awesome acting provide for a touching and honest drama about the friendship of a group of young men, that is destroyed by the Vietnam war.",

      "reviewBody": "I love the old WWII movies and how they portray what life was like for the men and women who served - and what it was like for the families etc. But of all the ones I&apos;ve seen, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen a single one that highlighted the plight of the children. I&apos;m glad this one chose to bring this sad effect of war to the public in this film.\n\nThe movie starts more like a documentary with a female narrator telling part of the story. At times the narration is a little annoying. But most of the rest of the film unfolds naturally without the narration. The film is a heartbreaking tale of the orphaned children of the war. They have nowhere to go and are shuttled from orphanages to resettlement centers. I was so shocked when I first saw the children - they looked so emaciated and dirty. They all seemed to have shell-shocked expressions on their faces. I think the director (Fred Zinneman)did a great job of casting and going for a realistic portrayal and not trying to gloss over the true realities. Being of Austrian Jewish heritage, the story no doubt hit close to home for him.\n\nThe actual location shooting in bombed out cities of Germany was also quite stark and realistic. I&apos;m glad they chose not to try to replicate the devastation in a studio. Being filmed in 1948, 3 years after the end of the war - I was shocked to see how much destruction was still evident, with huge piles of rubble laying around. The cities looked deserted.\n\nThis was one of Montgomery Clift&apos;s first films. He doesn&apos;t appear until 36 minutes into film. He delivers a fine performance given his inexperience (although he was experienced on the stage). He is still in possession of his youthful good looks which deteriorated later. Too bad he lived such a young, tragic life as he was quite a natural talent. The young boy is quite a good actor for his age and manages to express his desperation through his body language and action since he doesn&apos;t speak for almost 2/3&apos;s of the film.\n\nThere are many memorable and shocking scenes: the drowning of one of the children, the young boy searching through a crowd of women for his mom, several scenes of his wild and desperate attempts to escape at all costs, and the hordes of children exiting from the train as they arrive at the settlement center. Many of these scenes are some I will never forget. \n\nI&apos;m shocked so few people have seen this (given only 37 comments and 1000+votes on IMDb at this time). I highly recommend this film if you are interested in movies about the sad effects of war.",

      "reviewBody": "Getting Even With Dad is more of a nostalgia moment for me than anything else. What is interesting to see is how the film still has an emotional impact on me today. This isn&apos;t anything to fancy with regards to the scriptwriting or even the cinematography. This relies purely on the character development and acting of our main cast. Macaulay Culkin was such a big star at the time yet this one flopped a little on its release. Suddenly the audience had got bored of Culkin and he wasn&apos;t so cute anymore. However I believe Culkin plays a reasonably good part in this movie alongside Ted Danson.\n\nThe basic theme of the movie is blackmail, Culkin finds no other way to reason with his father on pulling off a coin heist, in which he sees it ending only one way. Alongside Danson and Culkin we have some great supporting characters, Rays (Ted Danson) two cronies Bobby and Carl played by Saul Rubinek and Gailard Sartain. Saul Rubinek adds some humour to what is mostly perceived as an emotional drama from my perspective. Where Getting Even with Dad struggles is sometimes in the pacing and also not fully sure of what it wants to be. It crosses genre without really settling on something concrete, this isn&apos;t a bad thing it just means it comes across of being not fully aware of the message it&apos;s trying to convey.\n\nIf you just watch this is a lighthearted mood and accept it for what it is you&apos;ll enjoy it yet if you are looking for something with a little more depth and meaning then you&apos;ll probably find you are on the side of the disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "The auspicious directorial debut from Viennese columnist Andrea Maria Dusl, this road movie which takes Eastern Europe as its subject, should have no problem finding receptive audiences in German-speaking countries. In particular, the presence of Josef Hader, one of Vienna&apos;s top cabaret acts, and Detlev Buck, a leading German actor-director, will certainly strike a chord. But with careful handling, Dusl&apos;s portrait of the former socialist empire, as seen through concerned but often amused contemporary Western eyes, should be able to reach beyond these cultural barriers to the overseas arthouse circuit. Certainly the performance of Viktoria Malektorovych deserves a wider international audience.\n\nOpening with an innocent-looking shot of the Odessa Steps, one of cinema&apos;s most celebrated locations thanks to Eisenstein&apos;s Battleship Potemkin, the film traces the love story between a Ukrainian girl (Viktoria Malektorovych) full of surprises and an Austrian man (Josef Hader) she meets by accident. Started haltingly and on a whim, it blossoms as the couple move further and further into the east, from Austria to Slovakia and then all the way through the Ukraine, via Lviv, Kiev, down to the Black Sea and Odessa. A third character, a fast-talking German conman (Detlev Buck) down on his luck, joins in for stretches of the road to flesh out the film&apos;s comments about the transitions taking place in this part of the world.\n\nOriginally conceived as a series of shorts about Eastern Europe since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Dusl felt her purpose would be much better served by combining them into one feature film. The plot that ties them together is pleasant, although at times come across as a bit loose, occasionally resorting to arbitrary subterfuges to keep the story afloat. But then what counts here is the writer/director&apos;s reflections on what she feels is still terra incognita for many of her fellow Westerners. Somewhere, between the strict political system of the past and the sudden freedom, chaos and corruption of the present, East Europeans are trying to find their own way of coping with the new economy, the new morality and the old habits, from which they have not entirely divested themselves.\n\nCollecting incidents that she obviously feels reflect on the bigger picture, Dusl&apos;s notes are always sympathetic, and often astute and entertaining. Metaphors, such as the unfenced sheep which refuse to run away unless someone persuades them to or a money-obsessed girl who keeps communist artefacts in her home, are often used to re-enforce the message. Additional commentary is provided by nuggets of grandma&apos;s wisdom introduced in the narration and by the constantly running video camera, used to expand or underline certain points.\n\nThe star of the show is undoubtedly Viktoria Malektorovych, a young Ukrainian actress whose expressive face and body language do wonders for the lead role and hold the film together. Hader&apos;s laid-back, effectively understated performance and Buck&apos;s typically extrovert rascal offer all the support that she needs.\n\nScreen International&apos;s Dan Fainaru in Locarno 05 August 2002",

The movie was directed by Mikhail Vartanov.\n\nThe film has no dialect. We see scenes of the rugged Armenian landscape, as well as the work of Armenian artists, both ancient and contemporary. Among the contemporary artists there&apos;s a brief clip of Sergei Parajanov directing The Color of Pomegranates. Because Parajanov was in disfavor with the Soviet authorities, this brief clip was enough to cause the entire film to be blacklisted for 43 years--until 2012.\n\nDirector Vartanov was a close friend of Parajanov, and he tried to get Parajanov out of prison. This was enough to have him blacklisted for many years.\n\nWe saw this movie as a Criterion Collection extra for Parjanov&apos;s masterpiece, The Color of Pomegranates. Howerver, the film will stand on its own, although it will be more meaningful if it&apos;s understood in context. The IMDb rating for this movie is an anemic 6.6.

All of the actors have wonderful chemistry, and Celeste Holm is a stand out as Sinatra&apos;s &quot;fiancee&quot; Debbie Reynolds is adorable as a 22 year old ingenue who wants a career in the theatre, but only for a brief time. She has a plan to get married, have three children and live in Scarsdale, which everyone knows has the best school system in the country. Sinatra and David Wayne are old friends and the married Wayne comes to New York to take a vacation from his wife. He becomes interested in Holm and falls in love with her. Sinatra falls in love with Debbie Reynolds and their scenes are just lovely. Complications ensue, but in the end, it all shakes out. This is one of the best adaptations of a 1950&apos;s stage comedy and it is most enjoyable and certainly worthwhile.",

The victims have no idea that they are invited merely to be humiliated and their boorish &quot;sponsors&quot; compare their notes later to determine whose &quot;idiot&quot; was the best. Pierre Brochant( Thierry Lhermitte), the smug publisher thinks that he&apos;s got a winner in the tax accountant François Pignon (Jacques Villeret, sadly passed away in January 2005 - great French Comedian whose performance in &quot;Robert and Robert&quot; I enjoyed very much) who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre (but fortunately for us, the viewers) he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon&apos;s sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...\n\nWith the modest running time of 80 minutes, the &quot;Dinner Game&quot; is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber, the director of Le Jouet, (1976) aka The Toy , La Chèvre, (1981) aka Knock On Wood, Les Compères, (1983) ... aka ComDads, and Les Fugitifs, (1986) and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire, (1972) ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.",

      "reviewBody": "Lawang Sewu means A Thousand Doors. Its apparently a real run-down colonial period building situated in Semarang, Jawa. Built by the dutch is first served as an administrative building, but when the Japanese came they changed the place into a concentration camp. Lot of bad memories connected to this place and many state its haunted.\n\nGreat location for a horror movie. But location isn&apos;t enough. Basically its a teeny ghost movie, one of many that have been jumping up in throves in Indonesia. Plot? A group of kids enter a house and get killed of one by one... \n\nUnfortunately it seems most Indonesian films are nowhere as professionally done as films like The Eye or Shutter and if this film is anything to go by then the industry has a lot to learn.\n\nActing is terrible and the direction makes the movie look like an indie amateur film, that people post on Youtube from time to time. The make-up artists and FX crew are the only ones that should receive any praise, as the miniscule budget didn&apos;t.\n\nSeeing how much money horror films are bringing in Indonesia it really is a shame that professionalism doesn&apos;t go hand in hand. Some films show that potential is there. For a excellent Indonesian horror movie recommended watching is Dead Time: Kala.",

      "reviewBody": "A documentary about historical, once-in-lifetime concert where some of greatest Afro- American musicians performed in front of 100 000 Ghana audience as part of country&apos;s independence celebration. According to booklet, this idea has been in making for some time before all the necessary arrangements made it possible (Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Louis Armstrong were among invited) until in 1971. finally everything fell in the place. Locals were overjoyed to see American stars ascending in the middle of Ghana and clearly excited, welcomed them as royalty, as long gone members of family - for musicians, on the other hand, this was cathartic experience as they visited Africa for the first time.\n\nTo say this documentary is fascinating would be understatement - you could watch it again and again, always finding new details about people&apos;s reactions, their faces, smiles and sorrows. DVD commentaries are also very illuminating as musicians reminisce about this visit and how they saw it. Most of American musicians knew nothing about African music but to be honest audience in Ghana seems to be not familiar with them either - except Wilson Pickett whom they saw as Soul God (and watched him with mouth open), however the welcome at the airport was clearly spontaneously joyous and heartfelt. Ghana was not a wealthy place but locals gave what they had in abundance - music, song and dance, prompting American visitors to join them in celebration. Movie follows American crew as they spend few days in Ghana, visiting local villages and places before they actually performed on concert - you can clearly see &quot;WTF?&quot; expressions on Ike &amp; Tina&apos;s faces as they came in the middle of some local village with people running around with a large Elephant bone totem or hear sorrow in Mavis Staples voice as she explains visit to old slave castle.\n\nConcert itself was a huge celebration - Ghanaian audience might not have been familiar with performers but they quickly recognized The Staple Singers as &quot;Old man and his family&quot;. The Voices of East Harlem probably reminded them of their own dancing and chanting. Ike Turner&apos;s blues was maybe alien music genre to them but they loved his guitar playing (he was brilliant, instantly recognizable guitarist) and if men gaped mouth open at Ikettes, women clearly loved regally authoritative Tina. Now,Tina was nothing less exciting than Wilson Pickett but his recordings were known in Ghana, so when he appeared all Hell broke loose and audience exploded - in all honesty, American musicians probably did their usual concert routine but audience reaction (and a fact that concert took place in Ghana) was tremendous and made a huge difference. \n\nAudio comments are very interesting as we hear musicians having a different perspective on what they saw and how they felt. Carlos Santana&apos;s white musician (Michael Shrieve) remembers how Wilson Pickett didn&apos;t want a white visitor to his hotel room party and how Ike Turner had argument with him about it. Ike Turner himself remembers Pickett making a fuss of insisting on his own dressing room (which was not possible). Mavis Staples remembers recognizing African faces in features of folks back home and so on. It must have been curious experience for visitors to see and feel Africa but there was surely a cultural shock and a occasional food poisoning. Absolutely fascinating to watch, though from today&apos;s perspective of course its technologically imperfect and footage had to be re-edited since Roberta Flack insisted her involvement had to be erased - she was part of concert but now doesn&apos;t want to have anything with it, well OK Roberta, if you dislike idea of being immortalized in a historical movie, it&apos;s up to you.",

Luckily i found it on You Tube and download this as well. Honestly, I&apos;m not disappointed after watching it! Steve Reeves came up with his final movie and quit acting after this movie, i wonder why??? The way he acted in a cowboy movie was surprisingly good and he could turn out to be a lot better if he further his career. It&apos;s too bad he quit earlier..I wish he acted more in spaghetti western movies..he could be as popular as Franco Nero or Lee Van Cleef! A Long Ride From Hell is just one of the best western movies i have seen so far. In my opinion, this one surpasses Django and The Great Silence. I just thought that A Long Ride From Hell is better.\n\n10/10 stars (excellent)",

It&apos;s not ground breaking, but it&apos;s enough for an interesting story. His relationship with his mother is at times interesting, and we learn about his father works too.\n\nSadly it all falls apart when the main character, Hans Petter, keeps making really dumb choices for no apparent reason. At some point you just have to assume it&apos;s because of his troubled past (or &quot;something like that&quot;), but then it makes to sense he would get to where he is. He could have easily avoided lots of trouble by thinking things through just a little bit, and that makes it frustrating to watch.\n\nI&apos;m not expert in how they speak (spoke) in the Oslo drug scene, but I had a hard time believing some of the lines spoken by the actors.",

      "reviewBody": "An exhibit of Rodin&apos;s sculptures was circling the Western United States a few years back.  In any gallery in which they were exhibited they snapped heads; there are few figures that speak with such authority or superiority, mute testimony, like the Easter Island figures, to as much effort and skill.  And so the movie `Camille Claudel&apos;, in like fashion, snaps heads in its understated power and commitment to craft. \t  \n\n \tLike Ansel Adams, Rodin stretched nature beyond what was possible  they both showed us something that was not there and in the rendering made representations so striking they had no precedent and thus set the bar higher for subsequent generations of artists.  As history played out, the far less well known sculptor Camille Claudel made substantial contributions but her tie to Rodin (and eventually her personal decline) for a period in the late nineteenth century is the focus in this instance.  In truth, her story demanded to be filmed; she stands a remarkable artist and most importantly the passion, talent and influence (inarguably on Rodin) she possessed went well beyond the `colorful&apos; label oft attached to the gifted. \n\n \tHistorically, this film is probably not a bad representation of how events turned in her life.  There are many issues and turns, and years for that matter, the details of which remain unclear to this day.  But in its entirety this is a marvelous interpretation of the record.  And without doubt Isabelle Adjani was the right actor for the job.\n\n\t Stunningly beautiful, there are few women in history as arresting as Isabelle is; certainly Camille was not as lovely, but the resemblance is darned good as compared to actors chosen to portray historical figures in most movies based on true events and the people that were part of them. That Adjani brings some of the passion is certain.  After all, bizarre, or at least socially unacceptable, behavior resulted in her eventual incarceration, so we know she was a handful.\n\n\tMany of the key points of her upbringing are addressed; her father&apos;s stern and inconsistent yet lovingly supportive position in her life (this is more forcefully impressed on us as the years progress); her mother&apos;s complete non-support and dismissal of all that Camille does; her relationship with her less understanding and conflicted brother.  But it is the period when she meets and falls for Rodin (and he with her) and their consequent tumultuous affair runs its course that is actually the focus of the film.\n\n\tGérard Depardieu&apos;s contribution as Rodin is probably the best work he has done.  He looks (Rodin was 40 when he met the 21 year old Camille) very much as Rodin did in this period of his life.  His love for his work, Camille and promoting his own career are his passions.  We are lead through the minefield of his own making (his inability to get off a dime and marry Camille is their eventual downfall) and we are not totally sympathetic to his behavior.  But this is the stuff of real life; as Seneca said, all art is but imitation of nature and both his and her own work convey their conflicted convictions.          \n\n\tThe musical score haunts us, as it should, right from the opening of the film.  Almost never detracting, it instead correctly underscores certain points in the narrative; but it is the opening where we see Camille scooping clay from beneath a Parisian street (and this is a well-crafted sequence) where we feel the upsurge of powerful currents operating.  The music heightens our interest as we determine exactly what we are seeing.\n\n\tOther nice touches in the film include an occasion where Camille and Rodin together study a model on a turntable, spinning the model about as metaphor for the emotional maelstrom gathering momentum.  We also see a great moment when Rodin is caressing Camille&apos;s face, intercut with shots of him working clay into an as yet unidentifiable sculpture.\n\n\tWhat follows the breakup of Camille and Rodin is essentially a retrospective of the downslide of a remarkable talent.  The story of Claudel&apos;s own diminishing output of work and the steady erosion of her inability to cope with reality is frightening in its telling.  At a meeting with Rodin some time after they have parted company she remarks that she has changed, and offers that `Nothing that&apos;s monstrous is foreign to me&apos;.  And so she truly (and sadly) withdraws into a world of her own making.\n\n\tRating: Four Stars."

When Hyo-Shin has one night stand and gets pregnant of a depressed teacher, the love of Shi-Eun dies and she breaks up with Hyo-Shin leading her to commit suicide. Shi-Eun&apos;s classmate Min-Ah So (Min-sun Kim) finds and reads their diary, disclosing the innermost secrets of the two lovers, and becomes obsessed for Shi-Eun. When a close friend advises that Min-Ah would die because she was reading the diary of a dead girl, she wants to return the diary to Hyo-Shin.\n\n&quot;Memento Mori&quot; is an intriguing, tragic and eerie love story, with a confused screenplay. The plot is built like pieces of a puzzle, but without chronological sequence, and in the end there are many parts without explanation that I have really not understood. I saw in IMDb that there is an 186 minutes running time director&apos;s cut version where probably I would find the resolution of my questions, but unfortunately I have just found the imported DVD with 97 minutes. In the end, this film is a good supernatural romance but not recommended for fans of the traditional horror genre. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

      "reviewBody": "Here comes another solid movie from the country that currently produces the best films in the whole wide world which happens to be South Korea.\n\nDon&apos;t worry about the critics. The economical, political and social component of a divided Korean peninsula is an issue in this movie and one should at least have a basic knowledge about this conflict to understand this movie. But this delicate topic doesn&apos;t dominate the movie and makes the whole thing too melodramatic. It&apos;s rather a positive elements as it adds some spicy ingredients to a promising melting pot and it adds some depth and development to many characters in this movie as you will see.\n\nThe movie still stays a tension filled action movie about a lonesome pirate that wants to attack the Korean peninsula with nuclear garbage. The acting of both the main villain and the main hero is authentic and unique to both of them. The supporting actors such as the main villain&apos;s sister also do a great job. The amazing thing about this movie is that the bad guy is more than just your average terrorist. There are many reasons why he has become the one he is and sometimes good and evil are not clearly distinguished. When it comes to the confrontation between the good and the bad guy, one realizes that they have a lot in common and could have been big friends in another situation. This is what makes this movie emotional, tragic and not too expectable at some points. Towards the end, the flick becomes a true tearjerker but I mean this in a positive way. The movie truly touched me because the stories behind the characters are really well thought out. They are dramatic, emotional and tragic.\n\nThe story is not complicated but still detailed enough to remain interesting and demand a certain kind of attention. The movie just has the right mixture of dialogues, narrative flashbacks and explosive action scenes. The settings are also amazing. The movie plays in several countries from Laos to Russia and exposes many beautiful landscapes and different cultures without being too educational.\n\nThe only two small flaws during this joy ride are a little bit confusing beginning as too many different characters are introduced at the same time and you need a lot of concentration to get out who&apos;s doing what. The second point is a too predictable ending that reminds a little bit too much of many Hollywood movies. I really felt that I have already seen similar stuff a couple of times before at that point. A final showdown on a ship during a storm including terroristic pirates and a courageous military special unit that refuses to obey any orders to save the world on their own is a thing that uses too many stereotypes. Nevertheless, this movie still remains quite underrated, should get more praise and I would definitely watch this again.",

      "reviewBody": "I was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering it fun family fare. It revolves around a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by his mom to Coral Key to spend the summer with his Uncle Porter. While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. Lots of adventures ensue amid the predictable nephew / uncle bonding as well as a little romance for Sandy with a local girl.\n\nI&apos;m a great Crocodile Dundee fan myself so absolutely loved Paul Hogan in his role as crusty and comical Uncle Porter. For starters, he keeps an endless stock of Spaghetti-O&apos;s in his house to serve as his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo from The Lord of the Rings, appeared quite competent playing the young Sandy, a boy at first none too fond of his forced summer vacation locale.\n\nOf course the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Set in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental, and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the cinematic offerings for youngsters nowadays.",

Sounds like a movie you&apos;ve seen a dozen times before, but actually the screenplay holds a few twists and turns in store, thus is is not hard to sit through. The hero keeps explosive cigars in his pocket, pretends to be leader of a whole gang by using dummies with Mexican hats, has a grave digger for one of his best friends and generally is a step or two ahead of everybody else. Still, &quot;El Cisco&quot; certainly is just an average Italian western. William Berger, who usually was no.2 in the cast, is exceptionally the only star here. Since he was a good actor who could do more than just keep up the pokerface, it is one good reason to watch this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone who wants to see this should be prepared that &quot;Oi! Warning&quot; is no Hollywood-cliché like &quot;American History X&quot; which deals with a predictable &quot;bad-skinhead-becomes-imprisoned-makes-friendship-with-a-negro-and-turns-to-good-man&quot;-plot. This movie is pure realism, almost like a documentary! The film is shot in black/white, sometimes the pictures are pretty elegant and stylish, often very similar to a video clip. Mainly this film is a portrait about a fascinating but dangerous subculture yet. However, &quot;Oi! Warning&quot; is too objective to deal with old-fashioned clichés, because it shows them skinheads as men who believe in there lifestyle and their ideals. Don´t think of searching any pseudo-moral or comments, I promise, you won´t find it here! A very good film with an explosive theme and a provoking un-happy ending!!"

Manaphy is, without a doubt, the cutest Pokémon i&apos;ve ever loved and managed to get my hands on. May plays a vital role in this movie, because she has gotten along with Manaphy. the voice actors did a good job voicing the actors, but pretty decent than the 4kids voice actors were considered better than the voice actors after the pasta la vista episode. but what&apos;s great about this movie? Manaphy and it&apos;s cutest voice. the water effects were decent, so it&apos;s not that bad after all. Manaphy should definitely make more appearances, like every other episodes in a hypothesis spin off other than Pokémon chronicles. as i mentioned, May is my favorite Pokémon character along with Mira, Molly Hale, leader Whitney, leader Jasmine, leader Roxanne, leader Flannery, leader Winona, leader Maylene, leader Candice, leader Elesa, and leader Skyla, and a good possibility of Iris with a dragon-type Unova Pokémon with her. Pokemon of Japan, you&apos;ve made my Pokemon memories so light-hearted.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those early Twentieth Century Fox CinemaScope potboilers where the studio sent (most of) the cast and crew to actual locations and took full DeLuxe Color advantage of places that most of the potential audience would never visit in real life. So, the bustling and already festooned-with-highrises city of Hong Kong is the principal setting for the jumping-off point of the plot. It&apos;s pretty obvious that Gable is actually there in Hong Kong for a few of the shots but Susan Hayward, embroiled in a custody battle after her divorce from Lex Barker, didn&apos;t dare leave the U.S., or her chances of caring for her children by that marriage might have been scotched. Therefore long shots and a few medium ones of her were cleverly arranged with a double and she performs all of her closeups, et cetera, safely ensconced on the Fox soundstages in West Los Angeles and against some rather good back projections.\n\nGable and Hayward are a pretty good team and Michael Rennie lends his usual elegant support. Gene Barry has a rather thankless role as Susan&apos;s eventually rejected husband, and the supporting cast, including the Asians appearing as various Chinese, are all convincing under Edward Dmytryk&apos;s workmanlike direction.\n\nFor me the real stars, however, are Leo Tover&apos;s excellent use of the CinemaScope lenses and, once again, Hugo Friedhofer&apos;s atmospheric score. In my opinion, no other Hollywood master of the full orchestral enhancement was able to cue the audience and call up some real emotion with so few bars of music. This film is a sterling example of his art. Just check out the closing few moments of the film. He could send you out of the theater convinced you&apos;d seen something even better than what you had actually viewed!"

      "reviewBody": "I saw this at the Montreal Film Festival, which this year is showcasing German cinema.  Leo und Claire is based on a real story, the account of a German Jewish manufacturer who was tried and executed for having sexual relations with a young Aryan woman.  But this is really a love story, and the new title, which focuses on the relationship between the man and his wife, Claire, puts the emphasis in the right place.  Although Leo was innocent of the charge, he was certainly guilty of being Jewish in Nazi Germany and the film has the courage to deal with the complicity of &quot;ordinary Germans&quot; in the persecution and destruction of the Jews.  As well, although the viewer&apos;s emotions are gripped by Leo&apos;s trial and sentence, no one watching the film will overlook the irony that in some terrible way, he got off lucky compared to what probably happened to his wife and those of his family who were still in Germany, of which nothing specific is known. The participation of Leo&apos;s daughter, Lilo, now an old woman resident in Israel, where she lived through the war years, makes the film that much more immediate.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the best movies I&apos;ve seen in a while. Not for the conservative minded or squeamish, from beginning to end there is little more than sex. But that&apos;s integral to the plot. This is a movie that showcases the violence and the decay that is just under the surface of respectable society. It&apos;s about two strong characters who begin down the road to a tragedy of their own making. It questions morality, it pushes the limits, it steps over &apos;that thin line&apos;, and it takes us over the line with it. It is human weakness, irrationality, and most of all, obsession, on film. \n\nThe acting, both in and out of the &quot;bedroom&quot; was excellent. It is sometimes hard to follow, especially with the subtitles, but that only makes watching it a second time more worth it. I&apos;ve never seen it on sale or for rent in a store, but if you have an online DVD rental service, then you&apos;ll have no problem getting a hold of it.",

It&apos;s also refreshing to see Julia Roberts before she acquired the required Hollywood Superstar Anorexic Look.\n\nSome of the scenes that make me laugh as much now as they did when I was 15: The Porsche full of fish, and JoJo&apos;s parents&apos; and boyfriend&apos;s reaction when JoJo and Bill are caught in a compromising position.  This film has some very tender moments as well.  A warning, however: the last line will probably make you groan.\n\nIt&apos;s not terribly deep, and it&apos;s not going to win the Palme D&apos;Or.  But it&apos;s well worth putting in the VCR on a quiet evening when your husband&apos;s out or your girlfriends are over."

      "reviewBody": "I saw this on the big screen in Austin, TX, in November 2007. My expectations weren&apos;t high; I had heard of Youssou N&apos;Dour through his work with Peter Gabriel and liked his music well enough, but not enough to actively pursue opportunities to hear more. After seeing this documentary, my opinion of N&apos;Dour and his music have transformed. Throughout the documentary, the twin themes of African enslavement and the liberating power of music are always in the forefront, and neither is neglected to promote the other. Instead, the themes intertwine as we follow N&apos;Dour on his trek around the world, gathering his band of champions like a musical Yul Brenner from &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; to overcome injustice and ignorance and establish the dignity of individuals and their neglected contributions to the sad history of the African Diaspora. We are shown the musicians playing and at play, each coming across with their own distinct contribution to the cause. At every stop along the way (Atlanta, New Orleans, New York, Luxembourg, and finally Dakar) the viewer is treated to musicians performing, occasionally for audiences but often enough for each other, communicating their passions and collaborating to create something larger than themselves. And N&apos;Dour is always around as ringmaster, coach, father figure and ambassador, providing a focus for the project; his charisma and the gentle ease with which he forms the project is a wonder to witness. Do they give out Nobel Prizes for music? But, importantly, this is not merely a didactic polemic about the evils of slavery; it is a celebration of the humanity in all of us and the expression of that humanity through music, and here is where the magic truly is. The film is at its best when we see the musicians play together and commune with each other beyond the boundaries of culture and language. When the Harmony Harmoneers sing in the doorway of the outpost that for many Africans was their last experience of Africa, you&apos;ll get chills. Seek this out; watch it with others and share in the joy and sorrow that is our collective experience, the pain that life can bring and the balm that is music.",

      "reviewBody": "The setup, in case you don&apos;t already know it, is this. The troops of the western Allies were bottle necked in Normandy, France, for the first month or so after the D-Day landings. The armies finally broke through the German defenses and Gen. George Patton&apos;s Third Army rapidly advanced across central and northern France. So rapidly that they outpaced their supply lines. The U.S. Army put together a truck convoy system to keep Patton&apos;s forces supplied and named it the Red Ball Express. Aside from managing to keep up with Patton&apos;s advance, the outfit is also noted for being one of the few integrated units in the U.S. armed forces at the time--I use the term &quot;integrated&quot; somewhat guardedly, since that usually meant white senior officers leading black junior officers and enlisted men, which is not what would first come to my mind as &quot;integrated.&quot; Regardless, around 75% of the servicemen in the Red Ball Express were African Americans.\n\nYou wouldn&apos;t know that from this movie, where the ratio seems to have been reversed. However, I&apos;m willing to give the filmmakers some credit for at least trying to address the integration issue at the time when they were working rather than castigate them for not doing what we might expect a present-moment filmmaker to do. That&apos;s not the real problem with this movie as a movie. Acting is not the problem with this movie, either, as another reviewer suggested. The acting is workmanlike--neither outstanding nor poor, just efficient. No, the weakness of this movie is that it is simply another cliché-ridden war movie; blame not the messengers, but rather the script. First, there is the clichéd unit. Our two lead characters have a troubled past and, surprise surprise, are forced to work together in the same outfit (&quot;of all the gin joints in all the towns . ..&quot;). The unit has a romantic, it has a &quot;runt&quot; of the litter with glasses, it has a stolid misunderstood commander, it has a guy clearly from Brooklyn, and so forth. Just like any other war movie of the day (think of, say, &quot;Air Force&quot; or &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot;). What&apos;s new here for the time is that the filmmakers exchanged African Americans for some of the other stereotypical roster of &quot;average Americans&quot; you got in any war movie. Notably, there are NO characters who are clearly supposed to be white Southerners--an omission that itself speaks volumes about how sensitive race relations were in the early 1950s in the U.S. and especially in the then-recently desegregated U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe clichéd unit is indicative of the rest of the flick. You&apos;ve seen this movie before. Bunch of misfits forced to work together overcome their differences and become a cohesive fighting unit--well, except here I never really got the sense we were watching an outfit of misfits. Yes, there&apos;s the guy with the racial issue vs. Sidney Poitier, and yes, there&apos;s the lead characters with the troubled past--one of whom is the main stumbling block that&apos;s keeping this outfit from fully coming together (what&apos;s that you say? That setup sounds like &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;? no wait, &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;? no, wait . . .)--but the movie is in too much of hurry to get this outfit on the road to really *show* how this outfit becomes a team. Essentially it just is. What else, you ask? How about the sweet-talking American and the saucy French girl? Rivalry with another outfit, with other outfit finally recognizing our heroes are indeed Heroes? The guys who think there mission is going to be a cakewalk only to discover the Harsh Reality Of War? Etc., etc.\n\nOh, the movie is solid enough and hits all the standard points--some action, some down time, some roughhousing, a romantic moment or two, some grousing, some &quot;let&apos;s pull together&quot; time--and some of the cast members are likable enough that, all told, you won&apos;t feel like you wasted your time watching this one. However, aside from the then-timely touch of trying to show an integrated outfit there&apos;s nothing here to see you haven&apos;t seen before.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, without a doubt, is the best dramatic film I have ever seen. It is truly an extraordinary film of humanity. To start out, the film begins in complete silence and gently flows into Pachalbel&apos;s &quot;Canon in D&quot;. It has become my favorite movie and I can say with 100% certainty that it deserved every Oscar it received. I cannot truly articulate with words what this movie did to me when I first saw it. I had an epiphany-like experience. I was born in 1980 and didn&apos;t see this film until shortly after I turned 19. The events portrayed by Timothy Hutton, Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, Judd Hirsch, Elizabeth McGovern, Dinah Manoff, and Fredric Lehne are just as powerful and relevant in society today as they were 20 years ago. Timothy Hutton&apos;s performance of Conrad Jarrett, an 18 yr-old suffering from depression after the tragic death of his older brother is extraordinary. Being the age Hutton was when he made the film, when I first saw it twenty years later, I related to the emotions on every note. Teenagers are rarely portrayed in film as realistically as in real life. In my opinion, Conrad Jarrett in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; is the best portrayal on film of a teenage boy going through the good times and the bad, but mostly the bad.  Timothy Hutton is a truly amazing actor. Mary Tyler Moore also deserved all of the praise and nomination for a role that is literally the opposite of anything she had ever played before. The way she portrayed the cold, cruel, yet emotionally-hidden Beth Jarrett is outstanding. Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch also gave performances that made them truly believable as Calvin Jarrett and Dr. Berger. Sutherland should have received an Oscar nomination. Elizabeth McGovern and Dinah Manoff&apos;s small character roles as Jeannine Pratt and Karen are just as vivid as in the novel. Jeannine provides the excellent uplift in the story; while Karen provides the semblance of reality that things are not as they seem. Every line and every scene in this film is as detrimental to the overall underlying theme as it is in the novel by Judith Guest. The words &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;love&quot; have an immense importance in this film. Kudos to Robert Redford, who shows that he is not only an excellent actor, but also a truly excellent director. The color scheme, music scheme, setting in Lake Forest, Illinois and that &quot;perfect&quot; home all provide the exact backdrop to the circumstances going on between these characters and within Conrad himself. This film relies solely on the realistic interaction between &quot;ordinary&quot; people living through &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstances. This film had an amazing impact on me and I&apos;m sure it will do the same for anyone else who sees it. If you do not leave this film having gained that underlying insight that this film gives, then you did not truly understand the purpose of the film. You don&apos;t have to suffer from depression or go through the loss of a loved one to understand the message delivered by this film. It&apos;s definitely more than just a &quot;tissue&quot; movie. Truly one of the best films ever made.\n\nA 10 out of 10.",

The inevitable march to the macabre resolution, leaves lots of room for speculation about who the villains are and how much of the world around us is our own doing.  This movie, like its Kubrick contemporary, was major ratings controversy because the sex and violence was &quot;disturbing&quot;  - unlike the real thing which seems like so much fun on TV."

      "name": "Slow Artsy Film with Outstanding Taylor Performance",
      "reviewBody": "Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and Noel Coward in a Joseph Losey film from a screenplay by Tennessee Williams with music by John Barry and cinematography by Douglas Slocombe. These credits alone should promise an award-caliber prestige film, but, unfortunately, the production of &quot;Boom&quot; was flawed from the beginning, and arguably one of Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s finest late-career performances was buried when the film bombed. The foundation of a film is its screenplay, and, based on one of Williams&apos;s lesser known, lesser quality plays, &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&apos;t Stop Here Anymore,&quot; the film is slow, often tedious, difficult to fully comprehend, and hard to sit through. Taylor and Burton were fresh from career highs with &quot;Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; and their decision to appear in such an uncommercial endeavor is mystifying. &quot;Boom&quot; was among the first of these missteps that led to the couple&apos;s demise at the box office.\n\nFlora &quot;Sissy&quot; Goforth is a lonely woman of immense wealth, who reigns supreme over her servants and a nurse upon a rocky Italian island; evidently quite ill, Sissy is demanding and often cruel to those around her. Enter Chris Flanders, a some-time poet with an address book whose pages list the names of deceased women; also known as the &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; Flanders washes up on the shores of Sissy&apos;s island. For some bitchy spice, Flora&apos;s flamboyant friend, the Witch of Capri, arrives and is carried on the shoulders of a muscular servant up to the villa. Taylor is much too beautiful, young, and vibrant to be a dying recluse, although she is excellent in a part that echoes her Oscar-winning Martha. Burton is always worth watching, and his magnificent voice gives some of Williams&apos;s lines the poetic justice they deserve. Coward is Coward and is amusing in his few scenes.\n\nThe visuals are often striking; the Sardinian scenery is magnificent; and a white Mediterranean villa, perched atop a cliff, and filled with striking art works, makes a suitable backdrop for the actors who are garbed in outlandish Japanese-inspired costumes. However, Barry&apos;s music is intrusive and inappropriate at times, and, unfortunately, Joseph Losey&apos;s direction is self-consciously arty, and he uses much symbolism, even beyond Williams&apos;s obvious Goforth, Angel of Death, and Witch of Capri monikers. Taylor is always dressed in white, while Burton is wrapped in a black samurai kimono and often carries a sword. Burton references the film&apos;s title several times, which is taken from the boom of the waves against the rocks below the villa. &quot;Boom&quot; is generally slow, pretentious, ponderous, talky, and difficult to recommend to any non-fans of Taylor, Burton, or Williams. However, for Taylor-Burton devotees, the film is essential viewing, and they will not be disappointed by Taylor&apos;s performance or Burton&apos;s reading of William&apos;s lines.",

      "reviewBody": "Buñuel seems to be even more brilliant without the screenplays by Salvador Dali (un Chien Andalou, l&apos;Age d&apos;or, both 1930). Of course Jean-Claude Carriere is not a small name either, but Buñuel must be the great mind behind this masterpiece. Fantome seems to take off right from the premises of &apos;Le Voie lactee&apos; (1969), as people seem to move in mysterious ways and mysterious things happen to them, there sometimes even seems to be time-traveling. Anything can happen along the way. But whereto leads the way? Who knows the direction and if so, does that direction make sense and to whom?\n\nYes, this film raises a lot of questions and that must be Buñuel&apos;s greatest power: question what you&apos;ve always taken for granted. In any way, Buñuel continues his &apos;unrestricted creativeness&apos; as someone on IMDb named it. Absurd, bizarre, subversive, anti-clericism, magic realism, surrealism, sophistry, you name it! Everything is in here. He seems to have returned to the experimental years (1929, 1930) completely. He probably thought he could get away with that because Charme discret de la bourgeoisie (1972) won an Academy Award for best foreign picture and Buñuel figured that everybody would be going to see this film, no matter how off the wall it was.\n\nIn Voie Lactee is a heated conversation between a catholic and a Jesuit about personal freedom that comes to a mysterious compromise when the Jesuit exclaims: &apos;Ma liberte est un fantom!&apos; That is worked out here in Fantome de la liberte for a wider audience, in that we don&apos;t have to know much about the differences between catholics and Jesuits to be able to understand what&apos;s going on. Well, maybe most of the time. The other part it is just plain fun to watch and get your world turned upside down (That&apos;s why Catch-22 (Nichols, 1970) is my personal favourite film).\n\nCinematographer Edmond Richard (Charme discret de la bourgeoisie 1972, Cet obscure object du desir 1977) who should have won an Academy Award for &apos;Le Proces&apos; (Welles, 1963) demonstrates that he can collaborate with Buñuel fabulously in Buñuel&apos;s last three films. Still I feel I&apos;m missing the point of this film by a long shot. But that just gives me a reason to see it again soon! For now I&apos;m just very thankful that someone recommended this to me.\n\n10 points out of 10 :-)"

The Movie has a few Scenes where His Aides Instruct the Newsreel Cameraman to Film the General from a Low Angle, &quot;He loves that technique.&quot;. He used Props (corncob pipe) to give Himself a Unique Flair and His Filmed Entrances are Legendary.\n\nMacArthur was not only a Brilliant General, He was a Brilliant Man. His Eloquent way with Words, making His Arguments and displayed Insights with a Poetic Zeal. All of the Aforementioned is seen in this Even Handed Account, originally Made-for TV than Edited for a Theatrical Release.\n\nThe Film is Sweeping in Concept, if not in Presentation. It&apos;s somewhat Low-Budget renders a Flat Production, but it makes up for it with Peck&apos;s Command of the Role and an Appropriately Wordy Script.\n\nAbove Average and a Powerful Portrayal of just over a Decade in the Complicated and ever Interesting Leader who was much Loved by the American People, the Philippines, and Japan (for His compassionate and intelligent restructuring of the island&apos;s ashes).\n\nPresident Truman did not Worship the General, as many did and the Movie ends with MacArthur Relieved by the Commander and Chief. It seems even the Accomplished Military Leader was Unable to &quot;Walk On Water&quot;, and was Symbolically Crucified by the President.",

      "reviewBody": "This film truly deserves 5 stars plus. It is beautiful, thought provoking and poignant. The acting is superb, especially on the part of the obviously talented Danish actress Line Kruse, who plays the role of a willful, spoiled and materially indulged child. She is also spiritually and emotionally starved by her distant and self absorbed parents. After staging her own kidnapping, she stumbles upon a simple Swedish ex-con and sewer worker (acted wonderfully by Borje Ahlstedt)who is basically viewed as a social outcast amongst his fellow workers and neighbors. The tender friendship that ensues between the two social opposites is extremely touching. The setting for this Danish film is during the 1930&apos;s and it captures the period in beautiful style. I own this movie on VHS and am hoping that it will be released on DVD sometime soon. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves meaningful and beautiful movies.",

I first saw Chase in a few movies about 20 years ago on a channel that went belly up. Thanks to TCM for bring these wonderful movies back. All of us movie lovers owe them tons of gratitude. His movies with Betty Mack may portray the most warmth and charm ever captured on film, especially for his brand of wacky comedy. I missed the beginning of this movie but I did catch the final song that he and Betty sang - it doesn&apos;t get any better and thankfully I did get to see this much. I hope you get a chance see them paired again in the movies, &quot;I&apos;ll Take Vanilla&quot; and &quot;The Chases of Dimple Street. &quot; Meanwhile I&apos;ll wait for TCM to re-run &quot;Another Wild Idea.&quot; \n\nThe funny, frustrated and dapper Charley died when he was only about 47 years old - somehow he was just forgotten - like a forgotten Easter egg. Betty Mack got her start mostly in those early western (cowboy) movies, but she never went too far in the movie business, always in supporting roles. Betty had a smile that could melt an iceberg and she quietly laughed with her eyes - she lived to be 79."

      "reviewBody": "I seem to have a knack for stumbling upon obscure little movies, which is how I ended up watching this entry in the Canon of Dacascos. Some endorsement, I know, but this surprised me for a low-budget actioner in a decade rampant with them.\n\nThe plot, with its blatant chess metaphors and convoluted twists, is a lot of nonsense, as is par for the course. However, now and again the script shows flashes of genuine intelligence and attention to detail that offset the boilerplate dialogue. Even at just under 100 minutes it drags a few times - a couple of action scenes back-to-back followed by stretches of exposition - but never becomes outright boring. Those action scenes are fairly routine affairs, with a bit too liberal use of John Woo level slow-mo. However, there are a couple good uses of pre-Matrix bullet cam, even if the effects haven&apos;t dated very well.\n\nMark Dacascos has always had an interesting screen presence without being much of an actual actor. Fortunately, the movie recognizes this and surrounds him with a strong supporting cast, including a delightfully hammy Tony Todd and vets Graham Greene and the late John Neville. Unfortunately, it also doesn&apos;t play to his strengths - there are only a couple of fight scenes, which are not only painfully brief and sloppily edited, there&apos;s a sense they aren&apos;t even necessary. The role doesn&apos;t embarrass Dacascos in any way, but it&apos;s not particularly suited to him either. A pre-Matrix Carrie-Anne Moss does decent work as a co-lead, even if the script isn&apos;t particularly interested in her as a character either. Todd gives the best performance in a walk, by virtue of not caring how far over the top he&apos;s going or how often his exaggerated accent just kinda wanders off.\n\nThis is an efficient enough time-waster that functions best as a stepping stone for its two leads to bigger and better things. It&apos;s kind of the same for viewers: there are definitely better and worse action films out there, and this does a decent job bridging the gap.",

      "reviewBody": "An optimistic film with a morale. Nothing is out of tune in this movie starred by Michele Laroque and then, the rest. Jacques Gamblin gives one of his stellar appearances, a hardened loner that can speak poetically seemingly at all the right moments.\n\nThis film starts when most finish: we witness a solid love between a couple in their 40s. Another thing I like is that: am fed up of teenagers pretending to act when they can barely deliver lines :)! \n\n&quot;Il Mio refugio&quot;, the music accompanying the end titles, is the best chosen soundtrack: it gives the exact nuance of a film that doesn&apos;t pretend much, and though not shying away from showing us feelings, achieves a lot. Léo gets better lines, but &quot;Moumousse&quot; could show with her regard that she is in love even to somebody who never learnt any (verbal) language! \n\nThe hypocrisy of the sister in law, the fidelity but at the same time moral condemnation of the maid, and above all the leisurely times of a working class bar at ... (a coastal town, rather affluent) make this film a pleasure to the mind as well as to the senses. Her son, gullible but not devoid of dignity, is pivotal. Very well cast.\n\nGreat shots of this seaside town, makes you almost want to have lived there all your life. Shot in different tows of the &quot;Var&quot; (?) county, in France. Thanks IMDb, as usual, for their obsessive interest in film! What would we do without you!\n\nIt&apos;s no wonder this film was such a huge success.",

      "reviewBody": "Degueyo is an exceptional spaghetti western. It&apos;s not among the greatest but it&apos;s just barely under the top tier spaghetti westerns imo. What i especially liked were several things. First and foremost the plot, is linear, actually makes sense and is complex enough to keep your attention. 2nd, main Characters are given enough back story that you care about them. 3rd, they do mostly logical things, ie when a baddie is dispatched the protagonists actually take their weapons and ammo knowing they&apos;ll need it later.\n\nPerformances are good and overall a very grim feel pervades throughout. Dan Vadis as the main bad guy is excellent, he moves with great energy and you can tell he relished this role. Rossi Stuart as well does great as the hero.\n\nThe film is fairly violent for its time and let&apos;s just say not too many of the characters get out of it alive. My highest marks would go to the script / plot. Much tighter than most spaghetti westerns and more complex. No, it&apos;s not perfect but it&apos;s very enjoyable and I&apos;ve seen a lot of italian westerns. Just know that this is basically a siege type plot/ primarily taking place in the town itself, so no emphasis on expansive Vistas or impressive desert visuals. Anyway, recommended and currently can be seen on YouTube.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It&apos;s a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers&apos; biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it&apos;s simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. It&apos;s difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm&apos;s Deep is simply unreal; it&apos;s unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It&apos;s much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great &apos;features&apos; of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a &apos;star,&apos; and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix&apos;s &apos;Bullet Time.&apos; The battle of Helm&apos;s Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli&apos;s visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers&apos; final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore&apos;s score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don&apos;t think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf&apos;s passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner&apos;s Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan&apos;s theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an &apos;A-list&apos; composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the &apos;A-list,&apos; right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",

      "reviewBody": "While not quite as romantic as the previous feature film, SHARPE&apos;S CHALLENGE, this action-packed adventure is a wonderful farewell to the bad boy English rifleman and his colorful friends and enemies. \n\nPersonally, I would have ended the series at the end of SHARPE&apos;S CHALLENGE, when Sharpe has the opportunity to marry a loyal, courageous, and truly stunning general&apos;s daughter and become a general himself in the famed East India Company. \n\nBut instead, Sharpe is just trying to get home, and he is roped into escorting a spoiled French beauty through the Indian countryside, and villains are after her, and one thing just leads to another till pretty soon Sharpe is like Moses leading dozens of castaways in search of safety and a new beginning. \n\nWhere CHALLENGE had the feeling of an Arabian Nights adventure, with most of the action among Indian palaces and Royalty, PERIL is more rugged and down to earth, with a virtual &quot;wagon train&quot; journeying through hostile territory like an old fashioned American Western. There are battles every ten minutes and sword fights every five minutes. Sharpe&apos;s followers include a lot of Western types familiar from movies like STAGECOACH and MAJOR DUNDEE. The useless missionary, the plucky pregnant woman, the loyal Indian companion, the drunken or lazy troopers, all have their parts to play. \n\nWhat lifts the story above Western territory, however, is the way in which Sharpe himself is forced to look for closure to his personal dramas. Some of his most deadly enemies reappear (or their sons do) and there are some unexpected discoveries on all sides. The most poignant scenes in the story all revolve around Sharpe coming to terms with past regrets and resolving conflicts. All of it was wonderful, even if Sharpe&apos;s French blonde love interest in PERIL isn&apos;t quite as demure or winning as English blonde love interest in CHALLENGE. \n\nBut both movies are Sharpe classics, both great farewells to a true hero!",

      "reviewBody": "Next to Joe Dante&apos;s minor exploitation classic, this is already the second &quot;Jaws&quot;-rip off that revolves on piranhas, but the comparison stops right there with the mutual choice of killer fish as the sea monsters. Dante&apos;s film is of course better and more relevant, but &quot;Killer Fish&quot; is a typical Italian exploitation product and thus delivers too many grotesque story lines, some neat gore and an unusual cast. Heck, I&apos;m not even sure this film fully qualifies as a &quot;Jaws&quot;-rip off since the main plot involves a diamond heist instead of a besieged tourist resort. Although... it has that, too! A well-organized bunch of thieves successfully complete their diamond robbery and lower the loot to the bottom of the lake for safety reasons. After 60 days  if the police give up their search  they will collect the diamonds again and split. In order to guard his precious jewels, criminal mastermind Paul Diller infested the lake with ravenous piranhas that can regularly nibble from the double-crossing team members. Meanwhile, one of the crooks falls for a model with a speech-defect and a tropical hurricane busts a large dam, allowing the piranhas to spread themselves all across the touristy waters. Antonio Margheriti&apos;s &quot;Killer Fish&quot; suffers from a slightly tedious and hesitant opening half hour, but it get more adventurous once the first victim is devoured under the water. The piranha effects as well as the underwater cinematography are a bit disappointing but this film has an irresistible 70&apos;s charm, complete with cool soundtrack and stereotypical characters. Lee Majors is excellent as the macho with more hair on his chest than brains in his skull and Karen Black is a great shrew. Not as good as I hoped, but a fun piece of Italian trash nonetheless.",

And how about this one? Is it worth seeing AH-NULD one more time? Must answer YES....and NO! Despite having seen a constant decline in the quality of his final films, they are still a cut above a lot of the action movies produced in Hollywood today. So, if the ACTION genre is your thing...The answer is &quot;YES&quot;. For everyone else, I think the words &quot;I &quot;YO PASO&quot; are the most apropos.\n\n&quot;Collateral&quot;, filmed BEFORE 9/11, with its Colombian terrorists detonating bombs on U. S. soil, passes from the category of Fiction to that of Fairy Tale! The bad guy here is a narco-guerrilla/terrorist named Claudio Perini, willing to sacrifice it ALL...for the &quot;Cause&quot;.(All the Colombians I know named Perini are UP-STANDING law-abiding citizens) The most chilling aspect of this film, is a mother so perverse and diabolic, she sacrifices her only son, with the dispassionate air of someone taking out the trash!\n\nThusly, Hollywood serves up a distorted and grotesque image of Colombia in this movie. Seems to me like the ones experiencing the most &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; are the viewers of the film itself! 5.5*, rounded DOWN to 5*.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was playing in the bargain bin of my TV at 1 AM in the morning, which did not bode well for its quality. And while this is clearly not high-quality material, I am not entirely sure what to think of this movie. There is something interesting and different here.\n\nThe first half is a dreamy war movie. A man is recruited as a mercenary for a rescue job in Afghanistan. He is broke and has post war nightmares but agrees to put his team back together.\n\nThe second half of the movie is where things get weird. In Afghanistan the team eventually encounters paranormal dangers...and that is where the movie turns sour.\n\nThe camera work is not great, but it is OK. Some shots linger for longer than needed and some camera angles are questionable. It feels like there are inexperienced people working behind the scenes. However, the desert where the film was shot is pretty and the Middle-Eastern feeling carries over nicely.\n\nThe transition between shots starts making less and less sense towards the 2nd half; the story starts making less and less sense; the dialogue and character&apos;s actions start making less and less sense until the movie turns into an episode of a sci-fi channel show.\n\nThe acting is not bad. Michael Madon showed up for a paycheck and there are a few mid-tier actors, but the film becomes so poorly directed and written, that everyone starts either over-acting or under-acting.\n\nAudiences have been indoctrinated to expect a fast-paced logical and sensible movie with a particular Hollywood structure and a specific genre, while this movie is a bit different from that norm. This is exactly the kind of movie you should experience alone, late at night, in a state of partial trance, and after it is over, you ask yourself what the hell you just experienced. In spite of it coming apart at the seams more and more, the movie actually kept my interest until the end.\n\nAt the same time, the film fails at what it tries to be. It starts out as a slow-cooking psychological war movie but it goes downhill from there until it becomes a z-movie thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "This might not sound like a recommendation, but when you consider the film&apos;s subject matter, &quot;painful&quot; is actually a good word to describe THE GREY ZONE&apos;s brilliance. Director Tim Blake Nelson has crafted a fascinating portrayal of the Sonderkomando, Jewish concentration-camp prisoners who help the Nazis in order to ensure for themselves a few extra months of life, as well as creature comforts denied to the other prisoners. The script and cast are equally effective. David Arquette proves himself to be not merely the idiot bastard son of the Arquette family with a powerful performance; Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi are brilliant as always. The film&apos;s real strength, making it the greatest Holocaust film I&apos;ve ever seen, is its relevance; we may think ourselves to noble to sell out our brethren to save our own lives, but we would certainly reconsider if actually faced with this choice. In the end, Nelson brilliantly implies that perhaps the nightmare world of the Sonderkomando is really not so different from our own workaday reality.",

And I am... definitely too old for nowadays.\n\nThis is technically one of those movies about a stranger that blows into a conservative town and teaches everyone to loosen up and let go of their inhibitions. Except now it&apos;s a kids movie about a chaotic little girl so unstoppable she&apos;s basically magic.\n\nIt&apos;s an extremely, extremely simple movie, full of actors trying to do their best impressions of living cartoon characters. It&apos;s over an hour of kids just... playing around, upsetting adults, and defying just about every physical and natural law on earth.\n\nIt&apos;s not the worst idea, but it&apos;s a lot of fluff. And I mean a lot. It goes down a lot easier when you&apos;re younger.\n\nAnd the thing is, my memories from being a kid lead me to remember a lot more about the first half of the movie than the second half, because eventually it realizes it&apos;s run out of road. The last 20-30 minutes are practically a completely separate movie.\n\nI may have been a bit bored, but honestly, I can&apos;t be too upset about it. It&apos;s not Pippi&apos;s fault. I&apos;m hardly this movie&apos;s target audience anymore, and at the bare minimum, it&apos;s nice to revisit these memories. There was a version of me that loved this movie, and it&apos;s good to get in touch with that once in a while.",

This is the middle one, following the silent Joe May got away from Fritz Lang which fitted into the Line of CALIGARI and METROPOLIS and preceding Lang&apos;s entry in the Eurotrash cycle of the sixties. It was a major hit for the Third Reich film industry and one of their most ambitious undertakings. It&apos;s pretty hard to look at it without remembering the politics.\n\nThis 1938 version is lifted by extensive location filming - snapping crocodiles, Maharadscha Philip Dorn / Frits van Dongen and so blonde Kitty Jantzen riding in the triumphal parade, locals pelting the cage of the captured killer tiger, two elephants battling it out as an entertainment.\n\nThe drama that this is slotted into, played by blacked up Europeans, is another matter. Dorn understandably takes a dim view of Russian intruder Gustav Diessel making off with so gorgeous Maharani La Jana and once the couple become fugitives in Europe he mounts murderous revenge.\n\nUnaware of this, German architect Hans Stüwe is commissioned to build a new city - waving of blue prints and one shot of workers pounding earth by hand). Think Chandigarh. The work includes a tomb for the still living La J.\n\nThrow in Theo Lingren&apos;s comic relief, La Jana&apos;s splendid hoochy coochy dancing and lots of extras in turbans in elaborate studio decors and you have the Maria Montez formula which will flourish in Hollywood post WW2\n\nThe dance numbers are highlights of all three versions. The theater fire which ends part one coming on top of La Jana&apos;s Indira routine is a hard act to follow and while the production values persist part two is a bit on the scrappy side.\n\nThis chaotic exotic-erotic adventure movie gives anything in it&apos;s area a run for the money. You watch it with a mix of sit back and enjoy it pleasure and unease about the underlying attitudes."

Mestema is a Satan-like evil wizard who wants to pit his magical prowess against the technology of the hero. He does so by transporting the newly-outfitted computer tech to various scenarios that he then has to escape from/defeat the monstrous villains in his way. These scenarios include an ice cave filled with random statuary (a wolfman, a witch doctor, Jack the Ripper) that come to life and attack him; a cave with a little horned troll on a throne who commands zombie warriors; another cave (sensing a trend here?) with yet another horned troll; another scene takes place in a nightclub during a stage performance by the hairmetal band W.A.S.P., because why not? Each segment was written and directed by different people, 7 in all, which helps explain the lack of tonal consistency.

      "reviewBody": "Of all Arnold&apos;s mid-&apos;80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn&apos;t more controversial as the last, it&apos;s a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have &apos;court-appointed theatrical attorneys&apos; or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.\n\nThe biggest message of all is &apos;You are being lied to&apos;. It&apos;s no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It&apos;s a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It&apos;s no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It&apos;s edited and reshaped before being aired and it&apos;s only what the networks want you to see. Usually it&apos;s far from the real truth.\n\nAlthough rather different than Stephen King&apos;s book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say &apos;I&apos;ll be back&apos; (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he&apos;s still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).\n\nThe director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80&apos;s feel.\n\nFirst of all, Harold Faltermeyer&apos;s score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.\n\nThis new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I&apos;ve seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a &apos;Meet the Stalkers&apos; gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.",

      "name": "Bizarre German western set in Mexico starring Lex Barker",
      "reviewBody": "TREASURE OF THE AZTECS (1965) is a German/Italian western based on a novel by Germany&apos;s famed western novelist Karl May, whose fanciful view of the American west spawned a whole series of movies, including several starring former Tarzan (1949-53) Lex Barker, who is seen here in the role of Dr. Sternau. Barker, who was, for a time, the most popular movie star in Germany, is directed here by old Hollywood hand Robert Siodmak, well-known for a career which included such film noir classics as PHANTOM LADY, THE KILLERS, and CRISS CROSS.\n\nSet in Mexico at the time of the American Civil War, TREASURE details Dr. Sternau&apos;s efforts to obtain financial support for deposed president Benito Juarez&apos;s efforts to overthrow Emperor Maximilian, installed as Mexico&apos;s ruler by the French government. A host of characters is involved, including one of Juarez&apos;s treacherous captains (Rik Battaglia); a wealthy landowner sympathetic to Juarez&apos;s cause (Friedrich Ledebur); the landowner&apos;s wastrel son (Gerard Barray); Kara, an Aztec princess (Theresa Lorca) who holds the key to a source of Aztec wealth; a Bavarian clockmaker serving as comic relief (Ralf Wolter); and an American cowboy (American actor Kelo Henderson) assisting Dr. Sternau. Various parties are trying to get their hands on a cache of hidden Aztec gold, either for themselves or for the cause, and there is constant back-and-forth motion--battles between one faction and another, duels and fistfights, and the wastrel son&apos;s romancing of the Indian princess in a bid to learn the whereabouts of the treasure. It all culminates in a free-for-all inside a Mexican pyramid and a search for the gold inside an active volcano.\n\nPlot and characterization tend to get lost amidst all this activity and one can enjoy the Spanish and Yugoslavian landscapes where this was filmed while lamenting the lack of any reason to care too much about what happens. The film is ultimately undone by awkward fight scenes, B-movie plotting, and a sub-par English dub job. The production was originally planned as a three-hour epic, and then released in two parts, with the second installment titled PYRAMID OF THE SUN GOD (1965), with the same cast and crew. For the American release version, however, both films were compressed into one 105-minute feature, accounting for the choppy editing and continuity lapses in the print available for review. The VHS edition distributed in the U.S. also has serious soundtrack problems, with the English dub track laid down twice, but seriously out of sync so that every line of dialogue sounds like someone&apos;s off-camera repeating each line a beat later.\n\nThe Indians on view look nothing like the actual Indian tribes of Mexico but are decked out in war paint and headbands adorned with feathers. When we first see them, they&apos;ve got two dark-haired beauties, one of them the Aztec princess, tied to a stake, while the Indian braves dance around in a circle. Sternau and his party of three come and rescue the women from dozens of braves without suffering a scratch.\n\nAs a German/Italian western directed by a German director who&apos;d excelled in Hollywood, with a French/Italian/Spanish/German cast headed by an American star and shot in Spain and Yugoslavia, it is not without interest for those Euro-cult fans curious about such hybrids. It&apos;s got an odd tone about it, not quite stylized enough to compare with Italian westerns, but a bit too cartoonish to be taken seriously as a western. It&apos;s probably closer in spirit to the cliffhanger serials of old than to any classic westerns. This is particularly evident in the preposterous, but action-packed finale. The bombastic music score deliberately recalls certain well-known Hollywood western scores.\n\nOf special note is the participation of Hollywood actor Jeff Corey in the role of President Abraham Lincoln in a brief scene with Dr. Sternau at the beginning. Corey had worked for Siodmak back in 1946 in THE KILLERS. Neither Corey nor Barker dub their own voices on the English track. Barker had previously worked for Siodmak in the German-produced THE SHOOT (1964). Fausto Tozzi plays Benito Juarez and offers a striking resemblance to the great Mexican leader."

This &apos;Projekt Gold&apos; is not as overblown but rather honest and &apos;real&apos; with a refreshing humor, well, as handball usually is.\n\nSitting in the movie theater with at least 300 other handball fans, all wearing fake &apos;Heiner beards&apos; and crowns, it was the best movie experience ever!\n\nEven though everyone obviously knows how it ends, people were holding their breaths as if going through the whole thing again.\n\nOelsner was able to carry the atmosphere between the players and the coach with all ups and downs into the rows of the audience. At some point you were laughing your head off, at others trying to suppress tears. The emotions from the championship all came back and you basically just clap, yell and whistle as if sitting not in a movie theater but right in the gymnasium watching the game.\n\nEven though you might not be a Handball Fan it is worth watching, since Oelsner was able to show what makes handball such a great teamsport and how to celebrate the Handball World Championship 2007 again. Thanks for that!",

What a future this young man will have as an actor. Keira Knightly is really great but I want to slap her too. Alas this is reality in the real world, addictions can take over all senses, and destroy all in it&apos;s path. This really is a compelling movie and I tried to stop watching but just could not. It makes me wonder what the writer has gone thru to create such a sad story.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m assuming the comments I read on this site were written by horny guys - the accolades to Lee Remick&apos;s beauty take up most of the comments. She is absolutely gorgeous and sexy in this movie, and I agree, she&apos;s the main reason to see this film.\n\nJames Coburn has a &quot;Hard Contract&quot; in this 1969 film about a top hit man, John Cunningham, who&apos;s sent to Europe by his boss Ramsey (Burgess Meredith) to kill three people, one of whom, Michael Carlson (Sterling Hayden) was his predecessor in the job. Cummingham is a man completely detached from human emotion; he only pays for sex, won&apos;t kiss, and won&apos;t let a woman spend the night. While in Europe, he meets a beautiful woman, Sheila Metcalfe (the afore - and oft-mentioned - Remick) and her group of friends, including Adrianne (Lilli Palmer) and an ex-Nazi. Sheila falls for Cummingham, the rest of the group adopts him, and before Cunningham knows it, he&apos;s become, for the first time, part of the human race. Carlson knows what he&apos;s there for immediately, and the two have a confrontation. Cunningham has started to realize there&apos;s something in the world besides killing.\n\nThis movie makes a great effort to be deep. It doesn&apos;t really know what it is; it lacks a point of view, but it does convey a message. Some of it is kind of cryptic. I actually thought there were lines of dialogue missing from the version I saw.\n\nCoburn is very good as a man who finally realizes he can&apos;t avoid living; Remick as an outrageous, adventurous socialite gives a wonderful performance; Palmer as her dizzy friend is delightful. Hayden, never a favorite of mine, was an unusual man in real life, and I think what made him special as a person comes through here. The retired hit man is one who thought a good deal about the meaning of life, as did Hayden, and found peace within himself. Hayden, after his forays into Communism, his guilt over cooperating with the committee, and his basically going out to sea and writing, did the same thing. Karen Black has a small role as a prostitute in the beginning of the film.\n\nA really wonderful cast, an uneven film, a kind of blah ending - still worth seeing for Remick and Coburn in their primes.",

The documentary shows some scary, funny, entertaining footage. The solo interviews are perhaps a bit dragging for none-fans, except the Howard Donald interview, his story is dipped in anecdotes and great memories.\n\nThe Documentary shows us the story of Take That from the beginning in the gay scene in Manchester, touring to schools and doing under 18 shows, the first video Do What U Like with the boys covered in jelly (Nice Howard quote: &quot;I was cleaning jelly out of me arsehole for the next two years&quot;), the first entry in the charts, the crazy, hysterical fans outside their houses, fan interviews, security interviews who must have feared for the lives of the boys at some point, backstage material (Howard: &quot;Suck my sausage!&quot; Robbie: &quot;Suck my ****&quot; Mark:&quot;Stop filming us Philip you dirty b@st@rd&quot;), Robbie being stoned or boozed up or both, the major shows, Rob leaving the band, the tour that had to go on, the split and what are the boys doing today. \n\nA must have for all Take That fans, and a must see for all people that say boybands are rubbish.",

      "reviewBody": "I am not the only viewer who believes that &quot;Threshold,&quot; a very low key drama at first viewing, is outstanding film. One online review considered it one of a personal &quot;unknown &apos;ten best.&apos;&quot; I watch it again and again, completely absorbed by the intense concentration with which Donald Sutherland plays Dr. Thomas Vrain, a highly skilled and dedicated cardiovascular surgeon. Vrain meets, and has his hospital retain the services of, an offbeat biologist, Aldo Gehring (Jeff Goldblum), who is pursing the invention of an artificial heart. Against all advice and straining medical ethics, Dr. Vrain performs a successful transplant of Gehring&apos;s artificial heart to save a patient with an otherwise hopeless congenital defect. &quot;Threshold&quot; is a meticulously crafted production with impeccable, nearly mesmerizing performances in the even most minor roles. Sutherland is at his best in this film, creating so realistic a portrait of a brilliant surgeon that one physician reviewer on this site claimed to recognize several surgeons known to him personally, with Sutherland embodying both their strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps the most notable attribute of the fictitious Dr. Vrain is his total, and no doubt indispensable, commitment to and absorption in his skill. One of the film&apos;s advisors was Dr. Denton Cooley, a pioneering Dallas Surgeon; under whom Sutherland studied, and seems to have managed to portray with utter fidelity as the leading character. Cooley was the first surgeon to use an artificial heart in a patient with an irreparable heart. He was professionally reprimanded for doing it with¬out approval and so started his own hospital, The Texas Heart Institute. The film very loosely follows this little known event, and it is worth seeing if only for the strength of Sutherland&apos;s portrayal, no less than its high production values and the assured performances of the entire cast. This was a Canadian production. For some reason it was never transcribed to DVD in Canada, although versions are available from the Czech Republic, Germany, even Greece. I have a gradually deteriorating VHS tape, which will no doubt wear out in the watching of it. The vagaries of licensing agreements seem to have claimed yet another creative victim.",

Many will be distracted by the subject matter and tune out, but try to hang on.\n\nJoe Mantegna&apos;s Bobby Gold  is a tough cop who denies his Jewish lineage, until a low priority murder investigation into an aged Holocast survivor forces him to re-evaluate his entire existence. The resulting destruction of the man is cruel and never-ending,and brilliant.\n\nWilliam H. Macy, an until-now bit player, gets a well-deserved promotion  to #2 man among the strong supporting cast as Gold&apos;s partner and sounding board.\n\nThe intricacies of the plot, the subtleties of the subtext, as well as the perfunctory Mamet attention to detail may mean a second, or third look is necessary for the viewer to get straight with what&apos;s going on------- but take the time, if you can, it just keeps getting better and better."

      "reviewBody": "One of best post-perestroika Russian movies. A girl becomes a prostitute, then gets a chance to leave Russia and have a normal family. But it&apos;s beyond her. Longing for motherland, not very friendly strangers around, no love, no mom, all of this leads her to death (presumably).\n\nElena Yakovleva is at her best as always. She is so perfect, so real. And so Russian :)\n\nIn general it&apos;s not really very interesting movie, just a glance into Russia after perestroika, when so many things got ruined. And maybe in a way a hint to those so many girls leaving Russia in search for better life. There is no place like home, you know...\n\nI advise to watch it, I watched it yesterday and it was so nice, so many flashbacks. Mind you, now Russia has changed drastically since then. Still one of best movies made after perestroika, we haven&apos;t got that many nice movies yet as in Soviet time, whatever they say, but majority of Russians long for that time, when everything was so simple and stable. When state took care of citizens (OK OK sometimes maybe overtook) and didn&apos;t just rob them as now.\n\nAs for the previous comment - yes, Ingeborga is a good actress. And Lithuanian, so what, unlike some other countries (we know yes what we are talking about), we always welcome all people, not depending on their nationality. Russians just don&apos;t care if Lithuanian or Georgian, we have a lot and it&apos;s normal. There is no bad feeling. OK, Soviet Union doesn&apos;t exist anymore, but we don&apos;t blame any other nationality in our problems :-P",

The PBS viewing showed a little clip after the film which discussed the strange trial results, which was probably the biggest problem with the film - it pretty much ends with the bankruptcy of enron and doesn&apos;t show much about the trials, since they took place later, although they would make for a great inclusion. To me, the most incredible part of the film is that fact that these guys would stand up every day and tell bold-faced lies to the employees, the government, the investors, and make it all sound good. They had to be thinking in the back of their head &quot;it&apos;s all going to come crashing down someday&quot;...",

The plot of this puppet movie is rather simple. A kid named Ondra, who is suffering from severe asthma, has to let go of his favorite toy - a stuffed toy named Kooky. But he isn&apos;t giving up on his favorite toy easily. Instead all the viewers are brought into his world of fairy tale like childish imagination/dream, where Kooky comes alive and tries to find his way back to Ondra. The story follows Kooky&apos;s adventures and misadventures on his journey back home as seen through the eyes of Ondra. And that childish perspective is what gives the magical feeling to this story - a child is telling the story and all the reasoning behind everything that happens to Kooky is limited to child&apos;s imagination, which is rather simple yet fascinating.",

Here&apos;s the deal I Am Omega is better than average for an asylum released product. Indeed the thing that is strange about Asylum films is that where as people liked Cannon and Full Moon, this group is universally hated and though their movies sell well the public opinion is of disgust and dislike. I Am Omega actually isn&apos;t too awful of a movie. I mean it&apos;s still a bad movie but it does have it&apos;s moments of goofy fun and with the reuniting cast of Kickboxer 5&apos;s Geoff Meed and Mark Dacascos the movie is watchable for fans of Dacascos. I think the main problem with this movie is that we know so little about how the apocalypse came and many loose ends are left at the end. That being said some of the action is okay and the movie&apos;s fast pace made it watchable. As for Asylum, I understand why people dislike their films, Transmorphers, Snakes On A Train and so on were all really awful films but I give credit to this one, in that I think fans of Dacascos will enjoy this movie. The bad acting (from everyone but Dacascos), the cheap production values and underwritten script detract the casual viewer but like I said fans of B.movies may find some enjoyment in this.\n\n* * out of 4-(Fair)",

      "reviewBody": "Hilarious Marx Bros. film with Groucho as the new president of Huxley College and Zeppo as his son, who convinces his dad to recruit professional football players to help the college&apos;s losing team. Groucho sets out to do just that but instead of getting two pros, he recruits speakeasy &apos;icemen&apos; Chico and Harpo. Chaos naturally ensues at the college leading up to the big football game, which has to be seen to be believed.\n\nAll of the brothers are in top form here, with the main three getting lots of funny bits and Zeppo getting possibly his best role from any of their films. Thelma Todd appears in her second Marx Bros. movie, playing the girlfriend of villain David Landau who sets out to seduce Zeppo and winds up seducing the rest of the brothers, too. Sadly there&apos;s no Margaret Dumont this time. This is probably the best Marx movie that didn&apos;t feature Dumont. Nat Pendleton plays one of the football players on the opposing team. Look out for Walter Brennan as a commentator on the big game. Some funny tunes and several great gags, including &quot;The password is swordfish,&quot; the crazy football game, Groucho teaching a class, and all those funny things Harpo pulls out of that coat of his. It&apos;s one of the Marx Brothers&apos; best. Definitely recommended.",

I saw this in the Brussels Cinematek, where the only copy of this film is still kept (with Dutch and French intertitles, but in good quality!).\n\nThe film consists of 15 chapters of +/- 20 minutes and lasts 5 hours. A lot happens during that time. Between the beautiful landscapes of Alaska there is frequent fighting for love, gold and a gold mine. Some action scenes were very impressive, especially when you consider that the film is from 1922: clambering in trees, sliding off icebergs, diving off rocks, escaping from fires, ...\n\nA truly forgotten gem, which is marked as &quot;presumed lost&quot; on some websites, but which fortunately still exists and is even shown (in the Brussels Cinematek with live pianomusic). A film that absolutely should be restored and released on DVD. This film serial is more captivating, more beautiful and more action-packed than most series that are made today.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the epitome of quotable movies. It&apos;s random absurdity on a level only matched by the genius of Monty Python. What is it about? Honestly, nothing. Are there any morals to be learned? Not really. Is it relatable? Most likely, not in the slightest.\n\nBut damn if it isn&apos;t one of the most hysterical, comedic masterpieces of all time. This is what movies are all about, it&apos;s about something that brings people together. And when you get a Napoleon Dynamite fan, and introduce them to another fan, what you&apos;ll get is a back-and-forth barrage of quotes and laughs and bonding that could last for hours, or even a lifetime.\n\nI personally have made a trek to Preston, Idaho where this movie was filmed, and visited all the locations in the film, including the park and the very spot where LaFawnduh played footsie with Kip. And even the locals get in on it. The way my group was dressed (we all had different shirts referencing the movie, and all of us wore the patriotic &quot;Rex Kwon Do&quot; pants), there was no doubt we were fans of the movie, and we even had a local driving by and stop to give us a map of the filming locations. Many people honked at us. And we even visited the very Deseret Industries thrift store in which Napoleon famously bought his groovy mix tape and sai, and I kid you not, we found a plastic toy sai for sale. Naturally we bought it and I sheathed it in my belt loop. We are still in awe that it was even there to begin with, and we have a theory that they have a bag full of toy sais in the back, in order to keep at least one in stock on the shelves, for obvious reasons if you&apos;ve seen the movie.\n\nBut all that is to show the affect this movie has on people. It has developed a massive cult following for a good reason. It&apos;s absolutely brilliant. Every scene generates genuine laughter. Every scene contains at least one classic quote that everybody uses when interacting in society. Every. Single. Scene. Is. GOLD. Except maybe the creepy scene with Uncle Rico in the photo shop. Other than that awkwardness, every scene is a comedic gold mine, and that is NO exaggeration.\n\nThis is a movie to be passionate about. And if you didn&apos;t get it, if you hated it, it&apos;s ok. It&apos;s not for everybody, for sure. Don&apos;t feel bad, don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re missing out. But if you haven&apos;t yet seen it, you are obligated now to find out which side of the severely polarized audience of the film you are on: Are you on the side that thought it was the stupidest thing you&apos;ve ever watched, or are you voting for Pedro and part of the nunchuck-wielding fans who can quote practically the whole movie? I promise, if you watch this movie, at the very least, all of your wildest dreams will come true.\n\nRegardless if you enjoyed it or not, unless you are in complete denial, you would have to admit the influence it had on society when it came out, and the power it still holds. Haters gonna hate, lovers gonna love.",

      "reviewBody": "When a senator&apos;s daughter gets kidnapped from a exclusive private school by her teacher Gary Soneji, the FBI are called in. However the kidnapper has his own agenda and phones Alex Cross, sucking him into the case even though he has not worked for almost a year due to the guilt he feels over the death of his partner. With the killer leaving him clues, Cross realises that Soneji is after fame and is using him to communicate to the world. Taking on Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan as his partner, Cross tries to work out enough about Soneji to profile and catch him.\n\nIt has been too many years since I saw Kiss The Girls for me to be able to comment on the quality or lack thereof in the first film but I decided to give this sequel a try anyway. From the opening scene this is pure Hollywood with its clunky CGI and its simplistic plot device of the dead partner and so we continue with a fairly uninspiring thriller that is engaging enough but never does anything that special. It doesn&apos;t help that the primetime schedules are full of versions of Alex Cross in TV series mysteries but generally this film just plods its way through a story that isn&apos;t &quot;obvious&quot; so much as it is uninspiring. It is an enjoyable enough mystery that is professionally handled but it lacks imagination and flair. The twists come but the film is not exciting enough to prevent the audience from thinking and, in thinking it is easy to rip massive holes in the logic of the whole thing  and thinking a plot is a bit silly doesn&apos;t help keep one interested. Tamahori directs without any distinction  he isn&apos;t bad but again he doesn&apos;t do anything of that much interest.\n\nInstead he sits back and hopes that Morgan Freeman doing Morgan Freeman&apos;s &quot;Zen-cool&quot; will be enough to carry the audience along with the whole affair. Luckily for him this does work to some degree because Freeman on his day could sell shoes to fish. He is solid and professional even if he is underserved by the script. Wincott is good in a role that he could have made more of but instead is controlled and restrained. Potter is blond and dull and is not suited one jot to the role that her character grows into during the film. Baker deserves a bigger role while Miller, Horsford and a few others provide familiar faces.\n\nOverall then an entertaining but uninspired affair that pushes the right buttons but doesn&apos;t aspire to anything beyond the genre. The cast and the budget help but the story gets weaker the longer it goes on and although it will do enough for some viewers, it is nothing that special."

For me, the good outweighs the bad, but the elements were here for this to have been a superb film, sadly it just isn&apos;t.\n\nI liked the way the original news footage is mixed in, it&apos;s well fused. If only they&apos;d have shown her Spitting Image character.\n\nMeryl Streep delivers an outstanding performance, she is sensational, the voice, the poise, the body language, she is fantastic. Jim Broadbent is wonderful as Dennis, the pair combined so well.\n\n6/10.",

This movie beat me in just the first 15 minutes through the small aspects of the little emotions in the relationship between friends and relatives in the family of saeko to express a secret love and in the bright of the shy girl. The episode that follows is just one part of the tragic series, the heart of broken love is the same as her crush shrunk bizarre. This is a chance for the change in emotion of saeko to be revealed true. The great story closes when the audience chooses themselves with saeko&apos;s tragedy, anger or sympathy. This film has the details and the dialogue touches the hearts of the sensitive, the character of the real, living character, the interwoven emotions even surprised me, such as the scene saeko cry. Can not believe a movie is not famous, no prizes, no star again impressed and touched me",

If you have seen the trailer you think this one is going to be a big laugh, scream comedy full of nasty humor and slapstick. But it is not! All big laughs are already included into the trailer. The other 85 minutes of this movie you will have a great time with a huge smile on your face, a small tear of emotion running down your cheek and the warm feeling in your heart, you always feel while listening to the old stories of yesterday&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "In the year 1962 this Science Fiction film arrived in our small home town at the local theater. It was called &quot; Journey to the Seventh Planet. &quot; All the kids ran to see it. Most of us were innocent youngsters and few knew anything of Science and fewer of the Solar System. During the movie with a large box of 10 cent popcorn and 5 cent coke, we watched in awe at the planet monsters, screaming in terror. The story was interesting enough, Earthmen of the future (2001) unite under the United Nation Flag, build a space ship, blast off to visit Uranus, the 7th planet. There the four spacemen wearing flimsy rubber suits, plexi-glass helmets and kitchen gloves, encounter a Blob or Mind-Creature who plans to conquer Earth and enslave the population. The giant creatures they encounter in the movie were exactly what attracted small children. As adults today, we wonder just how a cheesy, simple and hokey movie could produce such ear-splitting screams from an audience full of kids. John Agar stars as Capt. Don Graham, with Carl Ottosen, Peter Monch, Karl Ove Sprogøe as the crew. If you&apos;re an adult today, you too can create some modern nightmares in your kids, if they promise not to laugh too hard. Recommended for very young monster-seeking five-year-olds. *",

      "reviewBody": "One of Charlie Kaufman&apos;s more overlooked and underrated screenplays, &apos;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&apos; may have been something of a departure from the high-concept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren, &apos;Being John Malkovich&apos; and &apos;Adaptation&apos; (a masterpiece and a near-masterpiece, respectively) such striking breaths of fresh air, but on no account should its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated. Taking a well-earned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting, Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that was better grounded in reality; the twist there being that it was based on a story that, while allegedly true, just as likely never happened. &apos;Confessions&apos; though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst of his days as a game show host, giving life to such controversial classic as &apos;the Gong Show&apos; and &apos;the Dating Game&apos; while taking it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the scenario unfold without question  and does so with such considerable spirit and vigour that it&apos;s hard not to get lured in and pulled along for the ride. Regardless of whether the real-life Barris truly did have some incredible adventures within his time, or simply an overly-active imagination, this movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp  slick, stylish and entrancing on the surface, and with a bracingly poignant and sobering tale lurking underneath.\n\nKaufman continues to rule supreme with his flair for developing the most heavily flawed and eccentric of characters, investing them with witty dialogue and sharp situations and, as with his previous screenplays, the humour is a pleasantly mixed bag  lightly amusing at some points, laugh-out-loud hilarious at others, even outright alarming whenever it needs to be. George Clooney&apos;s direction, meanwhile, though it stands a fair distance from the eye-seizing zippiness that we&apos;re used to seeing Spike Jonze apply to this writer&apos;s workings, is still an accomplished visual take on the material, made sensational by its meticulous attention to detail. Indeed, the film&apos;s fondness for subtle in-jokes, crafty cameos (some great ones among the Dating Game contestants  absolutely great), background gags and general all-round intricacy is partly what makes it so rewarding and worthy of repeated viewings (I was watching it for what must have been sixth or seventh time last night, and still I found myself picking up a whole range of details that I somehow missed out on the first few times around). Sure, things can move a tad slowly every now and then, but with this number of niceties up there to be marvelled at you know you&apos;re never for a second going to be bored.\n\nIt also draws a fine contrast between the two separate pursuits that Chuck Barris is called to follow  the game show scenes are colourful, light-hearted fun, the assassin scenes murky and deliciously paranoid, and Sam Rockwell, at the helm as our savvy and hapless main man, has the timing, the energy and the appeal to emerge from the two as both a comic figure and a tragic one. Kicking off as a likable, familiar kind of anti-hero, whose goofy grin and offhand ways have us smiling through the bar fights and the womanising, he gradually evolves into something more enigmatic and sorrowful; a lost, confused individual whose more innocuous contributions to society, in the form of lowbrow &apos;trash TV&apos;, are widely scorned (not that I&apos;ve ever seen any of the genuine Chuck Barris&apos;s shows myself, but it would amaze me if they were really any worse than the kind of mind-numbing reality TV that&apos;s enjoyed popularity over the past few years), while the hidden talent he discovers in contract killing begins to understandably repulse him soon enough. One of the most effective things about &apos;Confessions&apos; is just how deftly it uses its gags and its pathos, along with interview snippets from those who were acquainted with the real-life Barris, which punctuate the story at various points, to reflect upon this man, his life, and just how much he really achieved either way, arriving in the end at quite a biting conclusion. I don&apos;t think that any other rendition of &apos;If I had a Hammer&apos; could feel nearly as sad and haunting as it does here.\n\nDrew Barrymore and Clooney himself offer nice support all the while, each epitomising different ends of the Chuck Barris spectrum  Barrymore, as Chuck&apos;s bubbly girlfriend Penny, is a fun-loving innocent; Clooney, as his CIA director, is aptly subtle and mysterious. But neither of them, or anyone else involved for a matter of fact, comes even close to upstaging Rockwell, whose input is simply fantastic  there&apos;s no doubt in my mind that the Best Actor Award which, as the blurb on the DVD so proudly states, he picked up at the Berlin International Film Festival for his efforts, was well-and-truly earned.\n\nIt&apos;s not an innovative, far-out, one-of-a-kind experience (a la &apos;Being John Malkovich&apos;). But it&apos;s an entertaining, well-made and entirely satisfying flick with one particularly brilliant stand-out performance, and that&apos;s more than enough to do the job. Kaufman can probably pen avant-garde better than anybody else today, but &apos;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&apos; goes to prove that, when in the right company, he can write &apos;normal&apos; just as impressively.\n\nGrade: A",

      "reviewBody": "This film should have been more interesting with the potential of such a cast. The script tries to be important. Indeed, we again get a &quot;Les Miserables&quot;-themed story of a parolee trying to go straight but finding all of the rules and society&apos;s prejudice forcing him back to crime. But Lloyd Bacon&apos;s sluggish direction holds everything back and it is never interesting storytelling.\n\nHow can a film with George Raft, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden not be compelling? Thank you, Mr. Bacon, for demonstrating. Raft tries hard to be the nice guy but the script gives the character no depth. He could be any ex-con coming home after a stint in Sing Sing. He seems handcuffed throughout. He does believably make a (much) older brother for Holden - the voice, the nose - but he surely can&apos;t pass for 27. Holden is so young and enthusiastic and all his acting mechanics are hanging out there for everyone to see. As few as his scenes are, Bogart is a steady if smarmy hand to get the action started.\n\nFlora Robson, as the mother of Raft and Holden, is the most sympathetic character. The actress had a tremendous soul to give weight to what could be a thankless part. Only through her does any real feeling come into this melodrama. And though nearly seven years younger than Raft, just a little age makeup makes her look as if she could at least be his aunt.\n\nIt is interesting that the film never shows the cons in actual prison stripes. The only two scenes of Raft and Bogart in prison are in the shower (thank you) and in the warden&apos;s office before leaving.\n\nI do like to show this film to friends after they&apos;ve seen John Ford&apos;s &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; just so they can be amazed at Moroni Olsen&apos;s range.",

      "reviewBody": "To put this review in context, I went to see this film with no previous interest in contemporary dance. I have always put it into that category of &apos;things I just don&apos;t understand&apos;. I understand it&apos;s a way of communication, but it&apos;s one that has never communicated to me. So my thoughts on this film probably won&apos;t have any interest to you if you are already a dance fan or a dancer or a fan of Pina Bausch in particular. But if, like me, you have heard that this is a visual feast of a film, or just that it is a Wim Wenders documentary, and are wondering whether to go see it for those reasons, this might help you decide.\n\nI was a reluctant viewer because it was clear from the beginning that I still didn&apos;t &apos;get&apos; it - what did it all mean? But visually, physically, this film ended up astounding me. It has stuck with me such that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.\n\nAs a documentary, it doesn&apos;t do much to reveal its subject. It doesn&apos;t say much about how this woman thought, how she felt, her journey and what influenced it, what tortured her, what she was in denial about and how she related to the wider society. These are the revelations I expect in a &apos;great&apos; documentary film. Films such as &apos;Man on Wire&apos;, &apos;Grizzly Man&apos; or &apos;When We Were Kings&apos;. Maybe those things are communicated though the dance itself. I don&apos;t know. Almost the whole film is dancing, interspersed with very short recollections from individual dancers. What these do get across are that Pina Bausch had a way of communicating with people and a depth of feeling that is unusual and wonderful. Those who worked with her (at least those that were interviewed) have the greatest love and admiration for her and what she was able to bring out of them. I ended up with a great feeling of admiration for her myself. Perhaps that was the point of the documentary.\n\nBut for me, it was the dancing and the way it was filmed that was astounding. It comes across with such intensity, such belief and such love, that I almost became a fan of contemporary dance. The sheer physicality. The bodies and what people could do with them. The beauty of movement. It is simply a joy to watch.\n\nThe quality of the visuals is startling. I saw it at a local arts centre which has a very good screen but I&apos;ve never seen anything as sharp and as detailed as this. And the colours seemed more vivid than is usual. It was like discovering a new form of super high definition film. I understand it was filmed in 3D although I saw the 2D version. Still, it was amazing to watch. The way it is filmed also seems to work very well. It seems pretty straightforward. Most of the dance sequences are filmed quite simply on stage, but the framing seems to bring out the subjects well, even in 2D. Wenders has also filmed individual dancers or pairs of dancers in various outdoor locations - a city street, a road intersection, a train, an open cast mine. These little pieces are so beautiful and so unexpected. There is even one that is intentionally funny, where a girl gets on a train and pretends to be a robot monster. It&apos;s hilarious! So, for me a wonderful surprise. I still didn&apos;t end up understanding much of what Pina Bausch was trying to communicate but I enjoyed watching her try.",

      "reviewBody": "Barn of the Nekkid Dead - or Nightmare Circus - is a film about a demented young man named Andre who captures women and keeps them chained in the barn. He believes that he is the ringleader of a circus and that they are the trained animals in his act.  Andre is a psychopath, but it&apos;s not all his fault - his mother left him when he was very young and his father has turned into a murderous radioactive mutant.  Andre crushes rebellion among his animals by feeding would-be rebels to his pet mountain lion or to his father.\n\nThe obvious moral of the story would be that men treat women horribly, be it is more likely that the pretense of the moral is an excuse to show attractive young women chained and whipped.  The best part of this movie is the ending.  Help is on the way in the background from the beginning but by the time it arrives at the barn, Andre&apos;s father has killed almost everyone. It&apos;s refreshing to watch a film without a morally happy ending."

      "reviewBody": "In my opinion Christian Petzel is one of the most prominent German directors of the new century. It amazes me how low his films are usually rated.\n\nWith respect to &quot;Yella&quot; a possible explanation could be that the story is complicated. The film has a surprising ending (about which I shall say nothing in this review), but even including this ending there remains much to think about.\n\nDespite or perhaps thanks to this complicated plot the film is very rewarding. It is situated in impersonal and distant environments such as highways, business motels and conference rooms. The facial expressions (amazement, disbelief, amusement) of main character Yella (Nina Hoss) contributes more to the story than the often somewhat disguised dialogue.\n\nIn the film Yella forms more and more a duo with Philipp (Devid Striesow), a shady venture capitalist who tries to buy firms in distress at a very low price and thereby explores and transcends the limits of the law.\n\nIlluminating is the scene in which Philipp puts Yella to a test. He asks her to deposit some cash money on a bank account and gives her an exces of cash. Will she return the &quot;spare change&quot; to him or not? Initially she does not. It remains unclear of she thereby was failing or passing the test. Personally I think she is passing it, proving that she too could embezzle money when opportunity knocks.\n\nImportant in my opinion is that Philipp is much like Ben (Hinnerk Schönemann), the ex of Yella. Philipp has the same character and the same physical appearance as Ben, being only a little smarter and more succesful. Given the fact that Yella and Ben are from East Germany (Wittenburg) and Philipp from West Germany, there seems to be some symbolism hinting at the re-unification.",

All kidding aside, you really have to be in the mood for this. Not sure if Mullholland Drive is the best comparison (especially because that movie is better quality wise), but it is really giving you some riddles or whatever you want to call it.\n\nIs this the real world? Is this just fantasy? I reckon Queen or lovers of that specific song may find more to this than others. I did not have any ice cream before I watched this (sorry for the pun), though I doubt that would have changed my viewing experience any way. Unless that is mean to be or mean something different ... anyway I did not have any of anything. Maybe it would have helped elevate certain things though (no pun intended)",

At first, the mother wants to protect her family from the troublemakers, but eventually she realizes that her son is right and the workers should strike.  The plot is similar to other Soviet films of the era but does focus more on the individual than some of Eisenstein&apos;s films.  The mother and son do represent the collective but they are also strong characters on their own.\n\nThe best part of the film is the editing.  It is always sharp and quick. When there is action, the edits are fast and give the viewer a sense of chaos.  The Soviets were masters of montage and this film is a prime example.  The acting is also better than in most silent films.  It is clear that the actors come from the serious stage and not Vaudeville.  The cinematography is somewhat average, though, and the film feels a little flat at times.  It is not perfect, but it is worth seeing for all and essential viewing for those interested in Russian film or montage.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; is a Woody Allen´s film for mature audiences that has not aged and gets better with the years. Jack and Sally and Gabe and Judy are best friends. When the first couple announces that they are going to split up to have new experiences, the initial shock to Gabe and Judy reverts to questioning of their own marriage with a surprising conclusion. This simple storyline about separation processes on the hands of Woody Allen turns into a funny and thoughtful film, supported by a great cast and witty dialogues and situations. This is a movie that can be seen and assessed from time to time. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil0: &quot;Maridos e Esposas&quot; (&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "It ain&apos;t great cinema, folks, but it IS fun. It&apos;s also a great reminder of the roots of rock- and-roll (old-fashioned hyphenated spelling intentional), and how far that musical genre has developed in the last (choke) 50 years. \n\nI was only 9 when this film was released, and had never seen it until today (thanks, Turner Classics). Bill Hailey was certainly no Eric Clapton on the guitar, but was definitely a showman...in what would now be considered a cornball sort of way. The whole film is a good display of the fact that choreographing singers&apos; movements didn&apos;t start with Madonnna. It also shows modern viewers that the Platters could REALLY sing!\n\nAnother thing I really enjoyed was the dancing in this movie. Lisa Gaye and Earl Barton could move! About an hour and 15 minutes into the film (which is only about 1:20 long) there&apos;s a number which shows them off well, during which they&apos;re joined by a couple of dozen other excellent dancers. It&apos;s a fun way to end the film.",

      "reviewBody": "COME LIVE WITH ME manages to be a charming trifle of a romantic comedy that gives HEDY LAMARR and JAMES STEWART a chance to prove that they may have seemed like an unlikely pair but have sparkling chemistry with each other.\n\nHedy is incredibly beautiful (as always) as a woman who must find a husband quickly or be deported. On a rainy night, she and Stewart meet accidentally in a fast food diner, and immediately she decides that this penniless bachelor will have to do. She makes a strictly business proposition with the man, a writer down on his luck, which he rather readily accepts--and a loveless marriage is negotiated so that she can wed Stewart, stay in the country longer, and then wed IAN HUNTER, who intends to divorce his wife.\n\nIt&apos;s all rather silly and highly improbable. The deepening relationship between Stewart and Lamarr is never really fleshed out so that the viewer can expect to see hints of romance developing. Instead, after his story is accepted by a publisher (Hunter), Stewart decides to whisk Lamarr off to the country to meet his grandmother in a picture perfect rural setting. Naturally, love develops quickly and before you know it, Ian Hunter is out of the running as Hedy&apos;s prospective mate.\n\nThe most original element in the story has to do with fireflies and Hedy&apos;s decision to use a flashlight &quot;to attract a mate&quot;.\n\nIt&apos;s an unassuming little comedy/romance, nicely played by the two leads and given good support by ADELINE DeWALT REYNOLDS as the grandma with her platitudes on plaques, VERREE TEASDALE as the publisher&apos;s open minded wife, DONALD MEEK as a park bum and FRANK FAYLEN as a tough talking counterman at a diner.\n\nClarence Brown must be commended for getting a relaxed and assured performance from Lamarr, who never looked lovelier. Stewart is his usual earnest self, especially good in some comic reaction shots.",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;pocket battleship&quot; (in armor and armament, somewhere between a battleship and a heavy cruiser) Graf Spee is abroad in the Atlantic, sinking British merchant shipping. She is tracked down by three British and New Zealand cruisers and after a fierce battle takes refuge in the harbor of Montevideo, Uruguay. In accordance with the Hague Convention, the Graf Spee&apos;s Captain Langsdorff is given barely enough time to make his ship seaworthy, without improving her fighting efficiency, before having to leave port. We aren&apos;t told exactly what her fighting efficiency is like but we learn she&apos;s taken more than fifty hits on the superstructure alone from the British 8-inch guns, and those are big guns. \n\nThere are shenanigans going on at the embassies in Montevideo, in which the French and British try to force the Graf Spee to leave as soon as possible, while the Germans argue for more time. All of this is reported by an opportunistic American from a well-positioned outdoor cafe where the proprietor demands he keep ordering scotch if he&apos;s going to sit there and take up the customers&apos; space. Langsdorff is cleverly led by the British to assume that the three cruisers waiting for him outside the harbor have been joined by several other capital ships including an aircraft carrier. The rumor has been deliberately spread by British staff (over an unscrambled phone line in a hilarious scene) and everyone believes it, including Langsdorff. The German captain takes his ship out of the harbor at the appointed time but scuttles her after ordering the crew off. The British have won the Battle of the River Plate, partly through courage and partly through intelligent use of misinformation.\n\nActually, considering that it&apos;s a &quot;war movie&quot; it&apos;s pretty good natured. The British crack jokes in the midst of battle. When a shell hits nearby and burns up some possessions, one sailor approaches another bearing a pair of charred boots on a tray and asks, &quot;You ordered the toast?&quot; When sailors die, they do so almost nonchalantly, with time for a brave few words like, &quot;See to the others.&quot; \n\nAs far as that goes, the film gives you a fairly decent picture of what sea duty can be like: operating the rudder from the steering aft position, for instance. (What a job!) The movie demonstrates the advantage of using real ships instead of models. The problem with model work has to do with texture. The splashes of exploding shells, for instance, send up drops of water as big as basketballs. But here there is some drop-dead gorgeous photography of ships making smoke and heeling around. Not even modern computer graphics could manage so effectively. \n\nThe Germans are treated humanely too, this being 1956 and not 1946. The Germans have a number of British prisoners aboard the Graf Spee and they celebrate Christmas together, with the captors presenting the captives with Christmas decorations. When a German officer announces to the prisoners that they will soon be released in Montevideo, he cheers along with the British. \n\nAmong the funniest scenes are those involving the blowhard American reporter. &quot;The whole world is watching and waiting with suspense for the Battle of the Ages,&quot; or something like that. &quot;Lays it on a bit thick, doesn&apos;t he?&quot; asks one British listener. After a few days of this boreal oratory the reporter&apos;s voice is going and he begins to swill liquor, surrounded by a dozen glasses of scotch. &quot;Excuse me while I get a drink,&quot; he hoarsely tells his listeners. \n\nWithall, though, there is a tragic figure here, and that is the wounded Captain Langsdorff who has fought the good fight and is now forced to sail his ship into what he believes is certain disaster. Finch does a good job with the role, as does the script. There isn&apos;t a moment when he loses his dignity. And his courtliness seems inbred. The Brits say of him, &quot;He&apos;s a gentleman,&quot; and, &quot;He&apos;s a good seaman.&quot; A cheaper movie would have given Finch an unnecessary speech: &quot;A captain belongs to his ship, just as the ship belongs to the captain. This is breaking my heart. I feel as if someone had just taken my Marzipan away.&quot; It&apos;s a genuinely sad moment when we see the coffins of the German sailors killed in battle. And although the movie ends with the victorious and quite beautiful white British cruisers sailing off into the sunset, the fact is that Langsdorff shot and killed himself shortly after these events."

This film deals with a revival, of sorts of the Nazi ideals through a terribly mislead and dysfunctional group of very young people, drawn to the darkest pits of their reality. Political or not, this film would be branded politically incorrect in all aspects. And it is, indeed. \n\nThe worst of its drawbacks is just that its own incorrect political issues were later (and still are) a sad fuel for some youngsters who believe their Fatherland should be defended the way Hitler did, and by the same means, even if their own were to be abolished from Earth. The deep consequences of the turmoil provoked in their minds (those of the young people who join the Youth Group or Party) suddenly turns into an unstopping vortex of violence. \n\nAll moral barriers are violated here. The only driving passion is the Party. The stories told are some kind of reliving the worst of the darkest times of war from the standpoint of the Nazi Reich.\n\nWell sorted, acted, filmed and scored, the film exudes reality. Since German is the language, the film sometimes gets too &quot;Hitlerian&quot;. Thomas&apos;s mother being the most unnerving character (every bit of her admonitions are as Hitlerian as they can be, and well over the top). The rest are good at doing their job. It&apos;s a substantial film, but, definitely, not for the faint hearted.\n\nYou&apos;ll find moments of pure repulsion and scenes when you don&apos;t want to hear what&apos;s been said. I&apos;m not Jewish, but it hit me as hard as if I were. The depiction of some gruesome dialogues and representations are simply disgusting.\n\nA great film with maybe too many gratuitous sex scenes, and with an eerie powerful omen of things to be in forthcoming years.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit up front that Peter Davis&apos; documentary makes no effort to show the carnage and torture sponsored and perpetuated by the Viet Cong -- and the one substantial time it explores the way South Vietnamese civilians were imprisoned and tortured by their own government (in huge numbers, by the way), the film isn&apos;t very clear about who made these arrests. It concentrates almost solely on the inhumanity and pointlessness of our presence there in a pointless war which even our leaders were unprepared to comprehend.\n\nIt&apos;s not &quot;balanced&quot; within itself, but given the day-to-day barrage of standard media coverage of the Vietnam war during the time the documentary was made, I believe the making of this film represented an attempt to &quot;balance&quot; the average American&apos;s knowledge of what was really going on and how misrepresented the war was by our government and even by the major media most of the time.\n\nAll that being said, it&apos;s a vivid, important part of the mosaic of American war records. The images are enormously powerful, and where occasionally Mr. Davis&apos; juxtapositions seem overtly manipulative, he still is to be praised emphatically for collecting and assembling this material in such a courageous and uncompromising way. It is essential viewing because of the power of its collected imagery and the lessons about America that we still need to learn. 30 years after the Vietnam war ended, there are still too many essential ways in which that conflict is not understood....and the degree to which we cannot seem, as a nation, to learn from the lessons of Vietnam is only too evident in the manner and attitude with which our leaders have handled and carried on the American military action in Iraq. \n\nHaving read a lot of the writings of Vietnam vets over the years about this war, I&apos;m tempted to say that this documentary doesn&apos;t go far enough to show the core of absurdity and tragedy at the heart of this war and the way it put young Americans into a hellish situation for no reason and then left them there to be a part of a morally ambivalent, politically and humanly misguided situation, forever disillusioning and haunting an entire generation. But if this film can help younger people to understand just the tip of the iceberg of the enormous tragedy of America&apos;s involvement in a pointless 10-year war, then it continues to be worthwhile. \n\nThe film itself does not provide nearly enough &quot;backstory&quot; for a student or younger person who did not live through the era. Peter Davis presupposes that the viewing audience knows a lot of things which we knew at the time but which is no longer general knowledge for many viewers. But as a part of an overall attempt (using various sources) to understand that war and its colossal ramifications to our country&apos;s self-image, and as a reminder of how easy it is to slip into a tragic imperialism masquerading as some other kind of naive political idealism, it&apos;s an essential and vividly effective document of the times for which we owe Mr. Davis a huge debt of gratitude. There is much to be learned from films like this -- including things which our leaders today don&apos;t seem to have learned themselves, despite having lived through the Vietnam era.\n\nIt&apos;s also important to remember that until the Vietnam war, and later Watergate (reminders of which resonate in the presence in this film of &quot;Pentagon Paper&quot;- leaker Daniel Ellsberg), Americans generally believed what their government told them, and didn&apos;t think Presidents lied. It may be difficult now to remember there ever was a time when we trusted our government not to be intentionally misleading us, and if Mr. Davis makes a conspicuous effort to emphasize the duplicity of Johnson and Nixon in this documentary, it&apos;s probably because it was such a new and unbelievable concept to the overwhelming percentages of Americans before the Vietnam era took place."

First of all the dialogue is so bad and cheese, that it sometimes physically hurt to watch. The killing in this movie just takes away from the comedy , and believe me there is loads of killing it. Another negative factor is, that for some unexplainable reason someone thought it was a good idea to make every flame in this movie a bright blue colour, which sometimes really hurts while watching in a dark room. That being said there are some scenes that I found genuinely funny, although most of the time this was unintentional like in action scenes or scenes that where supposed to be serious and dramatic.",

Nevertheless, on balance, a delightful romp, and a chance to see the wonderful Alastair Sim in one of his final appearances.",

When he finds a duck&apos;s head in the garden, it puts visions in his head of a crazy masked man, ripping the heads off ducks and running while. He makes his own attempts at this with his sister&apos;s tampons and starts a fight with her that ends with threats and repercussions.\n\nStarting out with a strange air to it, this film moves into the realm of Stan&apos;s imagination quite effectively and manages to produce a real unsettling air to it in both the imagined and the real sections of the film. Narrative-wise I wasn&apos;t sure where it was trying to go or where it ended up but it was unsettling to go their with it and it did leave me thinking about it long after I&apos;d watched it. The direction is excellent for a small budget short film and the scene of horror in the bedroom is surprisingly vicious and shocking  perhaps more so for the low-key shock that comes later.\n\nThe cast are good, with the two child actors doing very well with unsettling ideas and actions but it is the director that really controls the film and ends up being the reason you remember it (the cast not helped by the material in the longer term). Overall it is an interesting and unsettling film that may not have all the answers to the questions it itself poses but is memorable and worth seeing nonetheless."

Nevertheless, while you&apos;re watching the movie, you can&apos;t help thinking about the 1997 John Woo movie where the main character trade place with a dangerous killer. In both movies, the &quot;bad guy&quot; ends up sleeping with the &quot;hero&quot;&apos;s wife, he threatens the &quot;hero&quot;&apos;s wife and kid. They also switch lives where the hero ends up in jail (or asylum) and the bad guy enjoy a comfortable life in a beautiful house, next to the hero&apos;s wife and kid. &quot;The Machine&quot; doesn&apos;t have the juice of &quot;Face Off&quot; because they don&apos;t go deeply into everyone&apos;s personality and life. It seems like a shallow replicate of the John Woo movie without the special effects and cinematography. Good luck !"

There is 1 mention of Noah, and then its just animal antics on a boat.

      "reviewBody": "Although perhaps not in the same top-flight league as &quot;Rififi&quot; and &quot;Topkapi,&quot; &quot;Gambit&quot; is nevertheless an extremely entertaining heist movie that features consistently fine performances, an amusing and twisty script, and good production values. In this one, Caine hires MacLaine, who is working as a dancehall girl in Hong Kong, to assist him in the purloining of a priceless piece of sculpture, owned by Herbert Lom. This is not your typical heist film, however, and there is a twist right around the first half-hour mark that really had me chuckling out loud...and I&apos;m not an easy person to make laugh out loud at movies, either. MacLaine plays one of her patented loveable kooks in this film, and is ever so appealing. Caine, in his first American production, plays it alternately cool and exasperated. Lom is surprisingly good as Shabhandar, one of the world&apos;s wealthiest men; his performance is both urbane and beautifully modulated. Good in smaller parts are two faces that classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will recognize: John Abbott (an Organian) as the French art connoisseur, and Roger &quot;Harry Mudd&quot; Carmel as a hotel clerk. The heist itself is fairly suspenseful and, I suppose, high-tech for its day. Both Caine and MacLaine display surprising derring-do and quick thinking, and toward the finale of the film, the viewer is treated to at least three unexpected twists of plot. &quot;Gambit,&quot; thus, offers good suspense, real wit, some romance, colorful locales, and fine acting. It is a real winner. If you&apos;re a fan of the heist movie, this one will not disappoint. It&apos;s good, light, well-done fun, and infinitely more entertaining than recent, &quot;serious&quot; caper films such as &quot;The Score&quot; and &quot;Heist.&quot; Check it out!"

      "reviewBody": "Great film. Okay, I do have to admit it has been almost twenty years since I saw the film, but it has always stayed with me and I&apos;ve actually referenced it from time to time when discussing the worlds drug issues. Although not a film you&apos;d expect to see James Belushi in, I thought it was well acted and well written and Belushi fans will appreciate the fact that there is more to Belushi than just comedy. It gave an interesting take in &quot;the war on drugs&quot;. As the audience identifies with the main character, thinking as he that the best way to fight drugs is the classic; don&apos;t legalize, get rehab centers for drug abusers etc..., the movie educates the main character and you as to why this may not be the best solution and who is really profiting. It is a smart movie, but you certainly do not need to be a genius to follow it, as I was only 17 when I watched it and followed it just fine. So maybe they don&apos;t blow something up every five minutes, but there is lots of intrigue and conspiracy to capture and retain the attention of your average movie-goer. Give this movie a chance! I think many will be entertained as well as educated! Has anyone else noticed that this movie has seemed to disappear, at least in the US? Even IMDb does not list a US release date. Perhaps this movie is too close to the truth. If anyone finds an English version out there please share!",

Here comes Mani Ratnam (Ram Gopal Varma, Vikaram Bhatt,etc) who know talent when they see one (Esha Deol and exception) and cast them irrespective of the the Box office predictions. This is one tightly packaged and past paced movie with some great dialog, acting and direction. Abishek performance should make his papa proud. This kid has come a long way and he is even beginning to look like his old man. Next comes Rani, Vivek. Of course the Veteran Om Puri, is a delight to watch no matter what he does. Esha Deol cannot act-period. Ratnam or a Varma cannot extract any acting from this lasse-it is like trying to get juice out of a scotch tape. The stories run parallel and concurrently which adds a mystery like quality to the narration and one of the staple of a good cinema-the dialog is superb. The action scenes are very authentic and not the cheap variety seen in the decadent and discrepit Sharukh Khan and Salman Khan films. Mani Ratnam and Ram Gopal Varma have elevated the Hindi Cinema to the level that an Indian should be proud of, in fact this film sounds like a fast version of a Satyajit Ray film and that is a compliment for a filmmaker."

      "name": "An Angry Retort To Ozu and Naruse",
      "reviewBody": "It begins in a whirlwind of documentary footage about current Japan, about corruption and strife. We see flashbacks to Japan, just coming out of the War, dealing with poverty and hunger and teachers explaining that they were telling their students lies, passing on the lies they had been told and believed. Newspaper stories are shown. Among the headlines is one about a mother of two who committed suicide by jumping in front of a train.\n\nYûko Mochizuki is a serving woman at a resort in the Izu Peninsula. Her son and daughter visit her. The son wants her to sign documents so he can be adopted by a wealthy doctor; he is a top student, but he has no money, and so cannot afford to practice medicine. Her daughter, unknown to her, is being courted by her English teacher, a married man whose wife despises him, and whose daughter has been trained to hate him.\n\nOzu and Naruse wrote and directed serious movies about families struggling to survive and adapt in a changing Japan. Their families care about each other. Kinoshita, in this movie, says those are lies. Miss Mochizuki&apos;s family has fallen apart in a Japan where no one cares about anyone else. She is a kind, moral, silly woman, who gives good advice and is lied to at best, or knocked to the ground for it. Her daughter was raped by her cousin; now she hates all men and trusts no one. Her son has become an almost emotionless intellectual drudge, who shrugs his shoulders when told of some one making a stupid choice; they&apos;re adults, he says. They have to make their own decisions. He&apos;s going to survive in this new world.\n\nKinoshita&apos;s work after his wartime propaganda, is usually ameliorated by his dark sense of humor. There is no humor here. Instead, he has absorbed the techniques of both Italian Neo-Realism for his visual effects, and Film Noir&apos;s flashback structure to show character&apos;s motivation. It&apos;s a fine, angry, hateful story of people adrift in an uncaring world.",

      "reviewBody": "Its been years since I last watched a great Chinese movie. Growing up in Malaysia, watching many Chinese movies, the one I most fond of was Wong Kar Wai, Tsui Hark, Stanley Tong, Jackie Chan and of course the masterful John Woo. In his movies, the elements he combined made his movie very unique and distinctive from any other Chinese films i&apos;ve watched. His use of kinetic shots and slow motion gave a fresh look, if not, reinvented the action genre while Hollywood was still producing plain and boring action movies.\n\nAfter nearly 18 years, John returns to Chinese cinema, with a big present install for all of us. And that is Red Cliff. Beautifully shot, big on scale, action-plenty, great performances and a smart adaptation of the historical epic, The Three kingdom makes this movie one of the best Chinese epics in decades.(with the exception of Hero) True to his style. After his last three films, i began to think whether John&apos;s losing his edge already or is it because the Hollywood system that was in the way. In this case, I choose to think the Hollywood system was the cause of it. Red Cliff shows he still have the similar trademark he use in his films. The only difference is that this movie is huge in scale.\n\nThe themes he use; brotherhood, humble and honor are one of the driving formulas which made his classic movies a hit with audience is still very visible here. Visuals are breathtaking as this is one of the greatest visual effect shots I ever seen in an Asian movie. For an Asian like me I&apos;m very proud of that. The cinematic shots were stunning and beautiful. One which John&apos;s interpretation is still very sharp. The production behind this movie are mind blowing-ly HUGE. With the amount of extras and props used, makes any filmmaker-wannabe to ask &quot;how did he do that?&quot; I couldn&apos;t even imagine all the headache he has gone through for this movie.\n\nNow, in terms of story telling, plot and character development, the elements which i mention up there surprisingly fits together. The pacing for each scene has a mind of its own. For action it goes into overdrive. Cleverly building in the battle and action, the scenes were outstanding. It almost has a classic hong kong action feel to it where every action seems to be very unpredictable. The dramatic scenes and character development fits like a shoe, as the acting boost up all the character&apos;s emotions. Whether its seriousness, ego, humor, sad or depressed all the characters has it. So, to my surprise I still can&apos;t get over the fact that John can still balance both action and drama together like he always did in his films. Two thumbs up for that. The plot came in quite well in timing. With no hesitation except for the small intro, it goes straight into the battle scenes first before any dramatic scenes take place. Slowly it builds up, from the inroduction of characters each revealing themselves in detail, to the forming of strategies to stop the invasion and ends in with an amazing climatic battle scene.\n\nAll in all, Red Cliff is one of the best movies in 2008 that I&apos;ve seen. I&apos;m gonna review Part II later. So to end this review. I gave it A MUST HAVE for people.\n\n8.8 out of 10 ratings.",

It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, &quot;Hard Weapon&quot;, &quot;Die Lethal&quot;, etc. - talking about &quot;the long kiss goodnight&quot; will get you nowhere.  But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie.  A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on.  As she becomes Charly again, we&apos;re torn: we certainly want Charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don&apos;t want her to lose touch with Samantha in order to do so - even though we like Charly, too.  Geena Davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character.  Samuel L. Jackson plays second fiddle for a change. It turns out he&apos;s good at it.  That was a compliment.\n\nIntelligent, far superior to anything in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series - if I were more cynical I&apos;d add, &quot;it&apos;s not surprising that it didn&apos;t do well&quot;, but I don&apos;t really feel that way; it IS surprising that it didn&apos;t do well.",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen two Konrad Wolf films set in WW2 (&quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;I Was Nineteen&quot;, I was keen to see more of his work. I wish I hadn&apos;t bothered with this one, and can&apos;t explain why I sat through it to the end. I see it has been voted one of the 100 best German films, which says a lot about German cinema, none of it good. The two major problems are the story and the dialogue. As a voice- over near the end admits, the story is banal. I&apos;ve had experience of life behind the Iron Curtain, so the girl&apos;s decision to split with the man she loved and return to the laughably-named German Democratic Republic made no sense to me. She wasn&apos;t a Communist, she&apos;d seen the way the system treated her friend and fellow student, and she barely bothered to see her mother, so what drew her back? The joy of working in a factory making railway carriages, which was a waste of her intelligence? Lack of courage and imagination (&quot;I&apos;ve always lived in the same town&quot;)? What really sinks this film, as Thomas from Berlin points out, is the dreadful dialogue. Since the book is drawn from a Crista Wolf novel, and she helped write the script, I suspect the blame is largely hers. Characters, with the exception of the hero&apos;s father, just don&apos;t talk like human beings. I certainly feel no urge to read any of the lady&apos;s novels.",

But it continues the line of rare Bavarian films that capture life in all its facets, in the great tradition of Franz Xaver Bogner&apos;s &quot;Irgendwie &amp; Sowieso&quot; from the 1980s. It&apos;s true and funny, sad and heartwarming, telling a grand story with an outstandingly authentic cast, an exceptionally good soundtrack in beautiful pictures. If you want to be entertained well for an evening and you want more than just a cheap laugh, go see this movie (despite its strange title, meaning something like &quot;The sooner you die, the longer you&apos;ll be dead&quot;) and see Bavaria beyond all kitsch!",

      "name": "A Marvelous Film that Stands the Test of Time",
      "reviewBody": "William Dieterle&apos;s adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet&apos;s The Devil and Daniel Webster is the product of a great, albeit brief, era of quality Hollywood film-making that has never been repeated. Released within a three-year period that yielded such classics as The Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, Gunga Din, The Maltese Falcon, and Citizen Kane (just to name a few), The Devil and Daniel Webster is only now earning the accolades it deserves. The film is late to join the aforementioned classics because a definitive version of it has been elusive for nearly sixty years. For their 2003 DVD release of the title, The Criterion Collection finally discovered a complete print that had been in the director&apos;s possession. Now restored to its full length, and painstakingly restored, The Devil and Daniel Webster has never looked and sounded better. \n\nA cautionary tale of greed and power, the narrative centers around the character of Jabez Stone (played by James Craig), a down-on-his-luck farmer who is barely able to support his family in 1840s New Hampshire. When the nefarious Mr. Scratch (Walter Houston) appears during a moment of weakness, Jabez agrees to sell his soul in exchange for seven years of good luck. Much to the dismay of his wife (Ann Shirley), mother (Jane Darwell), and beloved politician Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold), Jabez slips into a downward spiral as a result of his newfound wealth and power. When his seven years are up, Jabez learns the error of his ways and wants to make amends. To escape his contract with the devil, Jabez puts his fate in the hands of the almost mythic Daniel Webster, who represents him in a climactic barn room trial against Mr. Scratch and a jury of the damned. \n\nThe execution of this story is remarkable, from the elegant direction and incredible performances to the innovative camera work and stylish mise-en-scene. Dieterle infuses the film with stark contrast lighting and masterful compositions rich in detail and multiple layers of action. When Mr. Scratch appears in Jabez&apos;s barn, he is heavily backlit and accompanied by ethereal sounds. His accomplice, the creepy Belle, is similarly introduced beside a fireplace. To portray the film&apos;s more ghostly effects, including Belle&apos;s dance to the death with Miser Stevens and the barn room trial, Dieterle relies on multiple exposure and diffused lighting. These visual effects and others, such as items bursting into flame, were ahead of their time - as were the lighting schemes. Influenced as Citizen Kane was by German expressionist films, The Devil and Daniel Webster features bold, suggestive lighting where shadows alone often represent a character. Dieterle succeeds in creating a visual distinction between the real world and the netherworld by frequently bathing Scratch and Belle in soft light or diffusion and removing all natural sounds from the soundtrack when they appear. Belle&apos;s dance of death and Scratch&apos;s fiddle playing at Jabez&apos;s party are accompanied by severe under lighting, insinuating the hellish forces at work in both scenes. Every shot in the film, even in the mundane world, seems painstakingly planned and executed, with decisive lighting and many intricate camera movements, rare for this era of film-making. \n\nThe most remarkable performance in the film is Walter Houston&apos;s Mr. Scratch.\n\nHouston, an Oscar-winner for his role in Treasure of the Sierra Madre, exudes unbridled glee with every devilish grin. His devil is a gentleman-like puppet master, a smooth talker, and very persuasive. He never flaunts his evil powers. He doesn&apos;t have to. His appeal is understandable because he can offer what everyone in the movie wants - wealth and power. It&apos;s easy for the Devil to sell his wares to struggling farmers, so he&apos;s confident and playful in his duties. Houston throws away one-liner after one-liner, owning the screen and stealing the show. At one point, he offers to help Daniel Webster win the presidential election. Webster replies, &quot;I&apos;d rather see you on the side of the opposition.&quot; As Webster walks away, Houston replies, &quot;Oh, I&apos;ll be there, too,&quot; and sticks a cigar in his mouth. \n\nTo combat the devil, Dieterle cast Edward Arnold (who was actually recast when the original actor was injured during filming). Arnold had a tough job in the film, making believable not only Daniel Webster&apos;s mythic stature, but also his flowery rhetoric about patriotism and the goodness in all men. He admirably succeeds in not only persuading the jury of the damned, but in holding his own against Walter Houston in their many scenes together.\n\nEveryone else in the cast is also excellent. James Craig pulls off Jabez Stone&apos;s fall from grace, and Ann Shirley is a believable virtuous wife. Jane Darwell, fresh off her Oscar-winning stint as Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, seems to be playing the same character in The Devil and Daniel Webster, but it serves the movie well. The most notable supporting player is Simone Simon, whose mesmerizing Belle haunts every frame in which she appears. It&apos;s easy to see why Jabez would fall under her spell, because we, as an audience, do as well. \n\nThe icing on the Devil&apos;s cake is Bernard Herrmann&apos;s Oscar-winning score, a dynamic one that works on many levels. Herrmann incorporates several traditional folk songs into his original music, including &quot;Devil&apos;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Springfield Mountain&quot;, and &quot;Miss McLeod&apos;s Reel&quot;. For Mr. Scratch and Belle, Herrmann manipulated the sound of telephone wires &quot;singing&quot; in the wind to create an eerie, atonal sound for the netherworld. The film also provided Herrmann a wealth of other opportunities, including a square dance and two lullabies. \n\nA good story makes a movie worth watching once. Exquisite aesthetics makes it worth watching many times. The Devil and Daniel Webster stands the test of time as an endearing narrative with lessons we have still to learn. It&apos;s masterful direction and style, fluid editing, and charming performances make it an accessible and entertaining film for any audience. Now restored and widely available, it is sure to join the ranks of those other great classics from the late &apos;30s and early &apos;40s - a scintillating example of good storytelling and fine craftsmanship. \n\n\n* Scott Schirmer\n",

He feels as if his religion is placing too many restrictions on him and he wishes to have some freedom from biblical teachings so that he can be more popular and go out with the girl he likes. One night Daniel wishes that he had &quot;never become a believer,&quot; and the next day he has a rude awakening. His room is different, his house is dirty, and an angel meets him and explains to him that the &quot;Heavenly Father&quot; answered his prayer and now his life is as if he never became a Christian. He soon finds out that the two bullies at school are now his best friends and at school he enjoys the fact that the girl he really liked now likes him too. But all is not well. He goes on to learn that his younger sister no longer exists because his parents got divorced years ago in his alternative life. He is also shocked when his mom prances off to go on a date with someone other than his father (who moved to Los Angeles). The angel appears and points out his nice car which Daniel got by betting money on football games last year. Daniel says he has never gambled in his life but the angel points out that his life is different now and it is as if he had never been a believer. Daniel also thinks the whole thing a big prank and he does not believe the angel at all.",

While these films are well shot and well acted, they don&apos;t seem to say very much; they offer a look at sometimes unusual human relationships but they don&apos;t seem to have much insight when all is said and done. And yet people rave over them.\n\nOKI&apos;S MOVIE is a rather confusing assortment of four short film segments which tell of a love triangle between a girl and the two men in her life: a middle-aged professor, and a young film-maker. There&apos;s some humour in the film which comes from the characters getting drunk, and the cast are good enough to fully inhabit their characters. But what of it? When all is said and done, what&apos;s been the point? Other than some nice visuals and nice classical music, there just doesn&apos;t seem to be much going on here. Give me a Kim Ki-duk film any day of the week...",

A script with so many nuances in the boring swamp. Only virtue - first step to discover a Spanish history page. But may it enough ? Sure, the props, the costumes are beautiful illustration of Golden Age but facts and intrigues are suffocated in velvet coffins. May be a moral lesson ? I don&apos;t know. Is love story a good part ? Only as slice of old bread. A common movie about an exciting events ball. And the dreams about its possibilities."

      "reviewBody": "I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.\n\nThe movie its story is told &apos;beautifuly&apos; in black &amp; white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn&apos;t that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you&apos;re causing to yourself and your close environment when you&apos;re thinking as a white supremacist.\n\nAs an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.\n\nEdward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It&apos;s almost like he&apos;s playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene&apos;s are highly believable as two brothers.\n\nAlso surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, the year before.\n\nThis was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "I went to this only because I couldn&apos;t get into the movie I came to the theater for. I don&apos;t know Dane Cook&apos;s stand-up and hated him in the overrated Dan In Real Life. But, we figured we could pass time for two hours so we went in.\n\nIt started routinely enough. Okay, the guy gets paid to be the date from heck so the girls goes crying back into her guy&apos;s arms. Okay concept, if executed well. Then we get Jason Biggs trying to clean up his act to impress Kate Hudson who likes him but is not wowed by him. Since Jason is Dane&apos;s roommate, he hires Dane to do his specialty. By this point, we&apos;re 20+ minutes into the movie and it made me laugh twice and is otherwise pretty lame. I looked at my watch. Then, Kate&apos;s roommate preps her for the date to sow some wild oats and the real fun begins.\n\nThe humor in My Best Friend&apos;s Girl is rude, crude, inappropriate, socially irredeemable -- and made me laugh out loud - a lot! Cook&apos;s chemistry with Hudson was electric. The twist is she can give as good as she gets and vice versa. She gets under his skin, but he stays in denial, leading to his next assignment which to me was the high point of the movie. The girl is religious and he takes her to a restaurant in an old church called Jesus Crust - where pizza is a religious experience. i don&apos;t want to spoil the inspired gags in this sequence, but I was nearly rolling in the aisles. This victim actually winds up setting the stage for a few plot twists I didn&apos;t expect. The movie is raucous fun from then on until the end.\n\nI thought Alec Baldwin was absurdly funny as the Women&apos;s Studies professor who is Cook&apos;s father. His chemistry with Cook is also terrific. Cook&apos;s former client who is about to marry Kate&apos;s sister is also hilarious as is she and the woman playing Kate&apos;s mother. Then, the movie goes a bit soft,conventional, and derivative -- but is still witty at the end, and the last two scenes play out nicely.\n\nThis is not a piece of art, but if you ever went to frat parties and can remember having fun at them and want to spend some time laughing out loud, give My Best Friend&apos;s Girl a look. I work in Manhattan so I have to be careful to whom I say I liked this movie -- that&apos;s why I call it a guilty pleasure!",

The other two movies which were made by Disney weren&apos;t bad, but weren&apos;t the best. Twentieth Century Fox gets a try, and well... they don&apos;t do good.\n\nThe movie doesn&apos;t really make much sense. This really bothered me since I read the books, and I was expecting something along certain lines, but the movie doesn&apos;t really follow it. The acting really wasn&apos;t all that good which was really distracting, and the dialog wasn&apos;t all that better. None of the characters except for possibly Reepacheep, and maybe Eustace when he was a dragon, were likable.\n\nFor some reason when reading reviews I keep on reading silly comments about how this movie had good visuals. This confused me greatly, because when you see the green mist for the first time it looks awful. I mean really bad. Actually the green mist looked bad in every scene. Why did it look bad? It&apos;s mainly because it wasn&apos;t integrated well into the scenes. You could tell the mist was put in badly, so when someone looks at the mist floating overhead it looks like the mist isn&apos;t even on the same plane. Since the mist was a big part of the movie, seeing it constantly really ruined it for me. The dragon was cool at some scenes, but in others didn&apos;t look too good. Now the serpent was pretty cool, but it seemed a bit cartoony, along with the dragon. That was my biggest issue is that both of the monsters in this movie look cartoony, and really bright. Now the water effects in this movie are real good, especially near the end, and when the serpent is splashing.\n\nProbably the biggest issue in this movie was the camera. Let me tell you I have never seen camera work this bad. The scenes flowed horribly, and the camera angles were all boring. There were no dynamic camera angles, and emotional shots except for maybe one which was near the end. The camera was also really shaky. I was kind of wondering why they didn&apos;t try getting a crane, or something for moving shots. But in all of the moving shots it is someone holding the camera, and when the person holding the camera moves the camera starts rocking back and forth. This was unbearable during conversations, or sword fighting sequences.\n\nThe scenery was also a bit stale in this movie, especially in the city on the desert island place. It just seems like this movie could have no vegetation which really got old fast. The sets seemed boring, and just ordinary. Only (again) near the end did the sets get a little bit more interesting like on the ancient forest island.\n\nIF there is one thing everyone can agree on, it&apos;s that the slave catchers battle was incredibly bad, and put together horribly. None of the people in the battle look like they are taking it seriously, and there is almost no threat. The slave capturers just run around, it doesn&apos;t seem really intense. The sword combat is pretty lousy, and their moves seem slow. So bad combat scene+bad camera really makes this scene even worse.\n\nNow the movie didn&apos;t really explain the plot really well, so it wasn&apos;t until about the last 20 minutes of the movie did it make some sense. Still it seemed like the plot was thrown in. Why not just keep the plot of the original? I guess it wasn&apos;t good enough. Either way the movie did get much better in the last 20 minutes as well. The combat improved with a goofy looking serpent, in a well done dark mist realm that was not green mist. Though since the dark realm did have green mist in it, it started forming green figures that looks quite off. The movie does get better at the end when talking with Aslan and the nice water effects.\n\nAll in all the movie was a real let-down. This movie has almost no artistic perspective with camera shots, so the movie is overall boring to look at. The effects are good when they need to be, but they are generally bad. I feel like this is evidence that WETA must make all action movies&apos; effects which they already do. The plot was changed, and this left the movie quite confusing. I really feel bad for having to review this movie with a low rating, but trust me, if it weren&apos;t for the final last 20 minutes, this would&apos;ve been a 4/10 and I&apos;m still arguing with myself if I should change it to that.",

The sets and costumes and deep-focus photography combine to make even more absorbing the story Oscar Wilde tells of the man whose portrait decays as he himself remains forever youthful. Hurd Hatfield never had a better role and he makes the most of it. George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lionel Gilmore, George Sanders, Morton Lowry and many others contribute to the overall excellence of the acting. The period atmosphere of late-Victorian London adds much to the slowly growing horror of the tale. Complaints by others on this message board that the film is too slow or too talky are foolish. If you want action and special effects, see a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film--forget this. But as a compelling and psychological study of a man influenced by evil (personified by George Sanders as Lord Henry), this version is better than any of the others made since. It&apos;s chilling, the way Wilde intended, and no one could deliver his cynical yet witty observations about human nature better than George Sanders. By all means, an outstanding film. Should be required viewing as a study of the art of black-and-white cinematography."

Peter Sellers returns once again as a bumbling French detective who this time unwittingly stumbles upon a group of murders that keep piling up right under his nose. Could love interest Elke Sommers be the culprit? Well it appears so, but Sellers is not buying it just because he has the hots for her. George Sanders is among the cast of several other possible suspects and of course we also have the first appearance of Sellers&apos; superior (Herbert Lom). Co-written by William Peter Blatty (of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; fame!) and Blake Edwards (who also directed), &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; remains one of the better comedies from any cinematic era. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "The talented John Duigan (perhaps best known for directing WIDE SARGASSO SEA (1993), based on the novel by Jean Rhys) wrote and directed this wonderful film about kids growing up in New South Wales, Australia, in 1962. Four years later, with the same boy in the lead, Duigan directed its sequel, FLIRTING (1991). The film is so honest, straightforward, and heart-rending, that it is a model of what an unpretentious film about real people should be. The film was made in the small town of Braidwood, which apart from its cinema looks like something from 1862 rather than 1962, so things clearly didn&apos;t change much in those days in the area they call the &apos;Tableland&apos;. The film would not have worked if the two leads had not been so perfect. Seventeen year-old Loene Carmen is so fresh and real as the girl Freya Olson, but also so convincingly sad and tragic in the light of the events which ensue. The kids in this film just don&apos;t seem to be acting. We can almost believe that John Duigan sneaked into the little town with an invisible camera and recorded all of this really happening. The boy Danny is played by Noah Taylor. The honesty and integrity of his performance were the key to its success. He languishes with hopeless love as an onlooker to the tragic first romance of his childhood friend, Freya, who being older than him is &apos;out of his league&apos; romantically. The pain of first love, especially unrequited first love, is intensely conveyed. There is also the implicit undercurrent that Freya may be his own half-sister, with neither of them realizing it, as there is a subplot about the dead mother of Freya, Sarah Amery, who died having her at the age of only 17, and the father may well have been Danny&apos;s own. But this is all the invisible &apos;grownup background&apos; to the story of the kids, who are in the foreground of this tale. Ben Mendelsohn plays an older boy with a maniacal laugh who steals Freya&apos;s heart but who turns out to be mentally unbalanced, presumably with incipient schizophrenic. Things turn out badly. There are wonderful shots of the wild Australia, and the kids run around in the fields and on the hills with the abandon of a youth before everything became spoiled by cell phones, emails, and Facebook. Everyone in those days was outdoors all the time, not hunched over a computer. People actually looked at one another as they passed in the street, and were not peering into their Blackberrys or staring into space with a piece of metal stuck in their ear like a transplant. This film is an ode to real life, in a world which has forgotten what real life is. It is one of the masterpieces of the high tide of Australian cinema back in those days before the tide broke.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The best word I can come up to describe this fine film is humanistic. Everything about director Jan Troell&apos;s (The Emigrants) approach is based on the affect or reaction of the individual, very human, characters.\n\nMaria Heiskanen as Maria Larsson is fascinating ... in the most grounded, heartfelt style I have seen. She reminds of Imelda Staunton in her ability to sell grace and dignity despite all obstacles. This is not a film about some character&apos;s ability to make headlines. Rather it is one woman&apos;s battle for independence for herself and stability and safety for her seven children.\n\nWe may question why Maria insists on remaining with her violent-when-drunk husband, but she takes her father&apos;s counsel to honor her vows very seriously. She battles through much for her family but the true joy in the story comes from her awakening with a Contessa camera, courtesy of Sebastian Pederson (played well by Jesper Christensen). She discovers a god given talent and eye for photography.\n\nThis is a long film, but so realistically presented that it just compels the viewer to join in. Sadly, it won&apos;t find much of an audience in the U.S., but it is excellent film-making and a very rewarding journey.",

But Douglas Fairbanks is certainly worth watching, if you have any real interest in film.  He has so much charm, and moves so fluidly, that he captivates even when the special effects are, well, very 1920s.  Fairbanks does not so much act as he dances the role.  The costumes and sets, by William Cameron Menzies, are also spectacular.  I have watched this movie in the earlier DVD version, and frankly it put me to sleep.  First, a great deal of it was missing, and so the story was choppy and hard to follow. Second, the print quality was poor.  But the new Kino Fairbanks collection is a miracle of film restoration.  There is one section on this DVD that is poor quality, compared to the others.  But since this is a section that I have never seen before, to see it at all is wonderful.",

      "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, this one constituted another gaffe within my ongoing Halloween challenge since it&apos;s not really a horror film despite title, director (he&apos;d later make the gory PIECES [1983]) and presence of genre icons Peter Cushing and Paul Naschy! In fact, it&apos;s a typical Jules Verne adventure (based on his much-filmed &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;) which proves surprisingly palatable – thanks also to a lively score – though unbalanced by comedy relief from the youthful hero&apos;s bumbling/cowardly sidekick, a Professor of Elocution whose name is constantly mispronounced (&quot;T. Artelet not tartlet!&quot;).\n\nCushing is the protagonist&apos;s rich uncle who has purchased an island, to which the boy is sent and where he meets a variety of dangers (pirates, cannibals, monsters) – eventually, there&apos;s a twist with respect to most of these, which thankfully explains the sheer poverty of the creatures on display! On the other hand, Naschy has a very small role at the start as a man who has struck gold – which is then coveted by his associates. The latter include Terence Stamp who, for obvious reasons, was Cushing&apos;s chief rival for the acquisition of the island; later on, he turns up on it (ludicrously shrouded from top to bottom complete with anachronistic goggles!) with his bandit horde to take the gold by force – to this end, he even plants a female &apos;shipwreck victim&apos; to lure the hero into divulging the loot&apos;s whereabouts.\n\nCoupled with the far better GORILLA AT LARGE (1954; see above) on Fox&apos;s-by-way-of-MGM &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; banner, it offers the film both in English and Spanish. At first, always the stickler for a film&apos;s native country being its original language, I started watching the film in Spanish but when a narrator began translating the credits into Spanish and the English subtitles proved to be of the descriptive &quot;hard of hearing&quot; variety, I soon gave up my puritan pretensions and watched it with the more &apos;user friendly&apos; English soundtrack on. At least, one does get to hear Cushing and Stamp reciting their own lines this way...",

      "reviewBody": "This is not a great movie.  It&apos;s definitely a B movie.  It was clearly done on a low budget, belongs to a generally unremarkable genre, and has a plot that leaves much to be desired.  For all that, it&apos;s actually not nearly as bad as would be expected.\n\n The major premise (that in space there is some kind of immateriel life form that possesses human flesh and wants to kill people) is obscurely bogus, yes, but many much better movies are open to the same criticism. SpiderMan&apos;s premise is hardly more realistic, for example, but that is a major motion picture and gets very good reviews.\n\n Then there&apos;s the plot.  Sure, it&apos;s a little thin, but the movie does *have* a discernible plot (not something you can take for granted in a B-grade movie), and what is more, the plot is quite coherent.  You do not find yourself confused part-way through about what is going on, which of the people on the screen are from which group (good guys, bad guys, et cetera), or any of the other vagaries that often haunt the plots of lousy movies. The plot isn&apos;t deep, but as far as it goes it is solid.\n\n The acting, moreover, is not bad.  I did not notice a single instance of noticeably poor acting.  Not that anyone&apos;s going to win any awards for the acting in this movie, but they don&apos;t do anything to break all pretenses of mimesis and make you want to scream at the actors, either. This is fairly unusual, especially for such an obviously low-budget flick, and extra-especially in the horror genre.  You expect, in a movie of this sort, to be disgusted when actors stutter, scream at the wrong times, leave long pauses between lines, and have wooden, unlifelike expressions on their faces.  I didn&apos;t notice any of that, unless you count characters who were at the time possessed by the alien life form, and that was clearly a deliberate charactarization of the menace as quirkily unhuman.\n\n As for the writing, I&apos;ve seen worse.  The characters were mostly flat and static, but horror movies seldom make any pretenses about having round, dynamic characters.  Only a couple of the characters were really obvious stereotypes (notably, the scientists&apos; boss and the deputy).\n\n Probably the worst thing about this movie is that the ending quite obviously left things wide open for a sequel."

Karin Dor plays Nora Sanders a secretary to Mrs Revelstoke(Elizabeth Flickenschildt),one of the targets for Shelton. Elisabeth Flickenschildt is excellent in her role, has a very soft lilt to her voice yet still across sinister. Slightly plodding around mid-way, but overall a well-paced film, packed with atmosphere and ends with a killer twist. The identity of the killer came as a surprise.",

Billy Zane portrays a member of the Media Police, Raymond Palinov, selected by the &quot;CKS&quot; (Internal Security) to infiltrate into a neighbouring city-state called Megaville wherein &quot;media&quot; is legal, in an ostensible attempt to assist in discouraging the continuance of a conduit of media products into the Hemisphere, and who has been recipient of a remote control transmitter installed in his brain, from which he will receive instructions from the CKS head, played by Daniel J. Travanti. There is a good deal of raw material here for application of satire, but the work is poorly written, directed and executed, with bafflement rampant as to what is transpiring during a majority of scenes, while poor Zane, charismatic under strong direction, is permitted in this instance his full range of fey mannerisms, and with contemporary street scenes of the Los Angeles Civic Center dolefully failing to impress as a future anything, at all.",

The characters are extremely funny, and the clash between the medieval knight and his sidekick and the modern world is just as grotesque as I imagine it would be in real life.\n\nThe part where they have dinner together is the best: &quot;Jour...nuit...jour...nuit...&quot; You can&apos;t quit laughing."

      "reviewBody": "One man&apos;s journey into the world of the so-called &quot;Bloodline&quot; conspiracy, at the heart of Dan Brown&apos;s The Da Vinci Code...\n\nThis documentary examines a great conspiracy, and uncovers some interesting food for thought -- particularly about the three men killed within 24 hours of each other. There seems to be an interesting history behind the Priory of Sion, assuming such an organization even exists.\n\nI notice that others have compared this to the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;, and that is not unfair. Much of it involves a shaky camera following one guy around -- a guy who clearly might be a bit too open to fringe ideas.\n\nSadly, whatever truth is uncovered here, it is greatly undermined by the revelation that &quot;the tomb man&quot; and his discoveries are a hoax (and he has admitted as much). So, you know, it is even harder to sort fact from fiction when you have to discount almost half of what you see... perhaps a re-editing?",

      "reviewBody": "THE FRAME is the second film from writer-director Jamin Winans and it represents a significant improvement over its predecessor, INK, on all fronts. The basics of the plot, which is very hard to describe as it is without giving away too much information, is that there are two people, Alex and Sam, who are each going through some difficulties in their lives. Through some weird turn of events they end up meeting and eventually help each other come to terms with their pasts and current realities. I&apos;m possibly missing something, but that was the gist of what I got out of it. The film speaks to the theme of our past defining who we are, to ourselves and others. Both Alex and Sam are in situations that they feel trapped in because of where they&apos;ve been, but it takes meeting the other to discover that they are the authors of their own stories. And somehow, a dirty, black-clad man with a wrinkled hat who sprays ink on things has something to do with it. I think that to really grasp the fullness of what Winans is doing here requires more than one viewing, and I&apos;ll probably return to it at some point. For now, though, I&apos;m just digesting it. In comparison to INK, though, THE FRAME is a much better film. It benefits from a slightly bigger budget, and the camera-work and editing are all improved. Even the acting, while not spectacular, is better than it was in INK. There aren&apos;t a whole lot of visual effects, but one effect of people turning into ink did look pretty cool. There&apos;s also some playing around with aspect ratios towards the end. Overall, THE FRAME was a visually creative, unique sci-fi/fantasy film that explores themes of redemption and overcoming doubts with sensitivity and a little flair. If you liked INK, then you should check this out but I would also recommend it to anyone who wants something the likes of which they haven&apos;t seen before.",

You can met not only Henry Silva (good as usual) and Thomas Milian (amazing part !) but also Claudio Cassinneli as Police inspector Sarti (cf. : LA POLIZIA A LE MANI LEGATE) and Nicoletta Machiavelli who stars &quot;capo&quot; of the abductor&apos;s girlfriend. Charming Nicoletta was directely linked with the Renaissance political philosopher Nicola Machiavelli (&quot;The Prince&quot;, &quot;Studies on Titus Livius&quot;, etc.) and was at a time herself thought to have been adbucted after having diseappeared for more than week from her San Lazzaro Castle near Bolognia where she lived near her father Nicolo Machiavelli. As usual, the great Dardano Sachetti has written a script full of violence with a evident touch of political and social concern : painting of the underworld is sharp, without any concession to good taste, full of dark humor and full of ultra-violence. Director of photography Luigi Kuveiller is allright as usual and the car chases are, as always with the good &quot;poliziotti&quot; movies - and it is the case, here ! -  quite impressive ones. As usual also, great realism in the choice of guns as a reflect of the sociology of guns in Italy in 1976 among both police and thugs : reglementary submachine-gun Beretta M12 chambered in 9mm Parabellum, Semi-auto pistol Walther P-38 chambered in 9mm Parabellum, Semi-auto pistol Beretta M1951 chambered in 9mm Parabellum, etc. To be pointed out : the titles themselves at the beginning of the movie make the viewer thinks that he is looking at the wrong movie : you see a western (probably an italian one !) but camera zooms back to reveal that we are in a screening room of... a prison ! French exploitation title at the time of release in French Theaters : &quot;LE TRUAND SORT DE SA PLANQUE&quot;."

Except here, maybe because he&apos;s familiar with the cast, which would allow him to ask intimate questions to relatives in the private sphere, &apos;realism&apos; becomes &apos;voyeurism&apos;. Questions asked to the poor cast are just plain bad taste. And the humanistic tendencies Gondry so beautifully explored in all his previous movies are travestied in facebook-era voyeurism.\n\nA poor, disappointing &apos;effort&apos; which can evoke, quite oddly, the most sadistic of Andre Gide. Except Gide is fully aware of what he&apos;s doing - which Gondry doesn&apos;t even notice.",

It went straight to video, and partly due to lack of promotion (and lack of quality) it didn&apos;t do very well.\n\nFast-forward 8 years. A second attempt is being made, this time with a higher budget, better actors and a new script (that wasn&apos;t published as a comic before) aimed at the big screen. The result, however, is even worse.\n\nThis movie lacks a plot (it wasn&apos;t written by the author of the comics BTW), lacks good directing (the director even admitted he doesn&apos;t like the comic book series), and despite the (for Belgium) know cast it lacks good acting (since there&apos;s not much to go on).\n\nToo bad, since this could have been great. Luk Wijns is a perfect typecast. Given a better script and a better director this could have been good. Now it&apos;s just a total waste.\n\nThe author of the comics withdrew from this film when it was still in production, and refuses a DVD-release. Chances that one will ever see this film again are minimal. The director (thankfully) learned his lesson too and went on to direct for TV instead of film. So now, most people seem to have forgotten it even exists. Which is probably a good thing...",

One of them, Rebecca Balding, a strong, no-nonsense actress, cottons on to what&apos;s happening and starts to investigate.\n\nAlthough the film was inspired by Halloween, it plays more like &quot;Psycho&quot; or &quot;Terror House&quot; and benefits from its downbeat look and score.",

A black man named Ellsworth `Bumpy&apos; Johnson (Lawrence Fishburne) was released from prison and went back to Harlem.  Then he joins his cousin, Illinois Gordon, and gets back into an illegal lottery racket ran by Madame Queen.  They call the game `numbers.&apos;  They say that numbers is the only business in Harlem which provides them with work.  A white man from uptown named Dutch Shultz (Tim Roth) is also trying to run the numbers downtown in Harlem, and there ends up being a battle between Shultz and the Queen.  Madame goes to jail and leaves Bumpy in charge. Bumpy meets a fine woman, Francine (Vanessa Williams), who sees good in him and wants him to stop messing around with `numbers.&apos;  But she stays by his side while things get chaotic.  Will he realize what he should do in time or will he lose everything?\n\nThe director Bill Duke has a message in this movie.               It says when people are left limited options, they are going to find a way to get by.  In one scene, Bumpy is telling Illinois because of the depression there isn&apos;t very many jobs and white men didn&apos;t leave them any jobs, so they had no options for making money other than through the numbers racket.\n\nThis movie had fast paced action.  I liked the part where Dutch Shultz wants Madame Queen&apos;s organization out of the numbers racket in Harlem, so he can make all the money from it.  Bumpy, who works for Madame Queen, comes up with a plan for eliminating the problem of Dutch, by getting Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia), another gangster, and Dutch in a fight.  This movie is a `classic gangster movie.&apos;"

The movie begins by Barbie telling her little sister a story about a particular woman, Eden, who just doesn&apos;t enjoy the holidays. Eden basically hates Christmas and lives by Aunt Mary&apos;s motto: In a selfish world, the selfish succeed. Several Christmas apparitions visit Eden to set her right.\n\nI chose this to be the first Christmas film I watched for the holidays. That was right of me. Young children could possibly find joy and entertainment in this Barbie film. Parents don&apos;t have to worry about &apos;scary things&apos;, either. The film has been padded with much-added humor that only children will enjoy. Still, to be fair, it was nice to watch this film. Barbie movies are filled with innocence that I do enjoy! But I didn&apos;t like their retelling of Dickens&apos; novel. Fans of Dickens&apos; should steer clear from this one.\n\nViewed on: December 22-23, 2011",

      "reviewBody": "You can guarantee if there&apos;s one area of the current employment sector which continually flouts the rules of a recession, it&apos;s the underworld London East End gangster. William Monahan&apos;s (screenplays for &apos;The Departed&apos; and &apos;Body of Lies&apos;) directorial debut is an adaptation of Ken Bruen&apos;s 2001 novel &apos;London Boulevard&apos; about a criminal who after being released from prison, attempts to go &apos;straight,&apos; but despite his attempts, he can never truly escape his violent past. It&apos;s not a perfect film by any means, but capable direction, and solid performances from a primarily solid British and Irish cast, create a competent directorial debut for Monahan.\n\nMitchell (Colin Farrell) has just been released from Pentonville after a three year sentence for assault, when he exits the prison he is picked up by long-time partner in crime, and local enforcer, Billy (Ben Chaplin), who takes Mitchell to a party in his honour. Every East End drug dealing gangster is there to shake the hand of one of the most feared men in London, but all Mitchell wants is to get a job, and avoid being restricted to a sixteen by eight cell again. He manages to convince a beautiful, reclusive actress (Keira Knightly) and her pot-smoking-hippy-esquire-father-figure Jordan (David Thewlis) to hire him as a handyman around their paparazzi infested estate. But when the leading figure in the London underworld, Mr Gant (Ray Winstone) comes looking to place Mitchell high up in his crime organization, he must find a way to refuse the advances of such a dangerous man, while also protecting those closest to him.\n\nFor the first ten-to-fifteen minutes of the film, Colin Farrell&apos;s forced middle-class cockney accent takes centre stage, but once he settles into the role, his performance takes limelight as a sociopathic criminal with somewhat of a heart. His brash use of violence, and utter respect and protection of friends, family and confidants, provides a conflict within Mitchell that he constantly battles throughout the film. The only thing he knows what to do is enforce, and if he was a true gangster he would &quot;kill everyone and take everything they had,&quot; but at the same time, the last thing he wants in his life is to return to that desolate hole known as prison. Aside from Farrell, both David Thewlis and Ben Chaplin give great performances as the hippy, wannabe actor and scared, low-level gangster respectively. While Anne Friel also plays the thieving, stubborn, childish sister of Mitchell&apos;s very well. Yet while Ray Winstone never puts a foot wrong, his role as the Underworld Godfather has become rather predictable and uninteresting, especially since every other word out of his Landan mouth is either f**k or c**t (or a combination of both). Monahan really missed a trick, by failing to provide Winstone&apos;s character with any further depth.\n\nAlso beside the main story as Mitchell battles his growing love for the reclusive actress and the life of a straight man alongside that of his violent past, and potential gangster future, is the sub-plot of Mitchell&apos;s old homeless friend Joe (Alan Williams) who is killed ruthlessly by a couple of youths and Mitchell&apos;s subsequent attempts to find out who is responsible. While it is an adequate underlying story to accompany the main narrative, neither Monahan&apos;s direction nor his screenplay seem to follow it to any decisive conclusion. It seems if anything, if this sub-plot is simply included to allow the subversion of the ending and provide a twist or surprise ending, which the film itself certainly does not need. &apos;London Boulevard&apos; is a proficient first effort for Monahan, and while the film contains flaws, which you expect from a first-time director plying his trade, it is also an engaging gangster drama which is smartly written, and incredibly well-acted by many of the great British and Irish actors at the moment.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the years, I&apos;ve read a number of professional critics&apos; reviews of this film; almost all were mildly to severely negative.  And here&apos;s the interesting thing: I don&apos;t disagree with most of the individual carps. Yes, the movie is a piece of fluff. Yes,the usually dependable Danny Kaye is a bit weak in his performance. Yes, the plot mechanism for inserting many of the production numbers is lame.  Heck, even the continuity is poor...I myself have discovered three noticeable continuity fluffs. But here&apos;s the thing.  The movie works, anyway!!! Bing and Danny nevertheless make a likeable &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; duo. The supporting cast all holds their own, from a radiant (and surprisingly voluptuous) Rosemary Clooney, to the astoundingly agile Vera Ellen, to Dean Jagger&apos;s Patton-like General Waverly...they all hit their marks very well. The plot-line is unbelievable.  Who cares?  This is a feel-good Christmas Movie, for cryin&apos; out loud!  The production numbers are sheer fun, the plot doesn&apos;t get in the way of all the beauty and great music, the actors are obviously having a good time, and we&apos;re all allowed to window-peep on the shenanigans.  This is the PERFECT movie to put on after Macy&apos;s Parade, while all those who don&apos;t like football are helping prep for the big Turkey Day meal.  You sneak a bit of dressing or cranberry sauce, and watch a production number.  The plot is so user-friendly, missing five minutes here and there doesn&apos;t hurt. Treat yourself.  Discover why millions of views have made this movie a holiday favorite, despite the critics&apos; opinions!"

      "reviewBody": "Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nGrocery clerk Kenneth (Mark Duplass) places an ad in a local paper asking for someone to go with him as he time travels. He says they&apos;ll be paid once they return but safety isn&apos;t guaranteed as he&apos;s only done this once before. A magazine writer (Jake Johnson) hears about the story and takes a long a couple interns, one named Darius (Aubrey Plaza), quickly gets caught up with the time traveler as she applies for the job without him knowing that she&apos;s actually on a job. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is a pretty strange film to classify because it&apos;s part comedy and there are certainly some very light moments but the film also has a tremendous heart, which lets the characters actually be characters and this leads to some pretty dramatic moments. I guess the best way to classify this film is just by calling it life because it pretty much has a little bit of everything in it. What I found so good about the picture is simply how cute and charming it actually is. The reporters go into this story expecting to find a crazy man because we all know that time travel can&apos;t happen. What works so well with the film is the fact that you makes you believe that these type of things are possible and you really get caught up with all the characters and their situations. By the time the movie is over, and I won&apos;t spoil the ending, you&apos;re leaving the theater with a smile on your face no matter what your brain might tell you afterwards. Duplass and Plaza are simply perfect together as both of them bring the weirdness and loneliness out of their characters but they also have such a warm and wonderful chemistry that you can&apos;t help but fall for both of them. I also thought Johnson was extremely good in his supporting role as is Karan Soni as the other intern. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is really a magical little gem that is a breath of fresh air if you&apos;re wanting to get away from the loud blockbusters of the summer."

Senna has to be the best documentary ever made, It simply tells the story of the great man trough, Mostly. old TV footage. This brings back memory s of late night highlight shows of a race that happened hours before. Its Shocking to see the total unfairness of the sport at that time, Its trilling to see the racing. Its so sad to see senna&apos;s Last lap at Imola. Overall It&apos;s a peek into the life of one of the worlds greatest sportsmen, a wort&apos;s and all account of a good, but sometimes, flawed man. If for no other reason than seeing how well the old footage is spliced back together, Go and see Senna, You will not be disappointed.",

      "name": "A landmark horror film which is still as powerful and disturbing as ever.",
      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Last House On The Left&apos; is easily Wes Craven&apos;s most important movie. It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now, despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero&apos;s &apos;Night Of The Living Dead&apos; deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point (the late 60s), but even that had a supernatural element, something &apos;Last House On The Left&apos; eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence, most likely inspired by Peckinpah&apos;s &apos;Straw Dogs&apos; released the previous year, and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. &apos;Last House...&apos; is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal, so the movie is rough and crudely made at times, but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari&apos;s parents and the comic relief cops (who include Martin Kove later to appear in &apos;Death Race 2000&apos; and countless action movies!) are pretty awful, but the two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) are both very natural and believable, and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very, very good. Krug is played by David Hess, who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack, something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis&apos; &apos;All Shook Up&apos; and &apos;I Got Stung&apos; and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug&apos;s junkie son, Fred J. Lincoln (now a porno director I believe!) is excellent as the aptly named Weasel, and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie, who brings to mind some of Manson&apos;s girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. &apos;Last House On The Left&apos; is hardly the kind of movie you &quot;enjoy&quot; but I think it&apos;s a very important movie, and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It&apos;s really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend &apos;The Last House On The Left&apos; to anybody interested in the development of horror, screen violence, or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned, it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take. I think it is worth it as it&apos;s still an extraordinary piece of work!"

Instead, he plays an ex-Marine hired by a wealthy businessman to rescue his kidnapped daughter from Vietnamese bandits. Vietnam films were pretty played out by the time this films was made, so I&apos;m not quite sure why this was a story that needed to be told, especially since essentially same story was told much better in the 1983 John Milius produced &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; (which incidentally Dudikoff had a brief non-speaking role). Dudikoff assembles his own Dirty Dozen out of a bunch of criminals and reprobates to carry out their predictable and dull mission. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, an actor too good for this tripe, does as much as he can with his ridiculous villain role as the bandit leader. Overall, this is a pretty low rent Vietnam themed action film that&apos;s about 10 years too late.",

In particular, the acting is good, but not outstanding.  However the film is very political, preferring capitalist glitz to communist squalor.  The best moment comes when the hero is asked whether he is West German or East German and he replies &quot;gesamtdeutsch&quot;, which I would guess translates as &quot;all-German&quot;.  I left feeling what a total obscenity that stupid Wall was.\n\nI should say that I only wrote this review because nobody else seems to have bothered.  My German is still pretty basic and I expect I missed quite a lot.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was actually banned in Britain since it was due for release in the same year as two ten-year-old boys abducted, tortured and murdered a two-year-old child. To this day, I don&apos;t understand that decision since nothing Mikey does reaches the scale of what those two sadistic monsters did nor does Mikey ever attempt to harm complete innocents but chooses his victims from people who have done him &apos;wrong&apos;.\n\nAnyway, I&apos;ve finally managed to get my hands on a copy and I have to say, I&apos;m quite glad I did. It&apos;s definitely not a film to be taken seriously but it can be rather funny if viewed as a dark comedy. Obviously, there&apos;s huge plot holes such as how a ten-year-old can move from place-to-place without anyone checking on his background and why these people were able to adopt him in a matter of days. However, there is something slightly humorous in watching the rather stupid adults be played by a young, calculating boy.",

Harry (Aiello), the &quot;brains of the operation&quot; advises against it, but Roy grabs Gary and drags him to their (stolen) getaway vehicle. Roy is determined to get big bucks out of Gary&apos;s father when they discovered that the $250k they thought was in the safe, wasn&apos;t there. The father is notified of the crime by his business associate (Stein), while he is with his paramour. He notifies his wife (shopping in Paris) who is not exactly an ideal parent either.\n\nMeanwhile, Gary removes his blindfold and sees the faces of his kidnappers which angers psychotic Roy (Pantoliano) into threatening the boy&apos;s life after they get the money. Harry, a basically good-natured guy, protects the kid and when Roy takes off to collect the ransom, he and the kid take off. After a comedy of errors, he and Gary return to the hideout and Roy returns with the cash, and a gun. When he tries to kill the kid, Harry pulls out a gun he has just stolen and ties up Roy, taking his share of the cash and leaving with young Gary.\n\nDuring their hilarious escape and preparations to flee to Mexico, Gary bonds with Harry, who has taken a liking to the lonely, neglected boy. He even gets the kid a pet. When their (stolen) car breaks down, Harry and Gary are taken in by Rose, a kindly motel operator (Moriarty). Rose takes a liking to Harry and young Gary begins to feel left out.\n\nAnother jealous character, Rose&apos;s ex-husband, a deputy sheriff, is suspicious of Harry and discovers the car is stolen. WHen he attempts to capture Harry, Rose puts him off the track. Eventually Roy escapes his bonds, and takes off in pursuit of Harry and the kid, this time with vengeance on his mind. The unusual conclusion has the kid telling the cops what to do.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ricochet&quot; is a movie worth seeing (renting) for its two lead actors; both of whom approach this movie with gusto, not to mention serious talent: Denzel as the righteous crusader attorney, and Lithgow as the bat-guano crazy killer. Lithgow plays the hell out of the psycho here, not the scenery-chewing bad guy you picture from &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, but the unhinged and unpredictable kind. The mindscrew he puts Denzel through in this movie is something else, man. Way out there.\n\nSleazy and over-the-top are both very good descriptors for &quot;Ricochet&quot;, which isn&apos;t at all what I&apos;d expected. It does have that early &apos;90s violence (you know it when you see it), but a lot of it&apos;s shot like a music video; it&apos;s kinda surreal. Ice Ti&apos;s character/subplot is awkwardly shoved in there, but on the other hand, Kevin Pollack&apos;s a reliable presence. I do love that Mary Ellen Trainor&apos;s playing the same character she did in &quot;Die Hard&quot;) it&apos;s so random). This holds your attention, but it&apos;s also fairly forgettable.\n\n6/10",

Unlike Ran, it is not Shakespearean. Unlike Seven Samurai, my favorite all-time film and I believe the best film ever made, it is not a western. \n\nAlthough epic, it is about a sweet and rueful soul swallowed by karma and history. It is redemptive without overt sentiment, and the lead performance by Tatsuya Nakadai is nuanced and unforgettable. \n\nI will always remember this film, not for its complexity or savagery, but for the simplest moments between Lord and subject, between the highest self and the lowest self, and most particularly, the very real pain of a man caught in the vise of his own life and death.",

It&apos;s a political story about the ways in which corruption can exploit those on the ground and even lead to a murder plot. Unfortunately for this film, the script is quite nonsensical, positing Britain&apos;s own Prime Minister as the master villain of the piece, quite happy to sell out members of his own armed forces for the sake of a trade deal.\n\nHad the villain been a junior minister with the ability to manipulate the system then it might have been more convincing, but giving the Prime Minister power to do this just makes it a laugh. It doesn&apos;t help that this film is entirely cheap without any action sequences in it whatsoever; in fact, when something does threaten to happen (such as the car scene with the two women), the film randomly cuts away to the aftermath. It&apos;s not totally bad, as one extended torture sequence is extremely gruelling, and a few familiar faces like Craig Fairbrass, Marina Sirtis, and John Rhys-Davies show up to pick up their pay cheques. The casting director has also gone out of his way to cast attractive actresses in support. In the end, though, 31 NORTH 62 EAST is simply a forgettable, occasionally ridiculous little thriller.",

On the other hand, I didn&apos;t find it ghastly (though a few others on this board did). It has the same terrific cast, which includes Don Ameche, Jack Gilford, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, with the addition of Elaine Strich in the old folks&apos; department, and Tawnee Welch, Tyrone Power Jr., and Steve Guttenberg with the addition of a very young Courtney Cox in the young folks&apos; department. Brian Dennehy makes a brief appearance at the end of the film.\n\nThe Anterians need to return to pick up some cocoons, so the old folks come back to catch up with friends and family, with some interesting results.\n\nAnother plot concerns scientists taking one of the cocoons and studying it, while the Anterians attempt to rescue it before it&apos;s too late.\n\nThe movie actually has some very sweet moments - it probably would have been lousy without the same cast, but they&apos;re all very likable.\n\nOkay, not great, and anyone under 55 probably won&apos;t want to be bothered. By the way, I cried during some of it. Guess my age.",

      "reviewBody": "A while ago someone launched a rumour in here the Croatian press that this film was going to be nominated for an Oscar for the best foreign picture. HA HA HA HA HA. Good one! Marketing genius, whoever made that one up.\n\nWell, not only is it not being considered for an Oscar or any kind of prestigious award like that, it should actually be given a Razzie for one of the worst films ever. Luckily for Branko Schmidt, the piece is too obscure to actually get a Razzie. So that&apos;s one upside of living in Croatia, eh?\n\nThat and maybe the fact that Croatian cinematography isn&apos;t renowned for spewing out masterpieces in general, so maybe within the scope of that environment this film even compares as &quot;okay&quot;. On a more global scale I don&apos;t think it deserves any attention. \n\nIn short I would describe it as a very sketchy, shallow piece whose story line lacks development and is poorly narrated through sporadic and thin dialogue between superficial, grotesque characters whose motivation is at best - unclear. \n\nMany mediocre films suffer from lack of idea how to end a story, even if their beginning was promising. Cannibal Vegetarian lands &quot;in medias res&quot; with a chaotic speed-sequence that is supposed to reflect the frantic personality of the main character. Perhaps this style may appeal to younger generations. This form of narration continues throughout the film. Unfortunately the director seemed to be so preoccupied with painting the pathology of the main character&apos;s psyche that he forgot to develop any other character, or even give a flow and some direction to the actual story being told. Just when you think the plot is about to culminate, it ends abruptly as if the writer had just given up. You get dragged through 85 minutes of painful, forced interactions between all-bad-guys characters to be given no resolution and no message?\n\nWhat an unfortunate collision of bad writing and unimaginative directing.",

The locations - desert, oases, Arabic architecture were well chosen, costuming very stylish, camels, ocean, underwater photography were well done. The actors/actresses did a decent job despite the script. And since when was any paradise on this planet anything but far-fetched? Blue Lagoon does not own youthful awakening.

      "reviewBody": "Gracia Querejeta, together with her already well-known father who has produced such great little masterpieces like `El Sur&apos; (1982) (qv) and the intimistic portrait `Tasio&apos; (1984) (qv), has ventured her hand at this feminine character-driven piece. I did not say `feminist&apos;. Using  numerous flashbacks  I counted about a dozen or so  between the present day and what would seem to be the early or mid-fifties, the spectator must remain very alert, especially in the first half of the film, if he is to piece together the events with any kind of coherence. Three sisters living cosily in Madrid and who rarely see each other, are forced to make a journey together to their native Galicia in order to carry out their mother&apos;s last wish: her ashes are to be scattered around three family homes. Certain characteriological frictions between the three ladies start becoming evident, bursting into outright clashes now and again, as certain deeds of the past come to light. The role-playing is pretty good, and improves when confrontations occur with their mother Adela in the flashbacks, and Tía Rafaela (Marta Belaustegui and Julieta Serrano respectively, the latter undergoing tremendous make-up so as to play in both time slots). The men form a dark background essential to the story, but they are for the most part very much in secondary roles.\n\nAlfredo Mayo&apos;s photography is good  it could hardly be otherwise in a beautiful Galicia in late summer. Most of the film was shot in all kinds of rural locations scattered around the region. I was able to identify `Las Médulas&apos;, which in fact are just outside Galicia (barely 3kms!) which in Roman times was an important gold-mining area. Those strange arenisc rock formations formed by natural wind and water erosion offer a very peculiar spectacle for the visitor; there is a little museum there as the village has been turned into a tourist attraction in recent years. I also recognised the landing ferry at Douade on the River Sil. Affording beautiful scenery, the gorge runs through abrupt chasms with vineyards growing up those steep slopes, some of which date back to Roman times or even earlier. There is a twice-daily boat-trip down the canyon which is well worth the time. In both cases, in the summer visits should be made in the morning: it gets very hot in both places in the afternoon! An ivy and moss-covered bridge I think is the one over the River Miño near Portomarín. Certain coastal shots were made up in the Rías Altas, in one case I think it was near Camariñas, but in another case possibly near the famous beach known as `As Catedrais&apos; in the province of Lugo. Wherever, wherever, write down Galicia for your next holidays! You will not be disappointed.\n\nMy one complaint about this film is that I did not hear even one genuine Galician accent from anybody! Which, frankly, left me feeling rather flat. I mean, the Querejetas could have shot it in Aragón or Asturias or Murcia or anywhere else, and it would not have made any difference to the film  apart from the scenery, which, anyway, is just as good in these places. For this failure I must take off a whole point from my vote, which is slightly on the high side of six out of ten.\n\nThe Spanish spoken is mostly fairly easy to follow with only a few brief exceptions.",

      "reviewBody": "Jump is a 2009 Chinese movie that&apos;s basically a tame version of &quot;Step Up&quot; meets &apos;Shaolin Soccer&quot;. That sentence pretty much sums up the entire movie sufficiently enough, and I could end this review right here and just rate the thing. But, I&apos;ll put in a little more effort.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\n&quot;Jump&quot; stars Kitty Zhang as a country farm girl who goes to the big city to chase her dreams of becoming a hip-hop dancer. She scrounges &amp; scrapes, and works her ass off to blindly achieve her goal; all the while playing the naïve bumpkin with a heart of gold who couldn&apos;t be happier. By day, she works in a textile factory, and at night, she is the janitor of a dance studio where she picks up what moves she can by observing the dance crew while mopping the floors. She stays late at night at the dance studio to study &amp; practice, and she sleeps and eats whenever she can.\n\nStuck up rich kids who comprise the dance crew treat the country girl like dirt and make fun of her, until one day, she tires of the bullying and shows off her newfound dance moves. Then, everybody is now good friends and she&apos;s welcomed in as part of the dance crew that&apos;s soon set to face off against the &quot;evil&quot; Korean dance team champs. Along the way, she catches the eye of the playboy rich dude who owns the dance studio, and romance between the two is afoot. \n\nThis movie is oh so predictable, and it&apos;s a story that&apos;s been told a thousand times before; fish out of water ugly duckling finds her calling in the bright lights of the big city while making friends and finding love. Is this version of this age old tale worth checking out?...Probably not, but you won&apos;t kill yourself if you watch it.\n\nKitty represents herself well enough for what she&apos;s asked to do. She&apos;s plays the unkempt country girl who one day blossoms into an urban beauty...as usual, it&apos;s pretty clear she&apos;s very attractive to begin with, whether she&apos;s farming in northern China or dancing on the streets of downtown Hong Kong, but apparently no one can see this until she gets the &quot;pretty movie makeover treatment&quot;. And of course, there&apos;s one scene in the movie where the rich playboy invariably takes her to a high end beauty salon &amp; clothier, and she&apos;s instantly turned into a young goddess ready for a night on the town with the cool kids and rich people.\n\nThe rest of the cast consists of the main love interest played by Daniel Wu, her best friend from back home, her dad she left behind, the snotty dance crew who come to embrace her, and a few other people; they&apos;re mostly serviceable, but I&apos;ve never really quite understood the appeal of Daniel Wu. I&apos;ve seen him in a ton of stuff, and he&apos;s never awful and doesn&apos;t irritate me per se, but I just don&apos;t see the star power that he apparently is supposed to have. Oh well, to each their own I guess. \n\nThat&apos;s about it. A few more random thoughts:\n\nI was not really all that impressed with the dance scenes; I&apos;ve seen better in other movies and any number of Asian dance/survival TV shows. That being said (written), I personally couldn&apos;t dance my way out of a wet paper bag, so I cannot say anything more than that about this aspect of the film.\n\nIt took me about 1 or 2 minutes into viewing this film to say to myself, &quot;Hmmm, this movie seems like Stephen Chow must be involved somehow&quot;. Sure enough, he&apos;s the main credited writer, and this production clearly has all of the earmarks and undertones of his trademark approach to storytelling.\n\nKitty&apos;s character often appears to be borderline insane in her relentless positive outlook on life. She&apos;s constantly smiling ear to ear, giggling maniacally, or bouncing around like a lunatic, for 90% of the movie; it almost seems that Kitty was mandated to down a greenie/red bull/wellbutrin cocktail before each take. This is such an overwhelming facet of her character that when she spent those few moments acting on the opposite end of the spectrum, I was thinking we could easily be in for a Miike &quot;Audition&quot; moment here (if this were a different type of movie). Now, that would have been AWESOME!\n\nAs it stands, this movie is definitely NOT AWESOME! It&apos;s just too silly, too predictable, and not well executed or well put together. It&apos;s an average movie at best. Didn&apos;t hate it, but can&apos;t ever see myself desiring to watch it again. I could see some people liking it up to a 6 or maybe a 6.5 or so, and others disliking it down to a 4 or thereabouts, but that should be about its range overall.\n\n5 out of 10 stars for me.",

It&apos;s a great story about a teen coping with loss through her training of a lame horse. The film has lots of emotion, actresses and actors that have a house-hold name, and it was set and filmed in the Pittsburgh area. Cineametographer Dean Cundy, the man behind Jurassic Park&apos;s beautiful scenes, does a great job with sharp images, bright colors, and racing scenes that put you in the action. And I thought actor Jason Gedrick did a great performance and stole the movie. There&apos;s even a funny cameo with Steve Guttenburg and the late Charles Durning, which I believe is his last performance. Check it out!",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this movie because I&apos;m pretty big Michael Cera fan and really nothing he&apos;s been in so far has been terrible... however, this movie looks like it was begging not to be watched. With a title like Extreme Movie, an embarrassing cover, and the fact that it&apos;s a Blockbuster Exclusive, honestly doesn&apos;t give it very much appeal. However, the cast seemed pretty good, the directors made a hilarious spoof movie (I loved Not Another Teen Movie), and the writers were impressive, many big name Saturday Night Live writers. \n\nEven with all that hidden talent though, the movie turns out to be exactly how the DVD case made it seem... embarrassing. For the most part very, very low brow humor with not very spectacular timing or very good taste. The movie for some reason plays like a typical American Pie storyline with sketches randomly thrown in. Some of these sketches made me chuckle, but for the most part, every sketch went on way, way too long. \n\nMichael Cera&apos;s sketch though actually had me laughing for a few hours after I had already watched the movie. It might seemed a little biased because he was the reason I watching the movie, but really his sketch was the only one that was casted perfectly. He&apos;s only in the movie for maybe ten minutes, if even that, and the first couple of minutes really nothing happened. However, if you&apos;re not sick of Michael Cera&apos;s awkwardness yet, then it&apos;s used perfectly here. \n\nOther than that, Jamie Kennedy&apos;s sketch made me went to take a shower after watching it. Really disgusting. Thought I was watching porn... actually the majority of the movie kind of feels that way... Matthew Lillard&apos;s portions of the film were incredibly unfunny. He basically just sits in a chair and throws at you the old sex advice jokes you&apos;ve heard from so many standups in the past. Honestly, this isn&apos;t a movie I would recommend. If you&apos;ve been enjoying the movies Michael Cera has been putting out... then probably skip this one. It&apos;s really not worth waiting forty minutes from him to appear only to disappear moments later."

      "reviewBody": "Guy Lambert (Elvis Presley) is a rock star touring Europe and chasing girls. In London, he brings Jill Conway back to his hotel room but it turns out badly. Jill&apos;s uncle Gerald Waverly is trying to keep her and her inheritance under his control. Guy is shocked to learn that she&apos;s a love-struck underage girl but she continues to pursue him. They get stuck in a jewel smuggling scheme when two criminals hide their jewels in her luggage. Someone is also trying to kill them.\n\nElvis always has his natural charms. I actually like his womanizing troubles. They humanizes him. I would change Jill age by advancing it four days. It would be funnier if she considers him her birthday present and less awkward if there isn&apos;t the smell of illegality. He can still try to keep her at arm&apos;s length due to her clinginess. Otherwise, I really like her character and she has fun with Elvis. I am surprised that Annette Day did not continue to act. This is her one and only notable appearance. The three idiot cops do go too far but I do understand having the Insp. Clouseau wannabes for comedic purposes. The movie struggles to keep going after someone dies. The death should be the climax instead of being in the middle. As for Elvis, he sings, he charms, and he Karate-chops. It&apos;s light Elvis fun with murder and mayhem.",

I think it&apos;s the grainy, dirty feel to it, which isn&apos;t something many horror films have. This cannot save it though, because whichever way you look at it, it gets rather tedious after the first few deaths. Don&apos;t get me wrong - they are quite bloody in a Herschell Gordon Lewis kind of way. I even thought the weird sounds that are played when the killings occur added to the grainy atmosphere. It&apos;s just that you get sick of seeing the same thing over and over. Also there&apos;s too much tedious bumbling from the police and a dull sub-plot. I thought the ending was rather cool though, when he drives the car into the water and all they find is his mask. Mind you most people would have fallen asleep by this point. \n\nOverall I would say Mardi Gras Massacre is worth the once over if you&apos;re a horror completist - just don&apos;t expect too much!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is probably the finest parody of Sherlock Holmes I&apos;ve ever seen . Yes , I like Wilder&apos;s &quot;Private life of Sherlock Holmes &quot; . Yes , Levinson&apos;s &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes &quot; was fun . &quot;Without the clue&quot; in my opinion easily beats them all . The idea here is simple , but brilliant (like the most of ideas) – what if Watson was the smart one and Holmes was an idiot ? This little movie is a great character comedy.\n\nThe movie actually really feels like a SERIOUS Sherlock Holmes movie . The music , the mood , the costumes and the art-direction – everything that is needed to bring the world of Holmes from the books on the screen alive is top-notch . Look at the beginning of the movie . Until the moment when Watson begins to shout at Holmes you could be easily fooled that this is just another adaptation of Conan Doyle&apos;s books. Hell , the whole plot is done well . If they would keep the original characterizations of the characters this would be a really good &quot;normal&quot; Holmes movie . This is something I feel that was lost by both Wilder and Levinson – the soul of Sherlock Holmes world .\n\nThe jokes here are simple , sometimes predictable . There are some more subtle jokes that you might miss , if you&apos;re not watching closely ( joke with the disappearing watch , joke with the violin ) . The true strength of this movie lies in the performances of Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley . I was especially surprised by Kingsley . I&apos;ve never seen him in comedy before . He usually plays a rather evil and menacing characters . I&apos;ve seen Caine in comedy before , so I knew he was perfectly capable to give a fine performance.\n\nKingsley and Caine have a wonderful chemistry together that is rarely seen on screen . They can make even the simplest line of dialogue hilarious and the interaction between them is a pleasure to watch . I seriously think that without them , the whole movie wouldn&apos;t have work . The other actors give them a good support , especially Jeffrey Jones . He&apos;s perfect for the role of Lestrade . He&apos;s got one hilarious scene when he&apos;s trying to figure out what Holmes said to him – he&apos;s facial expression is worth Academy Award . Great performance. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier the movie is very attractive visually and the orchestral music by Henry Mancini (famous for &quot;Pink panther theme &quot;) fits the story very well .\n\nOverlooked and unappreciated , even now . Too bad . I give it 7/10.",

A P.I. gets challenged to solve the case.\n\nSo, a storyline we&apos;ve seen nearly a thousand times, which isn&apos;t really convincing in this case.\n\nThe acting is temporarily pretty poor, some shots are just cheesy, and, what annoys me the most, the actors and the scenery are German, yes, even the plate of the prison, is written in German, although it takes place in Britain. The transitions of both, the German and the British aspects and props, are mixed and blurred in some ridiculous forms. The names and attitudes of the characters are so much stereotyped, it seems, the production team didn&apos;t took much work on that.\n\nBut the soundtrack is very nice, good matching parts for some different shots and scenes. \n\nAll in all i was only able watching it, by not taking it serious and seeing it as a parody or comedy. But hey, give it a chance, there are a lot of movies out there, which are way worse than this.",

      "reviewBody": "Prior to catching this German language film, at its US premier showing, I would have considered `German Comedy&apos; to be a contradiction in terms and the very idea of a comedy about testicular cancer seemed best left to the likes of idiots like Tom Green. Instead, this often hilarious, at times moving and always very human tale turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and well-realized films I&apos;ve seen in this (admittedly) pretty lame year for film releases. The film deals with a promising young man who finds his well-ordered life turned topsy-turvy by a diagnosis of testicular cancer. After a surgery claims one of his `eggs&apos; (the film&apos;s German title translates as `The Egg Thieves,&apos; which references German slang for testicles, as well as a term for petty thieves) the main character learns that either more surgery or chemo treatments are needed to give him the best chance for no return of the cancer. He opts, against his controlling mother&apos;s and his doctor&apos;s advice, for the chemo and begins a lengthy stay in the hospital&apos;s chemo ward where he develops a bittersweet romance with a terminal patient and an odd friendship with two other male chemo patients- one an obese, somewhat childlike near-mute and the other an often hostile young man who spends most of his convalescence watching gruesome horror videos. The film takes more than a few swipes at the medical system the patients are trapped within, and the doctors and nurses who run it, but these characters never devolve into total caricature, which would likely happen in most films of this nature. While often the targets of ridicule, the hospital staff is ultimately handled with the same kind of respect the director offers the patients rather than becoming buffoons or cold-hearted monsters. Eventually the trio of patients decides to rebel against the system and, in a truly hilarious sequence, which mirrors dozens of heist films, they set out to reclaim that which has been taken from the protagonist. His testicle.\n\nIn many ways, THE FAMILY JEWELS made me think of Robert Altman&apos;s MASH. Not that director Schwentke&apos;s film has that film&apos;s anarchic nature or improvisational style, but it has a similar gift for mining very real and telling humor out of a situation one would expect to be handled with deadly seriousness. Surprisingly, for a foreign film, much of the humor is of a verbal nature but the English translation is very well done and the laughs come through quite naturally. The director also never loses track of his character&apos;s humanity, nor the sometimes raw and wrenching emotions that underlie that humanity and the film&apos;s humor. You can count on laughing a lot in the course of this film, but a few tears will roll as well, and both tears and guffaws are earned honestly and not by cheap manipulation of the audience. The film&apos;s director was in attendance at the film festival I caught this at and he explained during a post-showing Q&amp;A that much of the film was autobiographical in nature, which makes the film all the more impressive. I really only saw this film because I had been very impressed with the directors film TATOO, which I caught at the same festival a year earlier. That film was a very dark and gruesome thriller with more than a hint of horror elements. FAMILY JEWELS could scarcely be more different, but it is every bit as well executed and the combination could mark the German born director as a major new talent. He did share that he&apos;s soon to start on a big budget, American action film. I can only hope the experience doesn&apos;t beat the freshness of Schwentke&apos;s vision out of him."

      "reviewBody": "After the box-office success locally of Bon Cop, Bad Cop, there is now a will in the Quebec Province to replicate the success of the funny crime thrillers, which have been so popular and successful in Hollywood (Lethal Weapons, Rush Hours, Bad Boys and so many more). Basically, mix some action and fun scenes and make a product that&apos;s not meant to be taken entirely seriously.\n\nUnfortnately, where Bon Cop, Bad Cop shined with a cool cinematography, evocative characters personified by great actors with chemistry and scenes that were hilarious, De Père en flic has little of that. Louis-José Houde is simply not credible as a cop, and is simply not as funny in a full role as he could be in a cameo or as a stand-up comedian. Michel Côté is better but has very little to work with. Rémy Girard is a wonderful actor but here, seems to go through the motion and repeat his character from &quot;Les Boys&quot;. Finally, the very pretty Caroline Dhavernas is totally lacking any credibility as a cop and annoys us with her wooden acting. Her lack of chemistry with Houde also kills their romance.\n\nThe actual crime plot and story? Completely ludicrous and cliché. The writing and direction fails to engage the viewers at any point in the story. In most movies of the genre, it is good to remember we often know how it&apos;s going to end, the point of these films is to make the ride enjoyable by creating cool action scenes, poignant moments and of course, making us laugh at times. \n\nThis film fails. And if it wasn&apos;t a local product, the rating would be closer to the 5 it deserves. I suspect a lot of reviewers are being nicer because of the local factor and that just doesn&apos;t cut it with me.",

Meanwhile, a seductive woman helps them launch a journey of self-discovery. Director Eddie Alcazar clearly takes influence on films like Lynch and strange art-house science fiction stories and with this being his first feature-length film, there are some great aspects to it.\n\nThere are some weird stuff happening. The black and white colors, sound designs, and visuals are very interesting and great. The performances from the cast is interesting as the performances feel kind of weird or dull but I think it was intentional for the setting. It has a surprising cast and for the whole cast, they do a pretty good job on playing their strange roles. I don&apos;t mind strange films like these as they are one of the types of genre of filmmaking that I enjoy seeing.\n\nThe main narrative is a bit strange and while it&apos;s very ambitious, the ambitious tone and presentation takes away from some of the writing elements as the writing elements at points felt underdeveloped or unfocused of what the intentions of the film wants to be. Some of the dialogue moments were pretty rough. The third act does start to feel a bit too silly at times which takes away some of the tension.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s definitely ambitious and a very strange type of film to watch. It&apos;s no where near one of my favorites on weird art-house films but there are some cool ideas that felt original.\n\nRating: B-",

Everything - absolutely everything - about this film works, from John Huston&apos;s brilliant direction, to the screenplay ( co-written by Ray Bradbury ), to the powerful and believable performances. Gregory Peck IS Ahab; if anyone defined and crystallized so megalomaniacal a character, it was Peck, hands down.  Not that this should be interpreted as a slight to any of the supporting cast; it isn&apos;t. The casting is so good, in fact, that now we find it difficult, if not impossible, to view the supporting cast members in any other light, especially Frederich Ledebur: his choice by the producers as Queequeg was nothing if not dead on the money, as was the small but significant part of Elizah, as portrayed by Royal Dano. Granted, some liberties were taken with the book ( so what else is new? ), such as the squid being written out completely, but this was, and continues to be, necessary in order to make a movie that doesn&apos;t take five hours to play out.  Yes, okay, it&apos;s a &quot;Cliff&apos;s Notes&quot; &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, but if what you&apos;re after is good direction, outstanding ( one could say tour de force ) acting, and a tight screenplay, then this is the movie for you.  Believe us, this is the one, NOT the remake with Patrick Stewart.  Stewart&apos;s Ahab is basically Patrick Stewart playing Patrick Stewart playing Ahab or, to put it another way, Huston&apos;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; needs to be remade about as badly as the rest of us need leukemia.  &apos;Nuff said."

      "reviewBody": "PICCOLO MONDO ANTICO (LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED WORLD), based on Antonio Fogazzaro&apos;s esteemed 1895  novel of the same title, is set in 19th Century Lombardy, then under Austrian domination. Like Manzoni&apos;s novel  I PROMESSI SPOSI,  the story is set into motion by  the marriage of a young couple that meets opposition.  The couple here is Franco and Luisa. Franco&apos;s grandmother, the Marchesa, is his only &quot;parent.&quot;   This cold-hearted, über-aristocratic matriarch won&apos;t permit her grandson to marry Luisa, the daughter of a government &quot;funzionario.&quot;  When he does so anyway, against her wishes, the fat old meanie disinherits him and does whatever she can to persecute the couple.\n\nFranco becomes involved in the patriotic movement, the Risorgimento, to liberate Lombardy and other Italian states from foreign domination and work toward unification with the Kingdom of Piedmont and create a new Italy. Grandma, an entrenched conservative, condemns her grandson&apos;s political agenda and co-operates with the Austrians to harm him.  Tragedy befalls the couple when their little daughter Ombretta accidentally drowns.  Franco and Luisa are estranged. The film concludes with a remorseful grandmother trying to make amends, Franco and Luisa reconciling, and with Franco going off to the Crimean War.\n\nMassimo Serato is a handsome and convincing presence as Franco; Alida Valli is even better as Luisa, especially in rendering her desperation after the death of her child. She won an Italian award for this performance.  But it is Ada Dondini who steals the show as the wicked-witch Marchesa whenever she is on screen.  The exterior photography by Arturo Gallea is particularly beautiful, with moody misty shots of Lake Como, boats on the lake, nearby estates and villages. There is a stark scene of high visual contrast toward the end which has Alida Valli going to a church, wearing a black shawl, in the wind-swept rainy background. This interestingly suggests a similar scene in Visconti&apos;s 1948 LA TERRA TREMA. All in all, this is a creditable movie and one of the key works from the Italian fascist era."

Knowing as I went into the film that it was a &quot;Christian&quot; story, I had placed a lower ceiling on my expectations. Not that being &quot;Christian&quot; means that a movie has to be bad - it just usually seems to be the case. Not so much here, however. There were just three or four times where I felt my muscles tighten up as I mentally prepared for emotional cheese, but to my delight, they managed to pull out of it every time without leaving my intelligence insulted. It was a fun and cute story with believable characters, and strong performances all around. It was clean enough that you could take the whole family to see it, yet interesting enough that the parents will not only stay awake, but you&apos;ll actually find yourself caught up in a sweet, and sometimes tear-jerking story about redemption, and the pursuit of true joy. Christian-themed films have come a long way, and I look forward to what the future holds as they continue to get better. At this point, it&apos;s safe to say that &quot;The Ultimate Gift&quot; is among the best in Christian films on the market today. Definitely worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you&apos;d suggest to make a children&apos;s film. As entertaining as &apos;Desperado&apos;, &apos;The Faculty&apos; and &apos;From Dusk Till dawn&apos; are, you wouldn&apos;t line them up alongside &apos;Toy Story 2&apos; and &apos;The Jungle Book&apos; for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.\n\nFrom the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, &apos;Spy Kids&apos; doesn&apos;t miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal &apos;strong yet silent Latino&apos; image. Yet, refreshingly for a children&apos;s film, it&apos;s never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you&apos;ll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. \n\nOk, it&apos;s a &apos;U&apos; certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for &apos;See Spot Run&apos;, but don&apos;t let that put you off. This is one of the better films you&apos;ll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.\n\n8/10",

First passage from the synopsis: &quot;Wiktor is having trouble with his consulate staff back at the embassy. He knows the Consul (Remo Girone) is filing derogatory reports about him to Warsaw and returns to the embassy to find the Consul sitting at the ambassador&apos;s desk.&quot; It&apos;s not Remo Girone, but Jerzy Stuhr, who plays Radca, the attaché in Polish Embassy! Second passage from the synopsis: &quot;A second Consul (Andrzej Chyra), sponsored by Wiktor, arrives with his beautiful Russian wife, Radca (Jerzy Stuhr)&quot; New consul&apos;s wife&apos;s name is Oksana, role played by Maria Bekker. On the other hand, the first comment (from India) puts everything right. And I can agree, the film is really very impressive and intelligently fine.",

      "name": "Inspiration for 1932&apos;s King Kong",
      "reviewBody": "In the 1932 classic &quot;King Kong,&quot; the protagonist is a filmmaker who has made a living traveling to remote locations with exotic backgrounds to film wildlife adventures. Hence he journeys to Skull Island where he&apos;s heard a gigantic ape is living. The Kong backstory closely resembles the team made up Merian C. Cooper, who produced the original &quot;Kong&quot; 1932 movie, and his cameraman Ernest Schoedsack, when they received funding from Paramount Pictures to film their adventures in northern Thailand. Part-owner Jesse Lasky of Paramount was so impressed by the pair&apos;s previous effort where they followed a Persian tribe&apos;s migration, 1925&apos;s &quot;Grass,&quot; he had his studio pay them by sponsoring the trip to this Asian country.\n\nHis instincts were spot on since the April 1927 release of &quot;Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness&quot; was received with great acclaim and rousing rounds of applause from packed theater audiences nationwide. The feature film was constructed as a documentary. If the viewer didn&apos;t know better, the two Americans capture the reality of a remote tribe living off the land in the jungles of Thailand as true-to-life.\n\nBut like most documentaries produced during the time, &quot;Chang,&quot; which means &apos;Elephant&quot; in Thai, was manipulated by the two filmmakers to fit their intended framework drawn up before they even arrived on the scene. The documentary&apos;s main character, Kru, was the guide for them and arranged for his family (besides a stand-in for his wife) and his friends to play the parts of members of a society that had long abandoned the practices displayed in the movie. Kru&apos;s background included not only being a guide, fisherman, hunter and trapper, but he was a practicing preacher as well as a carpenter.\n\nNonetheless, it was dangerous work for Cooper and Schoedsack to film the breathtaking wild animal footage. Cooper was at the ready with a gun when needed if the tigers, lions and elephants being photographed up close decided to lunge at the pair. Such a scenario played out on one occasion when a tiger approached uncomfortably too close to them. Another particularly dangerous set-up was when, using director John Ford&apos;s technique, Schoedsack dug a hole and positioned his camera to capture the rampaging elephants literally trampling over the planks lined above him. The weight of the heavy animals nearly broke the wood situated precariously just inches from his head.\n\nThe 18-month shoot was an ordeal for Cooper, who battled a case of malaria throughout the shoot. The production crew was forced to prepare for daily early morning filming since the animals were mostly active during the coolness of the day. They became lethargic in the afternoon and sought shelter as the Thai heat overtook the jungle. The humidity was so common that it wrecked havoc on the film stock and equipment, which had to be maintained on an hourly basis.\n\nThe manipulations of the producers are clearly shown in several sequences. The cross-cutting edits between man-hungry animals who corner the natives up a tree and the medium shots of the natives hanging waiting for relief shows the two scenes were clearly filmed separately. In the climatic sequence where a herd of elephants are stampeding and crushing the village&apos;s houses, the producers built miniature flimsy buildings and rounded a bunch of baby and juvenile elephants to make the model huts appear bigger than they really were. In another sequence, the crew tied up a baby elephant underneath a rickety tall hut and waited for the mother to come storming onto the scene. Sure enough, the irate adult elephant in a rage destroyed the building like it was balsa wood to free her baby.\n\n&quot;Chang&quot; is still as thrilling of a movie to see today as it had been when it first premiered. Once the documentary was ready for release, Paramount wanted to use the reactions of animals caged in zoos looking at the projected film for publicity purposes. But studio executives were disappointed that so few zoos took up the offer. The recently established Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, holding its first Academy Awards in 1929, nominated &quot;Chang&quot; as one of three pictures for &apos;Unique and Artistic Productions.&apos; The category was the only time the Academy listed it. But at the time it was considered as prestigious as its other category, &apos;Outstanding Picture.&apos; In retrospect, &quot;Chang&quot; is the only documentary to ever have been nominated as a Best Picture.",

      "reviewBody": "As far as I know, &quot;Life and Times&quot; is only available on old VHS tapes, where no doubt it was a pan-and-scan transfer. That is really too bad. I haven&apos;t seen it since it originally came out, when I was 13, and I doubt it would be any major revelation now--at the time it was meandering, episodic, nothing very special but a pleasant family-friendly variation on &quot;Jeremiah Johnson,&quot; with Dan Haggerty an appealing presence in the title role. \n\nBut what I really remember about it was that while nothing else about the film was all that memorable, the wilderness photography was gorgeous. That&apos;s exactly the sort of thing you lose in decades of crappy transfers to TV and VHS without a major studio upgrading the quality of the home-format releases. (And while I have no idea who owns the rights now, they probably aren&apos;t interested in making that investment, and god knows Sunn Classics is probably looooooong gone. Particularly since none of their other films seem to have gotten DVD/Blu-Ray treatment, either.) The same year, I also loved another (somewhat better if less commercially successful), &quot;Where the Lilies Bloom,&quot; and while you can find that on YouTube easily enough, it&apos;s also in sore need of restoration--I remember how stunning the photography of Appalachia was in 1974, and you can&apos;t tell that from the existing transfers. \n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the original &quot;Grizzly Adams,&quot; but won&apos;t risk revisiting it until the unlikely day that somebody puts out a letterboxed digital restoration. Because whatever the film lacked in plot or finesse, it made up for in beautiful photography of spectacular scenery, and I&apos;d hate to see that reduced to pan-and-scan and faded colors.",

This film is about style and 8 great French actresses - each of them is one good reason, why you should see this film. The best way how to &quot;use&quot; this film is just to sit and enjoy it. You don´t need to think (but this doesn´t mean that there is nothing to think about), you can only watch - luxurious interiors,great looking dresses and haircuts... and you can smile - sometimes, when I read other reviews, I have a feeling, the writer have seen a different film -THIS IS NOT A DRAMA, IT´S A COMEDY (very absurd)!!! It has a style of hollywood musicals from golden era of 30´s and 40´s, but in the same time it´s not american, it´s still very French film, with the specifiec antmospehere, which French films usually have. And my last word: more french film to czech cinemas!!!"

I felt the Japanese effect or the tyrannical force with which they subdued the Chinese should have been shown a little more, it all happened in a jiffy. The storytelling is pretty but fails to connect on many levels. Like the transition of a poor village girl into a strong distillery owner and the level of trust and love she is shown by the workers and the sudden infatuation that develops and is accepted between her and Yu. Also the way we are shown the attack sequence was not at all engaging, it only had slow-mo shots of people falling/running but the final shot of redness surrounding Yu and his son was brilliant. Watch it, for you&apos;ll get a peek into Chinese culture, the position of women in it, their traditions and songs and most importantly the red wine, red like blood mingling to mark a jarringly tough Chinese wartime life.",

If you like the SATIRE/PARODY genre... don&apos;t miss it...\n\nThe movie is narrated by an alien (voiced by Pierre Arditi) observing the human race and comparing it to their own kind... The story is about two couples, one on earth and the other in a prison sort of cube for observation, held like animals in a cage... I wont spoil or reveal anything more... But It is a movie to see, especially if you are looking for a Documentary on the FRENCH... and not the human race...\n\nI give this a 10 out of 10 or the Humor, the satire, and especially about everyday things that we have forgotten ourselves....",

Is it all in her head, is she delusional, did something really happen to her or is she completely &quot;Gone&quot;?\n\nThis is played out throughout this competent Thriller as She believes that the source of her pain and suffering is back and has abducted her Sister. This unleashes Her barely pent up Rage and propels Her on an unstoppable quest to evoke Revenge and rescue Her Sis.\n\nThis is a bit above a routine exercise in Serial Killer Clichés as it focuses on a truly riveting and believable Amanda Seyfried as the troubled Heroine. Truth is that she is damaged and not really in complete control of her affliction and this lends a certain edginess to the Film as you never really know what She is going to do next, or what Lie She will fabricate, it seems at will, in a moments notice.\n\nWorth a look for Fans of this type of thing and those who like strong Females willing to go the distance even if it means facing your most frightening fears.",

Four girlfriends get together for a hiking trip in the Canadian mountains and run across two sadistic redneck killers intent on ruining their day. But these women don&apos;t go down without a fight. I&apos;m a horror buff and would be remiss not to admit this movie has some clichés and does follow the format of films like &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; and the like. However, you do learn to love these women quickly and especially feel the bond between Rose (Esther Maaß) and Sarah (Lili Schackert.) It takes 40 minutes for the gore to begin but that time is used wisely for character development. Once the action starts it doesn&apos;t stop and there are truly gory and sadistic moments worthy of the genre. The scenery is beautiful and the actresses gave stellar performances (particularly Maaß)and the film was over before I knew it. And I was pleased with the outcome without it being cheesy or entirely predictable. So on a boring, rainy day give this little film a try. I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed. It&apos;s better than most out there these days!",

Also here, a series of crazy and violent events with &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;mad&quot; people involved are triggered by a small short-term event. The things will never be the same and all characters have to review their values, approaches and problem-solving methods. Solutions are often damaging and/or fatal, although the outcome is not anticipated (however, using a narrator and its role in the very ending are witty and distinct). The cast is also strong and catchy, Kim Bodnia and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, above all; the latter&apos;s recurring line &quot;We are only cooks!&quot; makes you always giggle.\n\nThe only question I wanted to raise throughout the film: what about police, journalists - or sometimes even witnesses? So many tough-rough acts and no response from them at all?\n\nStill, recommended if you like twisted action comedies with fine performances.",

Though the film features plenty of stunts, chases, crashes, shootouts, fights, and pyrotechnics mixed with a typically convoluted spy-type plot, we&apos;ve seen better of all in other films. The flick does have a female protagonist but there&apos;s little romance or sexiness in this flick which lacks the spit and polish of Bond films and seems to be begging for something more than just a lot of busy heroics and magical futuristic microelectronic snoop stuff. Ok but far from Snipes better films.",

      "reviewBody": "French Lesson was given an all-too-brief theatrical run in 1986 (the competition was strong that year with Ferris Bueller and Pretty in Pink dominating the screens).  However, if you can get ahold of the VHS from Warner you&apos;ll be in for a treat.\n\nThe story is simple, but the characters are a little more complex than usual:  Jenny, a British teenager, has left home for the first time and is going to college in Paris (the time is the early &apos;60&apos;s) Soon, she is smitten with a local Parisian (who seems like the right guy for her - he sure is handsome enough).  Although he is a romantic guy, Jenny REALLY wants to be wooed:  all she asks is he recite a few lines to her from Romeo and Juliet...something that would really put her on cloud nine and, alas, something he finds a tad idiotic.  Jenny is crushed when he outright refuses, but prevails.  From then on she runs into situation after situation in dealing with her crazy friends, a few other young men who find her attractive (including one that is already married) and, lastly, her French host family (headed over by a strict Madame Paroche who is none too pleased to see Jenny having any sort of social life whatsoever!).  Will Jenny get the man of her dreams after all (and if so, on her own terms)?  As Jenny finds out, first-time love is wonderful, but it&apos;s not without its share of troubles.\n\nThe film is perfectly paced and the cinematography captures Paris in the Fall like no other film in recent memory:  the slightly gray skies, sometimes damp streets, sunny parks, the stone buildings...all perfectly rendered.  As a romantic comedy/drama, this film has it all and it&apos;s a darn shame it isn&apos;t more widely acknowledged.  Perhaps Warner will issue a remastered DVD in the near future?  If not, track down the cassette and give it a watch - this is a cannot-miss affair."

      "reviewBody": "It seems the majority of the reviews thus far have been written by viewers who, after not enjoying either of the two previous films, decided to weigh in on what is ultimately a complete mockery of a great series.\n\nFirst I&apos;ll tackle the good things about this film, of which there are few, but they deserve mentioning and as much of a reprieve as anyone can give them. Aiko Horiuchi replaces Takako Fuji as Kayako (creepy crackling voice lady) and picks up the role fairly well. Any fault in her appearance lies with the director, Toby Wilkins, who I will get to in a moment. The only other two notable performances come from the female leads, Johanna Braddy and Takatzuna Mukai and might not so much be notable as much as they just sharply contrast their terrible surroundings.\n\nNow, on to the awful stuff. I think the large majority of the critics of the first two films, as I have understood them on here, find that the they were cryptic and difficult to follow. They have gotten their wish for an easy to interpret, spoon-fed, linear-flowing, cheesy horror film in The Grudge 3. Gone are the intelligent and subtle left-to-the-imagination disappearance kills. Artistic and suspenseful cinematography have been replaced by bland, formulaic and frightfully comical scenes. Brad Keene and Toby Wilkins have crafted an hour-and-a-half long slap in the face of director Takashi Shimizu who re-invented the haunted house horror film by making his own rules and breaking all the ones in the book.\n\nNormally I am given pause when criticizing the artistic vision of writers, directors and actors who put their work on the line for what is largely a very unforgiving audience. In this case, however, the writer and director were toying with another man&apos;s vision and the hard work and creative energy he expended trying to bring something original into the world. I am dumbstruck by how a duo could miss the theme of a series so entirely. Ultimately, The Grudge 3 adds nothing to the mythology of the films and takes away a substantial amount.",

Madhuri was pretty and competently did her role/s. Salman khan seemed a mismatch as he looked young, immature and unconvincing in his role. It was apparent the makers didn&apos;t invest too much in the songs dept, as they were below par by any standards. Anupam Kher and Kader Khan were upto their usual tomfoolery so nothing new there either. Anyone in 90s going to watch this movie would have done due to the craze of Madhuri, the rest of the cast were there just for the ambiance. Safely skip this one.",

      "name": "why BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT is Lang&apos;s best US film",
      "reviewBody": "Sometimes, in the world of 1940s-1950s film noir, we are given a film so transparently impossible and contrived that we can see ourselves giving up on watching it half way through. But is extremely rare that we are faced with a film where the very response the viewer is having holds the key to the success, rather than the failure, of the film.\n\nSuch is the case with BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, which has - to its credit - been completely misunderstood by many. When we reach the film&apos;s conclusion, we realize that even the title of the film itself is a joke, perhaps the ultimate prank on the viewer. Yet to offer analysis of the film would be to destroy its main and most sinister motive; you can&apos;t &quot;explain away&quot; the glaring plot holes and contrivances without revealing the twist the film takes in its climax, and to do would rob the viewer of a genuine experience. So... I won&apos;t.\n\nSuffice it to say, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT is far more than it seems and is nothing without the sum of its parts, in total. Lang tackles the story of a person who creates a fictitious role for himself in order to, essentially, pull a fast one on the legal profession for personal gain (or, as it appears on the surface, someone else&apos;s). In the world of film noir, of course, we know that such a character won&apos;t get away with it, but when Lang depicts the tragedy the viewer knows will come, he majestically turns the entire premise on its head. As a result, it&apos;s a cold slap in the face - a devastating critique of the complicity of the audience in following along, hungrily, with such contrivances in cinema.\n\nEvery part of the film fits perfectly by not fitting at all. Even the visual style of the film is a cold, rarely pleasing one, almost daring you to suspend your disbelief just a little bit longer without even granting the pleasure of emotionally charged close-ups at key moments. The editing is brutal and jarring, cutting away practically mid-sentence and moving to a similar conversation elsewhere.\n\nAs a swan song to his Hollywood career, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT does to the audience what Billy Wilder does to the industry in SUNSET BLVD. - biting the hand that feeds. The result is a total masterpiece."

Not unusual for the genre, right, but the film is really only something for completely painless gorehounds because of the basic premise: cheap cheap cheap. YES, the splatter and gore factor is quite high (and innovation-free), but the plot is so stale and the cinematic atmosphere so unfrightening that there is simply no joy...er...fear. I know, bad can also be good...but that doesn&apos;t work in every case, and not in the mid-2000s anymore.\n\nThe parallels to The Hills Have Eyes are more than conspicuous, but in terms of level even below &quot;IThe Hills Have Eyes Part II (1984)&quot;. You have to (well ok...rather can) see it for the sake of completeness, Hillside Cannibals on the other hand is absolutely irrelevant, even for the most fanatical horror freak.\n\nConclusion: not suitable for beer evenings either. You will break off the &quot;film enjoyment&quot; (I&apos;m guessing) prematurely and only get annoyed about the money you&apos;ve thrown away. Cucumber!",

First of all, the arrogance of comments like, &quot;You&apos;ve got to be a complete idiot to believe you&apos;re seeing something new&quot; takes me back to the self-important little twerps of my undergraduate days. So, Noel-74, if you are an undergraduate, my apologies. Let&apos;s hope it&apos;s just a stage you&apos;re working through. If you&apos;re over the of 25, please stay clear. I mean, seriously, your comment that there was something sinister in making abject poverty look so beautiful. Can any person look at the scenes depicted in that movie and feel anything other than horror at the conditions in which so many of our brothers and sisters live? Not to get all touchy-feely on you, but if you came away from that movie thinking about how beautiful it all looked, I&apos;d say it was you, and not the movie, that could use a little more introspection. I liked this movie a lot. I thought it was moving, chilling, depressing and unpredictable. Even the ending (NO SPOILERS HERE) could have gone a bunch of different ways, several of which would have been more conventional than what we are left with. A very good film, with excellent acting.",

      "reviewBody": "The love story between Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett is legendary, and her &apos;Sonnets from the Portuguese&apos; contains some of the beautiful love poetry ever written. They were both already established poets when they began corresponding, but she was an invalid, and had doubts and insecurities that he helped overcome with steady, persistent, genuine love. What I had forgotten about their story was how poorly her father behaved towards her and the rest of his children, and this movie really shows us that, in what appears to be a pretty accurate way.\n\nCharles Laughton is brilliant as the overbearing, controlling, overprotective, borderline incestuous Mr. Barrett, father of 12, whose wife had passed away, and whose own frustrations in love had led him to forbid his children to marry. He&apos;s hard to watch at times, but certainly gives the best performance, and the movie is probably more about his inability to let his children go – indeed, he disinherited each one who married – than it is about the extraordinary love between Robert and Elizabeth, though Frederic March and Norma Shearer do have some tender scenes. I enjoyed watching it, but I suppose that&apos;s the reason I didn&apos;t give a higher rating. How much better would it have been had they incorporated even more of their relationship, and some of their letters and poetry. The movie would be remade 23 years later by the same director, Sidney Franklin, and would be a great choice to be remade (with script changes) again today.",

      "reviewBody": "In 2008, the American Carnegie Endowment&apos;s Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as &quot;the worst place to be a terrorist&quot; and highlighted especially Russia&apos;s willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights.\n\nBut this movie represents the other side of the story which is based on the similar life experience of Luke Harding who summed up his Post Cold war Russia Experience in his 2011 book Mafia States. Now most of the people who don&apos;t know about him know this-\n\nLuke Daniel Harding (born 1968) is a British political journalist working for &apos;The Guardian newspaper.&apos; He was the correspondent of &apos;The Guardian&apos; in Russia from 2007 until he was expelled from the country in 2011 over his critical articles. His 2011 book Mafia State discusses the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin, which he describes as a mafia state.He is the first foreign journalist to be expelled from Russia since Cold War ended. He is now posted in the London office of &apos;The Guardian.&apos;\n\nThe movie basically depicts his experiences thought with some changes but the basic settings or plot remains the same where a foreigner journalist who is from Germany (and also the son of a deceased political journalist who used to work with the same magazine during the USSR era and post USSR era.)comes to work for a Russian Celebrity Magazine who publishes page three stories for rich and influential Russians as they no longer publish stories which might displease the powerful government and The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation who treat media censorship as a necessity to suppress the things they don&apos;t want to go public in dealing with matters of terrorism or national security any way they please to justify here the concept of national security over human rights.\n\nBut the movie not only depicts the inhumane methods of tortures developed by stasis in Germany during WW-II days but also the terrifying possibilities of secret services&apos; hand behind some of the domestic terrorist attacks to justify the military warfare in Chechnya. As one character says,&quot;The threat of terror is the only thing which unites the people of a country its a historic fact.&quot; \n\nHe also says,&quot;Russia was on its Knees..In 1988 Russia was as poor as a third world nation, most reflecting for the country that once was second most powerful in the world; everything collapses..Army, economy, whole society..we were at the abyss. Then the president managed to take us back. Only a fool thinks that it doesn&apos;t have its prize.&quot;\n\nSo the story deals with the question of who being the actual threat is. the main character writes an article of a recently deceased investigation journalist who was found dead in mysterious circumstances completely unaware of the fact that he soon will be involved with psychological war with secret service officials and terrorist attacks and dark and twisted power games who will terrorize him and will test him when his fathers past is also revealed during his investigation for truth.\n\nOverall the movie do raise questions about some serious issues of human rights and social willpower to resist the misuse of power which uses terrorist attacks to make more anti terrorist laws to give more power to military and make the life of common man more difficult. It represent the side of modern day Russia which has been hidden or unseen for masses of outside.\n\nI saw this movie and it do has a similar plot with the book Mafia State though i have not read the book completely yet an on screen view was a treat. It had a gripping plot and twists were in plenty. Every person shown in the movie was not what they claim they were..there were many moments of doubt and suspense and it is entertaining.\n\nOn the whole the movie is a decent effort and to show these kind of stories is always a challenge. Screenplay is good and it is fast pace. Acting is also decent and some serious efforts by male lead has been put in some scenes especially in the FSS prison where the inhumane conditions prisoners are kept in.\n\nI was impressed by the movie and it is a great to see a decent political thriller after the Pierce Brosnan starer Ghostwriter and it is commercially entertaining.\n\nMy rating is 7.5/10..\n\nGo watch it for things Russia is not famous for!!",

Actually, almost the entire movie takes place in the arena with gladiators fighting. There is a plot about a usurper trying to steal the throne of Maciste&apos;s country but Mark Forest swings into action and saves the Kingdom. He first has to beat a group of 7 professional fighters sent from Rome to aid in the sinister plot. After long fights and believable fights, he wins the day. The movie is none stop action from start to finish. A lot of the scenes were filmed at De Paolis Studios near Rome. I recognize the sets. A DVD copy is easy to find and is well worth the money. Dan Vadis gets killed in this movie but later went on to make string of similar movies that box office successes. Mark Forest is an operatic singer (look for him on Y/T), who later retired to Calif. and then Arizona. Great movie.",

Hopkins plays a screenwriter who&apos;s revising the script of a movie called &quot;Slipstream&quot; as the movie is being shot. Needless to say, the line between fiction and reality swiftly blurs as characters from the movie start appearing in his real life, and we keep reliving the same scenes from different angles. It&apos;s nothing we haven&apos;t seen before in the works of David Lynch or Dennis Potter, but Hopkins keeps the action from flagging and provides a surprisingly emotional climax. Definitely worth a look if you like this sort of movie, but I don&apos;t expect to see it at too many theaters besides the hardcore art-houses."

The acting&apos;s pretty average, there seem to be so many plots going on at the same time, but it still makes for an entertaining and interesting watch, if only to see the Nanny in her first major big-screen role. She brings the trademark we know so well to the movie - her nasal voice and pre-occupation with the trivial stuff, but she also brings a kind of sensitivity we&apos;ve never seen before in the Nanny series.\n\nI quite like some of the scenes - how she teaches the kids what she knows (airline miles), the massage scene, the home-coming, and a lot of others that just seem to be made just for her.",

      "reviewBody": "In Carmen, Saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction, between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera Carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional Carmen, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (read disregard for fidelity) and her ability to drive men mad with desire. Saura used this same vehicle fiction/reality in an earlier black-and-white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But, whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing Blood Wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the petty, libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic Carmen never comes even close to being believable. It remains a gadget, and, for that reason, a bothersome distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it hardly matters, the melodrama Saura tries to impose upon his Carmen, because the Flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals_ which are 95% of the film _by some of the best known Flamenco dancers and musicians, more than repays the price of entry. A flawed film, and a wonder: perfect for doing a drill in Keats&apos;s &apos;negative capacity&apos;, perhaps?",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Bandidos&quot; is a great, action-packed revenge story that is set up by a very dramatic opening scene that has a rogue gunfighter meet up with the man who taught him to shoot. The gunfighter shoots his former friend in both hands, and then tells him to try to get revenge if he&apos;s able to hold a gun. The stage is set, and the film doesn&apos;t let up until the very end.\n\nAll the elements of a great spaghetti western are here. There is a cool music score, an engaging story, suspenseful gunfights, cheesy acting, a couple of great one-liners, and it is all done way over-the-top, like a good western should be. This movie is loaded with style, and style is the reason why the Italian westerns are so much more fun to watch than the ones made in the U.S.\n\nThere is a lot of great camera work in this movie. The interesting use of camera angles here gives the film a distinct character in much the same way that the use of close-ups marks the Leone westerns.\n\nMy favorite scenes in the movie are the ones that take place in saloons. There is one especially amusing one in which a man who has just lost a gunfight is sitting at a table drinking and harassing customers and saloon girls while he waits to die from his bullet wound. This old woman tells him to &quot;hurry up and die,&quot; and he decides he wants to shoot one of the saloon girls so that he can take her to hell with him.\n\n&quot;Bandidos&quot; is a must-see for anyone who likes their westerns Italian style.",

      "reviewBody": "Lust For Life may look, at first glance, to be a typical Hollywood biopic, which is usually not much more than a star vehicle about a famous, real-life but vacuously recreated character, denuded of any real personality. Minelli certainly makes his biopic of Vincent Van Gogh with his trademark lavishness. But, importantly, he does not glamorise his subject. Instead, he makes a visually rich but earthy film, which exalts Van Gogh&apos;s achievement and seeks to portray the realities of his creative life and the dark side of his personality.\n\nLust For Life focuses on the extremely troubled man Van Gogh was, at turns listless, priggish, childish, needy, manic and quick-tempered; but also sensitive, caring, thoughtful, romantic and altruistic. Kirk Douglas is superb as Van Gogh, holistically exhibiting his various and contradictory aspects: obsessive though circumspect artist, diffident but passionate friend, forlorn romantic and dangerous maniac. It is all the more of an accomplishment as he is such a muscular, good-looking leading actor (nor should Anthony Quinn&apos;s key supporting performance as Gauguin, a macho with hidden sensibilities, be neglected).\n\nHowever, at the same time, what the film never forgets is Van Gogh&apos;s considerable achievement. Minelli&apos;s iridescence complements Van Gogh&apos;s colourful, vivacious visual style, and many of his paintings are shown throughout the film.\n\nCritics have pointed to the over-use of melodrama in the film. Yet Lust For Life is rare in that the film is consummated by its melodrama, along with Miklós Rózsa&apos;s grand, sweeping music. In other words, its melodrama succeeds, making the viewer identify more with Douglas&apos; Van Gogh, giving him a greater, but also justified, pathos and sense of tragedy.\n\nLust For Life is the best Hollywood Biopic"

The film addresses many issues concerning the famous Montreal riot, following a major penalty given to Richard just a few days before the beginning of the play-offs, and the &quot;revolution tranquille&quot; ignitor.\n\nBut this splendid film relates the story of an underdog player. His rise to hero and finally to that of a legend. It feels somewhat epic. The challenges Maurice faces are easy to relate to. You truly feel his angst has he&apos;s pushed around, beaten and bloodied. But still manages to overcome these problems and eventually becomes a symbol for every underdog who has ever dreamt of reaching the unreachable.\n\nMaurice Richard isn&apos;t just a good quebecois film. It&apos;s simply a good film. Worth seeing.",

Lemmon and Arkin are perfect as the salesman who&apos;s luck has turned towards the negative. You can literally see their will to live being sucked out of them with every blown sale and missed opportunity. Ed Harris is great as the angry salesman who is willing to do what it takes to save his own future. Kevin Spacey plays the tight -collared boss to a T, pushing people and not giving them the breaks they need.  The two most quoted characters of any movie I know are those played by Pacino and Baldwin. Pacino always excels in parts where his anger and ability to create believable outbursts are showcased, as they are in this part. All that I can say about Baldwin is that this is definitely his best performance and the writing for his character is unbelievable. I can watch his 10 minute scene over and over again. This movie rules in every way possible. 10 out of 10.   (I don&apos;t give that rating easily)",

      "name": "Freud was probably right",
      "reviewBody": "G.W. Pabst&apos;s fourth film &quot;Geheimnisse einer Seele&quot; (Secrets of a Soul, 1926) was the first film to tackle the subject of psychoanalysis. Even though a controversial subject, the film managed to make a profit. The filmmakers desperately wanted Sigmund Freud himself to join the production as an expert, but Freud strongly refused, not believing that the medium of film could do justice to his psychological theories. In this, he was probably right, since it&apos;s doubtful that things would be this neatly spread out in any person&apos;s mind.\n\nWerner Krauss plays a bourgeois scientist, who has a wife, 20 years younger than him. There is a murder in their neighbor&apos;s apartment, and suddenly Krauss starts to feel an inexplicable fear of knives and also an urge to murder his wife. We have a dream sequence, that is well executed enough, but it doesn&apos;t leave any kind of mystery to the film, which tries really hard to be a mystery. Of course we still get to return to it once the protagonist receives psychoanalytical treatment. Doesn&apos;t really take Freud to interpret this dream, but maybe people in 1926 weren&apos;t yet tired of freudian cliches.\n\nThis film looks like a pioneering work, but its greatest value lies in the films that it may have inspired. The dream sequence brings to mind Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), and the depiction of guilt resembled Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;M&quot; (1931) a little. The hold Pabst has over his film is too pedantic, especially towards the end. But one thing is certain, he does really believe in the science that he tries to sell you, and the film&apos;s message about how one can heal from psychological illnesses just like any other, is a positive one.",

No one had showed me Spain, the way Doris Dörrie did... Plain, simple and yet astonishing... Perhaps I understood her because I come from a country that lives of small rituals like Spain does. The music is also fantastic, like in every Dörrie film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film from director Pedro Almodóvar is centred on two men; Benigno Martín and Marco Zuluaga. They first meet when they are seated next to each other in a theatre; they don&apos;t exchange a word but Benigno notices Marco&apos;s emotional reaction to the piece. We then see how Benigno works at a clinic where he cares for Alicia, a ballerina, who has been in a coma for four years. Meanwhile Marco, a journalist, is trying to secure an interview with Lydia, a matador. They become friends but then she is gored in the bullring and ends up in a coma; Marco is told there is almost no chance that she will ever recover. As he visits her he meets Benigno in the clinic. He encourages Marco to talk to Lydia but he doesn&apos;t see the point. In the events that follow we discover secrets and events take a sinister turn as we learn more about one of the men.\n\nAs one would expect from Almodóvar this film is more about characters than events. The events we do see are there to advance character development and bring the two men together. The two main characters are interesting with Javier Cámara and Darío Grandinetti impressing as Benigno and Marco respectively. Over the course of the film the characters develop in ways one might not expect as we see what a first appears to be tender love is really dangerous obsession. This is all the more disturbing as we are initially encouraged to like the character. The film is shot in a naturalistic way that suits the material. It must be admitted that there is material in the film that will bother some viewers; most notably scenes of bullfighting and a film within the film that includes a scene of a &apos;miniature man&apos; climbing over then entering a woman&apos;s naked body. Overall I&apos;d recommend this to fans of Almodóvar&apos;s other films but it certainly won&apos;t be for everybody.\n\nThese comments are based on watching in Spanish with English subtitles.",

But reading about it on the internet was infinitely more interesting than this poor production. What were they thinking? And how did they manage to get Sammo Hung and Yuen Wah on board? They are martial arts legends. That in itself is more compelling.Now I wasn&apos;t expecting a good film.Average with top notch action would have sufficed just as good. And with regret I have to inform that isn&apos;t the case. What puzzles me even more is that with this movie they had the chance to inform the viewer about this form of martial arts and really sell it.But fail to do so.No real attempt is made. We simply are shown what you see in most similar movies.A few tedious training sequences, soap opera antics that absolutely nobody is waiting for.And fights so boring that I could not wait for them to be over.There was one redeeming factor. A short dream like sequence where Sammo Hung and Yeun Wah fight each other. Much too short but far better than all the other fights in Choy Lee Fut. To use a quote from this movie:&quot;Don&apos;t look too long or you will get nightmares&quot; So true!",

Also because I am a huge Wu-Tang Clan fan. What I expected to see was some decent fight choreography back-dropped with a grimy, old-school soundtrack. Now from what I recall on the soundtrack part, it did not deliver. And I know that RZA could have incorporated a couple tracks that would have lined this film up nice. Some that could have been included were; Da Mystery of Chessboxin&apos;, Wu-Tang Clan Ain&apos;t Nuttin ta F*** Wit, and pretty much anything from the 36 Chambers album. The fight scenes were mediocre until near the end to which I decided I would suck it up and just watch the rest of the movie. The first scene of the film actually made me angry because the fight scene was chopped up (which I hate), and the track they used in the background (actually from the 36 Chambers album) just didn&apos;t fit right!\n\nOther things that were disappointing, other than Bautista from WWE showing up, was the weak script and amateurish plot. The dialogue was horrible (see quote from above) and the plot was...well there wasn&apos;t really a plot at all. I walked out of the movie asking myself/trying to remember what the story was really about. I&apos;m not sure if it was because I was blown away by RZA&apos;s acting or because I was too busy trying to figure out why Russell Crowe was in the movie at all.\n\nThe set and costume design were the only things I thought were good about the movie. And the effort to create something visually appealing did not go unnoticed. But its all about the story and characters, which were both lacking aside from Lucy Liu&apos;s bit. Wait I think I just remembered what the movie was about...yeah it&apos;s pretty weak.\n\nIf Quentin Tarantino had more involvement/any involvement at all in this movie it might have been quite possibly something spectacular. But then RZA would have probably not been in it. Hey when is Kill Bill Vol 3 coming out?",

      "reviewBody": "My memories of real youth, like from five to ten years old are completely blurred for the most part but for some reason I remember watching John Belushi movies.  I remember going to see `Neighbors&apos; and `Continental Divide&apos; in the theater!  I haven&apos;t really examined this but basically since I was born I have adored John Belushi.  I remember renting `Neighbors&apos; when the VCR was a new item and I&apos;d watch it over and over again.  I guess I was a pretty strange ten-year old.  Memories of watching his movies, his death and whatever else are still with me in strange little flashes.\n\n I find `Neighbors&apos; to be his best work.  This is a controversial opinion! I&apos;ve recently reread Woodward&apos;s `Wired&apos; and it seems John detested everything about this movie.  He had sincere hatred for the director, Alvidsen- he continually asked to replace him. Yet, John&apos;s biggest concern for `Neighbors&apos;, again citing from Woodward&apos;s book, was the soundtrack.  He wanted it to be punk rock and Holy Christ did it ever wind up the antithesis. Of course I would love to have seen `Neighbors&apos; done the way John would have intended it but I still am very fond of this movie as is. I think Alvidsen did a great job of bottling all of John&apos;s manic energy and I think he summoned his best performance.  It&apos;s such a strange contradiction that, again from reading `Wired&apos;, John wanted desperately to lose the `Bluto&apos; stigma and prove he could be a versatile actor.  This role reversal gave him that chance and yet he was against this film from the beginning.\n\n I think `Neighbors&apos; is fantastic.  It&apos;s like `Who&apos;s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf&apos; on acid or something.  This film should be examined by future filmmakers as an example of how what seems like all the wrong ingredients can make a positive and an unforgettable piece of cinema in the end."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s no secret that I&apos;m a fan of writer-director Wisit Sasanatieng&apos;s movies - Tears of the Black Tiger, and Citizen Dog. What&apos;s excellent and probably the hallmarks of the director currently are the stunning visuals, wonderful colors, and story lines which are highly imaginative. With Tears, it was an amalgam of cultures for a distinctive and eclectic mix of what&apos;s Thai, and the Wild Wild West. In Citizen Dog, the fusion of fantastical elements, song, and comedy endears it and at the same time, warms your heart.\n\nBut when this project was announced, I admit I was a bit apprehensive. I have not fancied many Asian horror movies of late, because of the usual formulaic stories and the employment of cheap shock tactics which bore. At times, scenes become unintentionally comedic, coupled with bad makeup and cheesy special effects, which mar whatever potential the movies could have achieved. The horror genre is no doubt a money spinner, and many times, quality is compromised when everyone jumps on the same bandwagon, knowing audiences will still lap them up despite the inferior product.\n\nThe Unseeable, however, managed to evade the negative connotations as put forth. I guess my trust in Sasanatieng&apos;s vision remained unwavering. The story, when finally pieced together, remained coherent, even though at some points, it felt that the pacing could be picked up a little. Never rushed, it took a very measured method to introduce characters, their backgrounds, and the explanation of, well, what goes bump in the night.\n\nThe story tells of a pregnant village girl, Nualjan, who left her hometown in search of her lost husband. En route to Bangkok, she gets put up at a boarding house, with few inhabitants, and owned by a mysterious rich widow Ranjuan who lives in a separate house in the same compound. Making few friends, and slowly becoming the disdain of the housekeeper, Nualjan encounters inexplainable incidents and strange folks, helped in no way by stories about the spookiness of the premises. The usual motley crew of horror movie characters - an old scrawny lady, a young child, and plenty of shadowy figures.\n\nThe narrative structure did seem to stick to the usual formula though, with the final twist ending (twist endings themselves are becoming so common, it&apos;s difficult for filmmakers to imagine something more breakthrough). At times, you will also feel that despite the red herrings, your gut feel about how things will turn out, will probably correct. While the revelation explained and tied up loose ends, it did however demonstrate that it doesn&apos;t seem to want to end. \n\nGone are the usual bright pastel color palette that we associate Sasanatieng&apos;s movies with, and in place for The Unseeable, are strained colors with a general greenish tinge, in line with the mood and atmosphere created for horror. I felt the filmmakers achieved their objective of creating a horror movie which doesn&apos;t capitalize on CGI and special effects, that if not done right, relegates it automatically together with those of dubious quality. Relying on tight angles and excellent sound editing, I admit that yes, watching The Unseeable did give me the chills, especially during its revelatory scenes.\n\nI believed the movie&apos;s title in Thai was a little spoiler in itself, so please don&apos;t try to translate it until after you&apos;ve seen the movie. My faith in Wisit Sasanatieng continues, and I for one am eagerly anticipating his take on the martial arts genre with Armful, currently in production.",

      "name": "Very average and extremely hilarious Ravioli Western by the horror master , Mario Bava",
      "reviewBody": "Silly and funny Western about two drifters carry out several adventures , saloon brawls and resolve conflicts among nasty robbers that want to take a treasure . This is a serviceable comic spaghetti western which doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously . This good natured comic spaghetti packs diverting elements , tongue-in-cheek , thrills , shootouts , fighting , explosions , and results to be quite entertaining but middling . It is set California, the 1870s . Roy Colt (Brett Halsey) and Winchester Jack (Charles Southwood) are outlaws and although they are good friends , they cannot get along peacefully . Meantime , a beautiful Indian (Marilú Tolo) helps both drifters and plays both sides against each other . They take on a sadistic priest-turned-crime boss , nicknamed The Reverend (Teodoro Corrà) , and his hoodlums , who attempt to rob a valuable treasure . Roy then decides that he has enough of being an outlaw and leaves the bunch in search of a good , honest job as a sheriff in nearby Carson City . Roy , Winchester and his cohorts foil the planned robbery to keep the treasure for themselves . Our two not so upright heroes rob the robbers but, needless to say, get distracted by the gorgeous Indian girl . \n\nComical Spaghetti Western about a simple and plain plot , as two outlaws compete with each other over a treasure map , being realized in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style and considered to be rip-off of the Trinidad and Bambino westerns . The film is plenty of fistfight between Brett Halsey and Charles Southwood over who will take the treasure and who will become sole leader of their band . This is a slightly funny film with entertaining as well as bewildering events , giggles , craziness , twists and lots and fun . In ¨Roy Colt and Winchester Jack¨ there are pursuits , stagecoach attacks , crossfire , saloon brawls , cutthroats gunslingers and many others things . This bemusing movie is packed with tongue-in-cheek , slapstick , a steady stream of gags , lively situations abound , sheer belly laughs , crazy humor , too much fun and to be perfect for youngsters . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with ordinary actors , technicians , decent production values and poor results . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some fights , shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . Mediocre Western All&apos;Italiana made in laughable style with a screenplay written by Mario Di Nardo , including amusing dialogue , silly situations , plot twists and turns . Filmmaker Mario Bava often uses disconcerting and surrealist situations to give us a passable movie plenty of funny happenings as well as absurd incidents ; and that , at least , kept me entertained for the almost half an hour of duration . The cast and support cast are passable . As sympathetic acting by starring trio : Brett Halsey , Charles Southwood and Marilù Tolo as a young Native American woman . Furthermore , there appears ordinary secondaries of Spaghetti Western , such as : Guido Lollobrigida or Lee Burton , Bruno Corazzari , Federico Boido or Rick Boyd and Franco Pesce , among others .\n\nRoy Colt and Winchester Jack was regularly directed by Mario Bava . This was one of the films on which Mario Bava&apos;s son, Lamberto Bava , began his career as his father&apos;s assistant ; Lamberto would latter become a director himself , winning a successful career . Mario was the main creator of Italian ¨Giallo¨ genre , Bava (&quot;Blood and Black Lace&quot;, ¨House of exorcism¨ , Black Sabbath¨) along with Riccardo Freda (¨Secret of Dr. Hitchcock¨ , ¨Il Vampiri¨) are the fundamental representatives . In fact , both of whom collaborated deeply among them , as Bava finished two Fedra&apos;s films ¨Il Vampiri¨ and ¨Caltiki¨ . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color in shining red blood , usual zooms and utilization of images-shock . Bava directed all kinds of genres such as , Sci-Fi : ¨Planet of Vampires¨ , Peplum : &quot;Hercules in the Center of the Earth&quot; , ¨Battle of Marathon¨ , Historical : &quot;Erik the Conqueror&quot; , &quot;Viking Massacre&quot; and Western : &quot;The Road to Fort Alamo&quot; , ¨Ringo from Nebraska&quot; and this ¨Roy Colt and Winchester Jack¨.",

Director Terry Marcel and producer Harry Robertson had previously made HAWK THE SLAYER a film so bad that it almost attracted a cult following , almost . Certainly HAWK is a memorable film but not in any good way and Marcel and Robertson continue in the same vein here \n\nPRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE is another sword and sorcery film where modern day protagonists from the 20th Century , a TV presenter called Carrie and a truck driver called Dan find themselves transported to an alternative universe that sees different medieval tribes warring against one another with the upper hand being held by a tyrant called Kleel \n\nIf the above makes you fear you&apos;re going to be watching a nonsensical movie then you&apos;d be right . That said it&apos;s also a movie that doesn&apos;t take itself entirely serious . I was somewhat surprised as to how involving some of the film is and didn&apos;t find myself continually wishing for it to finish despite never once thinking it was ever in danger of being a good movie . In some ways it also reminded me of the TV show THE 10TH KINGDOM that might have very well be inspired by this camp movie",

I didn&apos;t know this was a British film until the kid messed up his American accent a few times. Would have been better if the reclusive wood carver had been a true hottie after he got all cleaned up and de-bearded(not depicted). A little bit of eye candy never hurts. The end was a let down as nothing really happened. I suppose the rapid transformation of the reclusive wood carver into a warm, sociable human being was the miracle. We needed to care more about the carver for the miracle to have more impact. His character wasn&apos;t developed enough to give us this......Worth watching once.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula&quot; is one of those films that reeled people in by making its audience believe that it would be an intense horror film on par with productions like &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; or &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Instead, director Francis Ford Coppola stayed more true to Stoker&apos;s novel and put a focus on an intense love story that transcends time, the elements and even life and death. This naturally turned off many horror enthusiasts who would rather see a film that thrives on shock value rather than a movie that thrives on heart, brains and emotion. The film is naturally about the titled character, an immortal man (played superbly by the nearly always exceptional Gary Oldman) who has turned against God and now lives through the powers of darkness. By the late-19th Century, the titled character is trying to lure back a reincarnation of his one true love (Winona Ryder) and of course attempting to eliminate all those that might stand in his way (Ryder&apos;s fiance Keanu Reeves and professor Anthony Hopkins most notably). Overall &quot;Dracula&quot; is an amazingly good looking film that benefits from high production values and guaranteed performances (mainly from Oldman and Hopkins). Coppola&apos;s direction is strong, but a bit overbearing at times and sometimes it is unclear what the tone of the production truly is. Watch for Italian beauty Monica Bellucci as one of Oldman&apos;s beautiful, but deadly wives. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "U.S. secret service agent YUL BRYNNER is enlisted by Scotland Yard to infiltrate a forgery ring distributing phony U.S. currency in London. He joins a Scotland Yard man EDWARD WOODWARD in this story that appears to be a remake of T-MEN, a thriller from the &apos;40s that starred Dennis O&apos;Keefe in the Brynner role. This version starts in the same terse documentary style as the American film.\n\nIt&apos;s Brynner who decides the best way to capture the mob is to infiltrate them, with Woodward as his back-up, a man with a wife and two children. Brynner is motivated by revenge. His sweetheart was killed in America by men who meant to kill him. Brynner has his misgivings about Woodward. &quot;A married man should be sitting behind a desk shoving papers.&quot; He&apos;s afraid Woodward won&apos;t be a good back-up for him since he refuses to carry a gun.\n\nThe London backgrounds add flavor to the story, but the script is a cumbersome one, lacking the tension of T-MEN. Dull stretches toward the middle of the story take away from interest for the overall story to have the desired effect. Sam Wanamaker&apos;s direction is much too sluggish for this kind of yarn. CHARLES GRAY does a nice job as &quot;The Owl&quot;.\n\nThe storyline is so similar in detail to T-MEN that it&apos;s an example of how a 1940s film noir filmed in shadowy B&amp;W can be so superior to this Technicolor remake shifted to London locales but otherwise much the same story, except for some minor changes toward the conclusion.\n\nSumming up: Should have generated more suspense. A better editing job would have helped the sluggish pace of a film that is not without a certain amount of intrigue and danger.",

I&apos;ve seen the story of Nanking depicted before but never with the confidence I had that this was how it really was. It was like watching three Shindlers save the Chinese, and Spielberg&apos;s Shoa, all rolled into one perfect film. A panel of actors speak the lines from letters and diaries of European/American witnesses and Chinese and Japanese survivors tell their stories themselves on film. It&apos;s not just a narrator interpreting the events - it&apos;s the voices of the people who were there. The story line is well honed accompanied by stills, 16 mm smuggled out by one of the foreigners, and the actors provide voice for the foreigners. It is an incredibly moving and informative film. I sat next to two couples, two Japanese American men married to Chinese American women. One wife had seen the film the night before, and our night she brought everyone else back with her. I spoke with one of the husbands and he said that out of scale of 5 he gave it a 7. For the rest of the week I ran into others who saw the film and everyone said that they thought it was the best documentary they had ever seen in their lives. I totally agree.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a pure exercise in style from the Luc Besson school of film making. A handsome gangster joins ranks with a school of dropouts who populate the Parisian subway system, hounded (but never phazed) by transportation police. The trouble is that head honcho Fred has fallen in love with the pretty but stroppy wife of one of his BCBG victims, and strife ensues below the streets of gay Paree.\n\nChristopher Lambert is amazing as the stylish rebel gangster with a heart, Fred; Isabelle Adjani is pretty but, as always, deeply annoying -- she just exudes arrogance from the bottom of her dainty little heart. On the sidelines we see an impossibly young Jean-Hugues Anglade, Jean Reno and Jean-Pierre Bacri. I actually didn&apos;t recognise Reno, that&apos;s how young and unknown he is here.\n\nIf you have a deeper interest in cinema, this is a straight ten. It&apos;s amazing how Besson brings together great style, action, fun, pace, acting, dialogue and amazing characters. Unlike most directors who film in the province and try to make it look like Paris, Besson films in Paris but makes it look like Metropolis.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn&apos;t much of a plot and zilch suspense. The film starts with a heated heart-to-heart between Fred and pretty Héléna, and since we are aware that their affair can&apos;t end but unhappily (albeit in an incredibly chic way), the suspense is exactly zero. So if you just want entertainment, you should better pick one of Besson&apos;s later movies.",

      "name": "Not quite a touchdown, but at least Stone is back",
      "reviewBody": "Oliver Stone is one of the most, if not THE most, passionate filmmakers working today.  He&apos;s also a talented filmmaker, which a lot of people seem to forget.  When both his talent and passion are at full strength, the results are impressive(SALVADOR, PLATOON, JFK, NIXON).  When the passion is still there, but the talent is tripped up by his passion and ambitions, he makes flawed movies which are still powerful(WALL STREET, TALK RADIO, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, HEAVEN AND EARTH).  But when he goes outside of his passions, for either experiments(NATURAL BORN KILLERS), or to make &quot;mainstream&quot; movies(U-TURN), he misses wide.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS, to me, was a worse film, but U-TURN was, in a way, even more dispiriting, because the former you could at least excuse as an experiment gone wrong, whereas the latter screamed &quot;Cash-in!&quot;  You felt after watching Stone was too tired to fight anymore.\n\nWell, as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY proves, Stone, like his on-screen alter-ego, Tony D&apos;Amato(Al Pacino), may look tired, but he&apos;s still got fight left in him. Many have seen football as war, so it&apos;s appropriate Stone has long wanted to make a movie about football.  And as Spike Lee did with HE GOT GAME, Stone wants us to see not only the glory of the actual playing(as well as how tough it is to earn that glory), but also the corrupt forces which are pervading it today.  After all, we decry flashy players, and then complain about those who are too boring, we talk about tradition out of one side of our mouth and demand the game be updated out of the other side, we call white players who exhibit boorish behavior &quot;colorful&quot; while calling black players who exhibit similar behavior &quot;punks&quot;(and that&apos;s putting it mildly), we complain about players who are overpaid while thinking nothing of owners who spend lavishly on themselves and move teams around, we complain about football being too dominated by TV yet sit around like couch potatoes every Sunday and Monday night, we react with horror when players get hurt badly and get addicted to drugs, yet we yell at them to murder each other on the field and call those who don&apos;t chicken(to put it mildly), and so on.\n\nThis is a wide canvas to cover, and yet Stone does a pretty good job of it. Especially good is how the relationship between D&apos;Amato and his new quarterback Willie Beamon(Jamie Foxx) encompasses a lot of that canvas. There are two scenes in particular which stand out; one where D&apos;Amato sits with Willie on the plane and tries to talk to him, but can&apos;t think of anything which doesn&apos;t sound patronizing from Willie&apos;s point of view(like music, where D&apos;Amato thinks the fact he&apos;s mentioning black jazz musicians is supposed to mean something), and the scene at D&apos;Amato&apos;s house, where Beamon talks of how, in the past, &quot;playing for the team&quot; was code for &quot;Know your place, boy,&quot; and have things really changed?  Willie has to learn that playing for the team really does mean, as quarterback, getting them to respect you so they&apos;ll play for you, and Tony has to learn that tradition can&apos;t be stodgy, that it has to accept change.\n\nStone is less sure in other aspects.  Cameron Diaz does a good job as the team&apos;s owner, but her character is a little too one-dimensional at times. It would have been more interesting to have here not just talk in terms of money, but that the game, to her, really is more interesting the way Willie plays it(maybe I&apos;m biased, but I&apos;m a fan of more pass-oriented games).  And while I don&apos;t think Stone is as misogynist as he&apos;s been charged with in the past, certainly it&apos;s evident here.  It&apos;s one thing to say there are groupies in football, it&apos;s another thing to delight in showing them.  There are sympathetic woman here, particularly Ann-Margaret as Diaz&apos;s mother, who shows what being a football wife costs, and Lela Rochon as Willie&apos;s girlfriend, who is unwilling to have that happen to her(the scene at the party, where she feels both isolated from Willie and the other wives, is nicely drawn).  Finally, Stone can&apos;t resist the ROCKY-type cliches near the end.\n\nBut though it&apos;s flawed, there&apos;s still a lot of power here.  Except for Lauren Holly, who I&apos;m not a big fan of, the acting is all around excellent, particularly Foxx.  I was particularly impressed with how well the athletes did as actors, particularly Jim Brown(though he&apos;s an actor, so this isn&apos;t surprising) and Lawrence Taylor.  And, of course, all the football scenes are terrific and feel real.  It&apos;s always good when you see on screen what you can&apos;t see watching the game on TV, and Stone accomplishes that here. Call it not quite a touchdown, but a film which convinces us Stone still has fight left in him.",

      "reviewBody": "I couldn&apos;t sleep one night and this documentary was on CBC Newsworld. The political career of Lee Atwater and how he helped Ronald Reagan and George Bush get to the White House is sobering stuff.\n\nAtwater was a master at spin. He would use every dirty trick in the book to make the GOP&apos;s opponents in the elections look bad. Unscrupulous, underhanded, ruthless and unrelenting, he would do everything he could to undermine the opposition. He even would attack his own, such as Bob Dole. He would use the power of fear to get people to vote for the Republicans.\n\nDespite all this, he still comes off as a charismatic, very likable, affable and cool guy. His love of blues music and the guitar just make you want to forgive him for his evil ways. He comes off as a true charismatic enigma.\n\nA very interesting look at how the political machine worked in the 1980&apos;s and how easy it is to control people with words and images, Boogie Man is definitely worth a watch to see how Atwater manipulated the American people to see things his way.",

Boring premise, cheesy dialog, and pacing that made me rather watch my clock&apos;s hour hand move. And come on--if the hero is going to restore some classic automobile, why would he ever waste his time and effort on a crappy Firebird?! \n\nI literally threw away the videotape when I was done. Lucky for me that it was a gift from a friend (who also saw no reason to hang on to it). If you&apos;re looking for a silly high-speed movie, watch Smokey and the Bandit or any Steve McQueen movie. There&apos;s no reason to waste time with this drek.",

There aren&apos;t many twists and turns but neither is the crime clear cut. The movie primarily follows Quinn through his surreptitious investigation as well as his family and woman troubles. The movie is easy to watch, easy to follow, plus you get to hear Denzel do his best Jamaican impression.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Something Big&quot; has always gotten a bad wrap from critics, but I have to disagree with them on this one.\n\nThis flick is good, fun, western escapism at it&apos;s non political correctness best. Just two years later Mel Brooks was hailed for a much raunchier &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, but for some reason &quot;Something Big&quot; was deemed way over the top in 1971. \n\nSad, since by this point, after his &quot;Airport&quot; success, Dean was at the tail end of a hectic 25-year film making career. One senses that as Dean prepares to end his outlaw ways in the film, he was saying goodbye to the movie... after a continuous run of at least one film per year since 1949. Indeed, other than the Cannonball Run nonsense in the 80s, Dean would do only two more films... 1973&apos;s &quot;Showdown&quot; with Rock Hudson (a good one!) and 1975&apos;s crime drama &quot;Mr. Ricco&quot; (a MUST SEE for Dean fans).\n\nAnyway... onto &quot;Something Big&quot;. Dean is on his last legs as an outlaw and wants to pull one more &quot;big&quot; event. This one involves getting a gattling gun, trying to get Albert Salmi a wife, putting some Mexican banditos on ice and ... ah, well, it&apos;s kind of a rollicking mish mash, but it&apos;s a lot of fun on the way!\n\nDean is really in his element and shines as the anti-hero. Brian Keith is a hoot as a stiff calvary officer and other great supporting cast members like the great Ben Johnson and the above mentioned Albert Salmi make this one a must see. Like Dean&apos;s television show of the time, this flick doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously, but you know, deep down, the bad guys really aren&apos;t too bad and work with their own sort of code of honor. Speaking of honor, Honor Blackmun is good here too.\n\nOther Dean Martin westerns I&apos;d recommend are Rio Bravo, Rough Night in Jericho and especially Showdown. He did others, but The Sons of Katie Elder and Five Card Stud weren&apos;t up to par in my opinion-although they are watchable. Only Four For Texas is truly bad.\n\nToo bad this isn&apos;t available on video or DVD. The Dean Martin catalog is seriously under represented in video and DVD and I hope that is rectified sometime soon.\n\nEnjoy &quot;Something Big&quot; for what it is... a bit randier version of &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff&quot; type of thing, with a pretty good cast of A list players, good locations and cinematography and a funny script. The deep blue arid skies and dusty locales are truly beautiful and may have been filmed near the Superstition Mts. in Arizona where I once lived, so the movie has a special place in my heart. The best thing I can say about this film is that it made me want to be one of the characters in it, looking for an adventure and finding it in the old west. No cares, no responsibilities, just a desire, once in life to do something really, really big!"

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t really expect much from this movie, being a Greek zombie movie and all, but my prejudice was quickly put to shame. &quot;Evil&quot; (or &quot;To Kako&quot;) turned out to be somewhat of a surprise.\n\nThink a mixture of &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and Peter Jackson&apos;s &quot;Dead Alive&quot; (aka &quot;Braindead&quot;), then you sort of have the thing that is &quot;Evil&quot;.\n\nPersonally, I am not keen on zombies that are super agile and running around, as they are in this movie. That being said, then the director of this movie managed to uphold a very &quot;28 Days Later&quot; feeling all throughout the entire movie, and for that, thumbs up.\n\nThere was a good amount of gore in the movie as well, though the movie was fairly low-budget, they managed to make the effects look nice and realistic enough. And again, thumbs up on that.\n\nHowever, one thing that didn&apos;t really sit well with me was the characters in the movie. They weren&apos;t really given much space to unfold or develop. And as such, they were fairly two-dimensional. There were some attempts thrown in at being funny, particularly from the Argyris guy, whether or not that is good, is a personal preference, I, however, just didn&apos;t find the forced humor at place in the movie.\n\nNow, this movie is of course a mile and a stone away from being up to most Hollywood productions, but still, if you are a zombie aficionado, there is some good stuff here and good entertainment, and &quot;Evil&quot; should - and deserves - a place in the movie collection of any zombie aficionado.\n\nSo you might wonder why I am only rating &quot;Evil&quot; a 5 out of 10 rating. Well, simply because I don&apos;t find agile, running zombies particularly enjoyable, and also because of the misplaced attempts of humor in the movie. &quot;Evil&quot; has a lot to offer, but with some adjustments, it could have been so much more. But with &quot;Evil&quot;, Greece has put itself on the world map of the zombie infection.\n\nOn a closing note, then the ending of the movie was just priceless. It was the best part of the entire movie. And what a way to leave the audience hanging. Several rotting thumbs up for the bold ending of the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I had always wanted to check out this Silent version of the Edgar Allan Poe horror perennial, and not just because of Luis Bunuel&apos;s involvement; actually, he only served as Second Assistant in charge of interiors on the film – so much for the co-directing credit that is often attributed to him (including the DVD front cover). Ironically, when the disc was released by All Day Entertainment, I recall complaining about its &quot;Collector&apos;s Edition&quot; moniker when it was a bare-bones affair apart from an essay by the director himself – the company&apos;s President David Kalat, however, was prompt to inform me that the proposed Bunuel-related supplements fell through at the last minute.\n\nAnyway, this is now my third viewing of the movie: the second had occurred either as part of an earlier Bunuel retrospective or to compare it with one of the many other filmic renditions of the tale. For the record, a viewing of the obscure low-budgeted 1949 British effort followed this re-acquaintance with the Epstein film, while I also own and have watched the U.S. short (also from 1928) and the 1960 Roger Corman/Vincent Price classicbut there are at least five more versions I would be interested in catching (by such notable directors as Alexandre Astruc, Jan Svankmajer, Jesus Franco, Curtis Harrington and Ken Russell)! \n\nThat said, my reaction to the film under review continues to be ambivalent: to begin with, this is perhaps one of only two cases which can truly be described as a dream-like experience (the other being the equally haunting but more readily satisfying VAMPYR [1932] by one of my favorite auteurs, Carl Theodor Dreyer); however, the sluggish pacing makes its brief 66 minutes feel longnot helped by the archaic parts of the accompanying score (at least, some of it was suitably avant-gardist) and the droning narration, reading the English translation of the original French intertitles, by respected but heavily-accented actor Jean-Pierre Aumont! \n\nVisually, the film really cannot be faulted as the Impressionist first half (with images that could almost be taken for paintings) giving way unsurprisingly to Expressionism in the much-anticipated high-strung finale. Even more than in MAUPRAT (1926), Epstein virtually lets the camera and the editing tell the story: the acting actually leaves much to be desired (especially since both Usher and his guest are way overage, with the latter bafflingly also made out to be quite deaf!); as for Madeleine, she is played by Marguerite Gance (wife of famous pioneer film-maker Abel – Bunuel&apos;s disdain of whom eventually cost him his job!), who manages the character&apos;s essential frailty and subsequent wraith-like features. Incidentally, Roderick and Madeleine are here husband and wife rather than brother and sister; other unwarranted changes to the source material were its depiction of the Usher mansion as something of a monstrous abode, akin to Castle Dracula, and the rather disappointing climax in which the Ushers actually survive the ordeal – thus rendering the title pointless! \n\nAgain, the power (and reputation) of the film rests squarely on its memorable detail: taking a cue from Poe&apos;s &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot;, Madeleine&apos;s &apos;painting&apos; by Roderick literally comes to life as its subject fades away more and more (at one point, Madeleine even feels her husband&apos;s brush stroke on the canvas, as if it had really touched her cheek); her eventual succumbing to catalepsy, played out in slow-motion; the lengthy ritual of her burial (her resting-place even lying across the river, a la Bunuel&apos;s own much-later THE RIVER AND DEATH [1955]); her &apos;resurrection&apos; (amusingly, the name Ligeia also crops up as an ancestor in the Usher family crypt!), with the sight of the casket moving about in the grave anticipating the surreal coffin-scurrying-through-the-wilderness sequence from the Spanish maestro&apos;s SIMON OF THE DESERT (1965), etc.\n\nDespite the rather grainy DVD transfer (the faults of the print exposed all the more on my 40&quot; TV monitor), the quality of the cinematography comes though – highlighting both the desolate, fog-bound landscape and the expansive interiors (the wind blowing through the house results in constantly billowing curtains and books falling from the library shelves in slow-motion); as already mentioned, Epstein practically runs the gamut of the cinematic language along the way, adopting such techniques as cross-cutting (at various points during one particular sequence incorporating, for no very good reason, a couple of frogs engaged in the act of copulation!) and superimposition, down to shaking the camera in order to evoke a character&apos;s disorientation. Unfortunately, the all-important closing moments of the film are rushed and decidedly muddled – even diminishing a nice effect ostensibly created by a constellation of stars, which appears in the skies behind the mansion, shaped like the Ushers&apos; warped family-tree! \n\nWhile highly acclaimed in some quarters - with hyberbolic claims ranging from &quot;the finest horror film ever made&quot; to &quot;the pinnacle of artistic achievement in European cinema of the 1920s&quot; - this version would be all but forgotten forty years later (it does not even earn a mention in Carlos Clarens&apos; influential tome &quot;An Illustrated History Of The Horror Film&quot;) and the exact same destiny befell Epstein himself later on, despite having been one of the three key avant-garde French exponents of the era (the others were the afore-mentioned Abel Gance and Marcel L&apos;Herbier).",

      "reviewBody": "COMEDOWN is a low rent British horror film set entirely within the confines of a deserted tower block. The gritty realism and the setting made me hope for something along the lines of TOWER BLOCK or ATTACK THE BLOCK, but unfortunately this is nothing like those two (great) movies. Instead it&apos;s a cheap slasher, almost entirely devoid of imagination.\n\nHeadlining the cast is Jacob Anderson, best known to audiences for his role as Grey Worm in GAME OF THRONES. Anderson and his buddies, including a pregnant girlfriend and an obnoxious type (Adam Deacon, playing firmly to type) hole up in a run-down building to help run a pirate radio station, but their drug-fuelled highs come crashing down when a killer starts picking them off one by one.\n\nCOMEDOWN must feature one of the least menacing bad guys ever, and when you learn of his motivations you&apos;ll laugh out loud, they&apos;re that slim. The kills, which are what most horror fans will watch this for, are relatively tame, and there just isn&apos;t much in the way of suspense built along the way. It doesn&apos;t help that the dialogue is moronic throughout and that every twist in the script is well-choreographed. Add in some quite terrible cinematography, meaning 95% of this takes place in near blackness, and you have a quite unworthy film.",

Hollywood is still the &quot;big dog&quot; on the block and it&apos;s hard for a film with a positive message such as this to find a better place at the table. MERCY STREETS has a few good things going for it, starting with the acting. It&apos;s not a stilted as you&apos;d expect from a religious-themed film. The writers took great care to avoid unnecessary and gratuitous cursing (even though the violent content garnered a PG-13 rating) and also to avoid being too &quot;preachy&quot; with the message. Writer/director Jon Gunn and co-writer John Mann bring a message of hope and deliverance to the screen in a truly artistic way. So, while the gun-play might be a bit much for young viewers, I think this film is a worthy addition to any home library.",

Steven is still pretty out of shape but he pulls this movie off, there is loads of hand to hand combat,guns,knives and car action. Eddie Griffin does a good job as a gang boss and ads some decent humour to the movie. Don&apos;t get me wrong this is no masterpiece and some of the fighting is speeded up but i think real seagal fans will love this and will see it as a very big step in the right direction.",

      "reviewBody": "Another fascinating and frustrating film from Kim Ki-Duk. He reminds of Lars Von Trier in a lot of ways, in that they both have a lot of the same weaknesses along with being remarkable filmmakers. The thing that bothers me the most about both of them is the degree to which their films obviously serve as allegories. In this film in particular (like Von Trier with Dogville) this aspect is particularly emphasized to a debilitating extent. Also, it&apos;s worth noting that both filmmakers seem to have a lot of the same questionable ideas when it comes to women, but that&apos;s somewhat besides the point.\n\nAs Kim Ki-Duk&apos;s films go, this one is actually one of the more obviously ambitious and noteworthy. The whole thing was shot in real time, with a bunch of cameras running simultaneously (including one digital camera that is incorporated into the story itself, to alternately ingenious and irritating effect). Objectively, this is one of the most promising things the filmmaker has attempted, although the method is less noticeable in the final film than it perhapse should have been. Still, in the moments where the technique is used effectively (particularly in scenes shot in public places), it proves to be one of the most admirable things Kim Ki-Duk has done.\n\nOn a whole though, the film still has a fair share of flaws. Along with the aforementioned problems i have with the un-reality of his films, Kim Ki-Duk again proves he is pretty much worthless when it comes to using music. To begin with, the film (as is the case with many of his) has awful sounding, cheap music. But even then, in one scene in particular Kim Ki-Duk has the music come in at a terrible moment that ruins what could have been a very emotional scene. In other ways as well, the (understandable) low-budgetness of the project becomes glaringly obvious in a way it shouldn&apos;t, particularly in the way in which the film deals with violence.\n\nThat said, as always, there is still enough genuine talent and obvious artistic vision that shines through in his work to make me not only not dismiss Kim Ki-Duk, but make me consider him one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Even if, on a whole, the film falls short of it&apos;s ambitions (it seemed to be attempting a lot of what Man Bites Dog had already done wonderfully), it&apos;s still a very admirable and interesting undertaking.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a film with a somewhat interesting premise, a somewhat interesting main character, and a somewhat interesting conclusion. This was not a Pixar film: it wasn&apos;t designed to appeal to adults. Rather, the writers focus on giving the kiddies a few laughs without leaving the parents comatose with boredom.\n\nAnd when everything is taken into consideration, the writers succeed. Somewhat.\n\nIt&apos;s just not a very memorable film. Whreas most kids can watch films like &quot;Shrek&quot; repeatedly because of the sight gags, talented voice-over performances, and hidden jokes that they might not catch the first time around, &quot;Chicken Little&quot; is likely to be forgotten the moment the credits roll. That&apos;s not to say that Disney doesn&apos;t provide it&apos;s standard politically correct message. Of course the best player on the baseball team is a girl (Foxy Loxy). Of course a girl (Goosey Loosey) beats up and humiliates the boy (Chicken Little). Of course the character with the most redeeming social value is physically unattractive (Abby Mallard). And on, and on, and on. Disney also manages to continue its bizarre tradition of creating single father families (&quot;Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Goofy Movie&quot;): Chicken Little&apos;s mother has, of course, departed for the great unknown.\n\nThe relationship between Chicken Little and his father comes across as more annoying than heartwarming. The premise: A father realizes that it&apos;s probably not such a great idea to be embarrassed by his son; by the end of the movie, what his own child thinks of him actually takes precedent over the opinions of neighbors and perfect strangers! This message would undoubtedly come across as highly inspirational...if not for the fact that it&apos;s so blatantly obvious, hackneyed, and overplayed.\n\nThe voice-over&apos;s for the film were largely uninspiring, save for amusing performances by Don Knotts and Adam West. &quot;Fish out of Water&quot; was easily the most likable of the bunch (yes, I was suckered by the standard Disney cutesy animated character in their never ending attempt to sell more toys), and he didn&apos;t even have a speaking roll. No, &quot;Chicken Little&quot; is not the worst animated film I&apos;ve ever seen...but memorable, it is not.",

It is the best filmation I have seen. Still I think this is not the best movie made by the same director. It seems to have something in common with the earlier film &apos;12 chairs&apos;, but is somehow weaker, although from literature point of view I think Gogol&apos;s Revizor outperforms 12 Chairs of Ilf and Petrov. In the film 12 chairs, the Revizor is played by a theater group that happens to own some of those 12 chairs hunted by Ostap and Kisa. I liked most the great actors in this movie. Papanov is great and also Filippov in the role of Osip, he is also Kisa Vorobyaninov in 12 chairs. It draws a hopeless picture of Russia, very dirty and amoral. This is a film from the deeps of &apos;stagnation&apos; period, 1977. I was surprised to see Russians current national flag in this film. Hopefully, the rest of the reality shown will not come true as well.",

I like that the action is in modern Moscow. Also it has some plot twists. Secondly, the cast is great, I like that we can see Sergey Burunov himself. Thirdly I like action and visual effects, it&apos;s very rare for modern Russin films.\n\nSo, i it&apos;s goos family film.",

It&apos;s a really cheap production, for one thing; it&apos;s shot with numerous close-ups, and with technical goofs like the reflections of boom mikes and cameramen clearly visible. The cheapness is really evident with the depiction of the evil alien (which looks nothing like how it did in the original movie for some reason.) There is very little alien mayhem both with the alien in human bodies and the alien outside of human bodies. This may explain why the tone of the movie is totally wrong. There&apos;s no feeling of tension; the tone is constantly flat and bored. It&apos;s no wonder why New Line paired this sequel on the same DVD as the original movie, since I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anyone who would buy this sequel as a standalone disc."

Frankly I am sick of everyone jumping on that bad wagon.  A few people say that he&apos;s a bad actor, then everyone has to jump in and say it too.  Sure, he could have done a few lines of this movie with more feeling, but that doesn&apos;t mean he deserves such awful critiques.  When I was in the theater, several people around me were complaining of how it was the worst movie they ever saw. Here I was, still sitting there, trying to let my face return to normal color (I had cried a little).  I was outraged.  The viewers should have enjoyed it for what the movie was, a light romance, nothing more, nothing less.  It wasn&apos;t supposed to be Oscar-winning, it was simply supposed to be romantic.  Movies aren&apos;t always believeable, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it will automatically get bad reviews.  It is really disappointing, because this movie was really good (and really sad).",

You can tell it was not touched up or enhanced their fixed or anything else. I suspect that they were not planning on people having 46-inch televisions. The credits in the beginning part of the program are fuzzy. But when it gets down to talking about Adams, he gets down to talking about Adams and many of the photographs mysteriously get sharper. We get so engrossed in the subject matter of both Adams and his pictures that we no longer care one way or the other were sharp or not.\n\nMy only complaint is that it was in soundbite form. I do not know who designed the program that way, but they could have focused on one person or another instead of person A, and B, and C, and a, and B, and c, repeatedly, and so forth. It breaks the continuity of thought.\n\nFor me, the experience is enhanced because I have been to most of these places several times. I hope to go back again. I have also been intrigued by the mechanics of photography before it became the digital age. I am now still interested in digital photography. But photography aside by the time that you get to the end of this program you will feel that you have lost your only friend.\n\nThis presentation gave me a unique way of looking at life and being conservative about what nature has brought us.",

      "reviewBody": "Many stories have been told about Fritz Lehner&apos;s newest film, whose production took more than five years, probably the most expensive and costly Austrian movie ever. All the newspaper critics have torn it to pieces, international festivals refused to show it, now the future will show how the audience reacts to it.\n\nThe story of Everyman (in German: Jedermann) is old, but it is best known from Hugo von Hoffmannsthal&apos;s play `Jedermann&apos; that is shown every year at the Salzburg drama festival. Apart from the very basic plot framework, Lehner&apos;s movie has absolutely nothing to do with the play. It is a modern version about an Austrian couturier (played by Klaus Maria Brandauer, whose face is not exactly what one wants to see in close-up for throughout almost three hours), who dies in a car accident and ruminates during his last hours about how one more night in his life could have gone by.\n\nLehner&apos;s movie is long and often exhausting. But one does injustice to Lehner and Brandauer, if one says that the movie is completely bad. Right, the whole project is pretentious and megalomaniacal. Often it is just stupid and it may have been cut much shorter.\n\nStill, a simple story about success and death is told in a coherent way, with much symbolism and - that is the main point - in absolutely brilliant, beautiful pictures and moods. I suspect Lehner of having been inspired by Peter Greenaway movies, which is absolutely no problem for me because not many directors have followed Greenaway yet and the fact that it is an Austrian director who, besides, shows Vienna and its vicinity in a completely new light, without any Lipizzaner or waltz clichés, is quite exciting.\n\nSo, in spite of all the - indisputable - weaknesses that were pointed out in the reviews, this is a wonderful, a beautiful movie, at least if one doesn&apos;t take it completely seriously and watches it with expectations as low as I did. I&apos;m afraid it won&apos;t happen but it would be great if `Jedermanns Fest&apos; could be successful. I think, we could even send it to the United States. The American audience would like it better than the Austrian, and maybe this could finally result in an Oscar nomination. But again: I&apos;m afraid this will never happen.",

      "reviewBody": "Beware with the title of this movie! It isn&apos;t a western at all. Besides, French westerns don&apos;t exist. It&apos;s just a road-movie. Unlike to the USA, France isn&apos;t really specialized with this kind of movie. Nevertheless, I think that the few French road-movies can rival their American fellows. &quot;Western&quot; ranks among them and it&apos;s with this movie that Manuel Poirier went down in history by imposing his talent to the general public.\n\nLike in a major part of road-movies, what interests the film-maker is the behavior and especially the evolution of his character(s). Here, in the very beginning of this movie, nothing can anticipate a friendship between the two main characters. However, as the movie goes along, by traveling the country, they learn to know each other. Poirier makes his two main actors nice and at the end, if Paco failed to win Marinette&apos;s love, he could gain the friendship and the comfort of his partner.\n\nBut &quot;Western&quot; is also an occasion for Poirier to take a realistic and sometimes ironical look on the France of the nineties, especially through Baptiste&apos;s zany game: &quot;Bonjour, la France&quot;.\n\nThe only fault of this movie is that sometimes it drags on due to tiresome and a little pointless sequences that bring really nothing to the movie. But if you take away this fault, &quot;Western&quot; is a successful road-movie where you find again the omnipresence of the country, a landscape dear to Poirier."
