I ordered a M after reading the other review about these gloves running small and it is still way too small. \n2 - Don&apos;t expect Backcountry to help you out in the return process either. You are on your own for shipping it back. Backcountry should not be selling this product with incorrect size charts by 2 sizes, and charging the customer for the returns.",

No wonder they now make a women&apos;s X-Large! Bought the large according to size chart and previous fit of gloves I own. I could barely squeeze my hands into them. Without the velcro( which I think is great) my hands would eventually tear the seams of the glove. Also I like the fact they offer a nice alternative color to gloves than the usually bland black! Recommend sizing up a size-if possible! No X-large left in grey. Had to return them.",

The photo is of the Shift Split vs Ruckus, the difference in size and curve is substantial.\n\nSo, recommended, if you have a larger face and don’t want sunglasses with a close to the face wrap.",

I ordered the ones called “Matte Terra / Poppy” and the pictured showed them as a kind of crimson and orange, but, they’re definitely purple and pink. I’m a guy. Luckily, I’m pretty confident and comfortable and I care about how well they work more than how they look, but they’re totally purple and pink. However, 5 star review because after years of constantly adjusting my helmet and sunglasses while racing in aero drops so I can see, I paired these glasses with the smith ignite helmet and I can see and I never have to adjust! It’s soooo nice! I can put up wearing some odd colors for that. Cheers!",

They look great and have a high-quality lens, but the glasses just aren&apos;t secure on my face. They bounce around on the mountain bike and feel like the wind will take them off my face if I were to look back on the road bike. The arms are loose on my temples and the nose piece does not grip so I am constantly pushing them back up on my face. I have always been a fan of Smith products, but these seem to miss the mark.",

        "reviewBody": "These sunglasses do not curve as much as the Reverb or other models of Smith sunglasses, allowing more air from the sides and bottom of the sunglasses to pass over my eyes. Since I wear corrective lenses this style does not work for me; I need a more curved design that does not allow for as large of gaps at the bottom and sides of the sunglasses. I used them for several long gravel rides and they tended to stay on my face relatively well considering how far away the bottom of the glasses hover from my face, but sweat from my helmet would often run down the front of them. Lastly, the durability and scratch-resistance of the black gold mirror lens was lacking and I found several spots on the glasses where the chrome finish has worn off. The Mag arms for switching from the clear lens to the sunglass lens are very nice and the quality of the glasses is great. There are many other styles I&apos;ve had success with from Smith but these ones aren&apos;t for me.",

However, after only owning these for less than 3 months, the lenses are separating from the frame due to the adhesive no longer supporting the weight of the lens. I’ve reached out to smith regarding a warranty claim. I’m unsure if this is an isolated event but Smith Optics has a reputation of taking care of their customers and I’m hoping to have a great experience.",

        "reviewBody": "I like the bibs, but I just returned what should be my size and ordered one size up. All sizes seem fine through legs, hips and waist and then the bib part (the part above the waist) is very narrow. It is made of elastic material, but after zipping it up I felt like in a corset, even before putting any layers on. The pictures on the site don&apos;t give an indication about that tightness. \nWe will see if one size up from the recommended size (according to the size chart) is the right fit.",

        "reviewBody": "This jacket is super light and incredibly warm and durable. I get cold easy, and I&apos;ve tried on and worn plenty of puffies I&apos;ve been too cold in (including Mountain Hardwear&apos;s Ghost Whisperer), but not this one. In the winter I use it as an extra layer snowboarding on single-digit days under an insulated shell. It&apos;s thin enough that it doesn&apos;t restrict movement and just adds warmth. This summer I&apos;ve been using it on alpine climbs in the Colorado mountains, where I&apos;ve largely been in the shade and temps have been in the 40s. It&apos;s kept me warm, and it&apos;s not at all restrictive. I&apos;ve comfortably climbed multi-pitches while wearing it. Frankly, I can&apos;t believe how tough the fabric is. It doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s tough, but I&apos;ve only ended up with 1 hole this summer when I thought for sure I would have at least 10. I&apos;ve spent plenty of time dragging it against sharp rocks. I&apos;ve also stuffed in my pack with cams and other climbing gear, and it&apos;s come out just fine every time. On top of that it&apos;s ultralight and, like any down jacket, packs down nice and small. \r\nAll that said, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d wear it as a standalone puffy in the winter. It&apos;s probably not warm enough for that.  But it excels as a warm layer when you need to be able to move freely and travel light. \r\nI have a small chest and don&apos;t have the tassel problem other people have complained about, and personally, I love the higher, harness-compatible pockets. I&apos;m 5&apos;8&quot; and 125 lbs and have the XS, which easily fits over other layers (including a Kor Nimbus Hoody in size S, which was oddly the size I needed in that jacket instead of XS). The arms are also plenty long in the XS. I also love the beautiful blue color (&quot;traverse&quot;).",

        "reviewBody": "I previously had the top recommended Wirecutter jacket that my dog ripped hole in after several years of use and wanted to give another jacket a try.\n\nThis one exceeded my expectations in that the hood covers large portion of my face when fully zipped. That has helped me a lot on windy days to minimize heat loss. I&apos;m someone who&apos;s always cold and was at first skeptical of warmth rating since the billows are more compact than my previous jacket. But it&apos;s been great! \n\nThe manufacturing is excellent from what I can tell. The one thing I&apos;ve noticed is the zipper setup seems reverse of what I normally see for male jackets in the US. I suspect it&apos;s because Mammut is European company but not sure. Overall, fantastic product!",

        "reviewBody": "I have been using OR clothing for years now with no reservations regarding quality or longevity. I previously had a pair of OR Igneo ski pants that lasted for ever and I eventually had to dispose of them when I had worn holes in the pocket and crotch. It was getting ridiculous sewing them back together. As an outdoor professional I really drive my gear until it dies and I wore the Igneos for hundreds of days heli-skiing and ski touring... The Tungsten II pants seemed to be the closest thing to replace them with. No regrets there. PRO: I LOVE the fact that they come in three different lengths. The short length was exactly what I was looking for. I hate pants that are way too long for me. CON: I would have given these pants 5 stars except for the fact that I found the waist size a bit deceiving. My old Igneos were a large and fit extremely well. So, I bought large in the Tungsten IIs. They were just a bit too snug in the waist for adding that extra layer for the frigid days we recently had in the Canadian Rockies (Yes, minus 40 is a thing.) I kept the large size and ended up buying two additional pairs of XL for the colder days as well. I have never worn a size XL in my life. (and Yes, I like them that much that I now own three pairs.) The XLs are a bit baggy in the legs for me but I can wear my expedition weight base layers for the frigid days and for when I am standing around instructing in the cold or digging snow profiles.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;m an intermediate climber and was looking for aggressive shoes that weren&apos;t painful to wear. I have wide feet (in the ballpark of 3E-4E), and could really only fit in wide shoes like the Skwama (painful heel), Instinct (too high volume), Shaman (painful toe) and the Mastia. The toe cap rubber is flexible enough to relieve pressure on your toe knuckles and is functional. I&apos;d say the shoe has moderate sensitivity - it&apos;s definitely more sensitive than XS Edge shoes, but not quite as sensitive as other slippers I tried on. The shoe is pretty flexible, and (so far) the shape holds and is tensioned enough to help you drive power through the toes (as someone new to aggressive shoes, I can definitely feel it working, and my feet need a break). It&apos;s been very versatile in the gym; I haven&apos;t gotten a chance to take it outside yet. Not sure why they use XS Grip instead of XS Grip 2, but the rubber doesn&apos;t seem as confidence-inspiring compared to other shoes I&apos;ve tried. At any rate, I&apos;d definitely buy it again, assuming that it&apos;s durable in the long run. As far as performance and comfort, it&apos;s a winner for me.\n\nFor sizing, I followed Tenaya&apos;s suggestion (they have a sizing tool on their website). It recommended 1.5 (US mens) sizes down from street for a &quot;comfort&quot; fit, which is what I got. I generally wear my street shoes on the tighter end with not much room past the toes. The &quot;comfort&quot; fit is snug throughout the foot, but has a little slop in the heel (I have a narrow heel). Just to test the limits, I&apos;ve cranked a heel hook with my full body weight, and my heel does slide around (I do have a narrow heels), but did not pop or dislodge the shoe. I can generally wear the shoe for ~20-30 mins at a time before needing a quick break, to relieve my foot from the tension in the curved shape. IMO this is perfect for any casual climber as my climbing rarely requires that intense of a heel hook. I do wish that \n\nIf you&apos;re looking for performance, I&apos;d go 2 sizes down, and if you&apos;re one who likes squeezing your foot for every last drop of performance, I&apos;d go 2.5 sizes down. If you wear your street shoes with a lot of room past the toes, I&apos;d go down half a size further. YMMV as everyone&apos;s feet are different.",

I could slip my foot out while strapped, and I didn’t even have a chance to climb in them. \n\nI know climbing shoe sizing is all over the place, but the gap between the fit of these and the Ra is baffling.",

The shoe has a nice fitting heel for my foot compared to the Oasi and the Iati models, and the heel design is similar to the Skwamas for stability. It also is stiff rubber, but softens over time.\n\nThat being said, my experience with other Tenaya models can be said for this one as well. For reference, I’m a street 8.5 M, and I have to get these 5.5-6 M, same with other Tenaya models. These shoes will probably last you for a good 3-6 months before they start to become floppy and the rubber begins to fall apart. It doesn’t really help that they can be pricey too. However, these are pretty great shoes for the time you have them.\n\nOther models I’ve owned:\n\nFive Ten Hiangle Men’s- 7.5 US M\nLa Sportiva Mantra- 6 U.S M",

This backpack is a game-changer for anyone who needs both style and functionality. First, the design is sleek and modern, with a neutral grey color that goes well with any outfit or occasion. It&apos;s subtle but still has a premium look, which I really appreciate. The quality of the material is top-notch, offering durability without being too bulky or heavy. The storage capacity is impressive. It has multiple compartments, including a dedicated laptop sleeve that fits my 15-inch laptop perfectly. There&apos;s plenty of space for books, a water bottle, chargers, and even a jacket. I also love the easy-access front pocket for smaller items like keys, headphones, and my phone. The straps are comfortable and padded, making it easy to carry even when it&apos;s fully packed. The back panel is breathable, which helps reduce sweating on those warmer days, and the overall weight distribution feels balanced. Whether you&apos;re using it for work, school, or travel, the North Face Router Backpack is practical, stylish, and incredibly well-designed. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, versatile backpack!",

        "reviewBody": "I finally shredded the sole on my purple and grey Scarpa Helix&apos;s that were 3+ years old after heavy use on local sport and trad crags. I love the Helix shoe so much I will be getting the old ones re-soled, but bought the new orange model on sale to see if there were any changes. The shoe has stayed true in comfort and shape with a few upgrades that make it even better.\n\nThe comfort level of these shoes has no competition when you&apos;re spending a day on the rock. The fit is snug but my toes only feel slightly cramped after an hour or two of constant wear. Scarpa is great for those with narrow heels; no slippage or stretch occurs at the heel cup. Despite a full leather shoe, there is little to no break in and they do not stretch much. Buy them true to size. The lacing system allows for adjusting as needed.\n\nI did notice the toe on the new shoe is slightly more pointed to allow for better contact on smeary foot-holds. The previous model was a pretty rounded toe with less stick on tougher climbs. I also love the oversized heel loops that help pull them on and a wider, more comfortable tongue. The stitching on the new model seems more reinforced throughout and the rubber now has a denser platform on the ball of the foot and heel. This makes them a little stiffer but more supportive and dependable overall. \n\nHighly recommended essential shoe for roped climbs, but not agressive enough for bouldering or highly technical climbs.",

One if you feel lazy and just stuff it inside and the other small one to have stored nicely in a backpack. The review above from another person above is not correct about it not coming with a small bag. The smaller bag is inside the sleeping bag, attached and removable. Really like the color and how light and breathable to material feels, my boys love it and can&apos;t wait to use it camping!!!",

No virgin goose down fill in it. The seems of the tubes on the bottom of the bag are sewn through - probably because not much fill loft is needed on the bottom part of the bag. Zipper length is 2/3 of the length of the bag - no ventilation at the foot section is possible if desired, or using the bag as a blanket is not practical.

The first question was sizing bc I read reviews saying it was too big.  I bought based on the actual measurements of the jacket. I have a medium that is 22&quot; in the chest. I usually wear L or XL in women&apos;s clothes,  I&apos;m happy w this choice bc the jacket is a little more fitted which is good given the weight and bulk. \nThe other thing I wondered was whether it stretches. People said it was stiff, and it is. I&apos;m assuming it might loosen up w wear over time.  There is some stretch in the jacket and it is the perfect amount to wear this jacket more fitted.",

Both were great initially low friction and quiet but both failed in my opinion. Both were installed correctly, no grease, correct BB tool. It&apos;s inexpensive and works but for the third one I opted for a threaded BB and couldn&apos;t be happier.",

          "Hi Erik,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave this review. Creaking can be a common issue or develop more frequently if you are riding in wet or muddy conditions regularly. Additionally, if you ride very frequently you may replace these more often as well. That said a thread-through style BB may be a better fit. If you need any help selecting the right bottom bracket for your bike you can always call a gearhead. We are happy to help.\n\nBest,\n\nHannah"

A L/XL does fit and surprisingly feels good. I particularly like the long length to get down in bibs.  I now had a full summer and full winter on it.  it&apos;s AWESOME for summer, must have and I can only imagine in warmer climates it even more so.  I&apos;m in Pacific NW.  For Winter, not so much, it doesn&apos;t replace a merino base layer for comfort or air insulation.  I have washed mine around 40 to 50 times on delicate with kit, but also used delicate low heat drying in tumble dryer and it&apos;s going strong.  Even still &quot;white&quot;.  If I had a complaint, I&apos;d like it in long sleeves and a dark color.  It&apos;s under the jersey so color for light shouldn&apos;t matter, and I&apos;m not fond of &quot;white&quot;.  I&apos;d say for friends in the warmer states, southern U.S. with humidity and temperature, this is a MUST HAVE.  Good luck, and as always backcountry gearheads were awesome to work with.",

I bought this, in part, for indoor riding on the trainer, and, while it&apos;s light, not sure it&apos;ll stop the sweat from pouring off, due to the holes.\n(2) As others have written, it runs even smaller than other Castelli gear.  I have around a 37&quot; chest, and the S/M is tight.  Castelli&apos;s race jersey in S is snug on me, so I usually wear a M, but this S/M is even tighter than the S race jersey.  In comparison, the Craft in S fits me quite well.\nTo be clear, I have not tried it out yet, so these are just initial impressions out of the box.",

It doesn&apos;t change how solid the grips feels but i cant even look at my bike from the left side now!\n\nTook my bike by a shop for some work, shop owner said the reason the end caps fall off is if they aren&apos;t fully jammed on to the bar... that&apos;s all well and good but this wasn&apos;t my first grip swap (yes i hit the grip with my palm before tightening) and the grip only has 1 screw at the thumb, not on the end cap.\n\nJust to test, i moved the right grip out and did the same ride i lost the left on... right end cap is still there. not really sure what the deal is, maybe i knocked it lose?\n\nWill order another set, just annoying.",

My only gripe is that the belt isn’t detachable and that the waist is kinda puffy—it puffs out when I’m sitting which is a bit weird. But overall I still wear them a lot. I enjoyrolling them up at the ankles. The legs are also slightly short, but that’s the style I like.",

I need all purpose clothes to wear all day, at a desk, on a trail, in a boat, on a rocky shore, or in a grocery store. These pants are comfy enough for sitting, sturdy enough for mountains, and flexible enough for trails. I first bought size Small and I have to roll the waist, so I tried XS, and they are perfect. Love the gently tapered ankles. I’m happy and I’m wearing real pants!",

I&apos;ve worn them every day since they arrived and they are incredibly comfortable! They hold their shape well but are also super stretchy, I can do anything in these.

They are navy/gray color as someone else described. The picture on the website definitely shows a true black. I already have a gray Altra and I&apos;m bummed that my go to gym and work shoe is no longer going to match with all of my black clothing. I highly recommend advertising it as the color it is, or even better, pretty please bring back the nice dark black version! The shoe itself still looks and fits great. I guess time will tell if the sole peels back as others have mentioned.",

I would like to see more choices from Altra with a low cushioning/ stack especially in their trail shoes. But I love that they stay loyal to the wider toe box and zero drop",

They are awesome to walk in and wear on a daily basis. They are so comfortable right out of the box. The only complaint I have is that the first pair I bought now have holes in the back of the heels so they now hurt my heel when I wear them. They are only 3 months old! It&apos;s unfortunate to pay that much for a pair of shoes for them to only last 3 months.",

They peeled off after less than 25 days of wearing them which I&apos;ve never had to happen with any other shoes.

Escalante meets all my criteria (zero drop, natural wide toe box, normal amount of cushion like a &quot;regular&quot; shoe) but I ordered and desired a BLACK shoe. These shoes match none of my clothing and are a huge disappointment. Hoping Altra exchanges them for something that meets my needs but I don&apos;t see any other styles in black that don&apos;t have an excessive amount of cushion. I really wish this model ACTUALLY came in black. It would be so easy for them to make this a black shoe like the one in the picture but alas... If style is important to you, don&apos;t order this shoe. It looks nothing like the shoe in the picture on the site.",

I have tried many other expensive brands, some literally feel like I&apos;m walking in wet sand because of the incredibly high profile and cushion.

        "reviewBody": "These women&apos;s Dawnstrike pants I ordered in the short leg length for my fiancee, who is only about 5&apos; tall. In addition to recently ordering these pants for my fiancee, over the past decade I have ordered 3 of these pants, men&apos;s version, for myself. (The first one finally got a bit raggedy from use and abuse, so I ordered another to replace them, and more recently I lost weight and ordered the next size down.) These same pants used to be called the &quot;Powder Flo,&quot; and for some reason The North Face stopped making them for a couple seasons, so I&apos;m glad they&apos;re now back as the &quot;Dawnstrike.&quot; Simply put, these are the best ski pants on the planet. The durability of the outer layer material, the Gore-Tex membrane, and the large and perfectly placed zippered pockets for everything I normally carry on the slopes is a must for me. It doesn&apos;t make sense to me why most ski pants these days skimp on the pockets, except I guess some people find it&apos;s a more attractive streamlined look, which is really quite foolish considering the benefit most skiers get from having the storage space of 4 reasonably large front-accessible pockets. Of course all of this wouldn&apos;t mean much if these ski pants didn&apos;t fit well, and I can say they fit exceptionally well. Aside from their overall design and construction, the huge benefit with these ski pants are that they are available in 3 different leg lengths. Why aren&apos;t the vast majority of other ski clothing manufacturers doing this? Probably because they assume the consumer to be ignorant and overlook that, I guess. But for me, as I have shorter legs, it&apos;s a huge deal! It was annoying when I used to find myself stepping on the back of the lower cuff of the ski pants I used to have before I discovered these one&apos;s from The North Face. My only wish is that The North Face offered these pants in one or two insulated versions, because they&apos;re more of a shell, although the 3 layers do add some amount of insulating value.",

I&apos;ve had Gore-Tex pants before, and never had this issue. They make it so hard to get it approved by warranty, you have to spend money to send it there, and then they may or may not fix it.

Tent works great and is fairly light but only good for good weather. By the time I went to try and replace it was already out of warranty. \n\nI came on to see if MSR offered a new rainfly as an option to purchase as a replacement. Alas, it doesn&apos;t seem like they do. Over-all would not recommend.",

This is very disappointing and frustrating as we use the tent once or twice per year only. We also got our sleeping bags and gear wet on several occasions, which can quickly ruin a trip. Otherwise the tent is very spacious and easy to assemble.",

After only 4 years the seam tape has completely degraded and the fabric is no longer waterproof. I always take great care of my camping gear and pack it clean and dry. I switched to the MSR Elixir 3 to have a bigger tent for all my gear since I only camp from my vehicle. Trying to decide whether to try a re-waterproof the fly or get a new tent.",

I&apos;m wondering why I couldn&apos;t just zip the Blue layer to the Yellow layer. Then when the temperature is 50* or higher we would use it with the Blue side up, sleeping on the Yellow side. But when the temperature would be down in the 30&apos;s. we could just sleep with the yellow side up and the blue side down. This system would not need the bottom side and would save space for camping or back packing. Is there any reason why this couldn&apos;t be done with the same relative results as is shown using the bottom layer?",

          "Hi Gretchen!  Im so sorry for your experience with this bag!  I would personally not recommend a 15 degree synthetic bag for the conditions you experienced.  A 15 degree rating is essentially the lowest survivable temp for a bag to keep you from getting hypothermic--as opposed to being a comfort rating.  \n\nI&apos;d consider this a versatile, 3 season car camping  bag that can handle the occasional cold night, but that&apos;s not taking into account those of us that may sleep a bit warmer or cooler than average!\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to a Gearhead anytime, we would be very happy to set you up with a free exchange, and even recommend some alternatives for you!"

It is so light weight and I am wearing it on my way to my yoga classes, as it is so easy to fold it into my bag while in class. I really like the fact that it has a lot of pockets and the hidden zippers adds to a smooth look. The shape works really well for me, as I sometimes struggle to find jackets that aren&apos;t straight cut.\nMartina S",

Holds multiple cards, cash, meds, iPhone 14promax, cigarettes, chapsticks, and sunglasses and probably has a little more room. It’s amazing for an everyday bag.

My only disappointment is that it has nothing to attach it to the backpack or something like that. When traveling, this wallet should be accesible at all times and it feels like a huge design flaw that you have to put it in and out of the bag instead of keeping it hanging around while you&apos;re at the airport, running through customs or whatever, and then safely putting it in your bag once you&apos;re in your plane or outside of the airport.

The bibs are quite large around the waist and crouch, but the waist can be cinched up with the internal waist adjustment. The crouch is not as big an issue with snowboard boots on. Overall, they are slightly large for my preferred fit, but they are comfortable nonetheless. Love the entrance of these bibs compared to the side entrance of most bibs. I really appreciate all the pockets, especially the rear pockets as most brands don&apos;t include them on bibs or most snow pants these days. All the pockets are zipper secured which is also great. The hydrastash feature fits seamlessly into the bibs and I hardly notice it&apos;s there. Now maybe I&apos;ll actually hydrate with something other than beer.",

The pot gripper will scratch the inside of the pot, unless you wrap it for storage. A pot handle would have been better. AND.... like many others it seems, after NEARLY doing it twice... I melted the bowl by not noticing and removing it from the pot before firing up the burner. I&apos;m in Australia and it seems like it will an ordeal getting replacement bowl, if possible at all??",

        "reviewBody": "I love this little kit (solo) however I wish that MSR would just add handles to the pot as that would alleviate the need for the pot gripper as it scratches up the pot. It would also alleviate the need for the silicone grip on the pot that eventually slides down anyway. Further, make the bowl orange so that it alerts others to remove the bowl before cooking. It would be nice if you could buy the pieces of this cook set separately in the event of loss or damage otherwise, this is a great system that I really love. It has replaced a few systems that I loved before this. My new go to!",

        "reviewBody": "I give it 2 stars for the light weight and the gripper. Sending back. I was trying to beat out my GSI Minimalist Kit for a very slight weight advantage. I love MSR stoves and have had several of their cook kits over the years so I was surprised to see how poorly designed this item is. I venture to say that anyone that loves this kit has never compared it to the GSI Minimalist Kit. Virtually the same size and weight but so much more functional. Pot versus Pot (GSI is lighter). Lid versus Lid (GSI Lid flips to turn the pot to a drinkable cup...once slipped into the neoprene cozy. MSR pot would burn your lips and the provided cup is only cold rated and would burn your hands). Rubber Rand versus Neoprene Cozy (MSR rand could melt if stove flares up and is so narrow there is only a small safe spot for your fingers. The GSI pot is removed from the stove and placed into a full coverage neoprene cozy the keeps one from burning their hands and functions to keep the contents hot). Metal Pot Grabber versus Neoprene Gripper (MSR wins this one. The GSI gripper is virtually weightless but awkward to use and one could find hot liquid steaming their fingers. The MSR gripper is far more functional). Cup versus Cup (The MSR cup is cheap flexible thin plastic that will roast your hands if it has hot liquid in it. It also kind of disappears when stored on the bottom of the pot and people forget about it and melt it on their stove. GSI does not have a separate cup. The pot double functions as a functional insulated cup when placed into the cozy and when the lid is placed on top. For those that think that MSR wins in this area because of a separate cup, you will be disappointed. What are you going to put in it other than a cool drink? It is basically only a measuring cup. Some might not like that you do not get a separate cup with the GSI. If that is important to you, for what it is worth, the included cup that comes with the GSI Soloist Kit, slides right onto the bottom of the Minimalist pot. When this is done, I believe the difference between the two kits is about 2 ounces). I count ounces but 2 to 3 ounces for a fully functional kit versus one that is fraught with issues is a win for me. All GSI needs to do is create a decent pot grabber and it will be a complete Game, Set, Match. NOTE: Do not buy the GSI stoves. They are junk. MSR wins the stove battle at every level. So, in my opinion, MSR Stoves and GSI Cook Kits.",

Also the weird stitching on the sleeves I’m guessing they did for looks, but it looks odd and it prevents the ability to push the sleeves up.  It’s also uncomfortable.  Also, put it on and walked outside, it was like 50 degrees and windy and the wind went right through it and I was cold.  Not a good product. \n\nI have a few other shirts from SW, and they are all Large.  This Large was a big snug.  And since it was so stiff I wouldn’t have kept it even if it were not itchy.",

The slick upper half wears well, as a layering piece. I bought it in the softer neutral color. She chose it intentionally, to wear with some ivory boots. This is true to size. She wears a medium, and it fit perfectly. This has become her go to, either around the house, or under her Fuego coat, walking the dogs. It was a birthday gift.",

With a pair of long underwear, these pants kept me warm and dry throughout the day.  They are comfortable to hike in and great to glissade in!  They are so versatile, that I plan to add them to my pack on hikes in Virginia, New England, and in Rocky Mountain National Park this summer.",

I can wear them on bluebird/warm days or blizzard/cold days and be comfortable. The level of water proofing is adequate, unless I’m just sitting still they don’t soak through. Zippers and seams are top notch and weather proof. They are also flattering which isn’t necessarily high in the totem pole but who doesn’t like looking fly on the slopes?! I 100% recommend them and hope this very same style stays in production because I don’t ever want another snowboard pant.",

As soon as I got in the water it just flooded like I had nothing on…O’Neill quality has always been good so was surprised; I called and got a return authorization so sent it back but still haven’t gotten a refund, (said they’d give me store credit but haven’t gotten that either)…very disappointed w the whole transaction…should have gone to the manufacturer direct so at least could have filed a warranty claim",

I used to love O&apos;neill wetsuits, but found them to fall apart to easily after they came out with the Zen in the 90&apos;s. \n\nLately, I&apos;ve been almost exclusively wearing Xcel&apos;s upper end suits which are great.  I&apos;ve had Rip Curls, Body Gloves, Hurleys and even a terrible fitting Billabong (Built-em-wrong).  \nI decided to try an O&apos;neill fullsuit again only after hearing and feeling the incredible stretch of their technobutter neoprene.  \nSadly, this super-stretchy suit started to literally unravel between the 2nd and 3rd surf. I kid you not!  I mean my old O&apos;neill Zen zip lost its ability to stay closed in a month or so, based on a horrible Velcro only closure, but this Hyperfreak suit falling apart after 2 surfs was ridiculous!  I didn&apos;t even bother to send it in to O&apos;neill after my experience with their horrendous customer service decades ago and my apathy, since I had  many back up suits. I just went back to my Xcel suits and called it a day.  \nI do plan to pay to have the neck sewn up and will use the suit again to see if I just got a lemon/ or a second quality from Bakcountry, as I wouldn&apos;t put it past them.  Their low price guarantee is anything but...",

I was so excited when they came out with the generation of Clifton because they were the best running shoes I ever had. However, I was disappointed when the clifton 9&apos;s I got in January started getting worn down within a matter of months. This was not normal wear and tear - the bottom of the shoe is tearing off and there are now holes in the fabric on top. I never had this issue with the Clifton 8&apos;s. They are also bulkier and less comfortable than the 8&apos;s. Overall, I wish I could recommend this newer generation of Clifton&apos;s but it seems like I will be looking elsewhere for my marathon training show.",

This is my do everything bike and it has gone through, dry gravel, sand, dusty trails, snow, ice, and puddles and the crankset spins as amazing as it did the day the bottom bracket went in. I was teetering on getting the steel BB, but opted for the ceramic. If you have the extra cash to spend on the ceramic, get it! But Chris King does not make poor products, so whatever you buy from them will be good quality and work as intended.",

I wear these mostly for around town, but they seem perfect for flat pedal gravel biking and for the &lt;7 mile hike. The rigid soles would make my feet tired for longer distances. \r\n\r\nMy feet are narrow and I sized down (a suggested by a different review). I am usually a US 12, these are 45.5. My other hikers are LaSportiva 47, which run small. \r\n\r\nIf you have wide feet these may not be for you.",

For whatever reason this pair was terrible.  The fit was at best odd no matter how I laced it up.  They must have changed the shoe last or did something different in the manufacture.  They were fundamentally unwearable.  Other than that they are great looking and seemingly well put together -- but very disappointing.",

The buckle was challenging to open/close and the there needs to be external drink pockets so that drinks don&apos;t get computer/papers/internal stuff wet.

The 3 way 27 briefcase does everything I hoped it would and more. It’s a large bag that isn’t overly bulky. When it’s full it’s as big as it needs to be and no more, and when it isn’t it scales down without the need for a bunch of compression straps just slim, compact, and lite. I haven’t had the opportunity to travel with it yet but I’m sure that will just make it all the better. As most have said in their reviews I had to add a pad to the shoulder strap (inexpensive leather strap pad from Etsy) as the strap is a bit too sharp for the weight this bag can hold. With the pad it’s perfect so don’t let the strap talk stop you.",

It inhales my laptop, additional travel monitor, menagerie of cordage, headsets, notebooks, water bottles, etc. and hasn&apos;t tapped out yet.  The shoulder strap could be wider as others have called out but I&apos;ve resolved that with a 3rd party shoulder strap pad from a previously owned messenger bag.  The stowable backpack straps are the preferred choice for longer term carry as they are plush and well executed.  11 out of 10, would recommend.  Now if only they would make a clip in padded holster and mag carrier.",

Also, the collar came up very high and kept hitting me in the face, I couldn&apos;t imagine driving in it. I understand it is good when you are all zipped up and need to keep extra warm but for every day the collar was just in the way. Nice jacket, but a few faults for me to keep it.",

The sand colored pair fits good on the left foot only, just like the black pair, but the right shoe is considerably smaller/more narrow! It literally crushes my foot/toes due to how tight and narrow it is compared to the other shoes. They both say size 9. Buyer beware, you may receive an inconsistent product. I don&apos;t think I could break in the right shoe even if I tried.",

        "reviewBody": "Purchased two of these…so my size could grow from one into the next and this could be a lengthier time study with a goretex toddler hiking boot - something rather scarce in the market place compared to adults. \r\n\r\nOverall, very happy with the boots. The first set of boots which were used as his camp shoes prior to and during a 95 mile rafting trip in Eastern Oregon with environmental conditions including hail, rain and the glorious sun, are still sending it hard. \r\n\r\nI’ve checked several times on the waterproofing of these boots because my son likes to jump into puddles and shallow water despite my requests not to. Thus, giving ample opportunity to pull the boots off and check to see how well the goretex is doing. And it is holding well, comparable to my Lowa, Arc Tryx, and Vasque goretex waterproofness.\r\n\r\nLightweight compared to waterproof boots available to toddlers. Not a lot of goretex options in this category so what is available is generally much heavier than these boots. So, it also makes for a better all around boot for going out on rainy days around the yard, for a walk or to the park. Less “clunky” and thus, less concerns for catching or tripping compared to say my toddler’s Boggs or rain boots.",

        "reviewBody": "I have used this on two trips for a total of 4 days.  So take my review under that consideration.  Overall, the temp rating  on this one is pretty inaccurate.  It is nowhere near a 0 degree bag.  I&apos;d optimistically give it a +15 rating myself.  I&apos;ve gotten pretty cold in it and all nights I&apos;ve used it in were in the high teens to low 20&apos;s fahrenheit.  Fit in the shoulders also seems to be the tightest of any bag I&apos;ve ever owned.  Even though the specs indicate its middle of the road...  The price is super compelling, the construction is good and I like the color.",

Kept everything dry in rough seas and for wet landings. Holds alot but can be closed down to fit under an airline seat if needed. Laptop sleeve is a real plus to get through airport security. Still looks like new after bouncing around the deck of a zodiac and laying in the sand. Definitely waterproof when sealed as directed. Probably floats but I did not test that.",

It&apos;s really comfortable, holds a lot of gear (plus my laptop!), and keeps everything dry. 4 Stars because one of the zippers on an exterior pocket came off shortly after I bought it. I put it back on without issue, but it looks like there&apos;s no zipper stop on that particular zipper so I need to be careful it doesn&apos;t come off again. Seems like a manufacturing mistake, and it&apos;s not a deal breaker, but check your zippers before you use your pack!",

Easy tighten waist. \n\nThis pair will be my goto cold weather pant to a point. The North Face Summit pants will take over where the WM pants leave off.",

If conditions get freezing you can have them on in minutes and no need to remove your gloves. They are always in my pack now whenever I go on winter hikes as they compress down to nothing and weigh like air. \n\nOne issue though, or perhaps a warning. I put these on the other day on the summit as it was -10. I had crampon on and decided to move down the hill before taking them off. The crampons ripped a hole the second they came into contact with the fabric. I guess some studier fabric on the inside cuff would have been a nice touch, but then again it would have added to the weight. \n\nI put the cuffs over boots, with a bib gaiter and did not find the cuffs too tight which other reviewers have raised as an issue. Perhaps this bug was fixed.",

The fit and feel of chamois, liner and outer were all great. The bib straps have to be the most silky smooth straps I’ve ever felt. Yes I know how that sounds but I tell you I was actually shocked on how soft they felt and performed well too. \nAt just shy of 6’ and 210lbs sizing can be all over the place but the large fit perfectly.",

With used with the Mega Light there are some tricks to staking it out so that the netting does not get wet with condensation over night and can be packed dry from underneath. Keep some tension on the tie outs and use a rock or small stick to ensure that the Bug basin/netting tie outs are at ground level and that the tent tie outs are at the top of the stake (separated by about 6 cm). This will make sense the first time you pitch the tent.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this because during the summertime I prefer a looser fitting tech t-shirt over a jersey, and needed to make up for the lack of pocket space. This bag is nice and sturdy, and doesn&apos;t wobble on the frame. \n\nI only have a single 1/4 inch spacer underneath my stem and had no issues with the front buckle. I haven&apos;t had any issues with my knees hitting the bag as I&apos;m pedaling either, but there is some very slight rubbing if I&apos;m climbing out of the seat. \n\nThe bag is large enough to fit two inner tubes, phone, ID/credit card, a gel, a couple of fig newtons, and some beef jerky. If you put your extra tubes in a saddle pack though you could fit more snacks. The way the zipper is positioned you could also carry a portable charger and run a cord to your bike computer. It&apos;s awesome to have your stuff right there in front of you, instead of having to blindly fumble with jersey pockets or try and pull something out of your saddle bag on the go. \n\nI haven&apos;t had this long enough to comment on whether it&apos;s going to mar the frame long-term, but the lack of wobbling leads me to believe no. There&apos;s also a felt piece where the front bottom corner contacts the frame/headset that&apos;s intended to prevent any scratches or paint rubbing.",

This shirt with the extra pockets near the waste is amazing.  Easy click buttons are nice, BUT, they have unspaped a few times if the shirt gets caught on something.  I suppose I would rather have the shirt buttons un-latch than have the shirt itself tear.  It&apos;s also nice that the UPF is strong.  Another complaint is that is holds wrickles a bit well.  However, all n all, it&apos;s a great shirt o highly recommend.",

No need to buy hyperlight for low weight backpacking, this kelty bag is low weight and a great low price! I fit an MSR elixir 1p tent and a Nemo 20° bag in this pack. If you buy a trekking pole tent and a quilt it would fit even better.",

        "reviewBody": "Probably a great pack for day hikes, and possibly an overnight, but too many design flaws that hinder functionality...\n- Main compartment has steep taper that limits use of bottom of pack\n- Inside sleeve only useful for hydration bladder; will not work with laptop\n- Front pocket is just a pouch with an opening just big enough for hand to pass through; no organization ability\n- Side zipper pockets are either too small or too large\n- Bottom side pouches will only work with small bottles, or as ?stop? for something like trekking poles; quart/liter canteen or bottle will fit, but side pockets above interfere with access\n- Bungee cord on front will catch easily on external objects (branches, car seat lever, etc)\nSo, what?s good about it...?  Lightweight with good padding and fabrics; good fit to the back for those with large arm movement.\nThe bottom line is that it will likely be best only for those using a hydration bladder, and gear for an overnight outdoors, but definitely not suited for those who are looking for a versatile pack that can work with City to Trail use.",

It always amazes me when a new build comes to life and the Di2 works exactly as it should, first time, every time.  And, I&apos;m impressed how they continue working through crashes and tough conditions.  Using the Shimano tool for insertion results in the same &quot;click&quot; every time.  The cumulative cost of seven of these wires is significant, but I&apos;ve only had to pay it once.",

        "reviewBody": "I love this jacket! I have been wanting to replace my bulky old down jacket for quite some time.\nI need water/wind proof with sealed seems and insulation and this jacket fit the bill! It even has features I did not even know I wanted-HA! Like a hood that can accommodate a helmet, underarm zippers to disperse heat, wrist &amp; waist guards designed to keep snow out. The feature that really got me was a small, invisible tracking device to help rescue workers locate you. could come in handy next time I miss the last gondola down lol. I especially love the color-very different from what I&apos;ve seen out there! I am 5&apos;4&apos;&apos; 112 pounds and ordered an XS. It fit but I like to layer up and it felt somewhat constricted across the chest. I returned it for a S and it fits perfectly. Which brings me to Backcountry. I was worried about purchasing online. What if it was a hassle to return if the size was off? Nope. Returning was effortless &amp; a quick turnaround for the proper size. There was a nominal return fee but the jacket went on sale in the interim! Backcountry has far the most (in my opinion) selection of apparel from different companies both online and in person stores and you. can&apos;t beat the prices &amp; save sales. Backcountry will be my go to from now on. I have already ordered more things for my upcoming ski trip and will continue to shop here in the future! Mountain Hardware makes a great jacket&amp; Backcountry is a great place to shop!",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been looking for an inexpensive but functional jacket for a few years. The Maven Jacket was the answer. I was skeptical about the size - M - because I am a seasoned woman with seasoned hips, and didn&apos;t want to go up a size and have arm length issues. But the fit is good, though I haven&apos;t tried the jacket with my ski pants or the layers for upper body. I like the armpit fit and its nice to have arm zippers for cooling down. The sleeves have a snug fit over the wrist that will help keep my body heat whether I wear long ski gloves or not. The only thing I would have liked more is to have a removable hood. I bought the jacket before the ski season so I can&apos;t say how it works in the snow. However, my major concerns about fit and function get 4.5 stars",

I couldn&apos;t wait for them to come in....then they did, and I put them on...and almost immediately something in my knees felt funny. So I took them off and waited for the lock laces and it wasn&apos;t so bad...thinking they were maybe too tight and using the wrong socks. They feel really RIGID. Yesterday, I took the longest walk and I could not wait to get home, and I wanted to chop my left foot off because it hurt so bad. This morning, I put my Biondis on and all is well again...wow. Too late to return and it really sucks because I love the new color combo, but I just can&apos;t wear these any more.",

I&apos;m a creature of comfort so I added an insole and that just topped of the feel of these boots.. The boa system works well. I&apos;m looking forward to hopefully seeing a double boa system for aladded ancle support. They work great in deep snowy conditions. Once they have broken in, they seem to be getting even more comfortable. I give these boots a 8 out of ten.",

        "reviewBody": "I was overdue for a new liner but have procrastinated this purchase since, frankly, there are things that are much more exciting to spend money on than padded underpants. But I wanted to get this right so I did my research and narrowed my search to 3 candidates: the Terry Aria, Zoic Essential, and POC Essential Short liners. In case you’re at a similar crossroads, I’ll share my impressions and which liner I ultimately chose.\n\nI’m a fit 5’6” woman, ~130 lbs, mid-30’s, with the sturdy upper legs and saddle of a mountain biker. I’m a little more padded than I’d like to be, but petite by most standards. I’m typically a XS/2/26 in street clothes, though after reading reviews claiming that all 3 of these liners ran small, I ultimately ordered a small in the Terry and Zoic shorts and a medium in the POCs. Note that this turned out to be the correct size for me in each short. Here’s how my head-to-head comparison shook out.\n\nPOC Essential Liner:\nHands down, these had the best chamois of the bunch. Dense but not bulky padding with a natural shape. I also liked the fabric of the shorts themselves. As promised, it did offer light compression. The shorts were well-shaped and felt like they wouldn’t need to be tugged up all the time. This is the only short of the 3 that has silicone leg grips, if that matters to you. But that is unfortunately where the virtues of these shorts ended. The length and band construction was an unequivocal dealbreaker. With a 2.5-3 inch inseam, the legbands squeezed my thighs at the widest point. And not just a little squeeze…I have never worn a garment that made me feel more grotesquely corpulent. If only these had a longer (7-9 inch) inseam and a wider leg band, I really think my search for the perfect liner would have been over. That said, if you have zero body fat or pin-straight legs, these could be your match…just go up 2 sizes from your street size!\n\nZoic Essential Liner:\nI had high hopes for these given many positive reviews online, but found them unimpressive across the board. The fit was okay, though they are low in front. The chamois was the second densest of the 3 options and seemed like it would be comfortable. The inseam was moderate at around 5-6 inches. The biggest turnoff was the unexpectedly thin fabric that lacked integrity, sort of like a kid’s unlined Lycra swimsuit. There is a band of elastic encased in this material at the top of the yoga-pant-style waist, but it felt strangely rigid in comparison to the thin material. Similarly, the leg band was so much thicker and stronger that the shorts that it created uncomfortable bulging above and below the band. I couldn’t see this fabric standing up well to tugging, heat, sweat, friction, and frequent motion, but if the fit sounds like it could work for your leg shape, it might be worth a look.\n\nTerry Aria Liner: (spoiler: winners!)\nOut of the ba, these are the least attractive of the 3 with a high waist, old-school elastic band at the top, perforations all over, and lace bands. You have to pull them on kind of like nylons, by gathering the fabric in your hands, so I was shocked when they slid on like a glove and just felt instantly good everywhere. The chamois is less dense than the other contenders, and I suspect is optimized for road/commuting use, but it’s a quality Italian product with some density over the sit bones and is flexible and breathable. When doing big rides, I haven’t noticed any more soreness than I had in my old, thicker chamois. The shorts slid under my baggies compliantly and don’t slip down or stretch out on the trail. I was concerned the lace bands would be inadequate to hold the legs in place without any silicone grip, but I was wrong. They stay put as well as my old silicone grips plus they’re incredibly comfortable, with no binding or constricted feeling. I’m a fan of the longer inseam. The shorts are very breathable, hold their shape, and hug your curves. They won’t win fashion points but I’m a happy rider!",

A bit tight and low around the waist, I wish they were a higher rise, and tight around my quads.\nWent out on an hour long ride , they were fine, did the job. Not as much padding as I would like for mountain biking, especially on the sits bones. I&apos;ll probably just keep these for road biking as they are a little shorter than my other patagonia chamois and better under a 5&quot; short. Overall, fine for what they are, I just prefer more padding and a higher waistband",

The liner is comfortable and stays in place. I have lost some weight so I need to size down. When I first bought the liners I was 150 lbs, 5&apos;3&quot; and size medium was perfect. I have to agree that I love the wide waistband; it feels more like yoga pants. I am still a newbie and haven&apos;t tried many other brands but these beat the heck out of Pearl Izumi&apos;s Escape Sugar shorts I bought (also a budget friendly liner but padding is an awful fleecy material).",
