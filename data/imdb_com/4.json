I&apos;m not a huge Robert De Niro fan as every time i see him act, i just think to myself that he Robert De Niro trying to be somebody. This is not the case in mean Streets for me. Instead he plays a kid who is young and stupid named Johnny boy. His performance is brilliant and is most likely one of his best. Keitel plays Charlie who looks out for Johhny. The opening line of the film basically tells you everything you would want to know about Charlie.\n\nThe film is gritty and shot in a documentary style with several tracking shots being carried out hand held. It takes the film 45 minutes to give you a clear plot and a clear understanding on what going to unfold. The last 20 minutes is directed perfectly with a palpable sense of suspense and is clearly the best ending you can give to this film. One negative would be that in the first half there literally no set pieces . Not a lot happens but saying this you get a clear understanding and fully engaged with the characters which makes the last 20 minutes outstanding.\n\nIt not the best film that Scorese has ever made but it clear by watching this that Mean Streets was his main starting point to his successful career",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t expect explosions, aliens or CGI of any sort. It isn&apos;t even too plot driven and none of the twists are too surprising. What is surprising are the sophisticated cinematic techniques that create a film reminiscent of Altman, Aldridge or Hal Hartley. Background conversations, radio broadcasts, meticulously constructed sets, and a naturalistic, somewhat flat acting style create a palpable world with believable characters. All sorts of objects turn out to have significance and there is a door that practically becomes a character. All sorts of weird stuff turns out to have reasonable explanations by the end. Like the similar film &quot;Advantageous&quot; it explores themes of courage, honor and love. \n\nThe recent news story about the nuclear weapon systems being run by ancient code had me remembering my days programming for Lockheed in the &apos;80&apos;s and this film gets that world. When one of the characters talks about going to a city in the desert where you could make a lot of money, I thought he meant relocating his company to Austin, but that turns out to be where the director was born and this was filmed. It was tapped to be the new silicon Valley during the Reagan administration, and, according to this movie, the dress code didn&apos;t change much.",

      "reviewBody": "Finally, Adam Sandler is rising up from the perpetual spiral of semi-interesting movies he has been riding for the past years. Sure, the movie &quot;Just Go With It&quot; looks disturbingly similar to &quot;50 First Dates&quot; when you look on the cover, but they are two completely different movies altogether.\n\nThe story told in &quot;Just Go With It&quot; is fairly sassy and Hollywoodish; a classical lovely story of sorts. Danny (played by Adam Sandler) falls in love with Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker). They go away to Hawaii with Danny&apos;s assistant Katherine (played by Jennifer Aniston) and his friend Eddie (played by Nick Swardson). And the story rolls as the little white lies escalate and grow larger and larger. I am not going on with more of the story here, but being a &apos;straight off the Hollywood romantic comedy assembly line&apos;, then there is no surprise to how the movie ends. You know it straight from the minute the movie starts. But still, the movie is quite enjoyable. Although stereotypical, then the story is a good one, and you quickly get into it.\n\nThere are some really good characters in the movie, aside from the four main characters. I especially liked the plastic surgery enhanced people at the party in the beginning of the movie. They were hilarious, and drew lots of laughs.\n\nThe location of the movie, in Hawaii, really adds a romantic aspect to the movie, and it works out really, really well. You can almost feel the sand between your toes and feel the waves as they crash gently against your shins. Thumbs up on making the feel of the movie stand out this much.\n\nThere is a really good chemistry between Aniston and Sandler, and they really brought the story to life and they were in their aces in this movie.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I had expected it to be another of Sandler&apos;s mass-produced half-funny comedies. So if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of either (or both) Sandler or/and Aniston, then &quot;Just Go With It&quot; is definitely worth checking out. The movie has some wonderful moments, it will make you laugh and it will make your heart all warm and fuzzy.\n\nThumbs up, and welcome back Sandler...",

I purchased the UNCUT Japan release thinking I was going to see some cool Italian splatter. Boy was I disappointed! The acting of course is bad (It&apos;s ITALIAN after all) and the movie pretty much all takes place in a cavern-like place. As far as Italian cinema goes, there are plenty of better and more violent horror/sci-fi pictures than this, including SHOCKING DARK and CONTAMINATION. I would seek those out instead of this piece of trash.\n\nRating: 3/10 because of some LAME but bloody not-so-special F/x."

      "name": "Good sequel with the young newlywed couple , being well written/played/directed by Fernando Fernan Gomez",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Life Around us&quot; or &quot;La Vida Alrededor&quot; deals with Antonio : Fernando FernÃ¡ndez GÃ³mez and Josefina : Analia Gade . Once finished their careers Law and Medicine respectively , the newlyweds attempt to work resulting in fateful consequences . Along the way they become involved in a large number of outlandish situations , and these happenings to be complicated since Josefina gives birth a baby . Meantime , things go wrong , as Antonio gets some poor cases with lousy clients, all of them delinquents with no money : Manolo Moran, Francisco Camoiras , Xan Das Bolas .\n\nThis is the sequel to &quot;La Vida Por Delante&quot; 1958, it is a fun comedy but inferior than the previous entry . Following the surprising misadventures , incidents, misfortunes and several events of this peculiar couple. It is a charming comedy of exquisite manners , filled with critical spirit and observation, concerning the huge dificultades a marriage suffers throughout the process to create a family , but narrated and developed in diverting and hilarious style . Well-directed with great sense of humor as well as sparkling and witty dialogue , delivering a fairly reliable analysis to show the society of the Fifties . All this is competently told , with extremely comical scenes , absurd situations , though it relies heavily on the trial scenes . Also noteworthy are the soliloquies of the offbeat characters, which face to face with the audience to tell their confidences . Starring duo , Fernando Fernan GÃ³mez , Analia Gade , are pretty good, giving nice and sympathetic interpretations . They are finely accompanied by an attractive plethora of Spanish secondaries , full of familiar faces, such as : Manolo Moran , Xan Das Bolas , Felix Fernandez , Joaquin Roa, Francisco Bernal, Erasmo Pascual, Maria Luisa Ponte, AgustÃ­n GonzÃ¡lez, Angel Ãlvarez, Maite Blasco, Felix De Pomes , Carmen De Lirio, JimÃ©nez Escribano, JosÃ© Manuel MartÃ­n, JosÃ© Maria Tasso, JosÃ© Riesgo and Rafaela Aparicio in his regular role as a servant.\n\nThe movie is well set in the Fifties , compellingly photographed by the prestigious cameraman Alfredo Fraile , shot on location , Madrid , though a perfect remastering being really necessary . The picture was nicely played , written, produced , directed by Fernando Fernan GÃ³mez. Fernando appeared in more than 200 films , directed around 20 and wrote novels , plays and poetry . After his debut in &quot;Manicomio&quot; , directed &quot;La Vida por Delante&quot; 1958 and in 1959 this follow-up &quot;La Vida Alrededor&quot; . He is the only person to be nominated as actor : El Abuelo, director : El Viaje a Ninguna Parte and writer : Lazaro de Tormes for three different films in the Goya Awards . He actually won in every category at least once . This prolific and notorious actor also directed a few films such as : Fuera de Juego, Lazaro de Tormes , Mambru se fue a la Guerra , 5 Tenedores , 5000 Dias Juntos, Ninette , Venganza de Don Mendo. These are fine movies but still far from the levels of talent would reach as a director with works as El Mundo Sigue , Bruja mÃ¡s que Bruja , El ExtraÃ±o viaje , and his greatest hit : Viaje a Ninguna Parte. His important career as a filmmaker has been little appreciated by the ordinary public , being more known for his performances at the orders of other directors . Fernando was one of the most complete Spanish Cinema artists and a member of the Spanish Royal Academy and one of the best actors of Spanish Cinema . La Vida Alrededor Rating : 6.5/10. The picture will appeal to Spanish comedy enthusiasts and Fernando Fernan GÃ³mez fans .",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d heard about Night Warning, I was fortunate enough to see it at a weird-film society showing, and I finally found it sitting in a bin in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThere&apos;s one problem with the film, and we might as well deal with it up front.  Director William Asher tries hard, but he&apos;s got a TV sensibility trying to cope with one of the nastiest scripts ever written and two of the wickedest performances ever turned in by SAG members.  In the hands of a master, this thing&apos;d still be playing at midnight showings all over the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThat aside, Susan Tyrrell&apos;s performance alone is worth the price of admission.  Bo Svenson&apos;s performance alone is worth the price of admission. Julia Duffy&apos;s charming, unwrapped little mams together are worth the price of admission.  Even Jimmy McNichol doesn&apos;t embarrass himself - no, he doesn&apos;t, watch it again, he&apos;s supposed to be a goofy, horny teenager in suburban/rural Arizona, not a sensitive coffee-house habitue, for godsake.\n\n Let&apos;s go back to Susan Tyrrell.  She puts on a clinic for actresses who want to know what &quot;over the top&quot; consitutes.  When she flips out - lordie.  All I&apos;ll say is that at approximately 1:15 into the movie, when she reacts to Julia Duffy breaking out a window, she makes a move with her head that&apos;s the single scariest thing I&apos;ve ever seen an actor do on film, ever, anywhere, period.  (And I&apos;ve seen Jim Carrey trying to be sincere, thank you.)\n\nAnd Bo Svenson is evil on skates.  The script doesn&apos;t give him that much to work with, but he rolls right over that little obstacle.  WHY does he rant, &quot;I want those deviants off the streets!&quot;  Who knows, who cares?  There&apos;s a story out on the Net that he was a royal pain on the set, and I could easily believe that this was a case of him getting to say things he&apos;s always wanted to say in public, and get paid for it.\n\nFind this gem at any price.  Know it.  Live it.",

The plot is enigmatic and twisty but has some holes, and it won&apos;t fool anyone who&apos;s previously seen &quot;Shattered&quot; (or &quot;Gaslight&quot;, for that matter). But Duvivier&apos;s innovative direction makes this a surprisingly undated thriller. Alain Delon gives one of his liveliest performances...and who could forget to mention Senta Berger&apos;s terrific body? (***)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a sucker for a good heist film, and three of the best I&apos;ve ever seen were made around 1955/56 - &apos;Rififi&apos;, &apos;Bob le flambeur&apos; and &apos;The Killing&apos;. Now they are still three of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, but now that I&apos;ve finally seen &apos;The Asphalt Jungle&apos; it&apos;s obvious what source those movies were drawing on! Not that I&apos;m saying they&apos;re rip offs, they&apos;re not, but they are kind of three (excellent) variations on Huston&apos;s theme. &apos;The Asphalt Jungle&apos; must therefore be seen as the most influential crime movie of the modern era, and the blueprint for every subsequent caper movie (&apos;The Anderson Tapes&apos;, &apos;Thief&apos;, &apos;Reservoir Dogs&apos;, &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos;, &apos;The Score&apos;,etc.etc.) This superb film noir is almost impossible to fault. The script is first rate, John Huston&apos;s direction is inspired, Sterling Hayden - possibly America&apos;s most underrated actor - is fantastic as troubled ex-con Dix Handley, and the ensemble cast are all excellent, especially James Whitmore (&apos;Them!&apos;), Louis Calhern (&apos;Notorious&apos;), Sam Jaffe (&apos;The Day The Earth Stood Still&apos;) and John McIntire (&apos;Psycho&apos;). The early role for Marilyn Monroe made a strong impact on a lot of people, but I was even more impressed by Jean Hagen as Doll. She is unforgettable and her scenes with Hayden are wonderful. Why did she never become a major star? This is a crime classic and brilliant entertainment. Highly recommended!"

The humour however, is timeless and offers a few laughs in a harmless non-provocative manner.\n\nThe story revolves around a Danish man and his young wife, her friend who is a feminist author and the author&apos;s slightly overweight cousin. After a quarrel, the young wife decides to go on a trip with her friend and her friend&apos;s cousin, to get back at her husband. The husband desperately tries to find her, aided by a strange friend, while constantly evading the aggressive mother-in-law.\n\nI recommend this to anyone interested in cultural/historical aspects of the mid-1930&apos;s, presented with a bit of humour and some romance.",

      "name": "Slightly Softened from Cain&apos;s 1930&apos;s Novel but Still Holds Its Own as a Noir Classic",
      "reviewBody": "The original book published in 1934 by James M. Cain (author of &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;) was a gritty unsentimental story of a low-class drifter and bum, Frank, who is taken in by a German immigrant, Nick, who owns a roadside cafÃ© and his beautiful wife, Cora, who turns out to be much darker on the inside than the facade of her pure white skin. Cora, we learn, is dissatisfied with her life married to this older immigrant and the drifter becomes her catalyst to change her situation. The movie adaption of twelve years later is a slightly sentimentalized version of Cain&apos;s noir classic. That said, the movie still holds its own as a noir tale of betrayal and murder, but doesn&apos;t quite have the edge of Billy Wilder&apos;s adaption of &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;.\n\nStill, the movie works very well under its own terms, particularly because of the outstanding chemistry between the leads John Garfield and Lana Turner. In fact, the star of the show is really Turner who turns in a tour-de-force performance. Turner continually shows us the many faces of her character Cora Smith who is sometimes weak and vulnerable and other times resolute and stubborn, even unsympathetic, and yet oozing with unrealized sexuality. We gather that Cora is no ordinary woman, or at least not the soft sentimental Doris Day type. More like a cross between Eva Peron and Madonna. Sometimes hard and mean and other times sweet and feminine, she is the complex epitome of the Cain femme fatale of this era. She remains enigmatic from beginning to end which is I think what Cain would have wanted. Garfield, in probably the role of his career, is equally superb, at first rejecting the murder scheme and then later embracing it. Although lacking the enigmatic complexity of Cora, Frank is equally ambiguous and ambivalent to his life choices, and Garfield well conveys the multi-sidedness of Frank.\n\nThe story concerns a young man looking for work, finds a roadside cafÃ© up a few hours north of Los Angeles, probably up the 101 freeway, and becomes the hired help. He is employed by Nick, a simple German-stock older-than-middle-age man, who simply wants to make enough money to be comfortable and occasionally play his little guitar. His wife, Cora, is about 40 years younger and wants to make something of their cafÃ© instead of just eking out a meager living. But fleeing with Nick and beginning from ground zero is not what she wants. She would like to have the cafÃ© and make something of it. And when the hired help Frank falls for her, she realizes he is the perfect means to get both of them out of their hellish existence.\n\nA fine example of 1940&apos;s film noir with many of the stylistic considerations, such as the camera panning from feet-to-face when we first meet the woman Cora, the many unexpected twists and turns, and of course the dark desires of the leads. Every series of scenes leaves you guessing as to what will happen next. A couple of scenes were contrived that were superfluous to the book. Unfortunately, the film suffers slightly because of the stringent ethics codes that started to be imposed on films of that time. Probably film noir offerings suffered more than most because of their probing the darker sides of human nature. However, Postman still ranks as classic film noir.",

      "reviewBody": "Lately, I NEVER buy these direct to DVD, factory-produced, pandering Scooby titles that get distributed to dumbed-down drooling kids at Wal-Mart. I was totally finished when I watched...*shudders*...&quot;Aloha, Scooby Doo&quot; a few years back. I could name a few other titles in a LONG run of BAD Scooby Doo features, but I digress. I don&apos;t know what possessed me, but I bought &quot;Scooby Doo: Abracadabra Doo&quot; at Wal-Mart tonight. I and my friend watched it expecting a sub-par experience. First, let me say...IT HAD A FREAKING CREDIT SEQUENCE WITH AN ENTIRELY NEW THEME SONG THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF THE GOOFY 70&apos;s POP FLUFF THAT PLAYED IN THE ORIGINAL SHOW!!! Then, if that weren&apos;t enough to catch my attention, they brought the character style all the way back to the 70&apos;s, by leaving NO whites in their eyes and choosing to richly shadow and detail their appearance. There was a wealth of camera angles, zoom shots, and random motion keeping your attention constantly. The backgrounds were extremely detailed. And there were many references to previous Scooby images or incarnations. \n\nAs for the plot, dialogue, and character development...A giant leap in the right direction! The plot could have stood a little bit of work, but suspense and gorgeous animation make up for this. Character development between the Mystery 5 was brought to new depths and Scooby himself was even included in this. I also appreciated the knowing jabs that Shaggy made about &quot;those meddling kids&quot;. I loved the inclusion of the smart-aleck GPS. It was just the modern boost that the Mystery Machine needed. The choice to have Andrea Romano of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; fame do the voice casting was excellent. Matthew Lillard did a fine job voicing Shaggy and Frank Welker was great as Scooby Doo. \n\nOverall, this is just the shot in the arm that the Scooby industry needed. This cartoon has plenty of atmosphere, depth, and slick animation to hold up for many years...long after &quot;Aloha&quot;, &quot;Lochness Monster&quot;, &quot;Goblin King&quot;, &quot;Chill Out&quot;, and &quot;Samurai Sword&quot; have mercifully passed from our memory. Maybe next time...we can get an outing that is boldly dark and creepy...with real ghosts again. Great effort Warner Premiere. Keep up the good work.",

It&apos;s not polite to mock us.&quot; Pause. &quot;It&apos;s not polite.&quot; Although this war story seems often to be a bargain basement version of Kelly&apos;s Heroes, it has its moments. Another moment comes when the bank director&apos;s wife, observing her husband for the last time, gets a chance to make one really mean comment that is a play on words. Those moments do not include the cheap explosions that do no damage to the Tunisian town set where most of the action takes place in. Les Morfalous is the last of seven (by my count in IMDb) pairings of Belmondo and director Henri Verneuil. Belmondo in this movie seems as spry as ever, fighting, running and chewing the scenery. But age was catching up to him, which shows in close ups. Verneuil, a great action director, decided to end his career, after this movie, by making a series of dramatic movies about the Turkish genocide of the Armenians during World War One. I think he made the right decision, by ending his career making movies he cared about. Les Morfalous is a star vehicle that lacks the usual production gloss of Belmondo&apos;s movies in the 60s and 70s. The version I saw on the NYC CUNY Channel had subtitles but the print was grainy and washed out. Even a great print could not hide this movie&apos;s flaws: cheap action, choppy editing and too many dull characters. Belmondo is fine, the actor who plays the German officer is fine, the bank director&apos;s wife is very good looking and on target when she lists the mistakes Belmondo&apos;s sergeant made. In the end, Les Morafalous is a tired movie with too small a budget and not enough interesting action for a war movie.",

I will say that Nils Malmros did a formidable job and thereÂ´s no faulting his research and story telling (Malmros is a doctor as well as a film maker and he did a tenure at the National Hospital in Thorshavn so he could make the research for this film). I like the film a lot, but must point out a couple of weak points: Namely the two male love interests, Lars SimonsenÂ´s Hr. Poul and Peter ReichardtÂ´s Andreas Heyde. They are both weak characters and itÂ´s not believeable that a woman like Barbara (brilliantly played by Anneke von der Lippe) should fall for either of them. The film is very faithful to the book and the scenery is breathtaking, but the key players lets the film down. 7 stars out of 10."

Italian and German advance units raced toward Alejandria . Mussolini had given explicit orders : The Italians must arrive first ! . In this one , the Italians and Germans, united in a difficult Alliance , fight the British in the North Afican desert . The Italians are the good guys and the British are the bad guys , including a point blank execution of prisoners . The protagonists are two brothers , a tough lieutenant (Frederick Stafford) and a sergeant (Enrico Maria Salerno) fighting the British military . Furthermore, a brave English lieutenant (George Hilton) and , of course , Erwin Rommel (Robert Hossein) and General Montgomery (Michael Wilding) . Montgomery&apos;s Iron Back 8th Army ... Rommel&apos;s Crack Africa Korps ... they met head on and tore the earth apart !&apos;\n\nThis movie gets lots of action , crossfire , gunplay and explosion . All-star-cast formed by known European actors give decent interpretations . It displays several extras and tanks , in fact , the production wishes thanks the Italian Ministry of defense and the Italian Army general staff for their collaboration in making this film .\n\nThe picture is based on the real battles , the true events were the following : Alamein in WWII are two decisive battles in the western desert , north Egypt , in 1942 resulting in British victory over Axis forces under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel : 1- 27 July 1942 the British 8th Army under General Sir Claude Auchinleck held off the German and Italian forces . Neither side can be said to have won , but the British had the strategic advantage of short supply lines and so could reinforce faster than Germans . 23 Oct-4 Nov 1942 General Bernard Montgomery launched a diversionary British attack in the south , aiming to draw Axis forces into the area so that the main attack in the north could cut two corridors through the extensive minefields , enabling British armoured divisions to pass through and exploit the gaps . Progress was slow however and Montgomery decided to change tactics to fight what he called a &apos;crumbling battle&apos; constantly switching the main emphasis to chip away at Rommel&apos;s front line and keep him guessing. Australian Division attacked along the coastal road , drawing the Axis forces toward them . Montgomery promptly launched a fresh attack further south, forcing the German armour to react in what became a major tank battle . By 3 Nov Rommel had only 30 serviceable tanks in action and on the next day began organizing his withdrawal. He was able to disengage and escape as the British were hampered by heavy rain and shortage fuel .",

Is it deservedly lesser-known? Well, I suppose it would be hard to compete with Stuart Gordon&apos;s work. But the Empire years were still the best work Charlie Band ever had his hand in.\n\nWe have Adam Ant as &quot;Diablo&quot; and horror veteran Bill Butler also appears. And, like many Empire and Full Moon films, we have the entire thing shot on location at Band&apos;s Italian castle. We have a sort of &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; theme going -- locked in a mysterious location, hoping to get rich (if they survive).\n\nI enjoyed this one. I saw another review call it a snoozer, but I thought it had a good pace (&quot;Puppet Master&quot; is slower). And it is decently bloody with fair effects. Director Rafal Zielinski deserves more recognition than he gets.",

      "reviewBody": "Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Harry, an Englishman with a sadly shady past who has re- invented himself in Panama as the best tailor in the country, making clothes for the rich and politically powerful. Into his world comes Osnard, played by Pierce Brosnan. A morally corrupt, self-serving MI6 spy, sent to Panama as a last chance after seducing a Euro diplomats wife. \n\nMany were bowled over by the irony of casting Brosnan, so associated with James Bond, as this much realer, creepier Bond alter ego. A man who is handsome, and self-confident, but whose endless seduction of women seems smarmy not sexy, and who delights in screwing other people while profiting himself. \n\nFor me the casting was actually problematic. Brosnon&apos;s terrific, but the irony is so distractingly obvious, that it pulled me out of the story, and made me think too much about film and our hero images instead of simply accepting the character. Beyond that, Osnard is drawn a little too broadly for my taste. He&apos;s so transparent, I have a hard time he gets anyone to trust him even for a moment. If his inner self-serving pig were a bit better hidden, it might have given the audience more to unravel, and make other characters&apos; willingness to do his bidding a bit easier to buy. \n\nThe mix of tones also was a bit of a misfire for me. Never quite darkly funny enough to ascend into true satire, but certainly never edgy enough to be taken seriously, there&apos;s a lack of danger here. Unlike &apos;Dr. Strangelove&apos;, we never really think Harry and Osnard&apos;s games will reduce Panama to a pile of rubble, and the intimation of it seems false and a bit silly. \n\nYet, all that complaining is because the movie is good enough, smart enough, brave enough and entertaining enough that I felt frustrated it didn&apos;t quite work as brilliantly as is should. But I&apos;d certainly still recommend it, in spite of my long winded misgivings, and I&apos;m also willing to give it another look.",

      "reviewBody": "I had to laugh or else I&apos;d cry Â and not because a bus full of school children died.  \n\nI honestly can&apos;t imagine anyone being moved by this film.  It is too distant to be involving, too vague to be meaningful, too slow to be engaging and too cold to be emotional.  But boy, oh boy, is it funny.\n\nThe dialogue is so odd and unnatural that it becomes comical. Note the stagy way in which the detective&apos;s daughter talks.  `Welcome to hard times, DADDY&apos;, `I like it when you don&apos;t believe me DADDY.&apos; Come on, playing a drug addict is easy Â just watch Courtney Love and imitate. Zoe doesn&apos;t sound drugged out but she must be because she always calls from a payphone where police sirens blast in the background.  And Zoe comes off well in comparison to the unintentionally hilarious stroke victim and the Otto&apos;s who put their heads together, dry-eyed and sniffle, expecting us to believe that they are crying over their long lost son named, Bear, of all things.\n\nBravo to the generic and lifeless Sarah Polley who musters a tiny ounce of oomph to deliver `the big lie&apos; at the end Â you know, the one she said she would NEVER tell.  She even attempts to glare at her father and later; if you look really close, it&apos;s the beginnings of a grin.\n\nHow ridiculous is the scene where Ian Holm recounts a spider bite story that goes absolutely NOWHERE?  Why doesn&apos;t he remember Alison&apos;s father?  Why does he get stuck in a CAR WASH? What is wrong with this guy? \n\n And why is creepy Billy a saint for trying to convince Nicole&apos;s father not to sue?  This anti-sue-happy town sure is unrealistic.  Oh, they&apos;re Canadian.  Thank explains it.  Sure Ian Holm&apos;s acting is bad but does he really deserve the town&apos;s wrath for trying to gain a buck?\n\nThere is a really cheesy time transition scene, which illustrates how confused director Atom Egoyan is. He thinks the audience needs to be hand held in order to comprehend the passing of time and yet he fails to explain anything else in this perplexing tale with similar clarity.\n\nWould people really behave the way these people do and what does it all mean anyway?  Detective Stephens says that our children are all lost to us.  The Pied Piper story echoes similar sentiments.  Some school kids are dead while others grow up to become drug addicts and are as good as gone.  One strange girl lives and because she tells a lie she is now, apparently, more pure than anyone else in town and well, that&apos;s it.\n\nIt is always wise to heed the immortal words of Radiohead Â don&apos;t get sentimental, it always ends up drivel. The Sweet Hereafter doesn&apos;t even have enough power to illicit the feelings that sentimentality requires.  It is the worst kind of drivel -the kind that attempts to be profound, fails and stumbles into pretension, leaving nothing worthy of redemption in its wake."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a big fan of Robert Mitchum and also of Jan-Michael Vincent, but I was disappointed with this father/son drama. The film has an interesting set-up, with Vincent reaching out to his recently paroled father, who had been put away for killing his wife, Vincent&apos;s mother, many years before. What doesn&apos;t work as well is that Vincent is such an unpleasant character and in terms of narrative seems like he should be the character the audience needs to want to follow and identify with. Mitchum is excellent as the father who is happy to help his son and to reconcile, but who avoids pushing himself on his son given his past actions. Vincent is an underrated actor, but this character is so damaged and hurtful that it makes the film an unpleasant experience. And it&apos;s not that I can&apos;t appreciate or enjoy challenging familial dramas, but they at least need to interesting characters or solid narrative, both of which this film lacked. Overall, this film was only made watchable thanks to a nuanced performance by Mitchum. Brenda Vaccaro, Sally Kirkland, and Josh Mostel appear in supporting roles and an uncredited Audrey Landers appears as a teenage Arby&apos;s customer.",

      "description": "Nineteen year old Jimmy Graham has grown up to be an angry young man based on his experiences, including not having either his mother or father in his life as he was growing up. When he was six, Jimmy saw his mother, Ann Graham, die before his eyes, she killed by his father Harry Graham in a drunken rage. Jimmy&apos;s testimony helped put his father away. Jimmy&apos;s anger often manifests itself in passive-aggressive behavior. When Jimmy is rejected from joining the military due to medical reasons, he, at a loss, decides to search out Harry, who he knows has now been paroled. He finds Harry living in a trailer park in a community close to their old Pennsylvania home. Harry is also in a relationship with a woman named Jenny Benson, who also lives in the trailer park in a Winnebago. Jenny knows all about Harry&apos;s past. While Harry wants to be whatever Jimmy wants him to be in his life, Jimmy exhibits that passive-aggressiveness toward Harry, being generally cordial to him to his face while doing things behind his back intentionally to hurt him. Partly as Jimmy sticks around longer than he says and as their life is generally going better than expected, Harry, who seems to have owned up to his role in killing Ann, maps out a life for him and Jenny to include Jimmy if he wants. In the process, Jimmy will need to confront both his issues with his father, and the overall anger in his life which is hindering him from finding his own path.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s the very first time that a movie makes me want to write a review. For the beginning, the cast was a perfect match, they were flawless for a horror movie, not too bad-ass neither too dumb-bass.\n\nI wasn&apos;t expect much thing after read the plot, but guess what! I was wrong, The Haunting in Connecticut 2 brings a solid plot about ghosts that in the end appeals for an emotional scene that is awesome. If you are looking for gore, blood and extreme horrifying things this one is not for you\n\nI don&apos;t know why low rating, but I think it is because the first movie wasn&apos;t so good as this one and everyone expected the worst.\n\nIf you don&apos;t want a blockbuster movie with a remade and same history give it a try.\n\nPS: My review is most directly to people who are involved with horror movies and enjoy all kinds in the genre",

I won&apos;t say it&apos;s uninteresting but it sure isn&apos;t much fun. It&apos;s violent, schlocky, and quite frankly, gross. I didn&apos;t care about anybody in the movie, which made it hard to become invested in the plot. It does have a nice cast, though. Shelly Winters gets a lot of flack for this movie but I thought she was pretty good. Robert De Niro appears in an early role. I missed his name in the credits so when I saw him I couldn&apos;t believe it was really him. Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Pat Hingle, and Scatman Crothers are among the other solid actors in the cast. Like I said, it&apos;s not much fun but it&apos;s worth a look. I did love that corny theme song.",

This summer he&apos;ll be back with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth program studying - I don&apos;t really know exactly what.  It&apos;s some kind of computer program, I just sign the check.\n\nHe&apos;s very much both anti-Microsoft and anti-Bill Gates. He&apos;s also quite pro-Linux, the emblem of the &quot;Open Source&quot; movement whose adherents regard its underlying virtues with a devotion normally reserved by the religious for the icons of their faiths.\n\nSo he wanted me to see &quot;Revolution OS,&quot; a documentary about the Linux operating system and the open source movement that spawned the increasingly important competitor to both Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThis is a very interesting documentary which I, clueless as to the secrets of operating systems,  readily understood. I watched it with the barest comprehension of Linux or the philosophy underlying the open source concept.\n\nMuch credit to the filmmaker for not only explaining the seminal value of open source - the commitment to free interchange of ideas with minimal incorporation of legal protection for intellectual property - but for also succinctly allowing contrasting values and competing personalities screen time.  This documentary is a very concise but excellent guide for the uninitiated into a world usually the arcane preserve of specialists most adept at talking to each other.\n\nThe Open Source movement is a work in progress threatened by the real risk of those benefiting from openness legally protecting their own &quot;added value&quot; and thus, in a sense, betraying their benefactors.  Several of those interviewed pursue their open source values almost as a  creed, the commitment to computers taking the place of more traditional dogma.\n\nAnyone interested in a major intellectual counterpoint to the dominance of both Microsoft and the role of law in insuring proprietary benefits for innovators should see &quot;Revolution OS&quot;:  no manual required.\n\n8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "La bimba di Satana/Satan&apos;s Babydoll is a strange early 80s film that does not really ever make much sense, but is marvellously weird and pleasantly gothic, albeit with a string of extended sex scenes which may or may not try the patience of viewers. Some of the highlights are Isidro&apos;s very, very long spellcasting (and yelling/gurning) scenes, and when Ignazio spies on the sleeping Sol (and imagines all kinds of self-induced hijinks on her part). The latter is notable in that it is essentially the same scene repeated countless times, and so it is (especially with regard to the repeated close-ups of Ignazio&apos;s startled boat race) pretty much the very first media gif! However, it is fair to say that these scenes can equally also try the patience of saints due to their endlessness. However, the film has possessions, a spooky castle, a pretty cool mummy and so is a horror curio, if nothing else.",

But still, this is a South Korean horror anthology, so why not give a chance, even without having seen the first movie. Why? Well, simply because I had the opportunity.\n\nThe first segment, &quot;The Cliff&quot;, was nicely filmed, although the story was really predictable. It was more of a drama than it was a horror experience. But I suppose that the supernatural twist to it and the amazingly ridiculous ending was enough to call it horror by the director&apos;s standard.\n\nMoving on to the second segment, &quot;The Pain of Death&quot;, again not scary. However, while it was initially a bit boring, the director managed to tie together all strings in a very fulfilling way, which made the ending quite good. But as for the scares, don&apos;t get your hopes up.\n\nThe third segment, &quot;Escape&quot;, is way over-the-top and totally stands out from the previous two segments. But not really fitting to the anthology, again, it is nowhere near being even remotely scary. &quot;Escape&quot; was odd and bizarre in a way that it was the most entertaining of all segments.\n\nIt was actually the narrative story in between each segment which turned out to be the best of all the stories and also the most interesting.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Horror Stories 2&quot; was a less than mediocre horror experience in the South Korean horror genre.",

      "reviewBody": "Hearing the news that John Boulting&apos;s classic 1946 adaptation of Graham Greene&apos;s novel Brighton Rock was to be remade filled with me trepidation. The current spate of mostly inferior remakes are one thing but meddling with the perfection of this archetypical gangster film is another. How can any updated version possibly replace the indelible image of the 23 year old Richard Attenborough as the flick knife wielding baby faced assassin Pinkie Brown? As filming began and rumours of a 1960s Mods and Rockers setting emerged I began to have serious doubts if this remake was really going to be a good idea! Thankfully fears that Rowan Joffe&apos;s Brighton Rock is a sanitised version of the story are quickly allayed. The relocation of Brighton Rock to the 1960s does not mean that we are entering into the trendy youth culture of the era or being taken on an adolescent search for identity. The sharp-suited posers and greasy leather clad Rockers are merely a backdrop to a much darker reality as we are taken into a terrifying world of crime, guilt and inner-torment.\n\nBrighton Rock is concerned with the concepts of good versus evil, sin and redemption they were present in Greene&apos;s novel, the 1946 adaptation and once again are central in Rowan Joffe&apos;s remake. However, additional scenes and alterations to the 2010 update mean that Pinkie&apos;s progressively violent behaviour is almost justified. In the exhilarating opening sequence Pinkie witnesses the brutal murder of the gang&apos;s original leader Kite when Fred Hale slashes his throat. When Pinkie sees one of the few role models in his life burbling and drowning in his own blood revenge it seems is not only on the cards but unavoidable. This kind of black and white, eye for an eye, morality detracts from the original story where Pinkie Brown&apos;s vicious streak appeared to be innate and a product of original sin. The character of Ida Arnold (Dame Helen Mirren) also has undergone a significant adjustment. In opposition to the Catholicism of Pinkie and Rose the pleasure seeking Ida was concerned only with the here and now. Mirren&apos;s portrayal plays these aspects down resulting in a more serious role and a lessening of the story&apos;s theological study.\n\nAs with Attenborough before him Sam Riley&apos;s Pinkie is intense, dangerous and teeters on the edge of sanity. If anything in Joffe&apos;s adaptation Pinkie Brown undergoes a broader transformation than before as greater emphasis being placed upon his journey from a nervous lackey to maniacal gang leader. Unfortunately the 30 year old Riley he does not resemble a juvenile delinquent. Therefore the shy adolescent awkwardness that Pinkie displays towards adulthood and in particular his relationship with Rose, (conveyed so expertly by Attenborough,) is absent.\n\nAndrea Riseborough gives an outstanding performance as Rose she too goes on a psychological journey from being a naive and mousey youngster to an assertive young woman attracted to Pinkie&apos;s confidence and menace. The scene in which Pinkie in effect buys Rose from her abusive father for Â£150 adds a social realist dimension to the film uncovering the lack of options available to a young working-class woman in &apos;sixties Britain. The squalid surroundings of Pinkie and Rose&apos;s flat complete with peeling wallpaper, scuffed furniture and squeaky floorboards are also reminiscent of a Kitchen Sink drama. There is some impressive cinematography by John Mathieson as the camera pans from the threatening crashing waves on Brighton Beach to the scenic seaside cafÃ©s foreshadowing the storm that is building. The swelling orchestral soundtrack also adds to the heightened sense of panic and drama. The tea rooms, arcades and dance-halls of 1960s Brighton are also accurately recreated as are the neglected interiors of the boarding houses. And yetÂ There is something oddly unreal about Joffe&apos;s Brighton Rock partly down to the unnecessary time shift which does nothing but confuse the audience. The film&apos;s characters seem stuck in the wrong era originating as they do from austere post-war Britain both in appearance and behaviour. Using the Mods and Rockers backdrop and casting of Philip Davis, (who appeared in Quadrophenia,) as Spicer turns the movie into a pastiche of sorts leaving us with a souped-up hyper-reality. This is Brighton as seen through the eyes of the cinema goer not the world of Graham Greene&apos;s novel. Dark, menacing and suspenseful Rowan Joffe&apos;s Brighton Rock is well worth seeing it is just unfortunate that the film is not as good as the sum of its parts."

Surprised yes and no because I&apos;ve giving up since a long time deciding whether or not I should watch a movie based solely on the ratings. Too much people rate mediocre movies with the highest score possible whilst perfectly good entertaining movies are being bashed. The Wolfman is entertaining, certainly in the lycanthrope genre, a genre that had multiple bad movies in the past, but this one is one for the &quot;good werewolf movies list&quot;. The cast is full of excellent actors like Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and others. The cinematography was what I liked the most about this movie, a nice dark tone of imaging added something special to the ambiance. It&apos;s not a wonder it won an Oscar for make-up as that was also one of the better things about The Wolfman. The story could have been better, I won&apos;t deny that, but all the rest made up for it. The Wolfman is underrated certainly in this genre.",

      "reviewBody": "Although my headline above is satirical, I did find this documentary to be taut and concise(at only 1 hr. and 16 min. long), and although I&apos;m fairly well versed on the subject I did learn quite a bit from it.\n\nI thought perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the doc was citing the memorandum of Lewis Powell, in the 1970&apos;s, who would go on to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. In this memorandum, which he wrote for the Chamber of Commerce, basically the game plan was written for the rich and powerful individuals and corporations, which is still being used today some 4 decades later.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan liked the Powell memorandum so much he distributed it to all his Administration officials, and apparently used it to back many of his doctrines. These included slashing taxes for the wealthy(the infamous &quot;trickle down&quot; economic theory), raising taxes for the middle class and the poor( but couching the terms as &quot;revenue enhancements&quot;), marginalize or destroy unions, and deregulate business as much as possible.\n\nThe film is quick to point out that Republican Administrations were not alone in this wealth re-distribution. Under President Clinton, the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act was abolished, which had very successfully prohibited banks and savings and loans from using depositors money for risky investments. Now, it was the Wild West all over again with banks packaging mortgages into the infamous derivatives, which I believe led primarily to the economic meltdown of 2008.\n\nAlso, Clinton backed and fostered the NAftA Treaty, which since its&apos; inception has cost countless American jobs, held workers&apos; wages stagnant, and put them further into debt in all three countries.\n\nManipulation of the media is another goal of the rich elite, or oligarchy. In 1983, there were 50 major media companies, and now we are down to 6--Time-Warner,Comcast, CBS, NewsCorp, Viacom, and Disney. Investigative reporting is becoming a thing of the distant past, and any reporter that seriously challenges those in power will most likely be fired. Six extremely powerful and rich families, such as the Koch Brothers, Joseph Coors et al. have formed private foundations to manipulate the media and promote their agendas. We even saw this in the recent Federal Government shutdown, and near default when certain groups showed they were virtually willing to do anything to de-fund &quot;Obamacare&quot; Next on their &quot;hit list&quot; will be Social Security and Medicare cuts, while major corporations shield their profits overseas and often not only do not pay their fair share of taxes but receive enormous rebates from the U.S. government.\n\nI could write all day on this, but let&apos;s say the movie offers some possible solutions towards the end for citizens to fight back and try and reclaim some of the wealth that has moved to the rich and widened the gap between the wealthy and the other 99% of us. Unfortunately, I personally believe it will take another crisis of some sort to get people motivated enough to demand major changes in this rigged system.\n\nThe documentary was directed by Frances Causey and Donald Goldmacher, and narrated by Thom Hartmann.",

      "reviewBody": "Against All flags is directed by George Sherman and written by Joseph Hoffman and Aeneas MacKenzie. It stars Errol Flynn, Maureen O&apos;Hara, Anthony Quinn, Alice Kelley and Mildred Natwick. A Technicolor production out of Universal with cinematography by Russell Metty and music scored by Hans J. Salter.\n\nIn 1700 A.D. the Pirate Rebublic of Libertatia on the Island of Madagascar was in constant menace to the rich trade routes to India. Several days sail from this pirate fortress is the British merchant ship, Monsoon...\n\nPlot, in simple terms, sees Flynn as a British officer who goes under cover to smash the pirate ring operating on the coast of Madagascar. Swooning, jealousy, heroics, moustache twirling villainy and big hoorays do follow. It&apos;s a lesser Flynn swashbuckler that came at a time when he was fighting some personal issues as well as the onset of age. Filmed mostly on the Universal stages in California, with a small amount of location work shot at Palos Verdes, picture is far better than it probably had right to be.\n\nDuel with landing pikes!\n\nOK! This is hardly a rip snorter akin to Flynn&apos;s triumphs of the past, nor is it a particularly potent story, but it&apos;s a picture full of lovely optical delights whilst the lead performers have an ebullience that&apos;s utterly beguiling. Colour photography and costuming lead the way, both of which off set some of the cheapo corner cutting by producer Howard Christie. Direction is steady, with the actors comfortable with the jovial material to hand, and the finale doesn&apos;t lack in the crash, bang, wallop &amp; hooray department. Flynn oozes laid back charisma, his unassuming kisses stealing the ladies hearts, Quinn enjoys being the dandy dastardo, O&apos;Hara wields a good blade and broods a sexuality to knock the boys off of their feet, while Mildred Natwick is as always worthy of observation since her visual acting is most enjoyable.\n\nThe flaws are evident from the off, making it an easy film to kick and dismiss if in a particularly demanding mood. Therefore, as pirate adventures go, or as Flynn swashers go in fact, it&apos;s very much a minor work. But that doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t colourful or fun, for it happens to be both. Universal&apos;s Region 1 Pirates of the Golden Age release of Against All Flags comes in full frame and is a rather good transfer to disc. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "In many ways, this movie follows the classic pattern of so many sci-fi features from the 1950s -- a small, isolated desert town finds itself threatened by a strange series of occurences which seem to defy logical explanation. However, the threat here is not the usual giant insect or alien invader but rather a meteorite which has splintered into a number of small, shiny black rocks. What happens with these rocks is &quot;absorbing&quot; but audiences then (and now) seemed to want villains with emotions and personalities. Rocks with curious properties, (or inanimate machines such as in &quot;Kronos&quot;), don&apos;t provide the necessary thrill. Calling this movie &quot;The Monoliths&quot; would have been more apt since it can&apos;t deliver the shocks you&apos;d expect from a movie with &quot;Monsters&quot; in the title. Besides, while the town of San Angelo is threatened, the movie never really convinces you that the world itself is also in danger. \n\nStill, this is a brisk and efficient piece of entertainment that has been put together with a degree of care which belies its modest budget.\n\nThe story on which &quot;Monolith&quot; is based was co-written by Jack Arnold who also directed its lead actor, Grant Williams, in that sci-fi classic, &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man.&quot;"

Some of the effects were amazing, especially the scene with the dancer. I liked that a lot. At other times the effect was more disturbing, especially at the beginning where there was an empty seat in the plane that seemed to be hanging in the air and looked really out of place. But sitting in row 10 and actually believing that you can touch something because it seems to be just in front of you is really amazing. The film itself was not really bad although there is not much of a plot. I enjoyed the eerie feeling, acting was adequate but I had the impression that some scenes were missing. The pilot disappears and reappears for no apparent reason and in the end the nightmare ends for no apparent reason. But if you do not expect to much from the plot you should be able to enjoy the experience.",

      "reviewBody": "I tracked down &quot;The Corpse Packs his Bags&quot; (and it&apos;s quite difficult to find, believe me) because of its cool title and fascinating plot synopsis. It sounds like a sort of crossover between an Italian Giallo and a German Krimi, with the great Horst Tappert (my mother was a giant &quot;Derrick&quot; fan and saw all seasons, hence my enthusiasm) and directed by the one and only inimitable Jess Franco. I honestly thought the &quot;Krimi&quot; would be a good genre for Franco, but alas, he managed to ruin another potentially great concept. How awesome does the plot sound? A vicious knife-murderer indicates that he/she is about kill again by packing a suitcase for the victim and putting it in the middle of a room. The first 15-20 minutes are also very good, because they deliver the promised plot. After that, however, there are so many sub-plots and newly introduced characters that I completely lost track and interest. I don&apos;t even know if Tappert&apos;s character was good or evil. The story supposedly takes place in London, but Franco hardly even tries to camouflage that he&apos;s filming in his home country Spain, the sleazy footage is dull, and the climax is very unsatisfying. I&apos;m certainly not an authority in the field of &quot;Krimi&quot; films, but I know two things. 1: writer Bryan Edgar Wallace isn&apos;t nearly as good as his father Edgar Wallace. 2: The best Krimi films were release between 1960-1965, and directed by Germans. Not in the early 70s, and certainly not by Jess Franco.",

These actuality films are some that people today will either be fascinated by or simply not see the point of watching them. Personally speaking I think these are some of the most fascinating movies to watch simply because they show you a time and place that is real. A lot of movies can re-create these times but actually getting to see men doing their jobs in 1896 is interesting to see. Being able to see what they&apos;re wearing and how they&apos;re working is a great glimpse into the past."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve got to say that the first 20 minutes of this film are admittedly excellent and show director Margheriti on top form. In a nut shell, Christopher Connelly plays the strangely named Captain Yankie who is running an amusing scam in the tropics for those with more money than sense. The good captain is leading mock expeditions into the jungle to recover &apos;lost artifacts&apos; from &apos;savage natives&apos; (in reality the friendly indigenous population who happen to be good friends with the captain) Accompanying our hero is also a worldly wise, jovial (and very drunken) Scottish guide (Margheriti regular Luciano Pigozzi) who is even &apos;killed&apos; by the &apos;savages&apos; early on in the shown scam for maximum effect!\n\nNews of these scams (or &apos;dreams&apos; as our hero likes to call them) however gets out to an inspector (Lee Van Cleef) who, using them against our heroes, coerces i.e. blackmails them into undertaking a very real mission to retrieve a priceless artifact known as the Ruby Of Doom (a most unsettling name...) Needless to say, such a task proves to be anything but easy with our heroes having to fend off vicious Burmese pirates, avoiding various lethal traps and being betrayed from within their own ranks. Mix in some of Margheriti&apos;s always cool miniature work and a trademark explosive finale and you have on paper what should have been a great flick.\n\nUnfortunately, after such a great introduction though, things go downhill with most of the action sequences being handled in a somewhat confused manner. Even the aforementioned finale whilst certainly pleasant to look at is handled with very little flair for Margheriti.\n\nThe good news is that the leads are tremendously fun to watch and the comedy present throughout is very welcome. One of the best bits is a scene in which the natives hear that Captain Yankie has arrived unexpectedly and thus perform a mad rush to hide all their westernised attire and accoutrement&apos;s to play the part of &apos;savages&apos; as they have done previously for the captain so many times. They even put out some fake human skulls for good measure!!!\n\nOverall: Not a bad film by any means but for fans of the genre I would recommend Margheriti&apos;s The Ark Of The Sun God as a much better watch.",

      "reviewBody": "This is about as simple as a movie can be. Yet its simplicity is one of its strengths. This is a Portuguese film, spoken in Portuguese language. It&apos;s 100% made in Portugal. It was directed by Manoel de Oliveira, the world&apos;s oldest film director in activity and still doing films, even though he is now more than 100 years old. But, for someone in such an advanced age, he is in very good shape. That and the fact that he still has plans for the future is respectable, to say the least.\n\n&apos;Aniki-BobÃ³&apos; is one of his earliest films. It wasn&apos;t well received when it came out, but time has been kinder to it. Truly a shame that, after all these years, this wonderful movie is still not available on DVD. The way I see it, they&apos;re waiting for the director to die to finally do it as a homage in his memory.\n\nOur movie takes place in Porto city, the director&apos;s hometown. Porto has its own symbols, such as the Francesinhas, the Maria Pia bridge, the Port wine and the ex-libris Torre dos ClÃ©rigos. The movie is masterfully filmed, with great sceneries and almost entirely filmed in natural settings.\n\nThis classic film in black &amp; white is about poor children in the streets of Porto and near the Douro River, where they live adventures, play games, socialize, use their imagination and sometimes have conflicts. It&apos;s a take on a childhood that has disappeared today, being pure, poetic, human, nostalgic, charming, funny and dramatic.\n\nThe movie&apos;s title comes from a rhyme of a children&apos;s game, which was already mentioned by one the reviewers here, so I won&apos;t say it all over again. As for the shop, (Loja das TentaÃ§Ãµes), it means &quot;Shop of Temptations&quot; in Portuguese.\n\nEach cast member does a fine portrayal. In fact, this movie is almost entirely acted by kids. The kids have different personalities (for example: Carlitos is shy and reserved, Eduardo is naughty and the ruffian one, the little kid who is constantly stumbling is confident), but they get along well. It&apos;s not that they don&apos;t have some rivalries at times, but there is no swear, no major violence and no bad stuff.\n\nThis film anticipates the Italian neorealism in several ways. It&apos;s a small Portuguese masterpiece that should get more credit than it does. Almost everything in this movie works out in perfect harmony, despite its simplicity. And I like very much the typical accent from Porto city by the actors and the music in the film. It&apos;s difficult to understand at times, but with more viewings and if you put the sound louder, it&apos;s pretty easy to understand.\n\nThis should definitely be on Top 250.",

I know it&apos;s insane to give a movie an excellent review just for the soundtrack, but it is THAT good! The movie is kinda funny, but totally for guys. It&apos;s basically half naked girls running around, saving the world...which is kinda fun. There are some VERY FUNNY &quot;guy lines&quot; like &quot;The four words most guys hate to hear from women...WE NEED TO TALK!&quot; How funny is that?! How true is that!!!! This movie is like a sinful, frightening look into a man&apos;s mind. Also, the martial arts the Swedish Bikini Team used was totally cool. An interesting tidbit I learned is that the girls are actually expert marksmen."

      "reviewBody": "This is not &apos;Terms of Endearment&apos;.  This film does not offer answers, explanations, or resolution, and as such I found it to be a very effective portrayal of the aftermath of a suicide.\n\nIt&apos;s not an enjoyable film to watch, but it&apos;s very much worthwhile.  First off, the acting is fantastic.  Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves all the raves he&apos;s getting for this role -- he&apos;s downright painful to watch.  All of the supporting cast -- except for the mother-in-law portrayed by Kathy Bates, who is exhausted with her own grief -- brilliantly introduces nuances of discomfort.  It&apos;s not overdone, but it&apos;s obvious that these characters are internally dealing with the question of how to deal with Hoffman&apos;s character Wilson, who has just suffered this terrible and shocking loss.  The dialogue is consistently and realistically not natural, in keeping with the awkward position of the supporting characters and Wilson&apos;s deteriorating mental health.\n\nI have seen this film criticized because Wilson&apos;s position is *so* dreary, that it may seem over-the-top, unrealistic.  But, really, the character&apos;s wife recently shot herself.  What bright spots were such critics expecting in this character&apos;s life at this time?  I believe the writing of the plot is realistic in this regard.\n\nStructurally, it&apos;s brave, risky, and effective.  I felt alienated by the lack of explanation and resolution of Wilson&apos;s position.  Not a positive emotion to walk out of a film with, but extremely powerful.  The sparse soundtrack and the painfully sympathetic supporting characters all added to this feeling of alienation.",

And George Lucas and Ron Howard managed to do that excellently in Willow.\n\nI&apos;d rather watch Willow yell at Madmartigan and call him stupid than watch Sam and Frodo &quot;Just hold on a little longer, because everything will be happy because of LOVE!&quot;\n\nThere&apos;s betrayal, redemption, action, the scariest dragon I&apos;ve ever seen in my life, love, purposfully corny poetry and lots of jokes. The characters despair, but fight against it rather than just wandering around listlessly saying &quot;woe is me!&quot; People are allowed to be petty and shallow without being influenced by The Greatest Evil Known To Man (tm). There&apos;s no one hanging around with no other purpose than to be encouragement- everyone claims Willow won&apos;t succeed but he still fights on, and wins everyone over to his side. In my mind that makes him a lot more admirable than Frodo McAngstypants who only keeps on going because Sam keeps telling him he&apos;s fantastic and he thinks he&apos;s going to die anyway."

      "reviewBody": "In the beginning and end of Mi Viaggio Di Italia (My Voyage to Italy), legend Martin Scorsese explains, in good reason, that the way to get people more interested in film is to share personal experiences of viewing particular ones that had some kind of impact for a movie-goer&apos;s experience (much like a friend telling another that a new movie is out, go see it, it&apos;s good, etc). Scorsese used a similar approach to his first cinema lesson- A Personal Journey Through American Movies- and like that one, it&apos;s a long, detailed, and deeply felt documentary. Sometimes when he talks about these movies you can tell he&apos;s so passionate about them, and it&apos;s a good approach.\n\nFirst, Scorsese gives the viewer a feel of how he saw so many of these films from Italy- how he could go from seeing a Roy Rogers western in the theater and come home to watch a Rossellini series or a De Sica feature on TV- then, he goes through a comprehensive tale of the progression of the neo-realist movement, also mentioning the silent film epics, the tragic/comedies of the 50&apos;s, and how it progressed into the &quot;new-wave&quot; of Antonionni and Fellini in the early 60&apos;s. Like &apos;Personal Journey&apos;, it&apos;s long, possibly longer than the previous, and might not be watchable in one sitting (it&apos;s a two parter as I remember it from seeing it broadcast on TV). But for the avid movie-goer, fan of neo-realism, or someone wanting to get a glimpse of a better, smarter world in cinema in these days of cineplex garbage, it&apos;s a lenghty treat. A+",

In place of a story, they give us a random string of random encounters between random people who talk and talk, and then talk some more about nothing. They walk and talk. They sit and talk. They smoke and talk. They drink and talk. And then some bombs go off, or some Messerschmitts fly low and strafe the soldiers. And then we&apos;re back to pointless talking. This is not a film. It&apos;s two hours of footage.\n\nAnd it&apos;s unfortunately characteristic of a particular kind of French film (especially a 1960s French film) where we get a cast of automatons who don&apos;t at all resemble real human characters but go around engaging in inane chit chat or robotically spouting meaningless philosophical musings or dialectics.

As well, the production design, cinematography, and so forth stretch its relatively low budget to maximum effect. No, this isn&apos;t on a level with Michael Haneke&apos;s unsettling &quot;Funny Games&quot; or its American remake; think of it more as a John Hughesian teen comedy that takes a dark turn into violent absurdity. It truly is a comic book potboiler in the vein of &quot;Tales From the Crypt,&quot; crude tongue wedged in its cheek, nonsensical plot devices on full display. I understand fully why so many wags here hated it, but despite its flaws, I had fun with its earnest attempt to offer up its twisted take on teen angst. The three Aussie leads will all be actors to keep an eye on in the future, that much is certain.",

      "reviewBody": "At the very least, the Western drama &apos;Doc&apos; manages to be somewhat interesting from start to finish, if not exactly factual. It tells the very familiar story of Marshal Wyatt Earp and John &quot;Doc&quot; Holiday in revisionist terms, and takes a very gritty, moody, psychological approach to the material, courtesy screenwriter Pete Hamill. It traces the journey of Doc (Stacy Keach) as he makes the acquaintance of prostitute Katie Elder (a de-glamorized Faye Dunaway) and rides into Tombstone to hook up with his old friend Wyatt (Harris Yulin), and to deal with the problem of such trouble making characters as Ike Clanton (Michael Witney).\n\nKeach is the main reason to catch this film. Deliberately paced by cult filmmaker Frank Perry (best known for the 1981 camp classic &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;), who produced and directed, it attempts to be as un-Hollywood as possible, and show darker aspects to these real life people, especially Earp, played as an opportunist. Perry&apos;s film begins on a very atmospheric note, as Doc arrives at an isolated inn / saloon during a windstorm. Ways in which the script humanizes Doc are how it charts his unusual courtship of Ms. Elder (appealingly portrayed by Dunaway) and his relationship with the well meaning &quot;Kid&quot; (Denver John Collins), who is the nephew of the Clanton brothers.\n\nKeachs&apos; engaging, melancholy performance is something to see. Veteran character actor Yulin is also quite good, in a rare above the title role for him. The supporting cast is comprised of less well known but still solid character players like John Scanlon, Richard McKenzie, Penelope Allen, Antonia Rey, Marshall Efron, and Bruce M. Fischer. That&apos;s writer Dan Greenburg as Clum the journalist, who in this fictionalization is decidedly anti-Earp.\n\nIt might be worth considering pairing this film with another gritty Western from the same time period, &quot;Dirty Little Billy&quot;, which similarly took an offbeat approach to telling a familiar real life tale (in that case, that of Billy the Kid).\n\nSeven out of 10.",

He helps others along the way without putting his personal agenda first. Anyone who goes along with his philosophy ends up getting rewarded in the end. And after all, isn&apos;t that what fairy tales are supposed to be about? There is enough heartache and sorrow in life without using it for entertainment purposes.",

      "reviewBody": "Kirby Dick&apos;s (&quot;Twist of Faith&quot;, &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;) new exposÃ© is as revolting as it is provocative. Featuring interviews with journalists, activists, media personalities and the film subjects themselves, Kirby exposes all the hypocrisy behind closeted elected officials (Larry Craig, Ed Schrock, Jim McCrery, David Dreier and Charlie Crist, among others) who lied their way into high office, claiming to be morally conservative family men while living a double life.\n\nNaturally, the issue of &quot;outing&quot; these men is morally questionable â but as Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank (a former closeted official himself) says, &quot;There&apos;s a right to privacy, not to hypocrisy&quot;. And hypocrisy is all there is, since once these men are in power, they shockingly, without exception, work against any and every gay right. Theories are discussed about what causes closeted gay men to join those who work against them, joining forces against what would technically be their &quot;community&quot;. An interesting analysis goes way back to Roy Cohn and McCarthyism, and to the kid called a &quot;fag&quot; in school that will join the bully to save his own skin. As simplistic as this example sounds, it certainly has a lot of truth in it.\n\n&quot;Outrage&quot; is a terrific documentary because it isn&apos;t one sided. It doesn&apos;t suggest that every closeted gay person is a hypocrite, and from a predominantly homosexual point of view (documentarians and interviewees), it&apos;s acknowledged how difficult the &quot;coming out&quot; process can be and how each person deserves to have their right to privacy respected. However, all citizens also should know what&apos;s behind their superiors&apos; speeches, and the fact that these people are working against homosexuals as they lead double lives themselves is repulsing, heartbreaking, and most infuriating. It&apos;s one of the most incendiary, straightforward documentaries I&apos;ve seen in a while, and I hope it gets enough exposure to provoke some serious discussions.\n\nThe so-called log cabin Republicans, elected officials or not, tend to put financial and professional reasons above anything else, and since they chose to live a life of lies, they don&apos;t care about the rights other people should be allowed to have. I know gay Republicans who will say &quot;Oh, they make such a fuss about gay marriage and such... you can always live with someone, there&apos;s no need to have a paper to prove it&quot;, etc. Well, personally, I even agree with that in a way, since I don&apos;t think I will ever feel the need to legally marry myself (but I&apos;d like to think that, if I change my mind, I will have the right to do it). But what about the concept of equality? Just because you don&apos;t care about it, don&apos;t you think John and Stuart should have the right to get married if they want to? I can be accused of being biased myself as I say this, that I&apos;m generalizing all gay Republicans by saying this... which is true. But I firmly believe that what they tend to do is put anything that will benefit them professionally or financially above anything else, including the fight for equal rights and the respect for others. In doing that, they lose their own dignity, and if you support just one of these hypocritical officials, you&apos;re one of them.\n\nThis is a never-ending discussion, but an important one. It&apos;s a question of moral integrity to really know those who are being elected so we can actually claim for our rights â whether you are gay, straight, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, black, white, yellow or blue. 10/10."

This requires her to go undercover--as a high school student. Not only that but she has to somehow make friends with Seung-hee and at the same time try to fit in. Neither of these are very easy. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it I will just say that in order for this particular type of film to work it typically has to have some really good comedy to back it up. That being said, while there is certainly some comedy here, I didn&apos;t see anything special about any of it. Even so it wasn&apos;t too bad for the most part and as a result I suppose it was worth the time spent to watch it. Accordingly, I rate it as about average. But no more and no less.",

While out there, he shares exactly one tale each night about previous attacks of the Bigfoot, which we get to see in all their cheap special effect splendor.  They find a backwoods woman who had a child with this creature (actually a somewhat interesting subplot) and end up trapped in her house when the Bigfoot finally attacks the hapless campers.\n\nLots of blood.  Lots of hilariously bad dialogue.  My favorite line involves the use of the phrase &quot;anthropoid-like effigy&quot;.  It takes everyone in this movie a day and a half to die from the creature&apos;s attacks.  Lots of shots of the forest.  Lots of blood.  A semi-decent looking Bigfoot monster.  And lots of blood.  Would recommend a double-billing of this movie with &quot;Legend of Boggy Creek&quot;, if you can find a copy of either one, that is."

      "reviewBody": "Ana (Emma Cohen) and her father (Howard Vernon) have always meant the world to each other but their idyllic life together shatters when the girl wants to get married and, going into his study to show him her wedding gown, she finds her dad dangling from the end of a rope. Devastated, Ana puts her piano skills to good use by running away to become a singer in a lounge band only to find the pain&apos;s inside. She&apos;s a beauty and men are interested but whenever Ana reciprocates, the image of her father&apos;s suicide appears to her in mirrors and she sees herself stabbing those men to death. Unfortunately, whenever that happens, she either hears or reads in the paper that the men really were murdered. Devastated again, Ana tries to commit suicide but her best friend intervenes and takes her to a beautiful island to rest and recuperate - the island where Ana and her father lived... \n\nThe Spanish version of this film is considered to be the &quot;director&apos;s cut&quot; and I don&apos;t know how personal the film was to Franco but I took it personally. There&apos;s a fairytale quality to this adult nightmare about guilt and the burdens of the past we all carry but since it sounds like an oxymoron to put &quot;expertly realized&quot; and Jess Franco in the same sentence, suffice it to say that THE OBSCENE MIRROR was downright hypnotic. So much so, I didn&apos;t mind the time it took to get where it was going -and it certainly took its time. There were too many non-essential musical interludes and the camera&apos;s meaningless meandering makes Franco the most frustrating director I&apos;ve ever encountered. All the zoom-in, zoom-out, pan right, scan left would be OK if it meant something but doing that to a flower bed or a harbor? Not only that, he&apos;d go in for a close-up on a patron in a nightclub audience and linger so long I felt the person was bound to become part of the story but, no, they were just extras. Credit must go not only to the screenplay but to the cinematographer because there were long stretches where the film didn&apos;t seem like it was being &quot;directed&quot; and was quite beautiful to contemplate. All I can say in defense of my 8/10 rating is &quot;there&apos;s something about it&quot;.",

      "name": "Slasher remake that beats all of the lifeless remakes/sequels of late",
      "reviewBody": "Sorority Row seems to be receiving a lot of bad press for the same reasons that all slasher flicks seem to garner - it&apos;s clichÃ©d, the characters aren&apos;t likable, the plot isn&apos;t handled well, the set-up is botched, blah blah blah. OK, these ARE fair points - there exists within this movie one too many &quot;Hello, is anybody there?&quot; moments, too many &quot;Don&apos;t go in there!&quot; moments, and let&apos;s be honest, they could have quite happily pinned the entire thing on someone else and gone to police instead of covering it up.\n\nHowever, to complain about those things would be to complain about the entire purpose of the slasher genre. Besides Scream, Hallowe&apos;en and Black Christmas, there is not a single slasher that has a shred of believability (and even Hallowe&apos;en doesn&apos;t - Michael Myers is the boogie man for goodness sake!). We go to see slasher films to watch people get killed and don&apos;t pretend otherwise. These situations do not happen in real life, why expect any level of realism in the film?!?\n\nSo why bother going to see this? Primarily, for the kills. Out of the 10 or so murders, I&apos;d say but only 3 are gratuitous and 2 of those are badly set up. Again, it&apos;s the same old story of bimbo/drunk frat boy wandering where they should know not to. But for the 7 or so others, they rock! The manslaughter at the beginning is pretty twisted, yet I, and many others got satisfaction watching one of those twits from The Hills getting offed and thrown down a mine shaft. Following on, a &quot;pimped up&quot; tyre iron is implemented to cause as much gore and depravity as possible: bottles, mirror shards, cars, flare guns, axes, fire-extinguishers, shotguns and the bird cane from the original all are used at some point to bring the death count to a total Rambo would be proud of. One of my favourite set-ups in the movie comes after the party, when they are aware that somehow, someone knows about their little secret. In an intense scene involving many bubbles - because in the World of the Greek Letters, you are more likely to find a jacuzzi than a room full of mannequins - one of the 5 get caught out in it. The build up ranks with that of Annie in Halloween or CC in Scream 2 - after the girls receive another threatening text, they realise that one of their names was missing from the list and before they know it, the missing girl is running, screaming through the courtyard towards them. Although the scares are few and far between, that scene had me ducking. The murder weapon, that tyre iron, is set to become iconic if it garners any sequels (which, undoubtedly it will).\n\nThe main characters may not be the most interesting, and two of the girls really are just plain boring, but there are 3 who stand out in my mind: Jessica, Cassie and Ellie. Jessica, the bitchy queen, is played with fervour by Leah Pipes: she relishes every mean phrase, never misses a chance to put someone down, and when she stumbles across the dead body of a sorority sister, her first remark is &quot;God, she looks terrible!&quot; delivered with a dead pan attitude that just rocked. The fact that, unfortunately, she is governed by a bloke is a shame, but she redeems herself towards the end, staying true to her bitchy, selfish nature. Ellie, although a walking clichÃ© in a horror movie, is played really rather well by Rumer Willis. A girl falling apart at the seams as she tries to cope with her part in the accident, she goes from slightly shaky to worried to paranoid to hysterical to catatonic. Yet she maintains some integrity and humour and has quite possibly the funniest moment during which the girls are trying to stop her from finding out that Megan just might not be dead. Finally, Briana Evigans is such fun to watch. Although her character has no right to feel better about herself over what happened and she certainly is no Sydney Prescott or Laurie Strode, Briana brings out of Cassie a feisty, tough girl who can actually be rooted for towards the end. The other 2 VERY good reasons to watch this movie are as follows: gratuitous cat fights (in a burning house with a psycho killer running around none-the-less!) and Carrie Fisher blowing her kitchen to smithereens with a shot gun, all the while taunting the masked killer with lines such as &quot;Come to Mama.&quot;\n\nAll in all, Sorority Row is not a good film but it is sheer entertainment. What it lacks in plot and credibility it more than makes up for in style. it&apos;s also the first remake that I&apos;ve had pleasure watching due to it&apos;s total carelessness of where it&apos;s origins lie. I&apos;d give it 6 out of 10. (yes I am aware I&apos;ve awarded it 10 out of 10 but that&apos;s because I feel bad that morons would mark it so harsh on its lack of plot... seriously)",

      "reviewBody": "War is not fun... or least it shouldn&apos;t be. Whoever it doesn&apos;t leave physically scarred it leaves emotionally, mentally, and psychologically scarred. Some have deeper scars than others.\n\nJoseph &quot;Megs&quot; Megasy (Robert De Niro) was scarred and he was working daily to heal. David (Ed Harris) was also scarred, but he turned to the bottle for his healing. The two of them were part of the same unit with a third friend whom they lost in Vietnam. It affected them both deeply and it showed.\n\nMegs was determined to reach out and grab a hold of Dave no matter what. He was so determined that I didn&apos;t know what to expect from Megs. The movie started with Megs banging on Dave&apos;s door at the crack of dawn waking up the entire neighborhood. I thought for sure that Megs was going to be an untamable loose cannon capable of great harm. I was wrong. There was a method to his madness, and it was in the name of helping another veteran in need.\n\nI liked &quot;Jacknife&quot; a lot. This is probably my favorite movie dealing exclusively with mental and emotional recovery from Vietnam. There were other post-Vietnam movies like &quot;Deerhunter&quot; and a few others I can&apos;t readily recall, but this has to be my favorite. It showed the tragic effect the war had on those soldiers without being too tragic. That is to say that the vets weren&apos;t robbing banks, or killing people, or committing suicide--that was a tragedy I didn&apos;t want to see.\n\nThere was also a soft side to &quot;Jacknife&quot; as Megs developed an adult yet romantic relationship with Martha (Kathy Baker), Dave&apos;s sister. This was no fireworks upon first sight, or a deeply passionate romance, rather it was a slowly kindled fire that never blazed but burned quietly.\n\nThe message of &quot;Jacknife&quot; was clear: get veterans the help they need. Part of that needed help is commiserating with other vets. Maybe, just maybe, they need their brothers in arms more post-war than they did during war.",

Although Conan Doyle never really combined his characters with historical figures, it&apos;s a great device. Alan Arkin gives one of his wonderful performances, employing one of his all purpose accents, and initially very understated. Holmes helps bring out heroic qualities you don&apos;t suspect in Sigmund Freud, pace, Anna Freud. Nicol Williamson looks and moves like Holmes, truly &quot;hawk-like&quot;. Robert Duval is one of the best Watsons ever, outside of the BBC. Some characterizations of Watson make it hard to believe that he could possibly be a doctor, or even any kind of useful member of society. But this Watson is believable as a person, doctor and friend. The plot line also provides an answer as to who Holmes really is, and what makes him tick. Not THE answer, but an answer. A lot of fun, and very well done. Great period color. Don&apos;t go all serious, and you&apos;ll have a good time. Nice use of the cimbalom in the score during action sequences. Gives it that &quot;Hungarian&quot; flavor.",

      "reviewBody": "It was the day after Halloween, I was ten years old. I arrived back from my Nana&apos;s with my mother - my father and sister had indeed watched something very disturbing that night. Well, maybe not my dad, naÃ¯ve and sceptical of all things unseen. The item that was the buzz of the media for the next few days was a show which was presented as true, which was in fact a staged drama of a paranormal investigation into the self-proclaimed `Most haunted house in Britain&apos;. Even better, since bed-time was 9pm in those early days - it was on tape, for my enjoyment!\n\nThe documentary started and progressed much-like Children In Need, oozing of Crimewatch-esque scenes - subtle, crowds gathering outside the spectacle, minor celebrity Craig Charles (now of Robot Wars fame) chatting to the neighbourhood in the dead of the night. And, in the studio, Michael Parkinson radiates professionalism, giving the show an undeniable sense of seriousness. In the BBC, Parkinson and Sarah Green had never acted a staged drama before.\n\nA young-looking Craig Charles used humour and traditional `Halloween&apos;s just a bit of fun&apos; tactics to lighten the atmosphere early on, which sucked the youthful audience in until they wouldn&apos;t ever want to escape. Then, at the point of no turning back, a masterstroke in film was pulled off and the audience was taken in by a whirlwind of strange activity which cut the proverbial throat of all fun and games and drove the drama into new heights of dread and evil.\n\nAs Parkinson fails to digest any of the happenings and focusses on his presentation from the studio, Sarah Green, presenting from the house, with family of the victims of a ghost they named `Mr Pipes&apos;, are locked in an atmosphere you could cut with a knife. Here, the film programs your mind to become paranoid Â creating a scene which will weld you to the screen, eyes fixated. The film uses all the tricks of a real documentary to create a familiar tone, the phone-ins, promotion of books, viewers actually phoning up - combined with the presence of the paranormal, it is a lethal concoction.\n\nVery early into the film we see supposedly supernatural footage on tape, of a bedside lamp exploding. A curtain reveals a vague outline of what the children and the mother believe to be the offender, `Mr Pipes&apos;. The overall conclusion is that this is just a trick of the light. Into the `live&apos; filming, we are teased with dimly lit areas and lighting which could suggest Pipes is present on screen at all times, unknown to Green and to the audience. Scenes in contrast from the loud social of the street to the silent, dimly-lit homeliness of the house work perfectly, the feeling of dread and of a presence, and an evil one of that, are never absent throughout the last thirty minutes.\n\nAfter being shocked to our skins with suggestive occurrences, and Â god forbid Â the force actually concealed within the confines of the screen, in\n\ndarkness and in light, the show reaches a climax and all hell breaks loose. Total darkness engulfs the house like a black mist with the motivation of juggernauts, Green trying to find a solution, Charles with a noticeable absence, joking attitude dead and buried, as Parkinson can only look on from the comfort of the studio. The final scene comes, is over-the-top, but would at least wake the audience up from their sleep that this was not a real BBC investigation. As silly as it was, there could be no alternate ending for a sixty minute TV documentary which was paced with perfect accuracy. Parkinson breaking a sweat, the evils of this world embrace the studio and nowhere is safe. The credits roll as you wake up from a horrible nightmare.\n\n Without a doubt, this was a masterpiece of film. The next day EVERYONE was talking about it. It was a cult hit within a matter of days, and beyond, people were traumatised. The media linked this to the suicide of a man - I was not surprised, Ghost Watch gave me nightmares for months afterwards. The curtains in my room became a homage for all kinds of faces, outlines, and mysteries which I could not comprehend. The film an inspiration, I vowed for the days where I could watch movies like Poltergeist and Amityville. Neither of those sequence of movies, or any other, for that matter Â cast a shadow on what was televised at half nine on BBC1. Sadly deleted and banned from screening ever again, the tape that Ghostwatch graced was accidentally wiped by my father, and has not been seen since 1993. At the time of youth, I didn&apos;t accept the work as fiction, until my Aunty tried to get hold of a copy of the book seen in the film. The book shop had been swamped with requests, familiarity overcame her face, the solemn answer was; `It was staged, the book doesn&apos;t exist&apos;.\n\nHopefully I will get my hands on a copy of Ghost Watch again to watch after almost a decade. Today, Tony Parkinson still hosts his late-night interviewing show, Sarah Green is an old face in the crowd, Mike Smith is still around, and Craig Charles is the main face of Robot Wars, bereft of credibility after his media speculation."

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie when I was maybe 15 or so and didn&apos;t like it too much but for some reason after getting the X-Men dvd I wanted to see it again.  Well I found a used copy for 9 bucks and decided what the hell.  The character of Capt. America has never been a fave of mine he was just cheesy and the costume was really corny.....I just found him boring, I have always however liked the Red Skull he&apos;s a good villian.  The movie was directed by Albert Pyun (who can sometimes make a visually interesting movie but is still somewhat a hack) and produced by Menahem Golan (the guy half responsible for all those terrible Cannon movies...all except Lifeforce really) so the movie already has the odds against it.  But it was entertaining most of the time but a lot of that is because I have a fondness for low budget films.  I think the heart was in the right place but the script was not.  Actually parts of the movie work well and others don&apos;t, the acting from Matt Salinger as pretty good as was Scott Paulin (even though I think his voice sounded like Dexter&apos;s from Dexter&apos;s Laboratory) and with the exception of when the missle passes by the kid the visual effects were cool in a low tech way. The big problem with the movie other than changing characters back story was changing Red Skull (looking cool at the beginning) into some mafioso with makeup that looks at best o.k. in some scenes.  Actually the whole movie is laughable (especially Caps&apos; old girlfriends husband who sits around looking really stupid &amp; confused) but the heart was in the right place &amp; there is a likeable quality to it....even though the environmental stuff was irritating and preachy.  It was good late night viewing.\n\nAnd Red Skull looked cool when he was Red Skull."

      "reviewBody": "Is NAVAJO JOE a stupid movie?  Oh yeah, you better believe it.  Is it a bad movie?  Surprisingly, no.  To a significant degree, NAVAJO JOE makes up for its farcical plot with its great style.\n\nFirst, Sergio Corbucci knew how to make good-looking movies.  Or at least, he knew how to make this one look good.  He laps up the shots of the sere Western landscape (Spain, as usual in spaghetti westerns, stands in for the American frontier).  He knows whose faces the camera loves and gives them lots of affectionate close-ups.  He knows how to put a rose against a background that makes it look even redder, like a spot of blood on the screen.  Kudos to cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti, but the cinematographer can only photograph what the director tells him to, and Corbucci knew what to shoot.\n\nSecond, Corbucci manages to keep his leading man off of the screen most of the time.  Burt Reynolds is atrocious.  His stuntman, on the other hand, is superb.  They combine to give us Navajo Joe, one of the most athletic western heroes you&apos;ll ever see.  Unlike the typical western lead who gets most of his exercise transferring his Colt .45 to and from its holster, Joe believes in getting close and personal whenever he can, usually by flying through the air, climbing onto rocks and roofs, and otherwise dealing with the situation acrobatically.  The movie poster ridiculously shows Reynolds aiming a bow, which he never once uses in the movie; as any smart Indian would, Joe uses a Winchester rifle for long-range combat.  But he uses even the Winchester athletically, holding down the trigger and pumping the lever action frenetically to shoot down his foes.\n\nThird, that `Leo Nichols&apos; you saw credited with the music is really Ennio Morricone, who, with all due apologies to Nino Rota, is the undisputed king of Italian film music.  Like many of his themes it is a choral piece, apparently inspired by Indian tribal songs but reworked to fit Morricone&apos;s own standards, and it is superb.  NAVAJO JOE is the only movie I have ever watched solely for the music.  It is amazing to consider that Morricone did four better themes for Leone alone, while for most film composers this theme would be a career best.\n\nFourth, the movie exposes some of the injustices that European settlers did to American Indians without ever giving in to the modern assumption that the Indian victims of these evils must themselves have been saints.\n\nAs you can see, the elements of a classic western were there.  But alas, Corbucci dropped the ball short of the goal line.  For one thing, he hasn&apos;t got a clue what to do with Nicoletta Machiavelli.  She&apos;s the top-billed lady, and she&apos;s gorgeous, but she doesn&apos;t get to take any part in the action.  She doesn&apos;t even get to kiss the hero.  It goes without saying that the characters are paper-thin, and the one who is most humanized is not Joe but Aldo Sambrell&apos;s villainous Mervyn (who has a funny scene where he tears down the `Wanted&apos; sign for his brother and crumples it up, but carefully removes his own and puts it away for safekeeping).\n\nFurthermore, NAVAJO JOE is a textbook example of what Ebert called the Idiot Plot; that is, a movie whose plot can only proceed if everyone involved is an idiot.  The initial massacre which motivates the hero for the rest of the film depends on his wife being idiot enough to show not the slightest suspicion when an armed horseman rides up to her when she is alone and defenseless.  Joe&apos;s survival is due largely to Mervyn&apos;s inexplicable decision never to send more than two or three of his thirty-or-so outlaws after him at one time.  The secondary villain fails to see that, once he has guided Mervyn to the gold, Mervyn will have no more use for him.  Mervyn&apos;s hard-bitten brother Jeffrey is given an invitation that has `TRAP&apos; written all over it, and proceeds directly into the trap without the slightest suspicion.  The most absurd part of all, though, is when Mervyn drags the servant girl Estella into the street, right under the muzzle of Joe&apos;s rifle, and threatens to shoot her unless Joe surrenders.  Does Joe (a) shoot him through the head, or (b) surrender?  You guessed it, he surrenders.  Now does Mervyn, having seen that Joe will cave in to any threat to Estella, threaten again to shoot Estella unless Joe tells him where the money is? Nope, he spends fruitless hours beating the living dung out of our hero, and when that doesn&apos;t work, strings him up by his heels.  He doesn&apos;t even muss Estella&apos;s hair.\n\nNAVAJO JOE was Dino De Laurentiis&apos; answer to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. Obviously, it doesn&apos;t even come close; FISTFUL was every bit as stylish as JOE and had a good story too.  But if you measure JOE by what it achieved, not by what it tried to achieve, you&apos;ll find it&apos;s pretty decent. \n\n Rating: ** out of ****\n\nRecommendation: Western fans should catch it on TV."

The acting is terrible, and if this is the platform Brooke Hogan plans on launching her acting career... I suggest she slap on some spandex and hop in the WWE ring instead. And what about poor Carmen Electra? Clearly she&apos;s needing some cash or at the least some exposure in front of the camera because her suntan scene (no nudity) was ridiculous...",

Based on the true account of George Plimpton at Detroit Lions training camp. Looks at the dream of a weekend athlete and the camaraderie of team sport. The nostalgia of the sixties comes through well. Alan Alda does a fine job as do all the pros, giving the necessary realism. Plimpton does a good job standing in for fans and giving all of us a taste of the big time. At first he tries for a meaningful experience;later he strives to earn respect as he realizes the challenges these men face in professional sports. All backyard athletes dream of the sensation of competing at the highest level. Plimpton and Alda show how it feels behind the scenes in this engaging and entertaining film.",

One feels like calling it a day but wait....\n\nThe second third makes Lilli Palmer&apos;s character the center of the plot:a very interesting one,this German wealthy woman who betrays her country because of her Christian belief.This spy is not a routine femme fatale but a human being,who is smitten with remorse because the bombing which her informations allowed led to children&apos;s death.She has wonderful lines:&quot;in a war,every victim becomes a brother&quot;.Two marvelous scenes:the first one ,probably the strongest in the whole movie,shows Palmer in a confessional,telling her sins to a man she thinks is a priest;the second one,she&apos;s to be shot  in a jail,while Holden desperately tries,behind his bars, to say a last goodbye to her.Lilli Palmer&apos;s performance is moving,responsible and sensitive.\n\nBy the third part,no more Palmer,but the movie has hit its stride.Holden&apos;s return to Suede becomes an odyssey,with a lot of traps and his character has grown wiser and more human.He&apos;s able to show some compassion,probably the woman&apos;s influence.One of the most intriguing characters plays a small part now:a young boy,about 12,member of the Hitlerian Youth,proud of his uniform,he will make your hair stand on end.At the end of the movie,Holden has completely understood Palmer&apos;s line about the victims/brothers as the scene with Klaus Kinski testifies.\n\nGeorge Seaton has made an entertaining movie,which does not forget to ask questions and to moot responsibility.He does flay the nazi horrors,but he also puts the blame on the English agents ,stuffing themselves with lobster and sipping Champagne,while other people die unnoticed ,simply because the victims are their brothers."

Even better, they seemed to attract fairly big name stars of that time...This is not a great film, but it is what it is.  It&apos;s light hearted, funny, has some interesting musical interludes and outrageous costumes and is one of Jim carrey&apos;s earlier films.  There is not much of a story but the slight premise it is based on is still entertaining.  Would recommend to any child of the eighties!",

However, it isn&apos;t &apos;Star Wars&apos;, &apos;Star Trek&apos;, &apos;The Last STARfighter&apos;, or even &apos;Star Kid.&apos; This movie was made &apos;down under&apos; and we can expect no less from foreign movies. Like &apos;Star Crash&apos; before it and &apos;Star Knight&apos;, we have a movie that wants to be so many things we Americans made but simply could not do. And, like everything else, it comes out so dirty it should be condemned in the laundry pile to be burned completely. I&apos;m sorry, folks, this sucked hard.\n\nThe back of the box mentioned and stole a few words from the Star Wars common terminology and compared itself to the likes of Blade Runner, which wouldn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense. The &apos;droids&apos; here are simply people with jumpsuits, aluminum guns and creepy Chinese/Buddhist masks - and more often than not, these are midgets. With someone whose name is &apos;Deep Roy&apos;, which is really downright hilarious (especially the name typo - Kid? Grid? Fail.), this is pretty bad. The &apos;storm troopers&apos; are all poorly designs animatronics which look like something a child did for a science project out of whatever was in a junkyard.\n\nThe music goes on to copy, blatantly, the same motifs as Last Starfighter - and blatantly rips most of Luke&apos;s battles in Tattooine from the first movie. The villain even looks like Darth Vader! Gah, originality must be pretty hard to find, is it? Jesus Christ on a stick.\n\nNone of the movies I have seen so far are recommended. It&apos;s a proved fact you&apos;ll ignore most of them for private time on the computer or with a loved one rather than pay attention.",

Moving on from a previously familiar summer holiday romance scenario that ends in pregnancy termination, the story shows how the now sterile ex ballet dancer faces frustrations with her new husband. The married soldier that was the subject of her affair (I presume he was killed in action), leaves a widow who comes to haunt her, in spirit and in body.\n\nFor Bergman, we see his first slightly bleached-out ultra close up and face to face shot. The psychiatrist too makes a first appearance as emotional damage is pursued as a topic. There&apos;s also quite a bit of flash-backing and a train journey that runs through most of it which is supposed to symbolise both a passage in time but also the empty, barren vessel she now feels herself to be. \n\nThe distinctively intelligent dialogue that so appeals to me is sharp and acerbic, probably for the first time. &quot;I only stay alive so I can keep you as miserable as you&apos;ve always kept me&quot; is typical of Ingmar&apos;s angst. Subtleties of depressive subjects such as suicide are shown by someone leaping to their death into water but all we hear is a plover or some-such seabird changing its call. \n\nA little lumpy in its narrative but for those who love Bergman, the gems are starting to shine and we are reassured by the burgeoning qualities of who we now know to be one of the World&apos;s greatest ever directors.",

After a rocky start she and David develop a close bond.\n\nAs much as I enjoy Goldberg&apos;s comedy roles like &quot;Sister Act&quot; I love it when she does serious work like this. She is an excellent dramatic actress, that should have had more top roles.\n\nPatrick Harris is simply superb, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work here. \n\nDavid&apos;s parents seem so self-absorbed and unconcerned about their son&apos;s welfare. I really felt sorry for him. The ending is not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; one, but also not horrible either.... it&apos;s nice to see something realistic for a change.

She is rather ho-hum in Act I, but comes alive in Act III and especially the finale.\n\nThere&apos;s an effective, if rather by the book, setup to the movie, and that really is its saving grace, aside from a good score and willing cast. A little suspense, a decent mystery, and it is an alright slasher flick. Nothing overly special, but it is rather decent. I watch it maybe twice a year.\n\nDecent enough, and if you are a slasher fan, it is a must own.\n\nSemi-classic",

The skaters I was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of Skateboarder magazine back in the late 70&apos;s.  These were the guys we copied and tried to become while skating.  I am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be.  I am almost 40 years old now and I guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life&apos;s problems, however; this film did a great job of taking me back. Back to the vacant pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road trips to Cherry Hill NJ.  I suspect that in order to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it.  Otherwise, it probably won&apos;t have the impact on you as it did me.  But for those of you (and you know who you are), who did live it, you know exactly what I am talking about!  In any event, I don&apos;t care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie...do it! I give thanks to the Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thanks to Stacy for making this movie!  JOB WELL DONE!",

While they may have lived with less liberties than what we have today, they were also less burdened with modern plagues such as too much busyness including those that are self-imposed like smartphone obsessions. Travelogues of France will always be treasures. But for the modern viewer, to experience an era of simpler enjoyments is a nostalgic pleasure that is almost indescribable. - dbamateurcritic\n\nRATING: 10 out of 10\n\nOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by AgnÃ¨s Varda.",

      "name": "Not a smash finale (not that Melville knew this would be his last), but it&apos;s a must-see for genre fans",
      "reviewBody": "Perhaps under-looked when looking at the career of the director Jean-Pierre Melville, Un Flic (called &apos;Dirty Money&apos; in the states, but is also translated as &apos;A Cop&apos; on the DVD I viewed) is a crime film that goes another step with the heist genre, another (smaller) step with the cop/robber relationship, and shows Melville in (mostly) complete control over his storytelling. There are elements that seem to have evolved (or devolved, whichever you prefer) in Melville&apos;s work with the three films going in descending order- Le Samourai, Le Cercle Rouge, and finally this film. \n\nAs this very loose trilogy progresses (a trilogy I mark just by the presence of Alain Delon, nothing more in common aside from the genre), one may notice how Melville progresses with his stylizing, how with each film he goes a little less with characterization and dialog. With Le Samourai it&apos;s half a character study, in Le Cercle Rouge there are snippets, here it&apos;s all based on the timing of the cuts and subtle reactions. In fact, there is so much of the film that goes without dialog that Melville proves himself to be an opposite of Tarantino- instead of being clever at dialog, he&apos;s clever at the plot twist, and more importantly at making note of the &apos;left-out&apos; detail, letting the audience figure it out. While one can say this is not a great place for someone not familiar with Melville&apos;s work to start, it should not be a big disappointment.\n\nThe story is one you may have seen before, only here in far more calculated circumstances. Simon (Richard Crenna, in one of his better turns) is one of four who rob a seaside bank on a rainy, foggy afternoon. In one of Melville&apos;s most polished sequences, things go good and bad for them when one of the men is fatally wounded. Edouard Coleman (Alain Delon, not his best, but always keen at being icy) is on a case that coincides with another scheme Simon has, involving a suitcase heist on a moving train during the night. Not everything goes as planned, and the presence of a mutual love interest for the two (Catherine Deneuve, practically one-sided emotionally) only complicates things further, if not on the surface. This story is told very, very simply and without anything aside from the injection of mood onto every scene.\n\nFrom the opening heist on, Melville still has his chops technically-wise almost all the way through the picture. And after reading an interview with him, something about the look of the film made sense (which he said before this film was made): &quot;My dream is to make a color film in black and white, in which there is only one tiny detail to remind us that we really are watching a film in color.&quot; One feels that is what Melville is successfully experimenting with in this film, that the methods to which he and cinematographer Walter Wottizm get the scenes are not conventional. To correspond with some of the characters, the colors are cold, or distant, corresponding almost to the unforgiving underworld of Paris- some colors seem to almost blend together, the browns going along with the grays, and the brighter ones (sometimes merely in the background) feeling diluted. \n\nThat, and the crafty editing pulled by Patricia Neny (the suspense gets laid on thick in some scenes), make up for a couple of big liabilities- that Melville, on tight a budget that he was on, used models for the exteriors of the train sequence, and some scenes don&apos;t have a &apos;new-wave&apos; feeling (i.e. filmed directly on location) but rather cheaply in the studio. Not to mention that the performances from Delon and Deneuve are not really at their peak (Crenna is another matter).\n\nStill, the most pleasurable thing about a Melville film, whether its the poetic Les Enfants Terribles or the bittersweet Bob le Flambeur, is watching the story take on a life of its own. Some things you practically wait on if you&apos;ve seen Le Cercle Rouge or Le Samourai, like a wild dancing number at a nightclub (here abridged), or a detail to remind everyone who the outsiders are in this world (here portrayed by Gaby). \n\nAs another tribute to the old-style crime films of the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s its still tightly held together, with the pacing almost impeccable. In short, it&apos;s not a masterpiece of a crime film (Melville&apos;s last before his fatal heart attack), but it remains gripping thirty plus years later, with memorable qualities.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is actually a triple drama. It is the drama of an Italian police officer impotent to expose by normal legal means the cancer of total corruption in Italian society. This is on a professional level, which the film deals with extensively. It is also the drama of the same policeman on a personal level, his relationship with his son and the mother of his son, which we see less. And there is also the drama of the same policeman in his relationship with his closest colleague, the policeman Marino, convincingly played by Giuseppe Pambieri, a corrupt character who plays a double role, being also a mafia informant. The protagonist of the triple drama is the policeman Sironi, masterfully played by the brilliant Enrico Maria Salerno. John Steiner in the role of Lambro, as usual in many other Italian productions, plays an unscrupulous mafia killer. Venantino Venantini, an excellent comic actor in many other Italian or French films, plays a small mafia middleman, Mancinelli. Daniel GÃ©lin, father in real life of the beautiful actress with a tragic destiny Maria Schneider, plays the mafia boss Brera, who is executed at the end of the film, in an ingenious and original way by Sironi. The film&apos;s music is composed by the gifted Luis Enrique Bacalov, author of many excellent soundtracks from Italian cinema. Excellent scene from min. 14.08, when Commissioner Sironi punches an informant, Barone, played by the natural Memmo Carotenuto, so that he will not be suspected by those in the antechamber of the police station that he denounced. Director Romolo Guerrieri did a very good job.",

      "reviewBody": "Be forewarned--no matter what you see, this is THE last Pink Panther movie. Shortly after this film, Peter Sellers died and the studio had the nerve to try to continue the franchise! On the first, we have a female cop take on the case and interview all the characters from the previous films. In the second of these awful films (THE TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER), we find outtakes and clips from the previous Panther films being strung together with a tenuous plot. In the third, Roberto Begnini stars as Clouseau&apos;s son (a pretty lame way to continue the series). And just recently Steve Martin (whose career really seems in the dumps during the last few years) reprises the role. Uggh! Just let it go, folks! In this FINAL Panther movie, Sellers is up to his old craziness but the film isn&apos;t quite as way out and weird as the last. Chief Inspector Dreyfus is out of the mental asylum after it is widely reported that Clouseau is dead. Kato also thinks Clouseau is dead and turns the apartment into a kinky Chinese brothel. But, Clouseau is NOT dead and Kato&apos;s scheme is quickly uncovered. However, Dreyfus is not informed of this and when he sees Clouseau again, he thinks he&apos;s once again going mad. A cute entry and well worth seeing, despite Robert Weber and Dyan Cannon not exactly being the best supporting cast the series has seen.",

Let&apos;s face it, vampire movies have been done to death with all the creative juices long since having been drained out of them -- right? Writer-director Scott Leberecht, however, has somehow found a way to approach this material in such a way that, almost without your realizing it, and without resorting to any of the usual gimmicks, he&apos;s created a small, quiet movie that slowly gets under your skin and haunts the corners of your mind. The final image, resembling a Mayan frieze, will burn into your memory. Praise goes to lead actors Zak Kilberg and Maya Parish with a special nod to Jo D. Jonz as the worker in a hospital blood lab. While not as good as last year&apos;s &quot;The Revenant,&quot; this can at least be mentioned in the same breath and that&apos;s high praise indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "This amusing movie set in a perfect Victorian atmosphere (1870, England) speculates about what might have happened if Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) and Doctor Watson (Alex Cox) had met during their student times in London . Holmes falls in love with a beautiful youngster (Sophie Ward) , living with her uncle , a retired professor named Waxflatter (Nigel Stock) . Then , it happens several murders and Holmes helps Inspector Lestrade (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) to resolve it . Later on , young Sherlock performing feats of derring-do in London , including a spectacular flight and dangerous duels . Although Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not write about the youthful years of Sherlock Holmes , as he established the initial meeting between Holmes and Watson as adults . This affectionate speculation on what might have happened has been made with respect and admiration , knowing references to Sherlock&apos;s later existence and in tribute to the author in his enduring Works .\n\nThis stirring , fast-paced film is packed with noisy action , adventures , thrills , tension and results to be quite entertaining . It&apos;s a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense , intrigue and outstanding surprises . Nicholas Rowe is nice as obstinate and intelligent young Holmes as well as Alex Cox as timid and easy frightened John Watson . Some images are very creepy and eerie and developed in Â¨Indiana Jones and the temple of DoomÂ¨ style , for that reason is rated PG-13 for violence and crude scenes . Spectacular special effects by Kit West and Pixar Animation Studios making &apos;the glass man sequence&apos; and puppets by David Allen . Furthermore visual effects supervisor by Dennis Muren with some of the firsts , images made by means of computer generator . As this one is considered to be the first feature film to have a completely CGI (computer graphics image) character : the knight coming out of the stained glass window . And intervention by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (company run by George Lucas) animated the scene , overseen by John Lasseter in a very early film credit for Pixar . As the &quot;Stained Glass Knight&quot; took Industrial Light &amp; Magic artists 4 months to create . Atmospheric score fitting to action by Bruce Broughton and London symphonic Orchestra . Well written by Chris Columbus and lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg with his usual collaborators , Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy . The picture was well directed by Barry Levinson . Youth and little boys are likely to enjoy this fun film.",

      "reviewBody": "Kenneth Branagh is known for great Laurence Olivier remakes. His last remake was 1991&apos;s Hamlet. 16 years later Branagh is adapting one of Olivier&apos;s most famous films, Sleuth. He proves with his effective directing and camera techniques that he is still the greatest director for a remake. The film only has two actors, the legendary Michael Caine as he reverses his role this time around. In this film, the supposed Italian actor Milo Tindle is played by Jude Law. The film starts off with the camera cutting through security cameras throughout Wyke&apos;s (Caine) countryside estate. When Tindle arrives you find out that he is the lover to Wyke&apos;s wife. He simply asks for him to agree to a divorce, but Wyke has much more planned than that. The film then spends the rest of its time playing out elaborate mind games of deceit and trickery that will keep you guessing until the last second.\n\nUsually, I think it&apos;d be hard to watch just two actors for almost 90min. To pull it off, you&apos;d have to have two incredibly strong actors to pull it off, and they got the perfect people for it. Michael Caine brings Olivier&apos;s role a fresher sense of darkness and questionable attributes. While Jude Law easily proves that he is one of his generations top actors. For playing Caine&apos;s former performance, Law is sufficient enough to keep the film going. During the second act of the film, Law will surprise you with a stunning performance.\n\nBranagh&apos;s direction is somewhat courageous. He uses new camera techniques that haven&apos;t been seen before. Sleuth in some way is a dream for a cameraman. Branagh pulls off such interesting angles that it gives you different perspectives of what&apos;s going on in each scene. Whether your only line of sight is protruding through a set mini-blinds, it almost makes you feel like a peeping tom listening in on the mens conversation.\n\nThe script written by Harold Pinter is filled with eloquent dialog that will entrance you. The character&apos;s flip flop from good to bad constantly, so the dialog keeps you updated on who is winning the game. It also gives you a sense that there is a third character in the film. The house. It&apos;s incredibly high tech and is the reason for the same of the character&apos;s choices. Pinter also uses some of the designs in the house to help move the story along.\n\nHowever though, towards the end of the second act it seems that the two characters start to get too caught up in their own games and the film does get a bit contrived. It lost my interest a little at the end as well. The film ends abruptly but leaves you hanging. After talking about everything, my conclusion is that Sleuth is definitely one of the greatest remakes of all time. \n\nI give it an 8 out of 10",

Some losers are called for military service and after committing any possible mistake they could find are caught in the need to win a manouver against the superior American army.\n\nOf course the plot is kind of superficial, the character&apos;s development is simple and the humor is not challenging either. But no matter what there are a lot of good jokes and I was laughing almost the entire movie.\n\nAlso don&apos;t expect this to reflect a correct image of the usual military service in Germany. This is nowhere near reality but since the movie doesn&apos;t raise this claim anywhere..who cares?\n\nSo after all I say: Great movie to send your intelligence on vacation, catch a few friends and few beers and just have a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "People call Lamhe Yash Chopra&apos;s biggest risk but in my opinion Silsila was his biggest risk. That is because with Silsila he tried to make us feel sorry for adulterers Amitabh and Rekha. He succeeds in achieving that, we as the audience are made to feel that they are not bad people and it is more of a case of unfortunate circumstances. That is one problem I had with KANK, they way it was written I failed to garner any sympathy for Shah Rukh and Rani and that is a major flaw.Amitabh and Rekha are lovers but Amitabh marries his deceased brother&apos;s wife who is carrying his child leaving lover Rekha heartbroken. They actually try to forget about each other but fate has other plans for them and they are soon reunited.\n\nThe music, as per usual in a Yash Chopra production is exceptional and perhaps the music he has had in any of his movies. My favourites are either Dekha ek khwab or the holi classic Rang Barse. Speaking of Rang Barse I love the acting of Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bachan in that song. When the song starts they are happy with Amitabh&apos;s and Rekha dancing together but towards the end they start to get insecure, such great acting. Now onto the acting, Amitabh,Jaya Bachan,Rekha and even Sanjeev Kumar were all exceptional.\n\nWhen released it flopped but made its money back through reruns. Apparently people were unhappy about the fact that after Amitabh spends all the movie thinking about Rekha when they do run away together he ends up going back to his wife. That in my opinion was Yash Chopra&apos;s only fault and yet I still enjoy throughly despite the ending. After this movie was released rumours started to circulate that Amitbah and Rekha did have an affair during the filming of Silsila. I can&apos;t say whether it&apos;s true or not, its just some interesting trivia. In my opinion Silsila is the best Bollywood movie based on adultery and is miles better than Karan Johar&apos;s KANK.",

Everything&apos;s fine, until Snow White arrives there, escaping from a nasty queen (Nina Hagen!) that wants to get rid of her. It does not hurt that Snow White is quite a lovely good looking brunette, just about to turn 18... again, if you ever happen to get hold of this film, watch it and you won&apos;t be disappointed, it&apos;s a good one hour and a half of fun. I have no idea if it will be dubbed or subtitled around the world, but its humor is definitely universal, so don&apos;t be scared by its country of origin, Germany! You&apos;ll get 95% of the jokes anyway, and who cares if you miss one or two, when you&apos;re already rolling on the floor with laughter?",

The nudity that is shown seems more for function than exploitation.  Peta Wilson&apos;s performance is incredibly compelling and sensual.  &quot;Mercy&quot; is worth seeing for her presentation alone.  Add the somber mood of the film, the secret femme culture of rough sex that is explored, Ellen Barkin as a troubled detective, and what could have been merely an &quot;B&quot; Movie cop thriller becomes a special film that held me rapt from start to finish.\n\n Female protagonists dominate &quot;Mercy&quot;. I think that is one of the key factors that make it so entertaining.  It makes no apologies its depiction of its women being independent and living their own, albeit secret, lives. One learns gradually of this subculture as the erotic Vicki Kittrie reluctantly guides Detective Catherie Palmer through this dark, ethereal world in search of a killer. This is really a film worth enjoying. The acting is superb from one and all. The plot moves along with constant suspense, and the climax is gritty and real, yet stunning in its poignance. And that aura of the sensually erotic simply pervades every scene. I highly recommend &quot;Mercy&quot;."

There are plotholes,but the cast easily makes up for that.The couple Mason /Bloom is very endearing:Mason &apos;s character is a man whose ideals have been betrayed and his love for the beautiful English woman he tries to save is touching .Actually ,at the beginning,Mason was not friendly,he was even disturbing,but his moral stature  ceaselessly grows towards the end.The two stars get good support from German thespian Hildegarde Kneff,whom we miss in the second part.\n\nThis movie might have influenced two sixties work:&quot;the spy who came in from the cold&quot;(Martin Ritt,1965) which featured Claire Bloom  again,and &quot;torn curtain&quot; (1966),one of Hitchcock&apos;s minor movies in which we find a theater again!FF Coppola in &quot;godfather III&quot; ,like Carol Reed,took advantage of this by using opera music to enhance particular scenes.\n\nAlthough inferior to &apos;the third man&quot; (neither Welles nor Karas)  &quot;odd man out&apos; or even &quot;fallen idol&quot; (1948),&quot;the man between &quot; deserves to be seen."

There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.\n\nTaking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi&apos;s great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn&apos;t have.",

Meanwhile, a detective, James Dalton tries to stop him.\n\nFor the most part, this film is extremely dull. It draws itself out for far too long, and there is a subplot where the detective starts dating a nurse, which is completely unnecessary as it adds nothing to the plot. It&apos;s as if the director thought the film wasn&apos;t long enough so he tried to find excuses for it to be longer.\n\nWhile this film does have it&apos;s share of exciting scenes from time to time, it really doesn&apos;t have much else going for it. The acting isn&apos;t bad; not top notch, but acceptable. \n\nIf you are after a good vigilante thriller, you could do worse than &apos;The Exterminator.&apos; Then again, you could do a lot better too.",

I liked this movie so much that I have it on tape and watch parts of it over and over again.  Lots of people didn&apos;t seem to like this movie much.  Maybe, I liked so much because it reminded me of my college days in the 60&apos;s, in particular, how my wife and I got together there. I&apos;d give this movie an 8 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve liked the Spice Girls for years, but I&apos;m not sure why. Ordinarily, I don&apos;t care for their brand of dance-pop fluff, but somehow they make it sound good. Regardless of what anyone says, they are talented singers and dancers, and they show that numerous times. They&apos;re also pretty and most of them wear outfits that show a lot. And while they&apos;re not accomplished actresses, they are simply adorable.\n\nI don&apos;t think anyone intended this movie to be taken seriously. It&apos;s just good clean (well, slightly naughty) fun. Roger Moore comes the closest to giving a good performance, in a role that appears to be spoofing Bond villains. Just in case we don&apos;t get the joke, he pets a long-haired cat. \n\nOne of the funniest scenes has the girls complaining about people thinking they fit the stereotypical image people have of them. Of course, Emma says this while on a swing in a three-year-old&apos;s fantasy world.\n\nThe girls actually show they have intelligence. Or do they? I thought Melanie B was the one with brains. She&apos;s no better off than the others!\n\nAnother humorous incident: Victoria can&apos;t make up her mind whether to wear the short black Gucci dress or the short black Gucci dress. Emma suggests she wear the short black Gucci dress. Problem solved! \n\nOf course, the girls are being harassed by the tabloids, whose top personnel are shown being evil.\n\nAnd then there are the guys pitching their idea for a Spice Girls movie. Some of what we see is supposedly their imagination. Including a Dukes of Hazzard style incident with a bus, which was done so cheaply it&apos;s obviously not real. \n\nIn the closing credits, the girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves, not merely playing exaggerated versions of themselves. I&apos;ve never seen communication with the movie audience quite like this! \n\nIt&apos;s not for people looking for Shakespeare. But if you want to laugh and hear music that is bubbly and upbeat, this is pretty good."

The special effects are entertaining and the film tries to maintain a decent pace. But the story is a heap of nonsense, really. Oh, and Mark Hamill stars in this film. Who would have thought that the Mighty Luke Skywalker would end up in a looney-bin on earth? Watch &quot;Laserhawk&quot;, if you don&apos;t believe me.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; started the American kung-fu movie craze but I remember seeing it for the first time as &quot;King Boxer&quot; in Chinatown, NYC, without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I also was fortunate enough to see the American premiere of &quot;Five Fingers Of Death&quot; on Times Square, NYC. What a contrast this turned out to be...same film but different audiences.\n\nIn Chinatown, this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers. It was because of hearing the real voices of the actors(In Chinese) that made this movie more believable. Chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years(1972&apos;s &quot;Boxer From Shantung&quot; beat them all in gore), so the action choreography &amp; story were the main attraction. Rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. Every great kung fu film had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and FFoD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a known actor in Chinese theaters. The mostly Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. The audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.\n\nOn Times Square, this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard those strange British accents come from those Chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. Most American audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that, bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.\n\nI had fun seeing this movie with an American audience but enjoyed it much more in Chinatown. Some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD can&apos;t. The original &quot;King Boxer&quot; is still enjoyable...a CLASSIC!",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this version in the early 1970&apos;s on late night TV and recently in the 1990&apos;s can&apos;t wait for it to come out on DVD! Georges Marchal does a fantastic acting job as D&apos;Artagnan. A gorgeous man for sure physically though he doesn&apos;t resemble the D&apos;Artagnan character in the book Jean-Paul Belmondo in the 1959 and Gerard Barray in Bernard Borderie&apos;s 1961 2 part TV production did resemble the character. This story followed the book and thankfully did not omit too many characters or streamline characters. The Musketeers are well cast and defined. The Constance and Kitty are well cast. They are just like the characters written in the book.Cardinal Richelieu and Count de Rochefort excellent. Yvonne Sanson was a beautiful Mediterranean dark haired Milady de Winter and against physical type (Milady as everyone knows was a blonde)turned in a wonderful performance. Her performance was very much like Lana Turner&apos;s 1948 and Mylene Demongeot&apos;s 1961 and in my opinion she was just as good. Pia Douwes in the Dutch 2003 made a stunning auburn haired Milady de Winter.Acting and looks make the difference not hair color or physical type. Bourvil did a great job as Planchet as did Keenan Wynn in the 1948 and George Kinnear 1973 but for those familiar with the book Planchet though a lackey was not a clown and he himself went into military service himself at the end of the novel. The sets,scenery,authentic 17th century costumes are great.This movie did get film awards. As one user said the movie is slow and is right but it is not boring! I recommend this film to anyone who likes classic takes on Alexandre Dumas Three Musketeers. This film compares favorably with the Gene Kelly 1948 Three Musketeers and the 1961 Gerard Barray 2 part production.",

If you&apos;re not okay with a bit of gore and adult themes, this movie may not be for you. I don&apos;t want to give any spoilers, but the meat grinder scene did give little Olivia nightmares for weeks.... But overall, GREAT movie.

      "reviewBody": "This movie essentially begins with six European women being abducted while on their way to Australia by some Chinese pirates who intend to sell them in the sex-slave market. Once they get to the pirate stronghold one of the women resists and she is killed by the boss named &quot;Chao&quot; (Hsieh Wang). Fortunately for them a beautiful Chinese woman by the name of &quot;Ko Mei Mei&quot; (Hui-Ling Liu) helps calm them down at which point they reluctantly do as they are told. From here on the first half of the movie subsequently consists of the women being fondled--and almost raped on several occasions--with Ko Mei Mei always seeming to come to their rescue in the nick of time. Not only that, but she also has a brother named &quot;Ko Pao&quot; (Hua Yueh) who is intent on helping these women gain their freedom. However, in order to do that he has to bide his time and wait for the right moment. Realizing this, Ko Mei Mei proceeds to teach them a few kung fu moves to help them in preparation for the day when they will be sold in the slave market-and they become quite proficient very quickly. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather odd Chinese kung fu movie which was filmed in German and used English subtitles. As I mentioned earlier, it had a rather basic plot and mostly consisted of either scantily-clad women being groped or long scenes involving martial arts-or sometimes both at the same time. It also had some humor here and there as well. Yet even so, I honestly didn&apos;t think it was a very good picture and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",

      "reviewBody": "A disappointingly uneventful Thai horror film about a group of unappealing characters, trapped in a haunted location and finding themselves at the mercy of various ghostly figures. The premise behind GHOST GAME sounds good â BATTLE ROYALE with a supernatural twist, perhaps â but the execution turns out to be lacklustre and muddled in equal measure. After the usual chit-chat and setup to the story, the characters are split up either singly or into pairs and then face repetitive encounters with grey-faced spirits.\n\nThe film is billed as &apos;one of the most controversial&apos; ever made; in Cambodia, maybe, where folk took exception to the former Khmer Rouge setting and banned the movie, but certainly nowhere else. In fact, it turns out to be rather predictable. The ghostly encounters are played for maximum scares, but never unsettled me for a moment; I&apos;ve seen so many similar run-ins with spirits, zombies, etc. that I must have become rather jaded. The entire setup - with the shadowy locales, suspenseful music, and frightened actors - just feels passe, as if it&apos;s being performed by rote rather than with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nI didn&apos;t think much of the actors or indeed the director, either, and a script that&apos;s content to repeat rather than innovate just adds to the overall disappointing viewing experience. I don&apos;t know about the Thais, but I prefer my horror a little more sophisticated than in this predictable outingÂgive me SHUTTER any day!",

The use of light is wonderful and remembered me some of the takes from &quot;The Garden of Finzzi Contini&quot;. Landscape and architecture from Havana is incredible. The film is a little slow but as the internal way of thinking of the characters is complex. Anyway the acting must be recognized as one of the best films produced during the revolutionary era in Cuba. One remarkable fact is that politics is just as the background of the plot and not the main course.The house where Amada lives is part of the plot and with the advance of the movie shadows are more and more evident. Idillic recreation of the moments with Marcial remember some of the best of the Italian neorealist movement.",

There shows up Maciste : Reg Lewis, who comes upon two warring tribes . The main tribe is led by a barbarian chief : Andrea Aureli who attacks the enemy and abducting the women to sacrifice them by beheading . Then they asking for help Maciste or Maxus , Son of Hercules .\n\nA run-of-the-mill Peplum with the particularity being set in remote times, in a fantastic Earth full of astonishing monsters and two violent Homo Sapiens tribes , the Moon worshippers and the Sun worshippers . It contains spectacular battles , human sacrifices , eclipses, earthquake, cliffs collapsing , fantastic caves, men falling to chasm and anything else . Besides , here turns up surprising monsters made by regular Carlo Rambaldi who created most of them in the Peplum sub-genre . Rambaldi was a crafsman who worked hardship through the 60s , 70s, and 80s making special effects , make-up , scale-model and monsters in most of Italian films , in fact he was hired by Steven Spielberg to make ET . Stars Reg Lewis who was one of various Hunk-Men along with Steve Reeves , Gordon Scott , Rock Stevens , Dan Vadis , Brad Harris, Ken Clark, Richard Harrison, who emigrated from US to Italy to play absurd mythological Peplums , however none of them topped in popularity to Steve Reeves. Here appears some familiar faces from Italian Spaghetti , thrillers , Peplum as secondaries, such as : Andrea Aureli, Luciano Marin , Nello Pazzafini and Margaret Lee , Klaus Kinski&apos;s wife.\n\nIt contains a decent cinematography by Giuseppe La Torre with gorgeous outdoors from Ljubijana , Slovenia and shot in Incir De Paolis Studios , Lazio , Rome . This routine motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Guido Malatesta. He was an artisan who wrote and directed all kinds of genres with penchant for adventures , historical and Peplum, such as : Fire over Rome, , Colossus and the Headhunters, Raid of the Giants, Tarzana the Wild Woman, Goliath against the giants , La Rivolta Dei Barbari, I Predoni Del Sahara , Samoa , Son of Black Eagle , Mask of Scaramouche , Poppea&apos;s Hot Nights, Samson versus Pirates , Catalina of Russia, Giuditta e Olofferne, Zorro versus Maciste , Revenge of the Gladiators Maciste avenger of the Mayans , among others.

      "reviewBody": "This film puts you in the middle of a world where luck isn&apos;t all luck. In this world some people really *do* have more luck than others, and it can be transferred from one person to another by touch. But this isn&apos;t a film that spells things out-you&apos;re immersed and have to figure it out on your own.\n\nVery early in the film we see Federico win several rounds of roulette in a row, betting on single numbers. He goes to see the owner of the casino, Sam (Max von Sydow), who hugs Federico (taking his luck) and then throws him out of the casino. Federico wants revenge, so he begins to look for a very lucky person to help him. He finds TomÃ¡s, the sole survivor of a plane crash.\n\nTo say more about the plot would give away too much, so I won&apos;t. The film is visually beautiful and unique, and there are a few scenes that will likely stick with you for weeks (I can say this with certainty since as I write this it&apos;s been over two weeks since I watched the film). I&apos;m not normally someone who seeks out thrillers, but I&apos;m very glad I saw this one.\n\nSeen on 11/9/2002 at the 2002 Hawaii International Film Festival.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is quite mediocre. Nothing special happens, the plot itself is not that much epic, the characters are two dimensional and too much ordinary. The story is about shogun warrior Mayeda who is also a personal bodyguard to emperor&apos;s son. After the tragic death of his family, his emperor sends him to Spain to do trading. On the way and in the Spain, the trouble follows, so Mayeda has to protect emperor&apos;s sun and to show Spanish king his worth and trust. First of all script and directing are boring and too much predictable, obvious and simple. Simple, not in a good way. Now, we have actorsÂ This is one of the 90s appearances of Sho Kosugi in foreign films. But, here, I&apos;ll be honest, he tries hard to do some serious acting. He really does, and his character of Mayeda his one tough guy. Honorable and brave, the kind of character that you really enjoy. His son Kane Kosugi appears as emperor&apos;s sun Yorimune and I think he was not that bad and I think the character is pretty well written. A young and brash prince, who also holds high respect for Spanish king and bravery. Although, he is bonded by Japanese traditionÂ when it comes to the women, for example. The leading lady is Cecillia, played by Polly Walker. Polly was young and still has to learn about acting. Cecillia was nothing special, you could easily see that she was there only to fell in love with Mayeda. The leading villain is Don Pedro, played by David Essex. Pedro was funny and typical (spoiled and easily insulted) villain, full of boring pride. While David Essex didn&apos;t even try to act here. I was just not that convinced that he was Spanish. Now, for the serious stuff when it comes to the actors. We have John Rhys-Davies here. Yep, as a supporting Turkish villain. This is one of those times, when John started (perhaps) to appear in these low budget movies. We also have Toshiro Mifune, who plays Japanese emperor. He was OKÂ Mifune hardly fails in his performance. And we also have Christopher Lee as a Spanish king. What an excellent choice for the role, and to give a high ruling position in contrast to Mifune&apos;s Japanese emperor. That was just great. Lee was good, also hardly to fail. Although he looked kind of disinterested in his part. Other things as music, editingÂ well nothing special, as I said beforeÂ The movie also has a pretty interesting subplot about an evil plot that christians have with secret samurai clan to kill young prince. I could easily say, (maybe I am wrong) that this movie shows some evil Christian influence on high royals from that time. I don&apos;t necessarily recommend this film. But, if you are a fan of sword fighting, especially in this kind of film where Spanish swordsman fights a samuraiÂ but who will win? For that, you need to see the movie.",

So i went through the reviews at IMDb and found that it wasn&apos;t highly rated. Still i decided to give it a try as i did not have anything else to watch......and i must say this movie is well made right from the start be it the acting,the choreography,the locations....everything was perfect. The only thing i found wrong was that the characters details were shallow but even then i found this movie amazing.\n\nAll i want to say is that reviewers must not go along with the herd if some people criticize then they should as well. This movie deserves the recognition and the people who made it possible as well. Hence i would recommend people to watch this and not go according to the rating earlier shown.",

      "reviewBody": "In the chaos surrounding the Italian campaign, an American flier and a British officer meet after having escaped internment. They make their way north towards Switzerland. They are aided by ordinary people. When news comes that Mussolini has escaped the partisans, a local Fascist rats them out to the Germans and they have to make a run for it over the wintry mountains, leading a desperate band of refugees.\n\nThis Swiss movie was directed and co-written by Leopold Lindtberg. He knew something about being a refugee. He began his career in the theater and the movies in his native Vienna, but in the early 1940s, his Jewish religion forced him to flee to Switzerland. By chance he was able to cast this movie well: two of the &quot;escaped British officers&quot; were precisely that, and professional actors to boot; the American was a flier whose plane came down in Switzerland, and was being held there until matters could be sorted out.\n\nAlthough there are dramatic, theatrical moments, the setting in the mountains and towns of Switzerland, and the casting of locals lends a humanist air to the movie that made me think of Pressberger &amp; Powell&apos;s movies of the period. the camerawork is extraordinary; instead of using rapid cutting to create excitement, cinematographer Emil Berna uses a moving camera, with fast, long movements to produce a sense of panic.\n\nAlthough this sort of movie was almost a commonplace of the era, it&apos;s ANABASIS-like plot of trying to escape -- only this time, it&apos;s to Switzerland, instead of the sea -- and its fortuitous casting makes it extraordinary.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Epicenter&quot; has a neat premise but spotty execution, and is ultimately undone by lousy casting. But it&apos;s nowhere near as bad as the dogpile of negative commentators here would have you believe.\n\nGary Daniels is a techie who tried to sell spyplane plans to a foreign government, but is caught in the act by an FBI agent and stressed single mom laughingly played by Traci Lords.\n\nSuddenly, the Greatest Earthquake Ever Known doesn&apos;t send them to the Land of the Lost, but just makes it a little bit more difficult for Traci to deliver Daniels to the proper authorities, while the bad guys try to execute them both.\n\nYou know what? This movie was a hoot. It was a low-budget, Traci-Lords-starring, direct-to-video, not-enough-Jeff-Fahey hoot, and all you h8ters can just hush the heck up.\n\nSo what if this movie repurposes a scene from &quot;Metro&quot;? Have you seen &quot;Metro&quot;? I wouldn&apos;t wipe the schmutz under my nads with the rest of that movie. I&apos;m glad someone put its one decent action scene to a better use.\n\nAnd to all those folks crying, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s the same elevator from &apos;Speed&apos;!&quot; Find a girl, kiss her, and stop spending your time pointing out similar elevators in movies.\n\nDollar Tree had this for, yep, a dollar. Not sure I&apos;d spend much more, but glad I laid out the buck for this one.",

Neo-noir, I guess, is what they call post-1950 gritty crime films like these. \n\nEastwood&apos;s character in &quot;Tightrope&quot; is a complex one. On one hand, he&apos;s a wonderfully loving father of two sweet girls (one played by his actual daughter, and played well), and yet he is a weak man when it comes to prostitutes. But, whatever side he shows - light or dark - he&apos;s interesting, as always. So is the female star of this movie, Genevieve Bujold, a woman with a very intriguing face and just a trace of her French accent. Dan Heyada contributes strongly in a low- key performance.\n\nYes, this film is a bit too much on the seedy side for my normal tastes, definitely sordid, but very well done. It&apos;s a story that grabs you early and locks you in all the way.",

      "reviewBody": "Forget Jimmy Stewart and that claymation crap! If you like Christmas movies with more of an edge and lots of comedy however, &quot;Bad Santa&quot; might just be your new favorite holiday movie. In my mind, usurping &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; and &quot;Scrooged&quot; as the funniest holiday movie yet, Bad Santa (or BS as I like to call it) pulls no punches as it delivers a raunchy, yet funny, and yes, even a little bit of a touching film.\n\nBilly Bob Thorton is a drinking, fornicating, defecating thief who freeloads for the whole year, only to work 25 days in December while robbing a mall of all it&apos;s holiday proceeds. His partner in crime is Tony Cox, Santa&apos;s little person helper who keeps him sober and lucid enough through the season to not royally screw things up.\n\nI won&apos;t go into details, because frankly the plot needs work. But the acting is superb, the script hysterical, and the unbelievable jokes and inappropriate situations are just so entertaining you won&apos;t care about anything else.\n\nBernie Mac and Lauren Graham deliver polished supporting roles, as does John Ritter in his final film role before his death. The kid doesn&apos;t have many lines (and I want to slap him for the ones he does deliver), but just looking at him makes me laugh, so I can&apos;t complain there.\n\nBasically, this is the ultimate inappropriate Christmas movie; one that makes you stand up and scream, &quot;Holly s*!t I can&apos;t believe they did that!&quot; This movie is just so blatantly wrong, the only other film I can compare it to is &quot;South Park: The Movie.&quot; Just as South Park crosses every line of decency that previously existed, so does BS. A great movie because of it? Hell no. But a funny and entertaining one? Hell yes!"

      "reviewBody": "Not many people have seen this film. Those who have seen it, will either hate it or love it. I loved it.\n\nThe movie starts with a computer screen that says: I want to buy GOD.\n\nThe Prologue doesn&apos;t have any human voices. The world the director shows of Japan is obvious. A world of Japanese high-tech. Everywhere there are machines, nobody lives without it. Even as they communicate. As well as the running is been done on a machine.\n\nClara Law has a very interesting and personal view which shows us her own interesting personality that she is. Because of that movie I can&apos;t let go of that.\n\nShe succeeds in showing us her own vision of The Goddess of 1967 because she stays consequent by creating a contemporary and postmodern feeling. A feeling she got from her own environment. Born in Macau, studied English literature in Hong Kong.  Afterwards Film in London and lives with her husband in Australia.\n\nWhat Clara Law tries to explain in her movie is sort of autobiographic, it is obvious that she reflects this on the two protagonists. Both characters living in two completely different countries and cultures.  Clara Law doesn&apos;t work this movie out in a shallow kind of way. She does it within a own creative way and lets  the characters explore each other\n\n One character JM appears to be having everything he wants. Financial that is. He is so wealthy he believes he can buy god. Therefore he wants to buy this is beautifully car called the CITROEN DS from 1967. The GODdess. For JM this means freedom. Free of all the big luxury, being unhooked of all the machines.\n\nThe other character is BG.  A girl who has been blind for all her life. Because of a suddenly death of the dealer of the car, BG will lead JM the way to the real owner of the car. Or so she says.\n\nOnce they are on the road with the car, you can follow the mental way of both characters. On the road the flashbacks follow and the viewer learns the pain and history of the characters and why the are what they are.\n\n Neither silent or moving. Neither perceivable or imperceptible Neither nothing or everything. A state of mystery, paradox, ambiguity That is what I tried to capture in this film. CLARA LAW\n\nThank you Clara Law.....",

      "reviewBody": "There is Pop and Alternative; there&apos;s Blockbuster and Art-house. A third wheel to those pairings might as well be New Age. That&apos;s what this film is: new age.\n\nI liked the poster. I like Blue. And I liked the blurb I read somewhere: &quot;a young woman ... is overwhelmed by despair and depression after her fiancÃ©&apos;s sudden death. The film follows her touching emotional journey, revealing how her first love came to be and how she copes with the shocking loss.&quot; But yikes! This film is bad. It seems more like a shot at giving some J-idols and starlets a chance at big screen time with integrity but just because they don&apos;t have to act stupid doesn&apos;t mean they act well. Maybe they do act well but the film is so overwrought with phony angst that it&apos;s hard to tell. The music, and there is lots of it, is boring new age dreck, and I don&apos;t mean just the soundtrack. There are several full on scenes of someone tinkling on the piano for endless minutes of boredom. The direction is of the style that lulls you to sleep by trying to force a pace of real life. In real life hours go by and nothing happens but I don&apos;t want to see a movie of that. If I see someone get into their car and drive off down a really long rode at 5 miles per hour it means I can watch them for a very long time but I don&apos;t think it makes for whoop dee doo cinÃ©ma veritÃ©. This is the John Tesh of movies. Stay away.",

But Army Girl with its abrupt change from comedy to courtroom drama just doesn&apos;t quite cut it. And the villain and as the film turns out to have one is more of a lunkhead than anything else.\n\nCaptain Preston Foster along with his aide M/Sergeant James Gleason are transferred to a horse cavalry fort which as progress deems is about to be turned into a place for that new mechanized warfare that tanks are bringing. The operation, repair, and maintenance of the tank will take the place of the horse. A fact resented on the post by nearly all from its commanding officer H.B. Warner on down.\n\nWarner has a daughter in Madge Evans and Foster has a self imposed rule about dating army brats, but with a little sly trickery he and Evans are an item.\n\nThings get serious though when on a final test the tank has an accident and both Warner and Gleason are killed. Foster is brought to court martial and nearly blows his career.\n\nCertainly the tank proved its worth in the next year, unfortunately for the enemy. German tanks were infinitely the superior machine. The thought of that little job that Foster and Gleason drive around in going up against one of those panzer tiger tanks is laughable. \n\nArmy Girl got Oscar nominations for sound, musical score, and cinematography and did not bring anything home for Republic Pictures. And advances in mechanized warfare dated this film very quickly.",

      "reviewBody": "For fans of the comedic national treasure, Heinz Erhardt, this will be a treat. Anyone unfamiliar with Erhardt and his humor may find this film rather idiotic.\n\nThe Hirsekorns are a dysfunctional middle class family. Constantly competing with their neighbors in everything they do. A scene with the wives at the grocer&apos;s sets the stage for their feud. One housewife wants a long list of exotic food, then the other demands twice the amount of those same items, only with domestic brand names! &quot;Anything you can do, I can do better!&quot; Although middle aged, they act like spoiled children.\n\nThe main characters (along with this tone setting scene) are all introduced within 10 minutes. Aside from the constant talking, shouting and aimless running around (90% of which are done by Willi Hirsekorn and his daffy wife) there are many little jokes, put downs and thinly veiled insults a la Heinz Erhardt, which are probably worth the price of the DVD. The story and the overall production, however, is very dated and not quite up to the quality of other films of the classic German fluff/comedy genre.\n\nThe Hirsekorns&apos; two elementary school age children are extremely poorly behaved. The family could certainly benefit from a visit by &quot;Super Nanny&quot;. If you like Heinz Erhardt, you will enjoy his &quot;schtick&quot; and gloss over the obvious shortcomings of this film. I love Heinz Erhardt, and I watched the entire film for all of the gags.",

Look, the masses want to be led like a toddler through most movies - lookee here - point A to point B to point C - get it? He&apos;s good, he&apos;s bad. Wow - watch that head explode. Yawn. I like gore too but I also love intelligent films that leave it to an audience that WANTS to think - that wants to be challenged and has to try and figure out what is true and what isn&apos;t. Sam Rockwell, Vera F (as the wife), Dallas Roberst as the uncle and the young kid as Joshua all give excellent performances. This is not a HORROR film in the sense of gore and supernatural crap. This is about a family swirling out of control with post partum depression, work pressure, meddling relatives, a disturbed child and a crying infant - and it is left up to us to decide what really happened. Slow, steady and ultimately, powerful. If you have patience and love well made, intense dramas - JOSHUA is for you.",

      "reviewBody": "These days you can&apos;t throw a half-brick in the air without it landing on someone who can fly, or was bitten by a radioactive spider (and that&apos;s assuming that the &apos;half-brick&apos; in question doesn&apos;t GIVE the person it lands on the power to fly or climb walls!). However, back in 2009, superhero movies (or those generally showing young, good-looking people with superpowers) weren&apos;t quite always guaranteed to make as much money as today&apos;s average Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Therefore, &apos;Push&apos; sort of flew below radar at the time. I&apos;d like to say that it&apos;s achieved a &apos;cult following&apos; over time and it&apos;s a bit more of a &apos;sleeper hit,&apos; however, it seems to have been completely forgotten. And, in my opinion, that&apos;s a shame - I really enjoyed it!\n\nI guess to sum it up simply, it&apos;s a bit like the &apos;X-men.&apos; There may not be a &apos;recognised&apos; team of superheroes dedicated to saving the world here, but you do have a sub-group of human who are &apos;cursed&apos; with special powers and so destined to either be hunted by shady Government agents before being studied in Top Secret laboratories , or simply working for the afore-mentioned shady Government agencies.\n\nChris Evans is one such &apos;person of power&apos; - yes, THE Chris Evans who glossed over the &apos;Fantastic Four&apos; to become one of the headliners of the Marvel universe, Captain America. However, rather than wielding a red, white and blue shield (or being able to burst into flames at will!) here he&apos;s a &apos;mover.&apos; This is one of the many types of &apos;ability&apos; these &apos;special&apos; people exhibit and, in his case, basically means someone with telekinetic powers. He&apos;s currently on the run from the authorities in Hong Kong, but his life of hiding comes to a premature end when a young &apos;watcher&apos; (someone who can see the future and played by Dakota Fanning) tracks him down in order to help her rescue more of their kind.\n\nWhat follows is effectively a &apos;chase movie&apos; where the &apos;gifted&apos; youngsters are pursued by their evil equivalents. And, like I say, if you like superhero-type movies, it&apos;s all good sci-fi fun. The characters are likeable enough and there&apos;s good chemistry between the leads. Plus there&apos;s plenty of action and a few fight-scenes using special powers which are quite inventive and do stick in your mind once the credits have rolled.\n\nIf I had to mention a negative side (besides the kind of uninspiring title!) I&apos;d say that the world which we find ourselves watching does need a lot of explaining so that you know all the rules of how it all works. Nowadays, we know what to expect in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but, back then, there was quite a lot of &apos;exposition&apos; supplied in lengthy voice-overs of segments of dialogue. I&apos;m not sure whether &apos;Push&apos; was based on a comic, or book, but it felt like you&apos;d certainly pick it up quicker if you&apos;d read a great deal of backstory surrounding what&apos;s going on. And, it&apos;s because of this lack of knowledge as to what powers people possess, that our heroes seem to bounce from one scene after the next meeting a new person with the exact superpower required to either get them out of their current predicament, or move the story along.\n\nHowever, I can forgive that and simply enjoy it for what it is - a harmless piece of superhero fun. Even if it never got the recognition that I felt it at least deserved, it&apos;s still fun. And, if you can find it on any of the popular modern streaming services, I&apos;d recommend you watch it - even if it&apos;s just to see what Chris Evans did before life in the MCU.",

      "reviewBody": "Toby Hooper&apos;s follow up to his classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) was this atmospherically bizarre horror oddity.\n\nDeep in the swamps, a crazed hotel owner is keeping a monster crocodile in his yard and occasionally feeding offensive people to it!\n\nAs with Texas Chainsaw Hooper gives this film lots of spooky atmosphere, but he really puts it into over-drive with Eaten Alive. The story is a bit disturbing and far more gruesome than Texas Chainsaw. The characters that parade through this film range from back-woods yokels to warped weirdos! Hooper gives the whole movie a kind of garish and bleak style that adds all the more to its off-beat weirdness.\n\nThe cast is good, Neville Brand makes for an especially convincing madman. Horror fans will see lots of familiar faces in the cast - Marilyn Burns (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), William Finley (Sisters), Robert Englund (Elm Street movies), Janus Blythe (The Hills Have Eyes), and young Kyle Richards (Halloween).\n\nWhile Eaten Alive doesn&apos;t reach the nightmarish heights of some of Hoopers other films, it is a good B horror picture. For those looking for a twisted horror film it will more than suffice!\n\n*** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "At the beginning I should mention that I live in Sarajevo, and I was a civilian in a besieged city, so that explains my perspective from which I was watching this movie, and experience I carry from it.\n\nThrough the whole movie, one thing kept torturing me: What is this movie about??? Is it about Michael Henderson and his moral issues, is it about all journalists and their moral issues, is it about Flynn and his understanding of war, is it about worlds&apos; understanding of that war, is it about Sarajevo, about Emira, about orphans? This movie needs focusing on one goal, because this way I&apos;m left with 100 stories that don&apos;t actually fit together and I don&apos;t know what I was watching the past 1,5 hours. Pictures of war make their message very clear, but then its messed up with the story that tries to cover too many things at the same time. So is it fiction? Well, no. Is it a documentary? Well, no, not that either...\n\nMost places shown in the move are totally wrong. Characters keep jumping from one end of the city to another in matters of seconds, some events that really happened are shown in wrong places, many times characters enter streets that in real life were sniper alleys etc. (meaning no way one could get near and stay alive), military checkpoints are mostly in the wrong places and so on, but one can forgive details like that.\n\nWelcome to Sarajevo is trying to show you how it was, living in Sarajevo under siege, but its constantly missing the point and showing the wrong things. If you want to know how it looked like, watch a documentary.\n\nTo date the only realistic movie about Bosnian war is No Man&apos;s Land, and that would be my highest recommendation. Other than that, Lepa sela lepo gore is worth watching."

First of all it has a very cheesy name, sounds like another cheap remake and DVD cover looks also not that good. But being a fan of zombie movies I decided to give it a try. I started watching it and first 35 minutes were just as I expected the whole movie to be, but surprisingly after first 35-40 minutes it gets much better, special effects, plot and even acting gets better, well acting gets better because all amateur actors are killed by zombies. I would say you can fast forward first 25 minutes, since nothing much happens in the beginning.\n\nI liked this movie and would recommend it to all zombie fans :)",

A most laudable work of love to preserve those memories of American history by filmmaker Connie Field, as told by those who were protagonists: in this case, the director reconstructs the symbol of &quot;Rosie&quot;, as five American working women tell their stories, when they took the posts left by men who went to the front during Second World War, and who were later displaced from their jobs, when the battle was over, the men returned and claimed their positions. A must see.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a visually stunning and emotionally moving tribute to the everyday people that make America great. Unlike those films that live to tell us how horrible things are, this one shows the faith, love and determination that make this nation.\n\nWhile some chose to focus on celebrity, this shows everyday people. From a farmer and his son in Vermont to a father and his disabled son who run the Boston Marathon, it is a heartwarming view of good and decent people.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking and the director made the wonderful choice to not have a narrator, referring to allow the people to tell their own stories.\n\nI&apos;ve noticed many find this to be bad because they see it as somehow patriotic (I guess for some people that is a bad thing). Many also blast it for being a pro-Bush or post 9/11 rally film.\n\nPerhaps they failed to listen to the audio commentary by the filmmaker who points out that most of this was filmed BEFORE 9/11. Indeed he has been working on it for 20 years, so a good portion of it was made during the CLINTON years. Perhaps it&apos;s OK if it supports him ?\n\nNor do they take into account the fact that, from what I&apos;ve been able to find out on the net, the filmmaker is actually a Democrat who did not support Bush in 2004.\n\nI won&apos;t go into the debate over diversity in the film since many have already pointed out that the film is quite diverse.\n\nI think this film taps into the real divide in America today. Most people in the United States love this country, regardless of whether they are liberal or conservative. They may dislike policies or leaders, but they love the country.\n\nA small group simply hates America. To they all is bad, nothing is good, and any optimism or positive thought is wrong.\n\nThat angry elite may find this beneath their standards, but for most of us it is a wonderful 90 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "This film has suffered some pretty undue criticism. It gets the dreaded `BOMB&apos; rating in Leonard Maltin&apos;s guide, followed by `The worst film of a great director.&apos; I haven&apos;t seen more than a couple of Penn&apos;s other films, so I can&apos;t comment on that, but it is hardly a bomb. Sure, it is a little slow moving, and it doesn&apos;t quite feel like the themes of the film were totally panned out, but most of the film is very good. I&apos;m assuming Brando&apos;s the problem with most of the film&apos;s detractors. Wow, is his performance weird here. If you ever wanted to find the missing link between The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, here it is. He plays a bounty hunter of sorts hired to discover some horse thieves and murderers. This character is very eccentric, and I&apos;m guessing that Brando had a lot of artistic input on this one based on his later career. He&apos;s basically a psycho killer, and he seems much more lawless than the criminals he&apos;s seeking. He also speaks with an Irish brogue, some of the time. Personally, the waxing and waning accent is my only real problem with the role, and I&apos;m not a big accent baby anyway. It&apos;s a tiny flaw in what is otherwise a very interesting performance. Brando creates a very memorable character. Jack Nicholson plays his rival. He&apos;s almost ready to go straight, having found a nice, small ranch and a girlfriend (Kathleen Lloyd). His performance is subdued, and I really think Nicholson is best when he&apos;s like that. This isn&apos;t his greatest performance, but it is subtle and it&apos;s very good. The flaws of the film are offset by the number of great scenes in it. Almost every single actor gets one scene alone with Brando, and both Randy Quaid and Harry Dean Stanton deliver excellent performances especially in those scenes. Nicholson&apos;s two best scenes are also alone with Brando. I would guess than he had something to do with their co-star; I do think Brando deserves some credit for the excellence of these scenes. Penn&apos;s direction is nothing to write home about. I love the two other films I&apos;ve seen by him, Mickey One and Bonnie and Clyde, but, let&apos;s face it, he was more or less ripping off the Italian and French cinemas of the time, respectively. Missouri Breaks is much more straighforward in that respect, and perhaps it is here that it could have used a boost of energy. 8/10.",

About every film element ever used, runs its course before the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry, a training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.\n\nThe battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.\n\nThe dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and coupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it gruelling if you are not instantly gripped.\n\nThis will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if sci-fi isn&apos;t your thing get comfy and bring a pillow.",

Sure,there was not really much Budget for it.But the sexualized torture scenes work very good out.\n\nThe whole Movie was shot in Austria.They used most of the same Locations like the first part.Last Fall i visited Lungau,Mauterndorf in Austria. They shot in real torture Chambers at Castle Moosham!This Castle was a real place for this,where SchÃ¶rgen Toni examine &quot;witches&quot; in the witch tower.Now this place is hunted!\n\nThey also shot at Castle Finstergruen exteriors for the Movie.A few shots where made at Castle Mauterndorf.For example in the scene with the young maid that buys ingredients for an &quot;love-drink&quot; and than took a away for torture.This was shot in the inner Bailey of Castle Mauterndorf.\n\nWhen you wanna made a bizarre trip to Austria,visit Lungau(Region Salzburg).\n\nJoin this Movie when you liked THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL or MARK OF THE DEVIL!\n\nAt least one correction: In the first review of this Film,the writer made a mistake about the Cast.Anton Diffring plays the Witch Hunter Balthazar Ross.Not the Priest! Father Melchior is played by German Sexfilm-Actor Dietrich Kerky.",

      "reviewBody": "17 Girls (2011)\n\nLots of mid-teen girl stuff on French beaches. And yet supposedly a social issue movie about a rash of intentional pregnancies at a high school. There are scenes between the girls that pry into contemporary youth culture but only get the lid off. This is a sensational idea with the depth of a single gasp.\n\nEven stranger, once you get into it, is how the movie makers, the writer/director pair Delphine and Muriel Coulin (both did both), took an American high school news story and adapted it to this small industrial coastal city in France. It doesn&apos;t right true. The utter rebellion of the kids to reason, their various trajectories around peer pressure and media hype, and the general glibness of some of the school reactions all seem a bit callous, and without nuance. \n\nThere is an attempt at depth (and some of the best acting) though the main character, Camille, played by Louise Grinberg. Here the need for such rebellion seems to have roots in her psyche and her family situation. How this effect &quot;spreads&quot; and becomes an easy viral sense of irresponsibility is not given much thought, however. There are three or four other girls who are given some complexity, but not enough to quite explain their motiviations.\n\nMaybe the project was doomed when the writers faced the central problemâthis is both about a large effect (over a dozen girls, en masse) and an individual problem (one by one). How to do both? Especially when it happens pretty much simultaneously.\n\nThere is a low budget documentary on the real dealâ&quot;The Gloucester 18&quot; which is apparently (from their press kit) a kind of public service piece against teen pregnancyâ and there is a TV series in Spanish called &quot;El Pacto&quot; that supposedly expands on the sensational aspects of the story. I&apos;m not sure any of it is worth the trouble more than just reading a new article about the phenomenon. The movie here is curious at first, slow to get going, and has a few interesting moments, but it hardly holds up over an hour and a half.",

I call it a &quot;fantasy&quot; because, sadly, we&apos;ve become too aware of how real crime and criminals work. There&apos;s no effort to conceal faces, the robbery crew addresses each other by first name, Powell plays soothing music and engages in witty banter with those he&apos;s robbing, but nonetheless it&apos;s very entertaining to watch. Another odd aspect of this unusual film is that Powell gives his victims marijuana cigarettes to smoke, to make them passive and jovial. This is one of those pre-code films from that tiny window where sound had come in, the depression was on and the Production Codes weren&apos;t re-writing movies like Jewel Robbery. See it when you can. Like the object of it&apos;s main character obsession, it is truly a gem."

      "reviewBody": "Often nicknamed the &apos;Godfather of Gore&apos;, cult-director Lucio Fulci is doubtlessly most famous for his gruesome Zombie films. The man&apos;s greatest achievements, however, are (in my humble opinion), his comparatively gore-less, but spine-chilling and extremely elegant Gialli from the 70s. After the brilliant &quot;Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino&quot; (aka. &quot;Don&apos;t Torture A Duckling&quot;, 1972), which I would name as one of the top-5 Gialli of all-time, &quot;Sette Note In Nero&quot; aka. &quot;Seven Notes in Black&quot;/&quot;Murder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes&quot; of 1977 is a close second on my list of the greatest Fulci films, and it also ranks among the true greats of the Giallo genre in general. \n\nAs a child, the clairvoyant Virginia has a vision of her mother&apos;s suicide at the very moment of its occurrence. As an adult, Virginia (Jennifer O&apos;Neill), who has recently married the wealthy Francesco Ducci (Gianni Garko) continues to have menacing visions. One day, she has the disturbing vision of a gruesome murder, in which a woman is being walled in...\n\nI do not want to go deeper into the plot, because this brilliant film is filled with clever twists from the very beginning. &quot;Seven Notes in Black&quot; contains no sleaze and hardly any gore, but has an incredibly intriguing and suspenseful plot containing ingenious red herrings and unpredictable plot twists, and is filmed in an incredibly beautiful yet unspeakably creepy visual style. While the film includes little blood and only very few gruesome scenes, the suspense-level is extremely high and intense, and the mystery is maintained until the very end. A fascinating plot, a truly haunting atmosphere and uncanny visual style make this one of the most tantalizing Giallo-experiences ever brought to screen. The score is another insanely brilliant aspect about &quot;Seven Notes in Black&quot; - Seldom is a soundtrack as successful in building up tension, and beautiful to listen to at the same time. Especially the haunting &apos;Seven Black Notes&apos; theme is incredible; I&apos;m sure Quentin Tarantino had good reasons to re-use it for &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. The performances are also very good. The ravishing Jennifer O&apos;Neill is great as the original and likable protagonist Virginia. The biggest name in the cast is doubtlessly Gianni Garko, who is most famous as star of many Spaghetti Westerns, and who delivers another great performance here. However, all cast members (many of them Italian Horror regulars) fit greatly in their roles. Overall, I can not come up with a single negative aspect about this film. &quot;Sette Note in Nero&quot; is incredibly suspenseful, genuinely creepy, extremely elegant and simply brilliant in all regards. No lover of Italian Horror can possibly afford to miss this tantalizing Giallo-gem, which is yet another proof that Fulci was a Horror-genius! 9.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "The partnership of actress Marlene Dietrich and director Josef Von Sternberg was a justifiably famous one, and could even be seen as iconic (personally do consider it so). They did seven films together, starting with 1930&apos;s &apos;The Blue Angel&apos; (perhaps the most historically significant) and ending with 1935&apos;s &apos;The Devil is a Woman&apos;, all of which ranging from good to outstanding (the weakest to me being &apos;Blonde Venus and that was still good).\n\nOf which &apos;The Devil is a Woman&apos; is one of their best, along with &apos;Shanghai Express&apos; and &apos;The Scarlet Empress&apos;. It does end on a bit of a curiously odd note and it&apos;s a tad over-stuffed in places. All that aside, &apos;The Devil is a Woman&apos; to me was a great film with a huge amount to admire.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dietrich. She was never more beautifully captured on film than in her collaborations with Sternberg and &apos;The Devil is a Woman&apos; is not an exception. As with her previous films with him she looks luminous, not just lavishly made up and costumed but gorgeously photographed. As for her acting, once again she is fun to watch but also brings a vulnerability to her role which helps make the role a real character.\n\nShe is very well supported by Lionel Atwill, excelling in an atypical sympathetic leading role (more familiar with him as a supporting actor), and Cesar Romero&apos;s usual suave charm proves crucial in making the most of a character not quite as interesting as Dietrich&apos;s and Atwill&apos;s. Edward Everett Horton is hilarious. Sternberg&apos;s direction is as accomplished as ever.\n\nCan always count on a Sternberg film to be visually beautiful, and &apos;The Devil is a Woman&apos; does not disappoint. Not just the striking use of light and shadow lighting and the sumptuous settings and costuming but especially the cinematography, which is often enough to take the breath away. The music score is stirring yet not intrusive.\n\nScripting is sophisticated and humorous, and the story is compelling and actually has more depth than one would think. The erotic, sensual atmosphere intoxicates too.\n\nIn summary, a devilishly good film, what a film to go out on for Dietrich and Sternberg. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Negative comments sort of miss the point, as this movie wasn&apos;t designed to be anything more than harmlessly amusing. To say anything bad about it is rather like kicking a puppy. You wouldn&apos;t kick a puppy, would you?\n\nI needn&apos;t go into the plot, which you can click a few links to find, but I sought this movie out because Jean Reno is fun in anything he&apos;s in, and oh lookit that, Luc Besson wrote the screenplay-- can&apos;t go wrong with that, can you? (unless it&apos;s an American remake, which luckily this is not).\n\nThis movie is FUNNY, at times a little cheesy (which we can also call FRENCH), and the action is over-the-top enough to be cartoonish (when Hubert punches someone, they fly back 20 feet). This is essentially a wacky comedy with some action, something Americans aren&apos;t used to seeing, but well worth a look. It&apos;s harmless fun, but still more original than your average paint-by-numbers American romantic comedy. Or action film.",

Every member of the band gave excellent performances, including Freddie Mercury&apos;s vibrant, arena rock voice will make the hair at the back of your neck stand up. Too bad I was too little to witness any of Queen&apos;s concerts when Freddie Mercury was still rocking the Earth. But now, with the magic of DVD and the power of digital remastering, you can almost feel as you&apos;re there among the other Queen fans. Great DVD for anyone getting into Queen or hardcore fans who do not own this instant classic yet. One of the minor concerns I have that really has nothing to do with the way they made the DVD, but the actual concert itself. The song &quot;Flash&quot; was an intro and was not really a live performance, and I would have liked to have seen it get performed live. Instead, they fly in on the helicopter when the concert starts.",

As far as I know it was never commercially released in the U.S. Based on a fictionalized memoir, it concerns a teenage German soldier captured in Poland at the end of W.W.II and falsely accused of war crimes.  It&apos;s an extra-ordinary and complex exploration of the concepts of guilt, innocence, betrayal, justice, and self-deception.  It&apos;s not a movie about good guys and bad guys, winners and losers.  Rather, it concerns issues of both personal and institutional responsibility during war and its aftermath, and it&apos;s immensely moving. Not flashy cinema on the surface, but so beautifully written and acted that it stands out as one of the most haunting war films I&apos;ve seen in the last several years (far more so than the recent jingoistic Hollywood blockbusters).  It poses difficult, complex questions about human behavior during war, and offers no simple answers.",

      "reviewBody": "The undead have taken over the world. What traces of humanity remain have taken to backing themselves into protected cities and getting supplies by venturing out in heavily armoured groups to raid smaller towns. One such city is formerly Pittsburgh, where the rivers provide natural protection and those who organised themselves into leaders have created a world of near normality while the rest live in the streets with less material and more risk. One of the raiders (Riley) is sure that he has seen evidence of learning among the undead but events within the city itself cause him more concern as his former second-in-command decides to take violent revenge for being betrayed by city boss Kaufman.\n\nHow you receive this film is more about you than the film itself (which I suppose is true of most things in a way Â everything has a market somewhere). Those that will love it will be those looking for gore as their horror because the film delivers this in spades. The camera lingers on flesh eating, mutilation and some very painful sequences that had me looking away. However the problem for me was that it was just gore Â not horror, not scares and not anything that made me feel uncomfortable in my own house. A minor criticism perhaps but let me assure you that me and zombie movies do not mix well and not only do I get scared during the films but also for days afterwards by the idea of it all.\n\nSurprisingly then I was able to watch Land of the Dead with a detached air and it never convinced me of the world I was being shown. Part of this is budget but that&apos;s not all of it as I never bought the characters or main story either. The story in particular narked me because it did dominate the main horror (the mass of undead) and spent too much time on the detail of the human interactions and betrayal. In itself this is not a killer and indeed recently I saw The Mist do a very good job of making human monsters just as scary as the rubber ones but here Romero doesn&apos;t make as much of his social commentary as he could have done Â OK so we have the haves and have-nots but beyond that we don&apos;t get much in the way of intelligence.\n\nThe cast reflect the low budget but are good enough for the level that this is working on. Baker is a bit bland but OK, while Leguizamo at least adds a bit of energy to his character. Hopper takes on a fairly easy role of just being a &quot;Mr Big&quot; character that even done in P Diddy/Daddy music videos in the past. Argento is sexy but little else while Joy is pretty good in his support character. Clark is better than a zombie character will get him credit for and makes his stuff quiet interesting and engaging. In regards getting the best &quot;urgh&quot; impact from his gore budget, Romero does well but I was surprised that he didn&apos;t do more as a writer or as director to do better with the characters or the tension/danger within the story; like I said, I was surprised by how much of an observer this film allowed me to be.\n\nWorth a look for gore fans and those seeking out some old school zombies in the middle of these modern &quot;28 Days Later&quot; type ones but really this film is a bit of a disappointment in just how average it is. The gore is great but it produces repulsion, not scares and Romero cannot create a sense of genuine horror or fear as he tries to deal with a narrative that takes more than it gives."

The fact that the movie is not of a commercial nature doesn&apos;t make it bad, it just makes it less accessible. In this manner, it is just as bad for movies as a science paper is for publications.\n\nAnyway, the film is based on a book of Romanian Mircea Eliade, one that I didn&apos;t read. Actually, I didn&apos;t read most of Eliade&apos;s work for the very reasons people bad mouthed this film. Then I entered adolescence :-P.\n\nThe film, though, is a resounding success to me. Not only that it is well done, but at the end of it, it let me wanting to understand more and to read the book. Maybe I will one of these days. As the film is impossible to summarize here, I will get to a quick conclusion.\n\nBottom line: a heavy feeling film, with a complex script and a lot of philosophical ideas of Eliade&apos;s scattered through the story; also some of his personal obsessions: orientalism and the loss of the love of his life. I personally think it was a great movie, but it became a bit confused at the end.",

      "reviewBody": "After the slightly disappointing &quot;...Outta Sight&quot;, the series revolving around the Olsen Gang take a flying leap towards their peak yet again. In spite of a very silly sequence that wouldn&apos;t have looked quite so out of place in a show by Benny Hill or an old black and white silent film a la Charlie Chaplin, this is one of the best of the franchise. Dealing with the future of Denmark, the plot is exceptionally well-written. It evolves very nicely throughout the film, and the pacing is perfect. The acting is of the typical high level, with more or lesser known Danish actors of the time shining in the many smaller roles in the film. The humor(apart from in the scene mentioned above) is excellent. With the usual plays on words, sophisticated jokes and funny running gags, not to mention the masterful human touch that brings us so close to these characters(main as well as supporting), what grounds it all, what pulls us in. As Kjeld struggles mercilessly to access a meal that he&apos;s been anticipating for a long time, we can laugh at it, not because he&apos;s pitiful... but because he&apos;s real. We feel his pain. We can recognize it. Anyone who&apos;s seen the film knows exactly what I&apos;m referring to, and I refuse to ruin it for anyone who hasn&apos;t. We are treated to some nice visuals in this one... the film takes us inside the Copenhagen City Hall(as far as me and my father could tell, shot on location), and even into the tower and to the City Hall Clock... and that&apos;s all I&apos;m saying, as the scenes that take place there are too good to spoil. More fun is had with Germans, specifically through the character of The Black Baron. With an unusual opening, a completely different(though understandably so) Yvonne and a very funny variation on Egon being rescued and having the impassioned, sentimental speech after-wards, this certainly also manages to divert nicely from what has been established as normal for the films. Also, BÃ¸ffen is unusually witty, this time around, which works quite well. More machinery that would have made the (nationally)famous Dane Storm P. proud. This time around, Benny shows unexpected skills, and Kjeld is put on a diet. More pseudo-German, this time, spoken by Benny... in a hilarious and short scene. This is the tenth in the series, and it also came out exactly ten years after the first... something that the filmmakers made something of a bit of deal out of, in the film. I&apos;ll leave for the viewers to find out how. I recommend this to any fan of the series and/or of Danish comedy of this period. 8/10",

After a wait this long it&apos;s even more a shame that such a big event in Dutch history turned out to be such a disappointing movie. Where other movies, like for instance Titanic, successfully use a personal drama as a metaphor for the bigger picture, &apos;De Storm&apos; gets lost in a totally unrealistic and very one dimensional story about a woman losing her baby. The movie ends up almost ignoring the tragedy all those other thousands of people where facing during this flood. The characters in this movie aren&apos;t properly introduced so as a spectator you feel no connection at all with the leading roles. The dialogs are very poor and the acting, especially from leading lady Sylvia Hoeks, is a disgrace!!! \n\nJust do yourself a favor and avoid this movie",

      "name": "Very attractive and quite accessible for a &quot;gay-interest&quot; film",
      "reviewBody": "This is basically the story of a young man (Yannick Renier), who is haunted by childhood memories of his father&apos;s suicide and mother&apos;s subsequent mental breakdown. He is traveling to the south of France/north of Spain on an ominous mission that involves his mother and the gun his late father used to commit suicide. At the beginning of the story he already has two traveling companions, a brother and sister (Theo Frilet, Lea Seydoux). The uncertain sexuality of the protagonist is established in the opening scene where Seydoux&apos;s character does a very sexy striptease for him (that would have any man who&apos;s NOT very. very gay visibly aroused), but with no effect. He is more drawn to the brother, who is openly gay, but clearly he is sexually confused. A fourth person then joins the group, a handsome hitch-hiker (Pierre Perrier), who becomes a love/sexual interest for the nymphomaniacal sister (even though she is ALREADY pregnant when the movie begins). But this new additional too seems to have some bisexual leanings.\n\nThe combination of melancholy flashbacks, beautiful scenery, and gay and straight sexual encounters kind of reminds me of &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. This isn&apos;t in the same class as that one(although some might consider it less pretentious since it doesn&apos;t break into Shakespeare in the middle). It&apos;s certainly a &quot;gay-interest&quot; film, but just like the French tend to make &quot;teen films&quot; that also appeal for adults, they tend to make &quot;gay-interest films that also appeal to straight people (thus the presence of the tres luscious Lea Seydoux). This is necessary, of course, because the French film industry is much smaller than the Hollywood industry and their films need to find a more general audience, but it sometimes causes problems in America. &quot;Blue is the Warmest Color&quot;, a more recent gay-themed film (also with Seydoux) was rejected by some segments of the American lesbian community because they felt the actresses and the sex scenes catered too much to heterosexual male fantasies. But is it really a good thing for ALL films about homosexuality to be relegated to some &quot;gay interest&quot; ghetto where they cater to the gay &quot;community&quot;, but are not seen by anyone else? That&apos;s a valid question.\n\nIt is a little ridiculous how incredibly attractive EVERYONE in this movie is. If Seydoux wasn&apos;t in this, I would have been seriously questioning my own sexuality since the three males in this are the three best-looking guys you&apos;re ever likely to see in each other&apos;s presence. The gay sex scenes in this are all pretty essential to the plot, but I&apos;m not so sure about the three-way, nude Greco-Roman wrestling match the males all engage in during a beach party. But, of course, you could also say that about the striptease scene or the one straight sex scene. People will complain about &quot;gratuitous&quot; nudity, but no one complains that a shot of, say, a beautiful sunset is &quot;gratuitous&quot; just because it doesn&apos;t strictly advance the plot. The bigger problem is that Renier and other males are not the strongest actors in France, and Seydoux has been a lot better in movies like &quot;Sister&quot;, &quot;Farewell My Queen&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Blue is the Warmest Color&quot;. \n\nThis is definitely not a great movie, but it&apos;s certainly an ATTRACTIVE one giving the cast and the beautiful scenery of southern France. And it&apos;s quite accessible as far a &quot;gay-interest&quot; cinema goes."

There is no thought,creative plot, or logic to this movie. It&apos;s simply Hollywood&apos;s way of cashing in on a teen idol that&apos;s just a flash in a pan. If I could rate this movie in the negatives, I would. If I had one wish, I would rid the world of Justin Beiber all together. This movie is painful to sit through. Do not waste your money. There&apos;s no thought process whatsoever. This talentless teenager belongs back where he started; on Youtube. He definitely shattered all hopes of ever being on the big screen again.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nObaba is loosely based on Bernardo Axtaga&apos;s collection of short stories &quot;Obabakoak&quot;, which won Spain&apos;s National Prize for Literature. Set in a fictional Basque town, Obaba follows Lourdes (BÃ¡rbara Lennie), a film student who has come to tape the town for a school project. She is soon drawn to some of the stories of the residents, all of which are told in flashbacks. These stories help Lourdes to understand the town, its people, and its secrets.\n\nMontxo ArmendÃ¡riz, who wrote the screenplay and also directed, has put together a fine film that blends the past and the present. Rather than use Lourdes simply as a device for prompting the villagers to tell their stories, she is an integral part of the movie. Lourdes is intrigued by the tales and the town&apos;s superstitions, and she soon begins to wonder if she has been caught up in and affected by it all. However, the film takes only a few of the stories from Axtaga&apos;s collection, and any political overtones don&apos;t seem to be present. The movie takes a more realistic tone and lacks any fantastical elements other than the mysterious blue-green lizards that seem to be indigenous to the area.",

      "name": "This supernatural Terminator knockoff is a lot of fun.",
      "reviewBody": "James Cameron&apos;s 1984 masterpiece The Terminator remains one of the greatest time travel epics ever made. A true Sci-Fi classic, it grossed $78 million at the box office and was an instant favorite of critics and fans alike. Perhaps it was inevitable that its premiseâthat of a hero and his mortal foe battling across centuries as well as great distancesâwould be duplicated a score of times by lesser filmmakers in lesser films. Universal Soldier, Highlander, and their myriad dismal sequels come to mind, as does the 1993 Stallone vehicle, Demolition Man. Steve Miner&apos;s unsung 1989 B-movie Warlock is very much in this same category of Terminator knockoff. Though underwhelming in its production values, Warlock manages to outshine its contemporaries through fine writing, directing, and above all, acting.\n\nThe beauty of Warlock&apos;s story lies in its simplicity. This is not a film with delusions of grandeur; it has more in common with Highlander than Braveheart. Hot on the trail of his mortal enemy the Warlock, our hero Redferne dives courageously after his foe into a magical time vortex that transports him from 17th century New England to 1980s Los Angeles. A true fish out of water, it isn&apos;t long before Redferne finds himself tasered at the hands of those infamous proponents of brutality, the LAPD. He&apos;s arrested but doesn&apos;t stay in jail for long. An innocent bystander named Kassandra (&quot;With a K!,&quot; as she is quick to remind all) posts bail when she realizes Redferne may be the one person who can free her from the curse the Warlock has placed on her. Kassandra (Lori Singer) is a vain young woman who has been cursed by a spell that leads to rapid aging. At the pace of &quot;a decade twice over a day,&quot; Kassandra not only rapidly loses her looks but has less than a week to live unless she can reverse the spell. The only way to do that is by confronting the diabolical Warlock, who rightfully terrifies her. After some convincing, Kassandra eventually agrees to join Redferne. The odd couple set off on a quest to find the Warlock and end his reign of terror before it goes any further. Along the way, the Warlock takes council with Satan himself and begins a quest to undo all of creation by uniting the pages of a spell book called the Grand Grimoire. Fully assembled, the Grand Grimoire spells out the true name of God which, if spoken backwards, will destroy the universe.\n\nThe character to whom we are to relate immediately as an audience is the Sara Connor proxy, Kassandra. Initially, she is not a likable leading woman; she is written as dim witted, cowardly, and vapid. But by the film&apos;s end, I came to find her if not pleasant then tolerable. The kindest thing I can say of Singer&apos;s performance as this boor is that it is adequate; she is never charming but far from odious. It would take an actress of the highest caliber to make me really care about Kassandra and Singer just doesn&apos;t have the chops. Still, she does what she can with the role and her effort is commendable.\n\nLike The Terminator, Warlock focuses as much on its antagonist as it does on the heroic duo out to defeat him. The Warlock&apos;s true name is never revealed on screen. Instead he is referred to only by title, a nice touch that paints him as less a man than an entity of nameless evil. He is wantonly cruel, blond, and impossibly beautiful. His powers are formidable; superhuman strength, a hypnotic gaze, and flight to name just a few. English actor Julian Sands has a ball as the title character. The scene in which he plays video football with a young boy on a swing set is tremendous; as is the scene in which he admires a victim&apos;s pinky ring before rudely hacking the finger off. Misfortune in the form of death and dismemberment inevitably befall all who cross his path, but Warlock takes care not to become an exploitation film. Most violence happens off screen, is merely hinted at, or is handled humorously.\n\nRichard E. Grant&apos;s performance as the witch hunter Redferne is nothing short of heroic. His character is loosely molded after Terminator&apos;s hero, Sgt. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). In the hands of a lesser actor, the valiant Redferne could have been a laughable caricature of superstitious Puritanism but Grant finds the heart of the character. Standing over a &quot;witch compass&quot; constructed of brass and witch&apos;s blood, he delivers the greatest line in the film; &quot;Now brute, one last time we play the game out!&quot; I enjoyed every word of Redferne&apos;s dialogue, all intoned with Grant&apos;s silver tongued faux Scots burr.\n\nOn a special effects level, Warlock falls flat on its face. This is a film produced by Roger Corman in the late 80s, which should give you some idea of what to expect. The bursts of magical energy the Warlock fires from his hands are truly garish. And don&apos;t get me started on the scene in which the Warlock is supposed to be flying down an interstate highway at 100 mph. Warlock&apos;s special effects suffer not only in comparison to recent films, but also in comparison to other films from the same time period such as John Carpenter&apos;s Big Trouble in Little China. Still, for all of the low budget special effect snafus, I enjoyed the fight scenes between Redferne and the Warlock immensely. I particularly enjoyed the climactic showdown in which Redferne takes on the Warlock with his bare hands.\n\nAll in all, Warlock is easily the best of the many Terminator knockoffs. It is action packed, well paced, and resists the temptation to get bogged down with a sappy romantic subplot. It never reaches beyond its grasp; it is a B-movie out and out and on that humble level it succeeds. It features an attractive cast and is well written, directed, produced, and especially acted.",

This after they fell in love in BHC 1. Soon, they have a family of 5 darling little puppies, too. Meanwhile, Aunt Viv&apos;s niece and the gardener have also fallen in love but there may be complications. So, no ring yet. The gardener decides to take the whole family of chihuahua&apos;s to his parents&apos; home in Mexico, so they can meet the pack and so he can get advice on affairs of the heart. While they are there, unhappy news arrives at once. The parents are going to lose their long-held family home unless they can pay the back mortgage payments. The pair got behind when the father was injured and unable to do his landscaping job. What are they going to do? In fact, before long, the whole caboodle are thrown out, due to the puppies creating havoc on the house and the loan officer. Everyone troops back to the USA and Aunt Viv&apos;s home to think. Fortunately, there is a dog show in Beverly Hills that week and the prize money would get back the Mexican house! Can Papi or Chloe win? Also, they once again meet up with Delgado, a friend from the first film, who needs the huahuas help as well. Will things work out? Of course! Bow Wow Wow, what a darling film! This viewer loved the first one and found this one equally fun. Some of the cast members have changed but, thankfully, Lopez is still here to do a great Papi. Also, French Stewart, Emily Osment, Morgan Fairchild and others lend their talents, too. The scenery is wonderful, as are the costumes, photography, script and sure direction. My advice? Turn any down-in-the-dumps-day into a great one by renting or buying this lovely film!",

Mr. Curtiz, one of the most distinguished directors of the American cinema, doesn&apos;t bring anything new to this tired 20th Century Fox movie.\n\nMaybe the three men at the center of the movie, the great song writing team of De Sylva, Brown and Henderson were too bland to merit a film that celebrated their lives. They made their mark in the theater in the early part of the 20th century, but as it plays on the screen, this musical feels dull and out of place. Some of the trio&apos;s best songs are heard in the movie. Songs like Birth of the Blues, which Gordon MacRae sings with panache. Also they wrote that sappy Al Jolson&apos;s standard, Sunny Boy, which is sung by the star in black face.\n\nPerhaps the casting was the wrong choice for this movie. Gordon MacRae doesn&apos;t show any spark as Buddy DeSylva. Dan Dailey is also an enigma, the way he plays Ray Henderson. Ernest Borgnine is the only one that shows some life in his interpretation of Lew Brown. Sheree North is the good Kitty Kane, who played in most of the shows this trio wrote.",

We follow it&apos;s progress from the mind of Roebling who would have his son complete it, open it on May 24, 1883 and along the way we hear about the blood and tears that went into it. The second portion of the documentary takes a look at the bridge in current times and we get clips from movies, pictures and paintings that feature the famous landmark. At just 58-minutes there&apos;s certainly nothing ground-breaking about this documentary but I think it does a pretty good job at going through the history of the bridge as well as the impact it has had on certain people. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any doubt that the most entertaining stuff is during the first half when we hear about how the bridge idea came to be and we also get to see how other bridges were being built at the time. Some of the most fascinating stuff comes from the creation of the caissons, how they were constructed and what their final purpose was going to be. This led to a disease, which became known as the Caisson Disease and we also hear about the day the bridge opened and who got to go across first. Fans of history will most certainly want to check this film out because the storytelling is extremely good and we also get all sorts of photos of the bridge as well as newspaper clippings from the days when it was being built."

      "reviewBody": "Despite having read the liner notes, I thought from the publicity artwork that WINTERSET would be something Gothic. It is Gothic, in its bleakness, but is squarely centered in the Depression era of the United States. It was completely of it&apos;s time, and considering that the film was adapted from the Broadway play, it must have been daring, with sub themes of socialism and police corruption. (The play was by Maxwell Anderson, who wrote KEY LARGO and THE BAD SEED.) Perhaps that contributed to the film receiving two Academy Award nominations.\n\nThis is the story of Mio (Bartholomio Â a young, dewy Burgess Merideth) trying to clear his father&apos;s name. In the first scenes, his namesake Father, played with riveting stillness by the painfully thin John Carradine, was accused of murder he did not commit, given no defense, and put to death. Years later, his son goes to the slums of New York to try to find out the truth.\n\nI had to remind myself that this was made in 1936, so it is still very early in the talkies. The sets are a wonderful blend of realism and expressionism (similar to the famous stage sets of Arthur Miller&apos;s A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE), giving this a Gothic noir flavor. Rain is often used as a &quot;purifier&quot; in stage and film, but here it is effectively used to create an oppressive humidity, a torrent of sludge. It is clear that film noir, Orson Wells, and THE THIRD MAN&apos;s Director Carol Reed all owe a debt to early films like this. The set elements are all here in tight proximity, the stone, the shadowed doorways, the waterways.\n\nIn fact, one irony is that one of the lead actors does look very much like Orson Wells. He plays the brother of Mariama (played by Margot, who is probably best known as the duplicitous woman in Capra&apos;s LOST HORIZON). Margot&apos;s transition to film is not as ideal as Merideth&apos;s, her style is more of the old school careful vocal production that may be the product of overcoming an accent. But she looks luminous and innocent, and fills the screen with a simple hopefulness at odds with the dark surroundings. The villain of the piece is simply fantasticÂ completely believably sociopathic without any extravagant ticks or frothing at the mouth.\n\nThis is pre-method-acting, but that spare realism is all here, especially in the performances of Carradine and Merideth. This entire film holds up as a moment of history Â of social themes and thought of that day that still resonate. The Broadway cast seems to have been lifted intact (which should be a lesson to modern filmmakers to use stage actors instead of vice-verse). There are one or two flowery monologues, but for the most part, the transition from stage to film goes very well, and the story and script are spare and universal enough to stand the test of time well. This is a fascinating moment of film history which has Âluckily Â made its way to DVD.",

The movie starts off with the Mugal Ruler banning the music as he believed that music departed the person away from god. Then comes Waris Shah( Gurdas Mann) looking for Guruji, who teaches music at the secret location, when Guruji and Waris Shah meet, Guruji tells him that he is talented but he needs the pain in order to write the Heer, so Waris goes to the other village ( where the music isn&apos;t banned) to gain further knowledge about the music. When the Mugal Ruler finds out that Guruji is teaching music, he is killed. In the new village Waris Shah meets Bhaagpari(Juhi Chawla) who falls slowly falls in love with Waris, Warish also falls in love with her as well. On the other hand we have Saabo( Divya Dutta) who also is attracted to Waris Shah as well, and she is willing to do anything to make Waris hers. Saabo tires everything that she could think of so she would be able to depart Waris and Bhaagpari.Later on Bhaagpari is forced to merry Saabo&apos;s brother (Sushant Singh.Waris Shah realizes that in order to complete his Heer he must let Bhaagpari go so he could feel the pain that his Guruji said that he needs in this writing. Performance wise Gurdas Mann is natural as if the role was made for him and can&apos;t really think of anyone else Gurdas Mann in the role of Waris Shah, but he does tend to over act in few scenes and the aging does show as well. Juhi Chalwa is excellent and takes full advantage as what she is given, the role doesn&apos;t demand much but she does shine the marriage scene and Zeher scene. The real star of the show has to be Divya Dutta, who as the supporting outshines everyone as Saabo who has been rejected by Waris Shah and has shades of grey to her character.She has been given more footage then Juhi chalwa and she takes full use of what she is given and I might not be wrong to say this is the best performance after Veer Zaara. The scene where she tries to seduce Waris Shah or the Scene where she steals the &quot;Heer&quot; is outstanding. Sushant Singh is OK not award worthy. Mukesh Rishi doesn&apos;t have a role to talk about. The songs are average the pick of the crowd has to be Ve Kabootra Ve Kasda, Khaas Shamma Ajj Tere Lai , and Couplets Of Heer.

      "reviewBody": "With its simplistic &quot;plot&quot; and slapstick humor, &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast!&quot; is kiddie fare that never aspires to be more than it is. Its humor, surprisingly, is toned down from the series that inspired it, but this is adequately compensated for. Most of the primary cast returns, with Jaleel White continuing to prove that there is more to him than Urkel. A cameo by Princess Sally is also included, a real treat for fans. In addition, &quot;Christmas Blast!&quot; makes other references to the popular &quot;SatAM&quot; series with its inclusion of SWAT-bots and Robotropolis. Beyond that, there&apos;s no reason for older fans to watch this but it&apos;s inside references are engaging enough. It&apos;s a fitting close to the adventures of the speedy blue blur within this particular continuity.",

He is the only real feature of this film, but a typical Heinz Erhardt vehicle it is not as in about 1/3 of the film he is not present at all. Without him the film, aimed at Germans who could not yet afford a holiday abroad, would have been hardly worth watching.\n\nAverage if not dull direction and a script with no surprises make this film into nothing special; the best thing that can be said about the script that it at least has a couple of funny verbal jokes for Erhardt (or did he improvise?). The film includes a couple of mediocre songs, the usual gathering of not so interesting teenagers (Corny Collins is nice though) and the unavoidable calf-loves. Teneriffa makes a nice background.",

At the end one of my friends added &quot;and now there will be a shot on a raven and finish&quot;  and after it happened just that we laughed through the credits maybe trying to forget how dull and boring this french &quot;masterpiece&quot; was."

Virginia Bruce was a lovely girl, and an up and coming MGM star. Colin Clive was classically trained in the British theatre and had 10 years of repertory work under his belt. You know what that means. One week you might be playing a country parson, and the next week, Shakespeare. They both had earned their acting chops. Unfortunately, the majority of Monogram&apos;s budget probably went to pay the stars, and their was little left for anything else. We&apos;re talking prehistoric sound equipment, high school dramatic writing, and summer stock wardrobe. For a 1934 film, the tech aspects were strictly 1919. I&apos;m sure that at the end of shooting, the stars politely shook hands, grabbed their cheques and ran like Hell! I know that if Clive had made Jane Eyre at Universal, with the same quality as their Great Expectations, he would have knocked Orson Welles flat! (g) JS",

      "reviewBody": "There are so many great films coming out lately from around the world. What&apos;s crazy is that some of the ones that get the most praise don&apos;t always connect with everyone. The Spanish made film Extraterrestrial is the latest meeting this criteria, but also sports the sci-fi comedy genre that gives it the unique opportunity to deliver something new to the genre, but can it make it work or will it just be a wasted invasion.\n\nExtraterrestrial follows a guy and girl as they wake up from an apparent one night stand only to find out that the world is full of UFO&apos;s. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, they have to deal with the girl&apos;s boyfriend and the creepy neighbor which might be even more trouble than the invasion. On the surface this movie works pretty well, but overall it misses the mark at times. The cast is great and do a great job bouncing off the clever dialogue to create a dry funny overall film. What takes somewhat away from this movie is the UFO aspect. While this does set up some reasoning behind the bigger story for them to play off of, it really serves little to no purpose for the film itself. There is nothing ever really done with it other than being a back drop and makes the final experience seem a bit lacking. Another major issue is the ending. It builds up with all the tensions and issues with all involved only to just kind of end with little to no resolution.\n\nBelieve it or not this is an entertaining movie that should have been way better than it was. Overall once it ends, it just feels like it was all for nothing since nothing ever really happens. If you&apos;re looking for something a bit different then this movie will entertain and do the job, just be sure to steer clear of the expectations of the sci-fi aspect. Be warned, this is a subtitled movie so unless you speak Spanish be prepared to read.\n\nhttp://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",

Vincent Price is at his creepy best in this film about a man who opens up a wax museum that has a secret as to why the figures look so life-like.   This was the second time I had seen it in its original format, and I enjoyed it just as much this time, including its over the top melodrama and unbelievably dated dialogue.  Do not miss this film if you can find it showing at a classic movie house, because it is extremely entertaining to experience. \n\n--Shelly"

Henri Young was played by Kevin Bacon who did a fantastic job of acting and captured your attention through out the film. There were many scenes filmed on the Island of Alcatraz and some old time footage of the first time Warden of Alcatraz, James R. Johnston. Christian Slater, (James Stamphill) was the lawyer assigned for Henri Young&apos;s defense, who had a hard job trying to rehabilitate his client so he could stand trial and even speak a few words. Young was in such bad shape mentally from being put into the solitary confinement for three (3) years, he was like an animal instead of a human being. This Hollywood version is not all completely true about Henri Young, he really had a long history of crime and mental problems. However, this film is very entertaining and Kevin Bacon put his heart and soul into this role. Enjoy.",

How can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth?\n\nThis movie is a total blast. Pairing again John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has great, funny results. Hyperactive Bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around, Curtis &quot;Ak Ak&quot; is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts... wow!) as the love interest of, once again, chronically depressed Cusack.\n\nThe story is, well, simple enough. The laughs are there, but both Savage Steve Holland films have a certain quality to them... they are funny, but they are also sweet. The scene where Curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach, and begins musing about how a little girl won&apos;t be able to sleep was dumb, funny and touching. The animation used throughout is quite surreal. &quot;The Boat&quot; is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush doll). Overall, a fun film, though not as good as &quot;Better off dead...&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "With subject matter that many might consider offensive (fifteen year-old boy in love with his step-mother and seduced by older woman), TADPOLE manages to be a charming, witty light comedy with a sensitive look at a controversial theme--a coming-of-age story with heart.\n\nAnd its hero, a sophisticated fifteen year-old played by a twenty-five year-old actor (AARON STANFORD), is a natural in the title role, completely convincing as the impressionable youth living with his step-mother (SIGOURNEY WEAVER) and father (JOHN RITTER) in a fancy New York City apartment. Ritter plays the busy working father in one of his rare serious roles and is excellent, as is Weaver as the woman who discovers that her son has been having an affair with her best friend (BEBE NEUWIRTH). Neuwirth makes the most of her sly comic scenes as a temptress who awakens hormones in the teen-ager. A restaurant scene with the boy and his parents is a highlight of the story, where her deceptive conduct is exposed by Ritter&apos;s observation of an indiscretion in a mirrored image.\n\nWitty and humorous, never taking itself seriously, it&apos;s an amiable tale told with deft touches and it moves briskly under Gary Winick&apos;s nimble direction with some nice glimpses of Manhattan&apos;s upper east side.",

      "reviewBody": "So poignant, it hurts. And I&apos;m a heterosexual male who enjoys football and grunge. Though some of the attitudes toward sex have been tempered in the intervening years, the turmoils and pressures of being a teen ring just as true today 42 years after this film&apos;s release. Kazan is a master at capturing those wrenching angsty adolescent and post-adolescent moments of emotional vulnerability and doubt, especially concerning the love/hate between children and their parents, and this is among his best work. A reminder that wistful remembrances of the seeming innocence and happiness of youth are probably wishful thinking, and also an ironic prodding that there is seemingly something idealistic lost or compromised when we enter adulthood. Kudos to the entire cast but in particular, Natalie Wood is scintillating, perfectly encapsulating the joys and horrors of someone caught up in the dizzying power and raging hormones of teen love. Beatty is solid, too, if a bit overly earnest.\n\nAll of the twists and turns of the plot work, though ultimately Bud&apos;s family&apos;s economic setbacks and deaths and Didi&apos;s family&apos;s successes are mere soap operatic window dressing to the &quot;A&quot; plot line, which is the heart tugging reality of &quot;nothing bringing back the hour of the Splendor In The Grass&quot; for Bud and Didi, though both obviously still share the feeling. This is the kind of movie that doesn&apos;t get made in America now because of the non-commercial (but accurate) ending. Okay, they broached it in the less psychologically challenging CASTAWAY, but slapped on a happy ending afterwards.\n\nSPLENDOR is not perfect; Bud&apos;s father (Pat Hingle) is a little overwrought and stereotypically drawn as the socioeconomic snob with castratingly ambitious designs on Bud&apos;s future. Bud&apos;s sister (Barbara Loden) is similarly too pat as the troubled, neglected child who does all she can to get daddy&apos;s disapproval. Still, any of the soapy aspects of the plot just fall away when the Beatty / Wood romance plot line gets cooking. They got the meat of this movie just right and the result is one of the most memorable and vivid examples of young romance ever set down on celluloid. Don&apos;t miss it!",

When the prison is isolated due to a yellow fever epidemic, Dr. Mudd helps the guards and the other prisoners to cure the disease. \n\n&quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot; is a great biographical drama by John Ford, telling a tale of injustice and recognition of a nation with a family man that is sentenced to a life sentence in a devil&apos;s island of the Nineteenth Century in Gulf of Mexico. The story is engaging and supported by magnificent performances and direction. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Prisioneiro da Ilha dos TubarÃµes&quot; (&quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot;)",

A bunch of unknown kids portray the Olsen-gang, of course they had no real experience, so their bad acting can be excused.\n\nJesper Langberg as Hallandsen and Ellen HillingsÃ¸ as Doktor Rakowski, the two people who adopt Egon Olsen and try to send him into outer space do very good in their roles, and Ole Thestrup as Major SchrÃ¶der is always great fun to watch.

The part where Kjeld is jealous at Yvonne&apos;s boyfriend and he shoots at him with a tank was quite funny, but very unrealistic of course, just like most of the original &quot;Olsenbande&quot;-movies.\n\nAs far as entertainment for kids goes, this is one of the better danish movies to watch, but it goes a bit flat once in a while, but it&apos;s not that bad. \n\nI give it 6/10",

The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn&apos;t stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it&apos;s done so in a beautiful and artful way.",

      "reviewBody": "Edward G. Robinson puts his own brand of cruelty on the role of a freighter captain who tyrannizes his crew and some unexpected passengers (Ida Lupino, John Garfield, Alexander Knox) in this taut, suspenseful psychological melodrama with no shortage of brooding atmosphere. \n\nBased on the famous Jack London story of Wolf Larsen (Robinson), the callous and inhuman skipper of a schooner, who proceeds to make life hell for his crew and his unwilling passengers rescued from a sinking ferryboat. Lupino and Garfield are a couple of losers with a past; Knox is a mild-mannered novelist. The romantic angle between Garfield and Ida is underplayed with the accent more on the brooding tension aboard the schooner.\n\n Under Michael Curtiz&apos; direction, all the performances are first-rate and Erich Wolfgang Korngold&apos;s intriguing score helps sustain the tense mood of passengers adrift on a fog-shrouded sea. Alexander Knox&apos;s restrained portrayal of an intellectual is a perfect foil for Robinson&apos;s bombastic megalomaniac skipper.  Stand-outs in the large supporting cast are Gene Lockhart as a nervous, cowardly doctor and Barry Fitzgerald as a crafty cook, a sinister departure from his usual comic roles.\n\n Absorbing all the way, well worth viewing, this represented a step up the ladder for Ida Lupino&apos;s career at Warner Bros. Watch for my full-length career article on Ida Lupino scheduled to appear in an upcoming issue of FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE."

That the &quot;King&quot; is not in the main role gives the film more credibility and you can really say that Love Me Tender is a good movie. With Elvis only as a troubadour works fine and the film remains a proper western too.\n\nPerhaps there has been better westerns too but the storyline in this one is enough interesting: a man returns from the American Civil War and finds his wife at home married to another man. With this marital mess and some other problems being solved Elvis drops in and offers some fresh music, or the music that was still fresh when the movie was being made. It is anyway relaxing to see the &quot;King&quot; in a most unspoiled context.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Tombs Of The Blind Dead&apos; is not strictly a zombie movie, but involves the resurrected dead (in this case blind heretics from the 13th Century). While not as explicit as Romero or Fulci it should appeal to fans of the living dead genre. The movie is strong on atmosphere and style, similar in some ways to Jean Rollin, but without the sex or pretension. The &quot;blind dead&quot; themselves are one of the creepiest and most effective concepts in any horror movie. Slow moving, relentless and deadly, with a penchant for flesh eating. The scenes where the dead ride horses to hunt their prey are classic horror. My only small criticism of this movie is that there were so few scenes of them. Modern horror fans who require wall to wall FX and a killing every 15 minutes will probably find this slow going, but true buffs will be mesmerized. Highly recommended."

Liam Neeson is reason enough to see this movie because his performance is the best out of the whole (mis)cast. Andie McDowell&apos;s scenes where she was talking to herself were very unreal and uncharacteristic of any human.  The love story between Liam and herself was charming but thrust into the movie suddenly and was not picked up at the right times in the plot. The ending, however was cute, despite no real victory on Andie&apos;s part. 1/2 *."

Joe&apos;s actor friend Bob has just got a job on a soap opera but is caught up in his desire for a `real&apos; blonde despite having fallen for the available model Sahara.  The films follows their lives in the world of minor celebrity.\n\nDespite having done good with the subject of film making in `Living in Oblivion&apos;, the director doesn&apos;t do as well when it comes to the world of the minor celebrity.  The plot is a little jumbled Â it wants to make fun of the world but also seriously follow the people it makes fun of in their relationships.  Also it makes fun of Bob&apos;s acting but yet has plenty of respect for Joe simply because he keeps quoting `Death of a Salesman&apos;.  The satirical edge is nice and produces some funny moments but the relationship stuff is muddled.\n\nThere are plenty of famous cameos and most are good.  Lloyd, Turner, Leary, Buscemi, Chappelle, Von Bargen etc all show their faces.  In the leads Modine is OK but because the director doesn&apos;t know if he&apos;s part of the joke or a serious character then we don&apos;t know how to approach him either. Keener tries hard and is OK but Caulfield is the best of the bunch simply because we know he&apos;s meant to be a bit of a comedy figure.\n\nThe film manages to loose it&apos;s laughs in a sea of serious asides.  The worst being the theme of the old black woman and her dog getting stolen.  We keep going back to her and she has the last theme in the film Â why?  If there was a message I must be too dumb to get it and it certainly didn&apos;t really fit in with the rest of the movie.\n\nOverall this has enough good moments to justify watching but it clearly lacks focus and loses it&apos;s way really easily."

      "reviewBody": "In 1983, there was a Dutch movie about a killer elevator called De Lift (which was remade by the director in 2001). Here&apos;s a German movie from 1984 about a killer elevator. Funny how that happens. Anyway, the one in De Lift was evil, but this one is just poorly designed and maintained.\n\nFour people get stuck in an elevator: a couple, a younger guy, and an older man with a suitcase. The night watchman doesn&apos;t notice the problem since the alarm had been turned off for the repairman who&apos;d been there earlier. They try to get out, hurting themselves and smashing up the elevator in the process. They bicker a lot. The hand-held video-game playing, walkman-wearing young man is annoying, and the woman is surprisingly slutty. The actress is rather unusual-looking, with eyebrows tweezed away to almost nothing, and hair in a style that emphasizes how high her hairline is and how thin her hair is. Whoever did that to her should never have gotten the job!\n\nWhen repairmen come, they give the security guard a hard time. He has a German accent (the video I watched was dubbed in English), which they mock, and they complain about foreigners. I thought that was weird, since the movie was German. Did he have an American accent in the German-language version? I was also surprised that they try to raise the elevator car, rather than lower it; I wonder if that is the procedure in real life?\n\nStill, I enjoyed this. It&apos;s not great, but is entertaining enough.\n\nI wonder if the elevator horror subgenre is played out. Someone ought to have one involving a paternoster lift (look it up) - those are pretty unusual; a friend of mine had ridden one and told me about it.\n\nIncidentally, the Worst Case Scenario Handbook writers have evidently advised the best way to survive a plummeting elevator is to lie down flat on the floor.",

Though Paco (a young man) is the central character of the movie, the other characters complete the picture - rehabilitating from drugs but more important rehabilitating as persons.\n\nI got several ideas from this movie: in the end you have to accept things as they are, you have to accept responsibility for your life if you want to go forward, we are not perfect - we are just humans, you can&apos;t escape from addictions but rather you can replace them with something good, the line between good and bad is not always so clear.\n\nThe movie it&apos;s a drama, there are lots of sad scenes but what was important for me is that the end lives you with hope. There are some sex scenes in the movie and they fit perfectly in the story. \n\nWhy should you see this movie? You don&apos;t have to. But if you encounter problems in your daily life (as we usually all do) it may help to see that you are not alone and also that you may reach a &quot;floating&quot; level.",

      "reviewBody": "Probably the best thing that I can say about this film is that it was, near as I can recall, the thing that first got me interested in Zeppelin history when I was about 9 years old.  That&apos;s been over a quarter of a century now, and the old &quot;armchair Zep historian&quot; trip is still a favorite hobby of mine.\n\nIt would be really easy for me to go into Ubergeek mode and nitpick every little thing about this flick (I&apos;ll try my best to spare you folks that and save it for when I&apos;ve knocked back a few with a couple of my Zep buddies) but when it comes right down to it, this movie could be a lot worse.\n\nI mean yes, it has a lot of flaws, not the least of which is its reliance on a fictionalized version of a sabotage theory which itself is perhaps one of the most elaborate, ethically-suspect works of fiction presently connected with Zeppelin history.  The story goes that a young crew member named Erich Spehl (renamed &quot;Karl Boerth&quot; in the movie, apparently for legal reasons) fell in with the anti-Nazi resistance via a mysterious older woman he was dating at the time of the disaster, and the two of them cooked up a plan whereby he would sabotage the ship at its mooring mast at Lakehurst, in full view of the American press, so as to get international publicity for the resistance movement.  The Hindenburg was late in landing, the timer on the bomb malfunctioned, (neither of the two authors who originally flogged this theory in their books ever really worked out that little detail of how the bomb went off as the ship landed) and the ship burned, killing Spehl in the process.\n\nAs I said, this theory is definitely hogwash, and I&apos;ve come to suspect that those who originally concocted it and passed it off as historical fact probably knew it was hogwash too.  But, this is the sort of plot that sells books and puts asses in theatre seats, so this is what Wise and his screenwriters decided to go with. They didn&apos;t invent the theory, they merely optioned a book (&quot;The Hindenburg&quot; by Michael Mooney) which was a retelling of the original Spehl theory (which appeared in A. A. Hoehling&apos;s &quot;Who Destroyed The Hindenburg?&quot;)\n\nPurely as a 1970s disaster film, this one isn&apos;t bad.  It&apos;s got all the bases covered: lavish sets and costumes; big-name stars portraying a cast of characters from various walks of life, complete with various interconnecting personal dramas designed to heighten the pathos of &quot;I wonder who gets it in the end?&quot; for the audience; and a special-effects laden disastrous climax.\n\n As far as the execution of the whole thing goes, it&apos;s definitely a mixed bag.  The script could have used a good bit of work before they shot it, but then that also seems to be par for the course with most 1970s disaster flicks.  A lot of the dialogue is fairly stilted, and some of the lines are just terrible.  Perhaps the one that bugs me the most is when Ritter (the Luftwaffe colonel in charge of security) finally gets Boerth (the saboteur) to tell him where the bomb is, Boerth replies with the meaningless phrase &quot;Repair Patch 4&quot; and Ritter, who apparently had never set foot on a Zeppelin before the beginning of the flight, conveniently runs straight to where the bomb is hidden... under a tiny in-flight repair patch on the side of Gas Cell #4 (which itself was 10-15 stories tall).  That the big &quot;Aha!&quot; moment when Ritter finally learns where the bomb is hidden is garbled by lazy, sloppy writing like this always makes me cringe when I watch this movie, and unfortunately that&apos;s fairly indicative of the level of screenwriting throughout the film.\n\nVarious characters are renamed versions of actual passengers and crew from the last flight, some are amalgams of a couple different actual people, some even retain the same names as the people on whom they&apos;re based... and others are simply invented for the sake of the movie.   Colonel Franz Ritter (George C. Scott) is based upon a Luftwaffe colonel named Fritz Erdmann who was aboard the last flight to observe long-range navigational practices used by the Hindenburg&apos;s crew (and who was erroneously presented in at least one &quot;historical&quot; Hindenburg book as having been assigned to the flight to watch for saboteurs); crewman Karl Boerth (William Atherton), of course, is based on the &quot;sabotage theory&quot; version of crewman Erich Spehl;  the Countess (Anne Bancroft) seems to be very loosely based on a passenger by the name of Margaret Mather; Gestapo snitch Martin Vogel (Roy Thinnes) was basically invented as an obstacle for Ritter to have to deal with; the Breslau family was based on the real-life Doehner family; crewman Ludecke (Peter Canon) seems to be something of a loose amalgam of a couple of real-life Nazi-connected crew members who flew on the Hindenburg, but basically he was invented as a flunkie for Vogel.\n\nAnd on and on and on.\n\nA few things about the film do work for me.  First, I think that George C. Scott was one of those actors who could lend even the worst film a bit of dramatic weight, and in this movie he actually takes what was written as a fairly one-dimensional character and breathes some real life into it.  As a Luftwaffe pilot who is ill at ease with the increasing excesses of the Nazi regime, Scott creates a rather human, sympathetic character.  His scenes with Anne Bancroft are some of the few which actually seem to work in this movie.\n\nI also quite like David Shire&apos;s music score.  Most of the musical pieces in the film are variations on the Main Title Theme, though there are a few distinct separate themes (notably the romantic piece played during the scenes between Ritter and the Countess, the piece played while the crewmen repair the ripped fabric on the fin, and what I always think of as the &quot;Gestapo&quot; theme, which seems to be used when the film cuts back to Germany for scenes such as the one where Boerth&apos;s girlfriend is arrested in Frankfurt).  And then there&apos;s the odd little vaudeville tune performed by Reed Channing and Joe Spah at the concert Channing holds for the passengers and crew.  It&apos;s certainly consistent with what an American might have thought of and known about the Nazis in 1937 (concentration camps, for example, were already in use for political dissidents and &quot;intellectuals&quot; by &apos;37) but it still feels kind of like the producers just said &quot;We want a show tune in here... write us something!&quot;  By and large, though, the music in this film is quite good.  I only wish it were available on CD.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the set design in this film, particularly the full-size recreation of various parts of the interior of the Hindenburg, is absolutely amazing.  If you want to see what it looked like to walk around inside the Hindenburg, watch this movie.  There are a few minor inconsistencies with the actual design of the ship (a pair of ladders which led down into the lower fin of the actual ship was changed in the film into a long set of stairs running up inside the leading edge of the fin, I assume for dramatic purposes) but for the most part Wise&apos;s set designers used the original designs of the ship and recreated them, right down to the rivets in some places.  The only thing that they apparently got wrong unintentionally is the dark blue/green color of the girders in the interior of the ship. They seem to have gotten this from pieces of girder salvaged from the actual Hindenburg wreck, and what they recreated was the scorched color of the original bright turquoise blue lacquer which coated the girders of the actual ship. ;^)\n\nBut most everything else is spot-on.  I&apos;ve stood in the control car recreation, which has been restored and is now on proud display out at Lakehurst, and from having seen photos of virtually every part of the real Hindenburg control car I can say that the set designers really nailed this, again right down to the rivets on the elevator and rudder wheels.  The passenger decks are pretty much identical to the real ones, the layout of the lower keel is frighteningly accurate... a modern-day movie about the Hindenburg would have to essentially re-build the same sets if they wanted to be accurate.  For this alone, I like to throw my DVD of &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; in the player a couple times a year.\n\nAgain, not a great movie overall, and the sabotage theory the screenwriters use is based on a load of dreck dreamed up under rather questionable circumstances a decade or so before the film was made, and which implicates a young man who unfortunately died in the fire and was not around to defend himself (nor did he have any close family to do it for him at the time the story first emerged). It may make for an interesting movie plot, but it didn&apos;t happen that way at all.  (I also don&apos;t buy the &quot;exploding paint&quot; theory that&apos;s been run up the flagpole over the past several years, as it simply requires too much cherry-picking of eyewitness testimony and photographic evidence to work... but that&apos;s a whole &apos;nother story.)\n\n Not a terrible film overall, due to the painstakingly accurate set design, but not that great a film either.  I&apos;m a bit biased, obviously, but I always find myself wishing that they&apos;d spent even half as much energy on writing a good script for this thing as they spent recreating the interior of the ship.  It could have been something a lot more special than just another disaster flick if they&apos;d put the effort into the story. But as 1970s disaster movies go, this is probably one of the best. It&apos;s certainly worth a watch."

Love is just not enough, especially when the object of it, Camelia Kath, is so woefully lacking in the femme fatale department. Then there is Keifer, who is excellent, except we don&apos;t get to see much of him. A lot could have been done with this character, but instead we get large dollops of the poisonous relationship between two quite unattractive people (Kath and her nasty, clichÃ©d, property tycoon husband). Hitchcock could probably have pulled off a denouement in sand dunes on an overcast day but probably not many others could. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Joe Don Baker&apos;s performance as the old sheriff.",

      "name": "Top Father/Son Movie Gets Beery Best Actor Award (Tied)",
      "reviewBody": "Father/son movies were nothing new when November 1931&apos;s &quot;The Champ&quot; was released. But its ending is what struck movie audiences as unique, one of cinema&apos;s most potent tear jerkers ever projected on the screen. &quot;The Champ is one of the greatest love stories ever put to film, the story of a man who wants to do right but fails and a son who never gives up on him,&quot; film reviewer Jerry Roberts writes. &quot;(Wallace) Beery is what gives the film its foundation.&quot;\n\nBeery performance was so powerful he won the 5th Academy Awards&apos; Best Actor in a virtual tie with Frederic March for his role in 1931&apos;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&quot; After receiving the statuette, Berry, in the middle of renegotiating his contract with MGM, demanded he be paid one dollar more than the studio&apos;s highest paid actor. The agreement made him the richest salaried Hollywood actor at that time. Francis Marion wrote &quot;The Champ&apos;s&quot; screenplay especially with Beery in mind. It proved to be a great inspiration since she won the Academy Award&apos;s Best Story for her work on bringing bucketful of tears to millions of viewers.\n\nHer tale has Andy &quot;Champ&quot; Purcell (Beery), a former world heavyweight title holder, down on his luck and turns to drink and gambling. Through his divorce, Andy was able to keep his son, Dink (Jackie Cooper), until his mother Linda (Irene Rich), sees him at the racetrack with his father. Remarried into wealth, Linda gets the court to gain custody of Dink. In a classic highly emotional separation scene, Andy, in prison, says goodbye to his loyal son, only to have Dink jump off the train transporting him to his mother&apos;s home. He wants to see his father fight one more match facing off against the Mexican champion in what turns out to be a brutal match. A preview audience loved the movie, except for the ending. MGM&apos;s head of production, Irving Thalberg, had the match reshot, ending with one of the most emotional 18-handkerchief scenes in cinema.\n\nDespite the warmth displayed on the screen between the two actors, Beery and Cooper did not get along. Beery hated childhood actors, and it was evident he didn&apos;t enjoy his time with the nine-year-old Jackie. Publicly, he diplomatically described Cooper as &quot;a great kid,&quot; but the boy claimed the actor treated him like &quot;an unkempt dog.&quot; In retrospect, Cooper said it was pure jealousy that made Beery, in scene after scene, try to upstage him. Beery was so fed up with the director calling for tight shots of Cooper&apos;s teary face, he demanded in his new MGM contract that no juvenile actor could ever have a close-up in any picture with him. Beery vowed he would never appear in another movie with Cooper again after &quot;The Champ&quot; wrapped. But so popular was the acting duo that he took back his promise in the mid-1930s, sharing screen time again with Cooper in three more films.\n\nBesides Beery&apos;s tied win, the Academy nominated &quot;The Champ&quot; for Best Picture as well as its director, King Vidor for Best Director. Francis Marion&apos;s award-winning script was so brilliant Red Skelton adapted it into his 1952 film, &quot;The Clown,&quot; where he plays the Andy character as a has-been clown rather than a boxer. Later generations are more familiar with director Franco Zeffirelli&apos;s 1979 version of &quot;The Champ&quot; with Jon Voight, Faye Dunaway and Ricky Schroder as the son. This film was actress Joan Blondell&apos;s last movie.",

An axe-wielding psycho dressed as Santa steals a list of the cancellations and proceeds to kill everyone on it, framing Caesar and Otto for the murders.\n\nComedy is such a subjective thing. I can&apos;t stand Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill, but they both have legions of fans who think that they&apos;re the funniest thing since the first caveman to step on a banana skin and fall into a tar pit. I find the appeal of zany duo Caesar and Otto even more mystifying than that of Hill and Rogen, but with three feature length films already under their belt, Deadly Xmas being the latest, maybe I&apos;m the one with the problem (actually, I have many problems, I just didn&apos;t think that having no sense of humour was one of them).\n\nIf 83 minutes of broad, absurdist, slapstick comedy featuring numerous corny horror references, wooden performances, extremely low production values, and several cameos from struggling B-movie actors sounds like your cup of tea, then fill your boots. But don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t try to warn you.",

      "reviewBody": "Kamikaze Taxi is a quirky, innovative social satire that is well worth watching only if you are open to seeing a different style of film. This is certainly not the usual Hollywood action film but more for the art-house cinema-buff crowd who enjoy cult films.\n\nThe aspect of Japanese living in Peru and Brazil is in itself intriguing. There are the cultural differences and insights into racial problems which offer an interesting mix. Viewers who peer beyond the violence and sex in this film will find much to rouse their intellect.\n\nThis film is unique in how it weaves various fabrics of life that are normally separate and often contradictory. For example, we hear magical Peruvian pan pipes played by a Japanese man standing, not high in the Andes, but in a lush green Brazilian forest. The spiritual yearning of this musician contrasts sharply with the ugly violence and betrayal of those near to him in the beautiful forest.\n\nThe film is in Japanese, and obviously delivers its message to Japanese society. Keep this in mind when considering the tragedy, humour, corruption, naivety, idealism, contradictions and poetic style that this film portrays so well. What does this say about the Japanese character? Is it true also for those of us who are not Japanese? Gather your friends and discuss such questions over cups of capuccino or glasses of brandy. There is more to this film than first meets the eye."

The wealth gives dreams but leads us to a pit of tensions.\n\n3. The people who are involved in fraud play lose their happiness forever.\n\n4. All kinds of friendship is not trustable especially in financial case.\n\n5. The wrong method for earning more will push one away from peaceful life which forms the central theme of the movie.",

He pawns his gold medal, gambles with the money, loses everything, &amp; the balance is pick-pocketed. He ends up on the beach, meets with Vidya Shastri, a teacher who runs a private school, and both fall in love. Ranbir gets a job in a laundry. When he goes to deliver some clothes to Maya, she notices that he has a way with cards, gets him to accompany her to a casino of sorts, where he wins Rs.20000/-, which unfortunately is pocketed by Maya. Then a rich industrialist, Sonanand Dharmachand, approaches Ranbir, hires him to work for him, and soon Ranbir is on his way to a wealthy life. Vidya gets a first hand look at this wealthy life, and decides to break up with him. Sonachand teaches Ranbir that in order to make money one must never discriminate between the rich and poor. So they set out to offer homes to the homeless for Rs.100/-. Watch what happens when Ranbir finds out that Sonachand has been setting him up to be the fall guy.",

With very low expectations, I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of &quot;Rebellion&quot;. It has a very good script, as it keeps suspense and engagement up high. It focuses on &quot;who done it&quot;, instead of focusing on violence and bloodshed. Through a series of mistrust and backstabbing, suspense and thrill is maintained well throughout. Another thing I like about the movie is that it gives each of the main character a distinct personality. The actors, especially Shawn Yue and Chapman To, convincingly portray their characters. Production, including camera work, lighting and sets are also above average. Coupled with the unexpected ending twist, I can safely conclude that &quot;Rebellion&quot; is an engaging and above par film from Hong Kong."

It&apos;s driving me crazy.\n\nIn the meantime , this is a fun film (if derivative). The biggest mistake might be the Pipe Cleaner antennea on the little monsters. The idea the creatures are subterranian in nature was very different for the period. All in all a good fun romp. The classical score does add a weirdness that somehow compelling.",

They witness a murder of their manager, and escape to Los Angeles to avoid their own executions. Connie is played by Nia Vardalo of &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; fame.  She gives a pithy performance and one is drawn to her likable character.  Toni Collette as Carla also gives a warm performance.  Together they portray drag queens in their quest for remaining undiscovered.  There is a delightful array of &quot;drag queens&quot; in the chorus line that punctuates this well organized film.  In addition, there is a charming surprise performance by Debbie Reynolds toward the end.  I can recommend this film as a very light way to spend ones cinematic experience.  It is not great, but it is lots of fun.",

Everyone did their job well, especially Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. They both excelled in their roles as Lincoln and Henry respectively. Plot flowed well and was easy to follow, and the action was absolutely fantastic. It was over the top, fast paced, bloody, and very well done. If you don&apos;t mind seeing vampires getting hacked, slashed, and bashed to death in a wide variety of ways, you&apos;ll enjoy this movie.",

Just personal taste, but it&apos;s not music that usually speaks to me.\n\nBut this tragic, darkly comic, oddly triumphant and endearing look at a group of young Iraqis trying to keep their band together and play - in the middle of the insanity of war, and then later in exile in Syria - and also seeing the crazy bravery of the two young guys trying to make a film about them - has stuck in my head with very fond feelings. \n\nBy making the war and it&apos;s effects this personal I came away with a much deeper understanding than I might have from a film trying to cover the whole wide landscape. \n\nI wasn&apos;t quite as moved on a second viewing with friends, but it&apos;s still a film I think of with tremendous warmth, and recommend whether you like heavy metal or not.",

This movie is so atrocious that I advise everyone to use all of its package as combustion to set some good fire on freezing nights.\n\nAstounding feat: The first half-hour of the movie presents the main actress trying to find her sister. A complete banal and monotonous way to open a film with the first 35 minutes (!!) filled with walking around thru nothings and the nerve-racking ineptitude of the actress to have sex with her man.\n\nPlot review: It is an amazing silliness with grotesque and pointless annoying shots after that blank 35 minutes. The movie tries to offer a miscellany of alien conspiracy theories and weirdo scientific experiments but only delivers confusion, commonplaces, poorly conceived interactions and a horrific bad experience to the viewer.\n\nBig question: How this script found funding is an enigma to me.\n\nConclusion: Avoid this one for the sake of your time.",

It also takes you up the country road to the talked about farmhouse where three people were murdered in the dead of winter night. There are actual crime scene photos of Teena Brandon and the inside of the broken-into farmhouse. I found those particularly disturbing, but I guess that is how to try capturing the essence of what it was like so viewers may learn from it. The video also includes interviews from friends and family of the killers and the victims. There are even interviews from inside the prisons from the killers themselves, trying to appear wrongly accused and failing miserably. The clueless sheriff is also seen praising their law enforcement, even after botching the rape and murder case in front of the world. This is not for children or the squeamish, and it really makes a strong impact.",

It&apos;s hardly known at all here in the West but if any Polish movie is ripe for rediscovery it&apos;s this, for here is a comedy that is laugh out loud funny and consistently charming from beginning to end, with something of a fairytale quality to its ridiculous plot.\n\nThe title says it all really. Eve, a penniless, or should I say zloty-less, young student has nowhere to lay her head for the night and all her efforts to find a bed, including a potential spell in jail, amount to nothing. It may be a slight little picture but it has a very sweet nature and is beautifully directed. The smile never really left my face.",

      "reviewBody": "I really had looked forward to this movie, being a big LCD Soundystem fan for years, but it really opened my eyes to the ego of James Murphy, who I had once thought to be one of the coolest guys making music today. Everything felt staged or scripted. The movie opens with Murphy &quot;waking&quot; to his phone ringing, but was there a camera man filming him all night waiting for him to wake? I don&apos;t think so. There are several other moments like this peppered throughout the film.\n\nThe interview that forms the backbone to the documentary is more cringey than anything else. Murphy&apos;s ego can&apos;t be kept in check and some of his answers make you wish he would stop talking and cut back to the farewell concert in Madison Square Garden, which is really the only thing that feels natural here. It&apos;s a fantastic, huge performance and is captured brilliantly.\n\nTowards the end, where we see Murphy going to the store where all the band&apos;s gear is kept and breaking down and crying in an Oscar-worthy performance. Again, it all feels staged: &quot;now for the emotional bit&quot;. I actually ended up feeling slightly sorry for the guy, crying over a few synthesizers.\n\nThey were a great band but they were only around for 9-10 years. I think the guy needs some perspective. &quot;Shut Up and Play the Hits&quot; is a more apt title than they probably realized.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a 74-year old who bought Super Furball as a DVD at the Dollar Tree. I&apos;m a fan of film, and especially animation, so went for it.\n\nSuper Furball is actually quite a story, as it involves the good little girl in school, with typical problems at home (divorced family, slob boyfriend, bullys and cliques at school) who seeks a pet. Gets a guinea pig.\n\nGuinea pig leads to superpowers. If you see the film you&apos;ll see how. It works as a fantasy.\n\nWhat gets pretty (more European complex) is that there&apos;s a mystery of the herring in the cove (important stuff in Finland, and yes, everywhere) are going wild, due to pollution. That&apos;s not a big spoiler, but it&apos;s important to the movie. In fact, the ecology message is rather complex and profound in a movie like this.\n\nI&apos;d say it reminded me in scope and style, of &quot;The Christmas Chronicles Two&quot;. Which is a complement.\n\nFinally, since it&apos;s dubbed English over Finnish, the mouths don&apos;t move exactly. Also, there is charming animations our hero makes in her notebooks along the way, and the words are in FInnish. And there&apos;s some FInnish pop associations. So it&apos;s an animation as adventure in another country&apos;s style, like going to a Vietnamese restaurant. Or a Chinese Restaurant on Christmas like Ralphie and his family do in the original great &quot;The Christmas Story&quot;.",

It was the home of hundreds of very small penguins. But then foxes discovered they could cross and soon the penguin population dwindled until it was down to under 20.\n\nThere are a few subplots going on but the main one is this curious dog named Oddball takes a liking to penguins and ultimately is utilized to scare off the foxes and help reestablish a healthy penguin population.\n\nMy wife and I watched it on Amazon streaming movies, it is a very nice and entertaining movie."

      "reviewBody": "Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious.\n\nWhen a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies â or anything for that matter - it&apos;s time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton, Zizek&apos;s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a &quot;great&quot; idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I&apos;m kind of surprised he didn&apos;t play a clip from &quot;Snowhite&quot; and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Moslem hell). It&apos;s like the premise of Schumacher&apos;s &quot;The Number 23&quot;: play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di&apos;s death.\n\nHowever, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch &quot;Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It&apos;s like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions.\n\nI have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like &quot;Birds&quot; this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don&apos;t require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them â unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days...\n\nWhen Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the &quot;Psycho&quot; shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh&apos;s blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh&apos;s vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out, this representing some kind of &quot;clever (Zizekian) irony&quot;. Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene his movies wouldn&apos;t have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to illustrate just how easy it is to improvise about &quot;hidden, deep meanings&quot;. And when you add Zizek&apos;s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible.\n\nZizek utters a number of unintentionally bits of poppycock, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins&apos;s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with &quot;the satisfaction of work, of a job well done&quot;. Don&apos;t laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of &quot;Psycho&quot; could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one&apos;s (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to &quot;say&quot;.\n\nI like Zizek&apos;s initial thoughts on Tarkovsky&apos;s terrific &quot;Solaris&quot;, but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in &quot;anti-feminism&quot; and other nonsense into his theory.\n\nZizek&apos;s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. &quot;I just want to play with it all day!&quot; Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal &quot;2001&quot;s.\n\nThe fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma didn&apos;t feature more prominently; that&apos;s another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch&apos;s incomprehensible &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it.\n\nZizek&apos;s comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier&apos;s laughable, &quot;ground-breaking&quot; physical set-up in &quot;Dogville&quot; made me snicker. \n\nHowever, Zizek doesn&apos;t only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the &quot;bleedin&apos; obvious&quot;. Like all &quot;social scientists&quot; (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite &quot;observations&quot; into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it&apos;s what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.\n\nI was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit...\n\nSlavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a kid&apos;s park near you.\n\nFor depressed, frustrated, confused film students only."

      "reviewBody": "Based on Ruth Gordon&apos;s play Years Ago about her childhood, The Actress is a good and uplifting tale about a young girl following her dream. Young Ruth Gordon Jones living in a Boston suburb dreams about going on stage. She doesn&apos;t get too much encouragement from her parents, Spencer Tracy and Teresa Wright.\n\nThat does not stop our Ruth. She&apos;s determined to make it in the theater, but there is a matter of cash.\n\nSpencer Tracy is a former seaman who now works at a lowly factory job and needs every dime to support wife, daughter, and a cat that&apos;s not particularly fond of him. This is not one of Tracy&apos;s better known roles and that&apos;s a pity because it&apos;s one of his best performances.\n\nHe downplays his daughter&apos;s ambitions almost until the very end of the film. I won&apos;t reveal any more, but there is an interesting dinner scene which is the key to the film. Very similar to the breakfast scene with Adolphe Menjou and Kate Hepburn in State of the Union where he tells them of his ideas for when and if he becomes president. Only here he tells the family the reasons for why believes as he does.\n\nAlthough Jean Simmons was well beyond being a senior in high school she&apos;s a good enough actress to make it believable. It was certainly a more innocent time.\n\nThe Actress is a fine production from MGM and director George Cukor, pity it isn&apos;t out on VHS or DVD.",

That being said, Amanda Bynes is a cool and attractive leading lady/girl and plays very well with the other characters in this film.

      "reviewBody": "A suicide epidemic is sweeping Japan, even among hordes of teenaged girls who are making pacts with each other and offing themselves together. As Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi) and crew investigate, they begin to suspect that maybe there&apos;s more to it than simple suicide.\n\nIn terms of sheer spectacle, surrealism and the impact of its scenes, Suicide Club is simply an amazing, groundbreaking film. As for &quot;what it really means&quot; (assuming we could even agree on how that could be determined), it is wide open for interpretation. Everyone is likely to have their own, and not a few will probably insist that their interpretation is the &quot;right&quot; one. I don&apos;t think mine is the &quot;right&quot; one--I don&apos;t even agree that there would be a &quot;right&quot; interpretation. But at any rate, my current take on the film is that it is an extremely twisted, broad-ranging exegesis on many facets of Japanese culture (and to an extent, it can be applied to other cultures, as well) that is issuing sharp criticism at the same time that it is showing reason for hope.\n\nSuicide Club is a very dense film. By that I mean that it is packed full of meaning, symbolism, references and such. An analysis of each scene would be interesting and informative, but it would take far more than 1000 words (the space IMDb allows). At the same time that much of it may be intentionally cryptic, designed to open up the interpretational field, I think that much of the film is more transparent than its often David Lynch-like surrealism would suggest.\n\nFor example, in the late 20th/Early 21st Century, and especially in 2001, the year before Suicide Club was released, a big news story in Japan (and elsewhere, including BBC and CNN reports) was their relatively high suicide rate. 33,000 Japanese had killed themselves in 2000. The Japanese government&apos;s Ministry of Health developed a special program to combat the phenomenon. At the same time, there is a cultural history of suicide being &quot;honorable&quot; in Japan, at least in some contexts, yet contradictorily, suicide has also been looked at as strongly taboo by the Japanese, as something not even to be talked about. Japan is also a culture where a more cyclical view of time and nature is common. The major Japanese religions are Buddhism and Shinto. Many species of Buddhism accept reincarnation, and Shinto has a potential &quot;life after death&quot; as kami. In the midst of all of this, The Perfect Suicide Manual by Wataru Tsurumi was on Japanese bestseller lists for years in the late 1990s. So suicide is certainly a complex, pressing issue in Japan.\n\nWriter/director Shion Sono offers his own thesis for the root of the problem, on the way providing a strong cultural critique of Japan (and by conceptual association, similar cultures in other industrialized nations). The criticism is perhaps surprisingly conservative in light of the graphic bloodiness of the film&apos;s images, but we could see Suicide Club&apos;s brutality as partially an embrace of reality versus sweeping the truth under the rug, and partially a Natural Born Killers (1994)-styled self-indictment of the media age&apos;s contributions to the problem.\n\nA major theme is &quot;disconnect&quot;. Many are wrapped up in their work, in gadgetry and other pursuits so that they lose their connections to their families and even themselves as authentic human beings. It is significant that Sono shows many suicide victims with interlocked hands, achieving a kind of emotional/spiritual/&quot;kamic&quot; unity before taking the plunge. Another corrupt attempt at achieving the missing connection is realized in long strands of human skin that are bound together and found near some suicide victims. Kuroda, who is investigating the epidemic, is relatively disconnected from his immediate family. They need help, but he only notices when it&apos;s too late.\n\nPop culture is initially portrayed as shallow or decadent. Near the beginning of the film, the young girl pop group has a big hit with a vacuous song about e-mailing or calling them. (Did I hear someone mention &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002)?) The name of the group is alternatively written in English (via posters, video and the subtitles) as &quot;Dessert&quot; (sweet and appealing, but bad for you if overindulged and consisting of &quot;empty&quot; nutrition), &quot;Desert&quot; (a seemingly barren wasteland, or an abandoning) or &quot;Dessart&quot; (&quot;Dessert&quot; + &quot;Art&quot;). Near the middle of the film, A Ziggy Stardust-styled glam-punk is shown depravedly indulging in sex and violence--an even more extreme version of Malcolm McDowell&apos;s Alexander de Large from A Clockwork Orange (1971). Later he becomes a self-styled Charles Mansion-ish celebrity, and he is blamed for having a connection to the suicides, in a typical media/pop culture scapegoating. At one point, the suicides evolve from their initial spirit of a unifying pact to a fad to be indiscriminately mimicked, whether one does it alone or not. It seems that in such an environment, even suicide is not immune from corruption.\n\nThe film only begins to reach a resolution once characters are lectured on their unwitting alienation/inauthenticity/dissociation from their core values. Children, either as perceptive innocents or wise reincarnates are the primary instruments of this reeducation. Even &quot;Desert&quot; contributes, as they sing a song about piecing together jigsaw puzzles. Later, when they decide to literally desert their pop stardom, they do so with a farewell song that&apos;s no longer shallow, but full of poignancy and hope. (By the way, all of the music in the film is excellent--I would love to see a CD soundtrack released.) This is a rare film that might be difficult to enjoy without a taste for this kind of deeper analysis, but there are plenty of visceral and surreal delights for horror fans. Those with weaker constitutions may have difficulty stomaching this material, but Suicide Club is an absolutely brilliant film--all of the technical and artistic aspects are exemplary. This is one of the best films of the 2000s.",

What makes this odd to John Shepherd is that no ransom has been demanded and the kidnappers also try to abduct Issac&apos;s niece, &quot;Elizabeth Teller&quot; (Joanna Pacula) as well. Now, even though this isn&apos;t a bad film and it certainly has some suspense and action, there really isn&apos;t anything here to differentiate it from a host of other films in this genre. Chuck Norris is his usual bland self who gives his standard vanilla performance. Likewise, both Joanna Pacula and Daniel Bernhardt (as the the bad guy&quot;Dirk&quot;) perform adequately as well. And while Tracy Scoggins (&quot;Alena&quot;) is also in this film, her part was limited and this fact adds another reason for the lackluster final product. That said, if a person is looking for an average action film then this is certainly something they should consider.",

      "reviewBody": "When I saw this I had no idea it was a remake. I didn&apos;t know the original had been rated the 49th best comedy of all time by the AFI or that Brooks neither wrote nor directed it.\n\nWhat I knew was that from the moment it started to the moment the curtains came down I was laughing nonstop in awe of an incredible plot. The film managed to escalate with each passing scene. Just when you thought nothing more could be done to it, they managed to push it further and further. Brook&apos;s performance was dead on, as was the entire casts. It&apos;s the sort of movie that gives Christopher Loyd only seven or eight lines, and you love him for it and need to ask for anything more.\n\nIt continually makes fun itself, building on jokes you thought were over half a movie ago. I&apos;d place this movie above Spaceballs and below Men in Tights, but would say that it is without a doubt the best plot of any movie I&apos;ve seen in some time, comedy or otherwise.\n\nThis is a movie that you should waste no time seeking out and renting, buying, seeing in whatever way you can.\n\nStill not sold? I&apos;ll retell one of the jokes. Don&apos;t read further if you want the first five minutes to be as fresh as they were for me - if you&apos;re debating whether to see it or not, I hope this is able to sway you.\n\nThey&apos;re in a theater, putting on a show. We hear the Polish songs - not quite sure what they&apos;re singing about. The curtain comes down on the two actors smiling and bowing together as the audience claps. The moment the audience can no longer see them the actors start bickering in Polish. We&apos;re not sure what they&apos;re discussing, but it&apos;s clearly a heated debate. The curtain then comes up, they immediately are smiling, bowing, curtain comes down once again and it&apos;s back to the Polish bickering. They continue bickering, stopping for an announcement over the loudspeakers in this vaudeville theater. &quot;Attention, for the Sanity and Clarity of the Audience the rest of this movie will be English&quot;\n\nThen the movie switches into English, and the plot begins.",

      "reviewBody": "John Sturges&apos; Marooned, based on the Martin Caidin novel, tells the story of three Apollo astronauts trapped in orbit when their main engine fails to fire, and the slow, agonizing realization that there&apos;s pretty much nothing that can be done for them.\n\nUnless.\n\nIt&apos;s a slow movie, with Sturges taking his time (or his sweet time if you have no patience for this stuff) to build suspense and tension. Miles of film is expended detailing the boys at Mission Control and Kennedy trying to implement the &quot;unless&quot; I mentioned, a bold rescue mission that will arrive in the last moments of their O2, lifting off into the teeth of a hurricane, no less.\n\nWhat makes the movie work are the very things that were lampooned so accurately by the boys at Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the terse acronym-filled jargon, the performances by Peck, Janssen, Crenna, Hackman, and Franciscus, and the glaringly non-CGI special effects (that looked great in 1970).\n\nFor a space-happy 11 year old, this was the ne plus ultra of movies--and the fact that the boys on the Apollo 13 had recently gotten back alive made Marooned more than a leetle beet unnerving in its topicality.\n\nThere&apos;s a moment that the movie transcends a clinical yawner, and takes on the mantle of heartbreakingly human drama. When the astronauts&apos; wives are brought in to talk to them on small TV monitors, one after the other, and Nancy Kovack coldly tells the NASA suit &quot;I know why we&apos;re here--we&apos;re here to say goodbye to them,&quot; you feel sucker-punched. It didn&apos;t seem real until right then.\n\nThen the wives are warned that their husbands are &quot;degraded,&quot; meaning they&apos;re tired, cold, and scared beyond description. Richard Crenna and Lee Grant have a touching exchange, the commander and his tough, beautiful, middle-aged wife trying to say everything to each other except goodbye. Kovack struggles with James Franciscus because her husband is the Spock of this mission, clinical and scientific. Yet he angrily assures her that they will make it. You can see him expending every bit of energy to convince her and himself that he&apos;s not a dead man orbiting.\n\nFinally, Mariette Hartley tries to comfort Gene Hackman, who is bordering on hysteria and panic. She watches in a gut-wrenching horror as he reacts to her reading a letter the wives have written to the President. He cries and rages something like &quot;I broke the lawn-mower, and I can&apos;t fix it and everyone is blaming me for it!&quot; Hartley is hustled away, but she stops in dumb horror as she sees her husband on the big monitor in flight control, screaming &quot;Don&apos;t kill me!&quot; as Crenna and Franciscus hold him down to shoot him full of sedatives.\n\nIt&apos;s the most painful and human moment of the movie. Sturges has kept you on the edge of boredom, then wham, it&apos;s somehow all real. The movie goes from intellect to emotion in a matter of a few moments. I didn&apos;t appreciate this as an a tweenager, but God how my mouth went dry watching it a few days ago. These poor bastards are already in their titanium-shielded coffin! \n\nThe rest of the movie is predictable, but brutal in its denouement. You know that, if the men are to be saved, there&apos;s going to be some dues paid. I remember seeing Marooned at the Garland Theatre in Spokane in May, 1970. When those dues were paid, my mom was tearing up. \n\nI thought, typical for a woman.\n\nI was clearing my throat a lot and having trouble focusing on the screen when my family and I watched it over the weekend.\n\nAdulthood has its upside, I guess."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Longest Daycare (2012)&apos; is a &apos;Simpsons&apos; short film focusing on everyone&apos;s favourite TV baby, Maggie Simpson. It walks on familiar ground, being reminiscent of a sequence in the episode &apos;A Streetcar Named Marge (1992)&apos;, and clearly takes inspiration from animated cinema of the 1940s and 50s. It is, however, animated in its source show&apos;s &apos;new style&apos; and, as such, is relatively flat compared to most other animated shorts. Still, the piece is enjoyable enough. It has a succinct, simple-to-understand story and some decent referential humour. It&apos;s not hugely exciting, but it&apos;s engaging and contains a nice little &apos;twist&apos; at the end. It&apos;s entertaining. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "And so goes the chorus for rapper Ice-T&apos;s hit gang warfare anthem &quot;Colors,&quot; which also happened to be the name of the 1988 gang warfare action film &quot;Colors,&quot; which was directed by the late actor/director Dennis Hopper, who does not appear at all in the film.\n\n&quot;Colors&quot; was one of the earliest films to deal with the bloody gang violence that by 1988 when the film was released, close to 400 gang-related murders had occurred in the greater Los Angeles area. The police were overworked and unable to effectively deal with the increasing gang violence, communities were forced to live in fear, and the L.A. streets were a virtual war zone.\n\n&quot;Colors&quot; was also different from previous films dealing with gangs in the fact that although it was told largely from the point-of-view of the dedicated police officers out there on the streets trying to curb the rising gang violence and ease community fears, it also showed us some of the inner-workings of gangs and why some people, mostly teenagers and young adults, join them and find such a dangerous lifestyle so rewarding. For once, gang members are given a human face so that we understand why they may do what they do as gangs.\n\nThe film focuses on the L.A. Police Department&apos;s anti-gang C.R.A.S.H. (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) unit. At the beginning of the film, and using a set-up familiar to the many buddy-cop action films produced during the time, veteran C.R.A.S.H. officer Bob Hodges (Robert Duvall) is partnered up with the brash, young Danny McGavin (Sean Penn). Hodges knows the streets and has an informal rapport with many of the local L.A. gangs, and many of them know him; there&apos;s a sense of mutual respect between Hodges and the gang members. Danny also knows the streets, but knows nothing of how to fight the gangs terrorizing them and he just wants to bust heads and make arrests.\n\n&quot;Colors&quot; is almost episodic as Hodges and Danny go from one anti-gang operation to another, but a plot of sorts forms at the scene of the latest gang homicide. A young &quot;Blood&quot; gang member is gunned down in his backyard by a rival &quot;Crips&quot; crew, led by Rocket (Don Cheadle, in an early role playing a character with much restrained malevolence). Hodges and McGavin are put on the case, and as their investigation goes on, it brings them into contact with many of the other local L.A. gangs fighting for &quot;turf&quot; in the streets - eventually culminating in a bloody turf war with the cops and surrounding communities caught in the middle.\n\n&quot;Colors&quot; does have its weaknesses in an occasionally spotty script and weak dialogue. But the film keeps you watching and engaged to what&apos;s going on on the screen. Fault can be found, of course, with the buddy-cop formula of pairing a veteran like Robert Duvall with an unseasoned rookie in Sean Penn. But their pairing works, as the two constantly clash with one another over their differing approaches to the job - but gradually build a grudging respect for the other man and his perspective on how to best handle their situation.\n\n&quot;Colors&quot; was also remarkable, as I mentioned earlier, in that the gang members themselves are not nameless, faceless entities occupying your typical us-vs.-them war flick. No. Hopper actually took the opportunity to go inside the gangs so that we get to know some of them as characters. We don&apos;t condone anything they do, but we get to know them and understand why gang-banging is so appealing - family, belonging, lack of ambition and/or opportunity, power/status, the overall lifestyle, etc. It was a brave and revealing, and unflinching, insight, and a departure, since not having this could have made &quot;Colors&quot; seem like your run-of-the-mill late-&apos;80s cop movie.\n\nA great action-crime film that comes highly recommended from this viewer.\n\n8/10",

In fact, overall, the technical aspects of the film was of a reasonably high professional standard. \n\nThe sets and costuming were well done to the extent that they did not detract from film. i.e. There was nothing strange that would distract the viewer from accepting that the hospital was, indeed, a hospital; nor were there any gross violations of cinematic convention. \n\nNaturally, the bomb was disarmed seconds before detonation. If it went off, how could the picture continue without a lead? And, did you ever notice the leads (good and/or bad guys) never die from the first shot - only the bit players. \n\nBack to the main premise - could this film be any worse? Yes, but if it were any worse, I cannot imagine anyone willing to continue watching. It&apos;s just bad enough to entice you into thinking, &quot;It&apos;s gonna/gotta get better.&quot; \n\nThe IMDb viewers have been very generous to give this a 4+.",

But after her first period, Kinu suffers the fate of any women born near the Sacred Mountain: she must leave the Mountain and serve as priestess But she has a plan to stay near her old home - which involves marrying into a rival branch of her family. \n\nFew Japanese films are as as exacting in recounting the details of custom and superstition as this, where the mores of everyday life are enforced by ritual and fate. This version, then, is a striking variation on the Bronte version, and completely convincing.",

I was studying at Manhattan&apos;s Grand Street Playhouse at the time, and the political climate that was beginning to engulf the public had started. Polonsky barely hid the real undercurrent of this remarkable film. When it finally hit the VHS bins, I was almost first on line. I agree with all of the positive remarks on this strong movie, that has all kinds of ghostly memories hovering over it. I did indeed develop a strong crush on Beatrice Pearson, who was an established Broadway actress. She later did quite a turnaround, and even more effective role in LOST BOUNDARIES with excellent work alongside Mel Ferrer, Susan Douglas, Richard Hylton and Carleton Carpenter. From what I have read (if it is to be believed), she was difficult with a friend around offering advice at every turn. Pearson, after BOUNDARIES, returned to Broadway. Wherever she is now may be a mystery, but if she ever reads this, I hope she knows that this is one fan who still smiles at thoughts of her hair falling over the side of her face, her lovely smile, and the sight of her sitting atop a high hall mantle."

The original one ended with the capture of a giant brain bug as it became obvious those bugs definitely were using some kind of military strategy. But it&apos;s only the tip of the iceberg so to say.\n\nRico is in a nice jackpot as he&apos;s blamed for a huge battle loss and scheduled to be hung. But he has friends in high places and they need him for a rescue mission of a sky admiral.\n\nThere&apos;s also a growing peace movement that gets kind of violent as peace movements sometimes can. \n\nAs for the rest all I can say is the bugs are learning quite a bit about what makes humankind tick.\n\nVan Dien is still as heroic as ever as John Rico, perhaps a bit wiser with age. None of the others who played characters who survived reappear in this. Might have made for greater continuity if they had.\n\nUnlike the first sequel the second paid a bit more attention to the society that formed because of the bug invasion and some of the inevitable flaws in a militarist based society. It&apos;s also got a lot of good action.\n\nNowhere a patch on the original but far better than number 2.",

      "reviewBody": "Two main characters that earn their title and a story that&apos;s both funny and heart wrenching. This movie starts off a little slow but raises the bar with every minute of film and culminates in a both very ordinary but genius final cut scene. I am not a big fan of most German movies, but this gem of a movie is really great material with typical German humor and high-rise apartment building nostalgia.\n\nThe story has a weak spot or two in terms of the starting premise but the rest of the movie makes up for any of that with ease. Esecially Ulmen is brilliant in his role of portraying what must be tough to bring across on the big screen. He slips into his role of a father stuck in the mental state of a 10 year old excellently and somehow actually seems to grow up towards the end of the movie without making it seem like an unreal development.\n\nLola as Radost perfectly plays her character as a Teenager stuck between 2 worlds: The guardian of her own father not capable of filling that role and on the other hand the youngster during puberty ready to experience life and make some pretty standard teenager mistakes. Needless to say, these worlds are meant to collide and Lola doesn&apos;t need a narrator to express that on the screen.\n\nIn my eyes this is pretty damn good popcorn material and worth a watch if you understand German or find a version with subtitles. Worth every minute I spent watching it. I actually got hooked 5 minutes in. Love it!",

      "reviewBody": "The closest I&apos;ve got to the rain forest was earlier this year. I fell into the Amazon climbing a tree to get a photo. My guide had just scaled it with ease, whereas I was unfamiliar with the slippery bark. It is an alien and challenging environment, mostly cut off from the rest of Brasil and the civilised world.\n\nDirector Marco Bechis penetrates further. Much further. Further than tourist-explorers who trek far into the depths. Further than the Bafta-winning TV series of Bruce Parry which charted people deep along the Amazon. Further than Martin Strel of Big River Man, who swam across Brasil to become one with the denizens of the rivers. And arguably much further than filmmakers such as the excellent Elite Squad director JosÃ© Padhila, who finds commercially viable subject matter in the favelas of Rio or the starving thousands of his native Brasil.\n\nCompared to the Indians of Mato Grosso, who play the leading parts in the gripping drama Birdwatchers, the rest of the world is just that. Looking at birds from the outside in. A pretty species here. A rare tribe in warpaint there. A fascinating social problem to look at. We see it from the point of view of our own world. But here is a story that evokes Brasil from the inside out. The people connected with its land from the start. We see the world through their struggle for existence. Their loves. Their lives. Their suicides.\n\nSays Bechis, &quot;All Guarani share a religion that attributes supreme importance to the earth, the origin and source of life. The Guarani experience the invasion of their land not only as theft, but also as a serious assault on their very identity.&quot; Set within the creeping genocide and loss of the rainforest that sustains them, Nadio leads a rebellion to try and reclaim a small part of their homeland. The place where their forefathers are buried. It happens to be a farm. They set up a makeshift camp, and the farmers try to interact constructively. Up to a point. They try to offer them work. Or sleep with the women. Or arrange for them to perform &apos;authentic&apos; displays for visitors in this deep interior. Ultimately, they terrorise them.\n\nOsvaldo is learning to be a shamen. Following a strict lifestyle that includes not eating beef even when the tribe is starving, the handsome youth forms a liaison with a farmer&apos;s daughter as they swim in the same lake together. Their sexual and emotional awakening coincides with the increasing irritation of the farmers with Osvaldo&apos;s tribe. The lyrical beauty of the rain forest&apos;s deep south is paired with a story of increasing violence and hopelessness.\n\nIn the last 20 years, over 517 of the few remaining Guarani-KaiowÃ¡ Indians have committed suicide. Many were young people. The youngest was nine years old. Brasil prides itself on being an indivisible mixture of three races â Europeans, Africans and Indians. But the mix is not as equitable as we are led to believe. Deforestation â ironically driven in part by demand for &apos;green&apos; ethanol fuel â has reduced the Guarani Indians to an endangered &apos;species&apos; that do not even have the right to own land. Eliane Juca da Silva, a Guarani who stars in the film (playing Mami, who sleeps with a farm hand to steal his gun) was taken to its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. She broke down in tears after journalists applauded. &quot;We just want a chance to survive,&quot; she said.\n\nBechis had first to introduce them to the concept of cinema, over a period of months, before interviewing would-be actors. With Osvaldo, he hit gold. As a trainee shamen, his ritualistic life is already one of performance, and he understands instinctively what it means to act. Bechis used a theatre trainer to develop acting technique in the selected players based on their existing cultural mannerisms, movement and way of talking. He worked with the charity Survival International to check facts are accurately portrayed in the story. But the whites are not thrown into any cultural clichÃ© either. In a confrontation where Nadio rages about the theft of the earth they walk on, the farmer angrily retorts that three generations of his people have worked the land, successfully producing food for many people. His jet-setting modern friends, and the iPod-groovy teenage daughter who takes up with Osvaldo, are also representative of an established part of Brazilian life and accurately depicted.\n\nIt is a situation where there are no ethical absolutes. We have the privilege of trying to understand. Even help. But the charity whose website address flashes on the screen all too briefly among end credits and the parting facts and figures â how many will contact it? How many will go and see the film? For most of the western world, Brasil, a country the size of the USA, is barely on the map of consciousness. Sadly, &apos;coloniser-friendly&apos; films, like City of God or Motorcycle Diaries, are the only ones likely to get much airtime.\n\nRemarkably, Birdwatchers is no bleeding-heart polemic: these lost people&apos;s way of handling things will make you laugh as well as staying glued to see how their impossible but real life situation unfolds.",

      "name": "A critique of the criticisms",
      "reviewBody": "I have been lurking on this section for some time now, with a few raised eyebrows at some of the comments that have been passed here. I think some are just wholly unjustified and inaccurate.\n\nI have seen Krrish twice now. It is an unabashed popcorn entertainer. You&apos;re typical Hollywood special effects summer blockbuster, only that it has a unique Indian soul and the quintessential Bollywood elements. It is an accomplished blend of Indian popular storytelling , western technology and Asian action and it&apos;s historic success in India, proves how successful this fusion is.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most Hollywood film, where technology and action takes precedence, here special effects are minimally and virtuously(often seamlessly) used and most of the emphasis is on the emotional journey of the protagonist, who is reborn as the superhero, only towards the end, shifting to sci-fi action and concluding in a mesmerising ground-air-sea helicopter chase sequence, supported by an awesome and adrenaline-pumping background score. \n\nNow I am going to deal with the common issues made against Krissh: \n\n1. Action and special effects do not compare to Hollywood standards.\n\nYou really do need to define what Hollywood standards are. I have seen many big budget Hollywood special effects extravaganzas and the quality of special effects are variable; they range from good to bad; from shot to shot and from film to film.\n\nKrrish is nothing below &quot;Hollywood standards&quot; It has effects work that is on par or better than some Hollywood films, and less than some. What matters most, is do they work on their own terms, and given that masses of people, including international critics have appreciated them, means an emphatic yes.\n\n2. The techniques, effects and stunts are borrowed and/or plagiarised from Hollywood and Asian films; such as Crouching Tiger, House of flying daggers,Paycheck, Matrix.\n\nFirst of all, it would make sense that special effects techniques have been repeated from Hollywood, because the special effects supervisors - are from Hollywood.\n\nIt would make sense that the stunts and martial arts have been repeated from Asian films, because the stunt choreographer - is from Hong Kong.\n\nSecondly, techniques are invented to be reused. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nA filmmaker has at his utility an entire tool-kit of established techniques. It is how he uses them to actualise his vision that creates originality. In that respect, Rakesh Roshan is not a hack, because while he borrows techniques, he tailors them to his unique vision and lends them an originality of their own.\n\nThe stunts and action scenes have been designed according to Krrish&apos;s character and his own quirks, abilities and idiosyncrasies.\n\nIn particular, the final ground-air-sea helicopter chase sequence and the shot where Krrish uses the fountain jet to catapult him(awesome shot) into the air has never been done before. The anime-inspired fight sequence on the island is another spark of creativity. The initial sequence of him running to catch the glider is another very original sequence. Ditto for the Circus fire scene.\n\n3. Krrish is a mundane love story, comedy and drama for most of the film. Not enough superhero elements.\n\nWhen I watched Krrish the first time, I too echoed the same sentiments. I wanted to see more action scenes and superhero elements, not the usual run of the mill romantic comedy. I was disappointed. Then when I watched it the second time, this time without expecting a superhero film, I realised it&apos;s not suppose to be a superhero film; it is the beginning of a superhero \n\n4. Krrish is a hybrid of other superheros films and copies plot elements.\n\nSuperhero films are quite a predictable genre and share many similarities. They are the classic tale of good vs evil, where the hero is super-good and the villain is super-evil(often a megalomaniac with designs to take over the world) and the film builds to the final face-off, where good will invariably triumph. Superman follows the exactly the same story arc; so does Batman; so does Spiderman; and yes, so does Krrish.\n\nAnother similarity is that the superhero-ego will often be incognito and not reveal their true identity, except to a select few. You see this in Superman; Spiderman and Batman; so, you also see it in Krrish. Again, because the superhero is mysterious, they become the talk of the world and the the press become obsessed with them and in unveiling their identity. You see this in Superman; Spiderman and Batman; so you see it in Krrish.\n\nKrrish is as original and unoriginal as any superhero film. If you can accept that Superman is not a copy of Spiderman and Spiderman is not a copy of Batman. Then you should be able to accept that Krrish is not a copy of either of them and stands as an original work. \n\n5. Krrish is just the usual Bollywood potboiler, with songs and dances, comedy, melodrama and colours.\n\nSo are 99.9% of Bollywood films. This is the unique Bollywood identity and film-making heritage and make no mistake about it, Krrish is an all-out Bollywood film, made for mass consumption by Bollywood fans.\n\nKrrish is a very commendable and well-made film, an all out-entertainer, with plenty of cool action and special effects, but with it&apos;s heart in it&apos;s story of Krishna becoming Krrish(played admirably by Hrithik Roshan) It&apos;s also a historic milestone in Indian film-making, and will be to Indian cinema, what Superman was to American cinema. Expect the sequel to even bigger.\n\nAn impressive and world-class entry by Bollywood to the fantastic world of sci-fi and fantasy. I look forward to more such films from Bollywood. In fact, as I write , another Bollywood director is in the preproduction phase of a big budget futuristic sci-fi romance set in 2050 India, and not an ordinary love story, it&apos;s the love story between a robot and a human!",

      "reviewBody": "Having enjoyed Mike Figgis&apos; earlier efforts, &quot;Loss of Sexual Innocence&quot;, &quot;Timecode&quot;, and &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, I entered the Varsity theatre at the Toronto International Film Festival in high spirits, also excited by the opportunity to hear Figgis introduce his film and take part in a question-answer program afterwards.\n\nAfter sitting through literally 2 and 1/2 hours of assaulting pretentious montages and amateurish camera work (not to mention editing), I was even more appalled by Figgis&apos; own take on his work.\n\nThe man brags openly about not having any script, storyline or characters to speak of. He then goes on to talk about how he is the &quot;actor&apos;s director&quot;, giving his cast the &quot;freedom&quot; to indulge themselves and improvise. What I&apos;m thinking was how could you do this to your producers, to your cast?!--people who put their reputations on the line and end up looking utterly ridiculous (the only one to emerge from this wreck unscathed is John Malkovich, obviously smart enough to pull-out from the project just in time, only to appear in the opening 2 scenes)!\n\nMy question for him would have been something along the lines of &quot;why did you want to make this film?&quot;.\n\nFor that matter Figgis didn&apos;t even seem to know what his film was about. I&apos;ve never before seen such a soulless, self-indulgent piece.\n\n Making a good, meaningful film should be a labor of love for the director. When you ask an actor to put their names and invest their abilities on your project you must show them the same respect.\n\nIn the end, when I think of `Hotel&apos;, I think of Figgis standing before a microphone making a complete ass of himself, going on about the brilliance of his work. But others not fortunate enough to have that experience will more likely remember David Schwimer barking like a dog at the camera or Burt Reynolds entering and smiling for the camera and then having literally nothing to say for an entire scene, never to appear in the movie again.\n\n If it were up to me the film would end with a still, black-and-white head shot of  its &quot;director&quot; Mike Figgis, superimposed above all the credits."

While I am not really a big Cyrus fan I find her curious, and find that she is a very capable actress. Filming started right after she turned 18.\n\nI started watching out of curiosity but kept watching because it is filmed in New Orleans, in many places I am familiar with. Tulane University, Audubon Park, St. Charles Avenue, Cafe du Monde, and a host of other places I know. Miley Cyrus is Molly who is hired to attend classes and join a sorority in New Orleans, to operate as an undercover investigator called Brooke.\n\nI found the movie overall to be a bit better than its current IMDb rating of &quot;5&quot; would indicate. It is a well made movie with a good cast and while some of the situations are not plausible there are a few funny ones and the overall 90 minute viewing is entertaining."

Right from the get go this felt like the first episode to a really bad MTV series (not that any of them are good). I stuck with it because I hate to judge a movie without seeing it to the end, but I am kind of regretting that now.\n\nSo the film is centered on a picture perfect teenage boy who wakes up in a blood soaked cabin and tries to recall what exactly happened. The story is told through poorly done flashbacks that try to move as fast as possible. That&apos;s one of my big problems with this, the pace of the film is actually too fast. They try to rush everything along in order to hold the audience&apos;s attention but really all it did for me is make me lose interest in what was going on. I didn&apos;t establish any kind of connection with the characters or the story because the fast pacing just made everything feel really cheesy and cheap.\n\nMaybe I&apos;m not the perfect person to be reviewing this movie, I am not a teenager and I feel like the is that main demographic that this film was going after. The cheesy romance and the lame jokes just fell flat on me but those are things that the MTV audience will probably enjoy. For me though I thought this was a pretty terrible film, after an hour of it I was really eager for it to just end. Other than some decent gore I really don&apos;t have many good things to say, wouldn&apos;t recommend it unless you are a fan of MTV type stuff.\n\n3/10",

      "reviewBody": "As a young man, Brian Sewell met the artist Salvador DalÃ­ and was invited to his house. That evening, after an awkward period of time with hosts and guest sitting in remote eggs, Sewell found himself lying in the armpit of a sculpture of Christ, masturbating while DalÃ­ watched. This started a friendship of shorts that lasted several years and, from this personal perspective he recalls his memories of DalÃ­ from the time but also his thoughts as he watched DalÃ­ in his later years.\n\nHaving just been to see the recent DalÃ­ exhibition at the Tate in London I was curious to see this film for more of an insight into the artist and his work. In this way I found the film both interesting but also a little weaker than I would have liked. The background into DalÃ­&apos;s sexual life and obsessions is of value and also the discussion of his later life were interesting as we generally focus on the high points of someone&apos;s career once they are gone. All of this content is interesting and I had no real problem with this, but I did have a problem with the delivery of the film.\n\nFor the most part Sewell is a voice, unseen behind lots of footage lifted from other places and photographs that are animated together in a way that (sorry) doesn&apos;t really work within the context of the rest of the tone and style. This was a weakness and a bit of a problem but for me personally the issue was more Sewell. He opens the film saying he was in Spain looking for somewhere unpretentious to be and I&apos;m sure I am not the only person to believe that this was the last time that Sewell ever sought out anything lacking pretence. There is no doubting his intelligence but his delivery is so heavy and pretentious at times that it does feel like he is trying to make his intellect the focus of the film rather than letting his reflections drive the film on DalÃ­.\n\nDespite this though, the film is still engaging if you have more than a passing interest in the artist (of course without this it will be of no interest to you!). it is just a shame then that the delivery is so mixed with so-so animation used and Sewell&apos;s rather pretentious narration throughout."

      "reviewBody": "Isolation in extreme conditions allows for very telling studies of human beings, and potentially unpleasant philosophical conclusions. Marooning a character on an island will get you some dramatic results, and the only way to take it a step further is to maroon that character&apos;s worst possible enemy with him. That&apos;s what Hell in The Pacific proposes.\n\nThis is not Cast Away Meets WWII. For one thing, it has a much tighter focus, completely losing anything beyond the island&apos;s horizon. It is admirable in its bloody-minded focus, and, with only two actors to cast, it&apos;s hard to imagine how it could have been any more perfect that pitching wild-man extraordinaire Lee Marvin opposite Kurosawa favorite Toshiro Mifune. A genius idea, but one that could have failed with a more conventional approach. \n\nWe are introduced to both antagonists in a neutral way, free to prefer which ever one we choose, though that is hardly the point, and director John Boorman makes it both easy and at times hard to sympathise with either in equal measure. Both actors do a fine job, playing mostly emotional and physical roles with great restrain and intelligence. \n\nBoorman&apos;s direction is perfect, rejecting excess stylization in favor of a subtle approach, aided by superb photography. You have got to see this at least once, simply because, for all its visceral thrills, it is quite profound without ever trying to be. Because it boasts top performances from two of the last century&apos;s greatest leading presences in action cinema. Because, though frustrating at first, the ending is, for once, the smartest one that could have been chosen. Humanity is on trial and the judges choose to be honest and pragmatic, thus delivering something that combines greatness and very thoughtful substance.\n\nWe need more films like this!",

      "reviewBody": "Ladies and Gentlemen, the best superhero movie of all time. Years and years ago an Ultraman named Belial attempted to gain access to the Plasma Spark, the artificial sun which serves as the power source for the Ultraman homeworld known as The Land of Light. He failed and was banished but not before bonding with a powerful alien entity called Reiblood and then returning to attempt to steal the Plasma Spark, he failed again and was this time imprisoned, years have gone by and now Ultraman Belial is free, he plans to steal the plasma spark, destroy the land of light and gain access to the monster graveyard, the inter-dimensional realm where the souls of all the monsters ever defeated go. Now bear in mind, there have been over a dozen Ultraman shows and they all had weekly monster, all those monster all in one place, and all revived at the hands of one evil Ultraman, This is as epic as it sounds. This movie gets everything right, let me go through it: Production design: This film has some great sets flawlessly blending CGI and real sets, I dare you to tell which is which in a lot of the bigger scenes, the overall look is an easy a-plus. Music: The usual kick-ass battle music we&apos;ve come to expect from this franchise but with gravitas in scenes where it&apos;s needed. Fight choreography: Here is where the film easily shines over any western superhero film, I mean yeah the fight scenes in the MCU movies have been able to blend CGI and live fighting almost flawlessly but here it&apos;s all wirework and martial arts with a little CGI for power attacks, just enough to make it look good. The two best scenes are the attack on the land of the light and the showdown in the monster graveyard. The attack on the land of light is when Ultraman Belial attacks the land of light in order to seize the plasma spark, but in order to get there he has to fight his way through a whole army of Ultramen. I love this scene for two reasons, firstly the Ultramen included in the fighting firmly establish &apos;Ultraman: The Legend Begins&apos;, &apos;Ultraman Beyond&apos; and &apos;Ultraman Powered&apos; (all foreign crossovers) as being in cannon, clearly demonstrating that the creative team knew what they were doing and had a deep love of the Ultraman universe. The other thing I love is that all the Ultramen Belial has to fight through have each had whole TV series to build up their credibility, each has had a whole series of us watching them fight monsters on a weekly basis, sometimes battling more then one on occasion and some taking on evils that threaten the existence of the entire multiverse. And yet Ultraman Belial is able to fight his way through by fighting them three at a time, This is the best way to establish how unstoppable the villain is and why to this day Ultraman Belial is one of my favourites villains of all time, this and his design is appropriately hellish and the guy doing the voice sounds appropriately maniacal and gleeful. The other fight scene I like is the showdown in the Monster Graveyard, this scene is almost a reverse of the assault on the land of light, here the few Ultramen who survived the assault on their home face off against Ultraman Belial and a whole army of monsters, it&apos;s urgent, it&apos;s dynamic, it is awesome. Acting: the acting in this movie is great, it&apos;s actually a bit more toned down then in other movies which people could accuse of being melodramatic, making it a more accessible movie for others. Characters: this movie is a grand anniversary and reunites over forty years worth of Ultramen, though some get taken out early no one feels sidelined, the only problem I have is that there is a crossover with another series about a group of humans flying around with a spaceship and one of them has a machine with which he can summon monsters but they don&apos;t take up too much screen time and their presence is explained so I don&apos;t mind them, they also pick up Ultraman Dyna (who&apos;s from the Ultraman Tiga universe but let&apos;s not get into that) just to add one of the alternate universe Ultramen to this reunion. Story: I am actually really impressed that this story works so well, having to fit in so many characters and yet it manages to make them all fit, the script could easily have felt like fan service designed to be the ultimate Ultraman crossover but it actually feels like a decent story. And so here it is, my favourite Superhero film of all time, serving as a great introduction to Ultraman, a great tribute to years of Ultraman lore, a great tokusatsu film, and a kick-ass superhero film.",

      "name": "Strange and mediocre for a Martino movie, but still pretty OK",
      "reviewBody": "As other reviewers have said this is a strange movie. It is kind of an &quot;unofficial&quot; sixth entry to the series of excellent gialli directed by Sergio Martino in the early 1970&apos;s (although, as such, it is definitely step down from his previous film &quot;Torso&quot;). It has a very familiar &quot;giallo-esqe&quot; starting point where the investigation of a murdered underage prostitute leads to a lot of equally nasty killings. It also functions as a &quot;poliziani&quot; with lots of action and chase sequences and a cynical plot involving high-level political intrigue. Claudio Cassinelli plays a cop who makes Dirty Harry look restrained and by-the-book. He sleeps with prostitutes, consorts with minor criminals, feels up underage girls, shoots at civilians, and even leads the regular police on a wreckless high-speed chase for no real reason. The people he is after though are even worse, involved in everything from kidnapping to drugs and teenage prostitution to money laundering.\n\nBut if all this isn&apos;t a little too much, the movie also tries to be a comedy. Cassanelli has a comical side-kick, and there is a running gag where he keeps breaking his glasses. Sometimes the comedy works, but other times it tends to sabotage the drama, like when he incorporates slapstick pratfalls into what is already a very over-long car chase (a bane of these type of movies ever since &quot;The French Connection&quot; was released in Italy). Fortunately, Cassinelli has charisma to spare in his first of many roles for director Martino (he didn&apos;t have the impressive breasts of Martino&apos;s other frequent collaborator Edwige Fenech, but he was no doubt a better actor). Jenny Tamburi, on the other hand, was pretty much wasted (both as an actress and pair of impressive breasts). But Mel Ferrer and most of the other obscure more actors acquit themselves pretty well. Not as good as Martino&apos;s earlier movies, but better than his later ones, and it has just been released in widescreen with English subtitles on (import) DVD. So check it out for yourself."

      "name": "Despite Title, Not A Sellers Movie",
      "reviewBody": "Is there another movie where the lead actor has his characters name in the title and yet his part is almost irrelevant to the film? This can hardly be called a Peter Sellers movie.\n\nThe movie really belongs to the two girls with a crush on the Sellers character, Henry Orient, a schlocky avant-garde pianist. Gil (Merrie Spaeth) has a the big crush on Orient and her friend Val (Tippy Walker) is her cohort in the 2 member fan club. Their relationship seems so natural you forget they are acting. Neither girl had a long career in movies (few child actors do) and it&apos;s nice to see child actors carry a movie so effortlessly. So many times kid actors can only play cute and you are quickly reminded that real kids never act that way. I suspect George Roy Hill deserves some credit for their performances - I know he got good performances from Diane Lane and Thelonious Bernard in A Little Romance. Their performance doesn&apos;t rank up there with Tatum O&apos;Neal in Paper Moon but are still very good. Considering it was the first movie for each of them, their performances are even more remarkable.\n\nAfter the girls the performance by Paula Prentiss stands out. Playing a much more glamorous role than she had previously (think Tuggle in Where The Boys Are) she is funny and sexy as the married object of Seller&apos;s affections. A pleasant surprise and an indication that she should have been a bigger star than she was. Why couldn&apos;t she have had more roles like this?\n\nTom Bosley also plays a warm father to Val - a more sentimental version of his role as Mr C on Happy Days. Angela Lansbury practically reprises her role from The Manchurian Candidate as the worst mother she could be. \n\nAs for Sellers, his accent shifts continually. Maybe he thought he was playing numerous characters as he did in Dr Strangelove and never realized when he changed costume he was still Henry Orient. As much as I love and respect Sellers, I could see other actors in the role without hurting the movie.\n\nIf you want to see teenagers do a good job of acting like teenagers (albeit in 1964 and having a crush on a concert pianist instead of the Beatles) this is a good flick. Plus New York looks really good - you almost believe it&apos;s safe for teenage girls to wander the city late at night.\n\nAs a side note, I was surprised to discover that Merrie Spaeth was the founder of Spaeth Communications. She may not have had a long career as an actress but she sure became a success as an adult.",

The movie feels cheap and it is in most parts poorly acted. Especially by children actors. It&apos;s often regarded as Tarkovsky&apos;s influenced film (Lopushanskiy, the director, being a Tarkovsky&apos;s protege) but it isn&apos;t. I don&apos;t see any Tarkovsky influences here.

      "reviewBody": "Oh, boy. Clark Gable in the Salvation Army. Where did they come up with this stuff? Nightclub performer Ivy Stevens (Joan Crawford) is despondent upon learning Howard &quot;Howdy&quot; Palmer (Neil Hamilton) has no intention of marrying her. She was just a booty call to our boy Howdy. How Neil Hamilton got so many roles in the early &apos;30s as a ladies man type is beyond me but that&apos;s how it was then I guess. Anyway, Ivy decides to jump off a bridge but she is stopped by kindly and handsome Salvation Army worker Carl (a mustacheless Clark Gable). Ivy joins up with the Salvation Army too and is seemingly happy with her new lifestyle. But then one day Howdy spots her and, despite being married now, makes a move for her. Can Ivy resist Howdy&apos;s seductive ways? Can any woman?\n\nThere&apos;s a few things wrong with this movie. First, on no planet does Joan freaking Crawford, at this time a young and sexy dancer, get that upset over being dumped by Neil Hamilton. He was born looking like a banker. So that&apos;s unbelievable. Second and third things are that Clark Gable is no Salvation Army worker and he sure as hell isn&apos;t a guy named Carl! Joan&apos;s farmer dance is the highlight of the movie and probably her best dancing number from all of her early dancing movies. Overall it&apos;s a watchable but mostly forgettable melodrama about a &quot;wrong&quot; woman going right. Avid Crawford and Gable fans will like it most.",

I do think &quot;the end justifies the means&quot; in this particular case! \n\nI sometimes even fear for her own security, wondering what would have happened if they caught her (specially the Chilean). She delves on the &quot;Condor&quot; plan, the connection between Brazilian, Chilean, Argentinian etc forces for exchanging information and &quot;savoir faire&quot; about kidnapping, torture and murder. It&apos;s fun how the French generals seem to be totally proud about their job, I suppose they are even heroes! Whereas the Argentine have been judged and condemned, by the society as much as by the judges. A difficult topic, where a definite opinion is not easy.\n\nAs a side point, I find alluring the beautiful French language, even when talking about such a violent topic. If only beauty could cancel things out...",

      "reviewBody": "The fourth cinematic installment of the notorious Italian YouTuber duo, &quot;Me contro Te - Missione Giungla,&quot; is an odyssey that, unfortunately, gets lost in an endless dÃ©jÃ  vu. Directed by Gianluca Leuzzi, the film, while reflecting the duo&apos;s established formula, fails to evolve beyond the YouTube children&apos;s entertainment brand. The plot is a predictable blend of situations already exploited in previous chapters: LuÃ¬ and SofÃ¬, fresh from an adventure in Ancient Egypt, find themselves once again having to save the world. This time, a magical source in the jungle is in danger, but the feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu is unavoidable. The film follows the usual pattern: festive atmosphere, hidden danger, race against time, all seasoned with musical moments and comedic numbers. However, &quot;Missione Giungla&quot; shows its struggle within the first ten minutes. The plot is thin, and the acting barely decent, often overshadowed by moments of excessive exaggeration. The attempt to embrace the adventure genre is ineffective, with set design and visual effects that seem to come from a YouTube video, but stretched to reach feature-length. The lead duo, Luigi Calagna and Sofia Scalia, with their childish voices, seem trapped in a format that fails to evolve. The predictable plot, TikTok-style dances, and excessive use of plastic effects turn the cinematic experience into a simulation of happiness. While the saga&apos;s success can be attributed to children&apos;s immunity to dÃ©jÃ  vu, &quot;Missione Giungla&quot; seems more like an attempt to exploit the brand than a true step forward. The film represents a necessary economic chapter but gets lost in the inability to innovate and offer quality entertainment for new generations. In conclusion, &quot;Me contro Te - Missione Giungla&quot; may awaken nostalgia for the nineties, but it fails to take the couple&apos;s cinematic experience to new heights. An adventure that, unfortunately, announces the fifth film, maintaining the formula but sacrificing the opportunity for growth.",

Romero had apparently been slated to direct Pet Semetary before commitments (Monkey Shines) pulled him off - now that would have been worth watching. This on the other hand is a rather tepid slasher flick punctuated with a few inspired moments (the dream sequences and the whole sparrow things in particular). It&apos;s hard to know who is a fault here - certainly Dark Half - despite its intriguing premise - is one of King&apos;s weaker novels - but Romero&apos;s screenplay is little more than a rather one dimensional collection of deaths. There is some suspense and some good effects but overall a rather dull affair.",

      "reviewBody": "Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti&apos;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot; is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde&apos;s characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.\n\nMahler&apos;s music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy.  But then what else would you expect with a title like that?\n\nThere is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It&apos;s mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests. The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice.  They seem to acknowledge each other&apos;s presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze.\n\nEach viewer will have his own interpretation.  The composer has lost a child of his own.  Is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved?  Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare?  Could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece?  Who knows?\n\nFrom beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th Century Venice.  The elegance of the ladies, the deck chairs on the sand, the children frolicking in their neck-to-knee bathing costumes, the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world.  While some may think the pace is rather slow at times, the film has an overall gentle quality, but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.",

      "reviewBody": "1939 that celebrated high point of the Hollywood studio system turned out to be the break out year for James Stewart. His career kicked into high gear with Destry Ridges Again and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. From just a good leading man these films guaranteed Jimmy Stewart screen immortality.\n\nDestry was equally an important film for Marlene Dietrich. Her career had come to a standstill and she had been let go from her original American studio, Paramount. A whole lot of people said she was through in Hollywood, but Marlene showed them all.\n\nThis is the second film adaption of the story, a 1932 version was done by Tom Mix, one of his last films and one of his few sound ones. This one however is THE standard version.\n\nDestry Rides Again was directed by George Marshall who was very good at mixing humor and drama to make some great films. This one is probably Marshall&apos;s greatest. Among Hollywood directors from the studio age, he is sadly forgotten. \n\nThe town of Bottleneck is one rip roaring place with a whole lot of promiscuous shooting going on. It&apos;s a pretty corrupt place run by saloon owner Brian Donlevy and his stooge mayor Samuel S. Hinds. When the sheriff is killed they &apos;elect&apos; the town drunk Charles Winninger as the new sheriff.\n\nBut Winninger who was a deputy sheriff at one time sends for the son of his former boss Thomas Jefferson Destry played by Jimmy Stewart. Destry makes quite an entrance into Bottleneck, running afoul of saloon entertainer Marlene Dietrich. His arrival in Bottleneck up to his first encounter with Marlene are some of the funniest moments ever put on screen.\n\nDestry Rides Again gave Marlene one of her classic ballads, See What the Boys in the Backroom Will Have as well as Little Joe, the Wrangler. Who would ever have thought that the girl from Germany would wind up having one of her most noted film roles as a western saloon entertainer. But Marlene created an indelible character, so much so that Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn gave her a real heartfelt tribute in Blazing Saddles. I&apos;ll bet Marlene enjoyed that one also.\n\nJames Stewart did not return to the western genre until Winchester 73 and Broken Arrow eleven years later. But this was one great film to make a debut in that film art form.\n\nYou won&apos;t indulge in any promiscuous shooting while Destry is on the job.",

      "reviewBody": "If Alien (1980) is my &quot;ten stars&quot; and Doomsday Machine (1972) is my &quot;zero stars,&quot; then Cosmos: War of the Planets -- as result of it being ever-so-slightly more competently made than Doomsday Machine -- should be &quot;one star,&quot; but I pushed it to &quot;two stars&quot; for the nostalgia value. However, regardless of my youthful, UHF-TV softspot, make no mistake: Cosmos -- produced and released quickly in 1977 to cash in on Star Wars -- is an absolute mess across the disciplines of directing, cinematography, editing, costuming, and effects. Thus, as for the next four films in the series (? !), all are one-star efforts: and this one is NOT a retitle of Cosmos: War of the Planets, as oft-critically opined.\n\nOh, yes. After Cosmos: War of the Planets, Alfonzo Brescia returned with his &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; (aka, Part II) in the form of Battaglie negli spazi stellar (aka Battle in Interstellar Space), but it was given a new, stateside title because it sounds suspiciously like &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot; And since that was Glen Larson&apos;s cheap-jack Lucas rip, that makes this a Star Wars rip twice removed.\n\nYou never heard of or seen this second film (out of the five, total) because Al&apos;s &quot;Star Wars II&quot; suffered from poor theatrical distribution and a weak reissue via home video and TV syndication (unlike the debut film, Cosmos: War of the Planets, which streams on Smart TV platforms in 2023!). Then, with all the alternate titling that plagues European films as they&apos;re distributed to the international markets, spacesploitation buffs believed the almost-impossible-to-find Battle of the Stars was Cosmos -- with a new title. It&apos;s not helping when the main cast of familiar Italian actors of John Richardson (he&apos;s &quot;Capt. Fred Hamilton&quot; in Cosmos; &quot;Capt. Mike Leyton,&quot; here), Gianno Garko, Malisa Longo, Antonio Sabato, West Buchanan, and Yanti Somer -- with most of their supporting cast -- appear in the subsequent films of the &quot;series&quot; as different characters (well, they&apos;re the same character-types, but with different names), adding to the continuity confusion.\n\nRegardless, it&apos;s not the same film.\n\nBattle of the Stars is an entirely &quot;new&quot; film that cannibalizes Cosmos for stock footage -- and all the costumes and sets return. As is the case with most &quot;sequels&quot; (Alien vs. Aliens and Mad Max vs. The Road Warrior being the exceptions to the rule), Battle is a just remake/reimage of Cosmos -- with a little script tweak: Instead of Earthlings traveling to the planet-home of the evil computer, this time: the rogue planet (or was it an asteroid; don&apos;t care) without-an-orbit-and-upset-sentient-being running it comes to Earth (from the orbit of Ganymed, Jupiter&apos;s moon) -- which was the plot of Margheriti&apos;s Battle of the Planets from his &apos;60s &quot;Gamma One&quot; series. Hey, er, uh, what happened to the ship with its computer, &quot;The Wiz,&quot; possessed by the alien computer in Cosmos &apos;77? Is that cleared up in Part III? Nope, that plotline is done and gone.\n\nLook, as someone who has seen Cosmos: War of the Planets a few times (oh, the nostalgia of stupid youth): there is no &quot;sport fishing on Earth&quot; scene and there&apos;s no androgynous, platinum blonde 12-year-old alien decked out in a silver chain mail spacesuit helping the Earthlings with an ersatz Marksman-H training remote Jedi-ball. But there is in Battle of the Stars.\n\nSo, yeah, it&apos;s the same effect shots, same sets, same actors, even the same situations (that 2001-inspired space station repair, again, and that sentient alien computer set, again). But it&apos;s a different film. It&apos;s not up for debate: it&apos;s two different film, space ace.\n\nOther inept, Italian-made &quot;Star Wars&quot; films to enjoy are The Humanoid, Star Crash, and the even-more inept than Cosmos: Escape from Galaxy III, aka Star Crash II. So, when it comes to Italian space epics, go to the master: Mario Bava and his late &apos;60s delight (that Alien borrowed a LOT from), Planet of the Vampires -- that rates &quot;ten stars&quot; (in 1960s years; in 2023-years, it nets &quot;eight stars&quot;). If you look under &quot;Critic Reviews&quot; and search for &quot;B&amp;S About Movies,&quot; I offer a deeper examination of all five films in Alfonzo Brescia &quot;Star Wars&quot; series -- but opted to post a special &quot;User Review&quot; to call out this film that, again, many junk sci-fi fans didn&apos;t know existed, because they thought it was a repack-retitle of Cosmos."

      "reviewBody": "I am surprised that more people have not commented on this movie. I guess it might have had a limited release in the United States, but I really do think that it is as important a documentary as Born into Brothels. I am also a bit baffled as to how many people have rated this raw and inspiring movie below 5 stars!\n\nIn today&apos;s world of individualism, it is really touching to see how there are people out there who are selfless and are actually actively doing something about the HIV crisis in Africa. Sure, there are movements like the Product (Red) campaign, but this documentary shows what people are capable of doing on the forefront and on a grassroots level to provide a long-term solution to this devastating situation.\n\nFrom the beginning of the movie, you are hit with powerful and touching images of the Cloete family loving and caring for the children that have come under their wing. By giving them a loving environment, education, food and, most importantly, a strong sense of self, they are providing them with a future. The reach out programs that are carried out by Marion and her family are nothing short of amazing. Speaking to families and trying to make them see logic when it comes to the children&apos;s health and well-being. The parents sometimes don&apos;t understand that they need to act now and their children need to be at places like the school and boarding house to be away from situations where there is high risk of HIV infection from rape or prostitution.\n\nThe movie is quite raw - there is no interruption from the filmmakers and it is very focused on showing the ins and outs of what goes on at the orphanage. The stories that are interwoven are heartbreaking yet inspirational. It really pinpoints the HIV / AIDS crisis in Africa and how, even without a whole lot of money, that it can be solved.\n\nI think this documentary is an important one and needs more recognition and support from the public. People like Oprah and Bono should really be on the bandwagon to support these sorts of charities and organizations and publicize them so that there is more recognition in the global community. It has really inspired me to go out there to do something to really help - and in turn help me grow as a person.",

What does that mean? Since I do not know how many films are produced in Lithuania, and I have no idea what the budget was, it is hard to say. The budget must have been at least as much as Uwe Boll spends, though, because it looks like one of his movies.\n\nNot that this is a bad film, but it is more action than horror. So if you like movies where guys shoot at each other for 80 minutes, you might dig this. If you would rather see horror with ghosts or chainsaws, this is not going to be your cup of tea.\n\nPersonally, I lost interest in it really quickly.",

      "reviewBody": "Bruno Mattei must be the only person in on his own joke. I simply cannot understand how he made such a career out of such blatant ham-fisted ripoffs of famous Hollywood movies. Sure, Italy and The Philippines are known for cashing in on the latest trends - like with all the post-nuke flicks to flood out of both countries immediately after MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR. But no one until Mattei had the gall to just brazenly ape a popular movie scene-by-scene, shot-by-shot, line-by-line.\n\nROBOWAR is an obvious remake of PREDATOR, only changed slightly to accommodate the total lack of budget. Here it&apos;s a government-engineered cyborg out destroying massive amounts of stock footage from DOUBLE TARGET and STRIKE COMMANDO. Thankfully, the bulk of the actual film is largely stock-footage-free though you&apos;ll recognize a lot of the locations from other Mattei/Fragasso Filipino films like the old hut from AFTER DEATH.\n\nThe great cast (including Romano Puppo, Massimo Vanni, Jim Gaines, Max Laurel, etc.) actually turn in surprisingly good acting. Even star Reb Brown performs much better here than in his other Italo-Filipino outings. Not Olivier-quality of course, but COMPARATIVELY good. It&apos;s amazing too considering Mattei stages them either theatrically (everyone crammed into a master-shot) or shoots them shot-for-shot like scenes in PREDATOR. Good, yet idiotically staged action scenes come fast and furious but are interspersed with more than enough filler shots of Reb Brown and Co. wandering through the jungle.\n\nThe only real kudos go for the pyrotechnic crew for plenty of lovable slow motion explosions, as well as Al Festa and his wonderfully cheesetastic 80&apos;s synthesizer spectacular score. While nothing as heinously 80&apos;s as AFTER DEATH and COP GAME, it&apos;s in a pretty similar league.\n\nPeople who like this film and get a kick out of line-by-line ripoffs should also seek out Mattei&apos;s not-quite-as-fun-but-still-hilarious SHOCKING DARK, which did the same thing with ALIENS and TERMINATOR.",

It seems that the original production company ran out of money and the film was sold to another company. They in turn chopped the movie to pieces and added a lot of new material. The sum total of this is a story that seems disjoint and dull.\n\nThe story begins in a nightclub. Many of the women in the place are striking but not in good ways. They look much like some of Fellini&apos;s weird characters or those from a John Waters film. THen a monk enters the place and tells a story...a not so clever way of joining the two bits of movie.\n\nIt seems a group of six jerks are driving about the countryside in their tiny convertibles causing all sorts of trouble....drinking while driving, running people off the road and just acting like folks who need to be taught a less. A bit later, they arrive at a castle and begin treating the place like garbage. An old man in a strange period costume (Christopher Lee) arrives and he blathers a bit. Later, he reveals himself to be the devil.\n\nThe story is dull and confusing and lost my interest very quickly. Inexplicably, in reading through the reviews some people liked it. There&apos;s no accounting for tastes.",

Gail Patrick as Meg (nick-named NutMeg in this film) is wonderful as a daughter out to avenge a wrong done to her father. Gail Patrick is a much under-rated actress, and one wonders why she didn&apos;t get better roles in big budget A-movies. If you really like Patrick, I recommend that you see: &quot;Quiet Please, Murder&quot;, which is a far superior B-movie mystery than is this film. \n\nThis neat little suspense yarn is quite atmospheric, with courtroom dramatics, fast gunplay, and a tight little mystery that can only be solved by a picture photographed by one of the newspapermen present when a high-priced criminal lawyer falls over dead. Of course, the picture disappears. Did the killer take it? Only one way to find out!"

It will further be a testament to the murders committed there with the statement by Dr. Benkendorf (Allen Jeayes, excepting Leslie Howard, the only man to play in both Pimpernel movies) &quot;My business is to cure, not to kill!&quot;\n\nWhat makes this movie is not the plot, but the little subplots that surround the movie.  You cannot watch this movie just once; it takes several times before you catch all the subtilties.  Leslie Howard is just full of them in this movie.\n\nBut even more interesting is the character development.  We watch Professor Smith go from a hardened academic to a gentile, but compassionate man.  We watch the students go from being boys to men, and we learn from Ludmilla Koz about what kind of courage a lady can have.\n\nBy all means, watch this movie and watch it a lot.

As other reviewers in old film magazines say, the dream sequence is intriguing and a little spacey. However, would I call it horror? Probably not, it&apos;s more of a psychological exploration of a man and his grief, and how that goes into a hyper-real state. The Moroccan landscape was good though - I guess that gave it the element of - is this real? or just his confused mind? Willaim Sylvester is a bit of a disaster as the lead. He was reliable stock actor in B movies of the time, and he doesn&apos;t have the power to lift his ability - which is really required - to play this character.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not often that we see a sci-fi film that doesn&apos;t have a big budget and not produced by a major studio.\n\nFilms within this genre naturally require a lot of money for the CGI and general production design.\n\nHowever, there is occasionally the odd independent release that has decided to go this route.\n\nThis particular new release has got a strange concept that I&apos;m not sure where it was going to go in terms of tone.\n\nNow that I have seen it, it was like I was watching an arthouse version of Red Dwarf with an almost Big Brother environment whilst giving nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThe purposeful low budget sets and costumes gave us an effective grounded look to the story. This gave us time to concentrate on the characters and it&apos;s themes of achieving your ultimate dream both for you personally and as a species.\n\nSteve Laplante was a very capable lead and I liked the journey his character went. He had a very likable screen presence and I think it was helped by his supports.\n\nLarissa Corriveau in particular produced a lot of the films energy and Hamza Haq gave us some good comedic moments as did Denis Houle\n\nI was surprised at how entertained I was. There&apos;s genuine laughs to be had amongst the surrealness of the situation.\n\nYou can see that the people behind making it loved the material and are fans of sci-fi.\n\nIf I was being picky, I think some of themes could have been better utilised. This would resulted in a more satisfying ending as there were some loose ends not quite tied up.\n\nBut even with those issues from a personal perspective, this is still a very entertaining watch. The concept worked, the characters are easy to invest with, the deadpan humour is great, the minimal production design enhances the grounded story well and there&apos;s a quirky charm to it that is very infectious.",

      "reviewBody": "What is surprising is Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier didn&apos;t have an even more extensive directing career (at least 9 films to his credit) because &quot;Let&apos;s Do It Again&quot; is deftly crafted and funny.\n\n Believe it or not, that&apos;s quite impressive in an era (1970s so-called Blaxploitation films) hard pressed to find material suitable to African American actors and comedians. In fact by the mid 1970s a few &quot;Let&apos;s Do It Again&quot; cast members joined the NAACP in blasting Hollywood for the evident paucity of material and roles for talented blacks because much of what emerged was exploitive stereotypes and had the effect of mainstreaming distorted ethnic and racial images.\n\nIn this movie, however, a bearded Bill Cosby (Billy Foster), clean-shaven Poitier (Clyde Williams) team up as do-good Atlanta fraternal order brothers who play the odds to &quot;con&quot; threatening criminal punks so they could cheerfully give gambling winnings to a pet charity.  Of course, they have to impossibly hypnotize Jimmy Walker&apos;s reluctant and unlikely bone thin boxer (Bootney Farnsworth) enabling him to successfully fight heavier and craftier opponents; convince their beautiful but reluctant wives to go in on the con and, after pulling off a preposterous megabucks &quot;sucker bet&quot; caper, escape the played mobsters by hoofing it through a series of apartment buildings.  In one of the cinema&apos;s longest and funniest foot chases ever, the duo dashes through an unlocked apartment door running smack into a dining room not quite interrupting a family dinner. The folks seated around the dining table are incredulous for a quick moment and, well, maybe we should leave a few surprises.\n\nThe movie doesn&apos;t escape the &quot;Mack&quot; flamboyance of the decade, nor did it avoid the annoying 70s &quot;wah-wah&quot; disco soundtrack but it doesn&apos;t pander to the lowest common denominator evident in other movies whose stars were African American. On the other hand, performances by Denise Nicholas (Beth Foster), Calvin Lockhart, (Biggie Smalls) deliver a sense of dignity that would not have emerged under the hands of any lesser director in that era.\n\n In the pre-Huxtable Cosby universe, a comic actor shines. Of course, Cosby had resisted such notions during his successful run of the NBC-TV series, playing down and turning away Emmy nominations for Best Actor. In the younger Cosby&apos;s personna, there is none of the self-mocking. He&apos;s not playing a cuddly version of himself. He&apos;s perhaps funnier than anything he presented to the generation who grew up with the Huxtables and &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; (also directed by Sidney Poitier), which makes it plausible for younger viewers to dust off this more than quarter-century old relic and get a kick out of what Poitier was able to do with Timothy March and Richard Wesley&apos;s story and script.\n\nAside from not descending into the group of movies that fall under the category of 70s &quot;exploitation flicks&quot;, there is no social comment here. &quot;Let&apos;s Do It Again&quot; will give us a grittier maybe funnier Cosby than anything Generation Xers are likely to remember. If you want to escape, indulge in popcorn and have a laugh, this is a fun film."

After a few minutes into the film my mood changed as I became immersed into this strange tale of a harassed owner of a cafe in the middle of nowhere and a tourist from Germany. The owner of the cafe brilliantly played by CCH Pounder is just as bemused as we are why this German tourist delightfully played by Marianne Sagebrecht wants to stay at her cafe. This is a wonderfully unpredictable film never going where most films would go. It&apos;s utterly charming and I only got distressed again when I realised it was about to end! (9/10)",

The only thing missing is a plot, but too much story might have taken attention away from everything else that makes &quot;Top Hat&quot; enjoyable to watch.\n\nFred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are talented and charming as a somewhat star-crossed couple.  The whole story line is that Ginger thinks Fred is someone else (who is married instead of single) and thus misinterprets and rejects his advances.  Their many abilities and a fine script make this paper-thin plot seem not only acceptable but amusing.  Edward Everett Horton is both funny and indispensable as Fred&apos;s friend (and the man whom Ginger thinks Fred is), and the rest of the supporting players are also quite good.\n\nThis is the kind of carefully produced classic that offers many reasons for watching - see it if you have the chance, whether or not you usually like musicals."

With them are their female counterparts, the Dagger Debs lead by Lace (Robbie Lee). One day, they meet a loner name Maggie (Joanne Nail), who holds her own. After a night in juvenile hall, Maggie joins the ranks and gains the trust of Lace. However, Lace&apos;s friend Patch is suspicious of Maggie. As Maggie began to to know the ways of the Dagger Debs, she makes a move on Lace&apos;s boyfriend Dominic (Asher Brauner), who would not take the role of a father when he hears about Lace&apos;s pregnancy. More to it, Maggie would take in the reins of leading the Dagger Debs following a failed ambush at a roller rink. The men are ousted by Maggie, and they go form the Dagger Debs, to the Jezebels. They even join a militant gang to help boost the power of the group. When Lace re cooperates from her attack, she joins the group, only to suspect Maggie as a traitor. I like the scene where Lace beats up Maggie, and tortures her by sticking a cigarette butt in her bellybutton. Then came the showdown. Classic scene. The gang gains a new leader, while Patch is left behind. Goes to show there is no loyalty among gangs. Power shifts, and questionable leadership can destroy an organization. The Jezebels have not only ousted the men, but Lace as well, without her knowledge. They consider her a weak link in the gang. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Two famous actors, Bierbichler (mainly plays Brecht) and Sukowa (worked with Fassbinder), obviously believed in the script and gave him a chance. The lead role of Lene was given to Johanna Wokalek, a fresh face to me (though IMDB says the played in AimÃ©e und Jaguar). She is absolutely enchanting, so I don&apos;t know what to write about her without making a fool of myself.\n\nFacing the truth and trying to cope with it -- possibly even in a humorous way -- this is what this movie is about, and I think I&apos;ve learned a bit from it.\n\nAfter Siebtelbauern (1998), this is only the second Heimatfilm that I intensely liked. Everybody seemed to be happy when this genre died in the 60ies. A new generation of film makers has given the much-hated Heimatfilm a new meaning. Thank you for that!",

      "reviewBody": "It has been over 40 years since this final installment of the Quatermass saga was first broadcast on TV and an abridged movie version released to theaters. The reception was lukewarm in both venues and it then basically disappeared for many years. As an American, I never saw the original 4 hour version and first saw the movie in a VHS edition back in the 1990s. I was disappointed as I had been a big fan of the 3 earlier film versions and found this to easily be the runt of the litter. It had nothing to do with John Mills&apos; performance as Quatermass which was just a notch below Andrew Keir&apos;s and quite above Brian Donlevy&apos;s. His transformation from tired old man to an engaged and dynamic scientist was very well done. My beef was with the movie&apos;s lack of coherency.\n\nThe biggest problem for me at the time was the depiction of the Planet People which seemed very dated. I also found the music to be too repetitive and less than engaging although the nursery rhyme &quot;Ringstone Round&quot; stuck in my head for quite some time. The &quot;heartfelt&quot; slow motion conclusion was typical of the era but I really could have done without it. I immediately watched it again hoping that I had missed something but I hadn&apos;t. Nigel Kneale&apos;s recurring theme of alien intelligence controlling human behavior was still a viable one and that aspect of QUATERMASS CONCLUSION along with the usual solid performances kept it from being a total washout. However it would be 25 years before I would see it again.\n\nNow, thanks to this Network release, I got to see the full 4 hour QUATERMASS miniseries which kept me engaged even though there was a lot of repetition. There was more background to the characters and even the Planet People actually had some depth since they are portrayed as more of a cult quite capable of killing people without a second thought not just caricature flower children. I then watched QUATERMASS CONCLUSION once again and, because I was aware of the missing material, I realized what a patchwork the movie really was. Here the blame must go to Nigel Kneale as it was he who prepared the 100 minute version at the same time the series was shot. His biggest mistake was in creating a condensation of the 4 hour version rather than an adaptation which would have made it more cinematic just as it did with the 3 previous Quatermass movies.\n\nThe transfer of the original series looks great with the colors more vivid especially the green sky after the incident at Wembley Stadium. The sound is also very good and the subtitles helped immensely. Kneale was always a literary writer and many of his lines read better than they sound. The look of the movie version also gets full marks but even that can&apos;t gloss over the cut and paste nature of the screenplay. Having seen the full version, I would have edited the film differently to try and make it a little more cohesive. Still it&apos;s Bernard Quatermass combating alien forces and that makes it a must for any Quatermass fan and anyone interested in intelligent sci-fi not just CGI and SFX. It may be a bittersweet CONCLUSION but it&apos;s still one still worth reaching. The 2 disc set comes with interviews, commentary and a 35 page booklet...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic."

As a social (2xPh.D.) scientist (and as a Canadian) it seems Americans have lost the drive and initiative to make a change. In many ways the nameless people in this film are heroes, standing up for what they believe should be at any cost. Many who see this film have no idea what the students who were part of this movement went through, it was far from a &apos;walk in the park&apos; - their sacrifices of family, friends and the indignities they suffered cannot be explained. These are your lost heroes America, learn from them and rise to the occasion again before it is too late.&apos;"

      "reviewBody": "Finding Amanda is a mixed bag that has some really great moments but also left me wanting more. The film follows Taylor, a television producer with a penchant for drinking and gambling, who is sent to Las Vegas to convince Amanda, his troubled niece, to enter rehab. This isn&apos;t a movie for everyone as it deals with a lot of heavy topics such as sex work, abusive relationships, drugs, alcohol, and gambling addiction. But if those topics don&apos;t turn you off, I would say it is worth watching for Brittany Snow alone, despite its flaws. I should start off by saying I love Brittany Snow. She is my all-time favorite actor, and I had never seen this one until now. And as previously stated, I have mixed feelings about the film. For the most part, I think Brittany Snow killed it as Amanda. At first, she plays Amanda as a carefree girl who has become a sex worker because it appears as an easy way to make a lot of money. However, as the film progresses, it becomes clear that she is more complex than she first appears. There is one scene where Amanda is talking about her first experience as a sex worker changed her, and it broke my heart. In contrast, I didn&apos;t really care for Matthew Broderick&apos;s character. He was just too self-centered and detached from Amanda for me to care about him. I would have liked to have seen him take a more active role in trying to help out Amanda. Or that at some point, he would realize he was being selfish and make some sort of sacrifice to help Amanda. However, he never really gets out of his own way. There were some other good actors in this film that it never really utilizes, such as Maura Tierney. Lastly, I didn&apos;t care for the ending. I won&apos;t spoil anything, but I felt like I was still trying to find Amanda and closure for her. Overall, I would say it was okay and worth watching for Brittany Snow alone.",

      "reviewBody": "Veber is one of the rare French cineasts who manages to make people laugh the world over ( quite a feat ). He has directed and scripted many films over the years which have given hours of pleasure and laughs to millions. This is because he has found the secret of universal humour which appeals to the vast majority of people, whatever their origins. This film is in keeping with his standards. A little weak during the last half hour ( unlike &quot;Le Placard&quot; ) the film nevertheless maintains the spectator amused for most of its length. Many of Veber&apos;s films are about two central characters who are very opposed to each other but who nevertheless remain together. Some may criticize this idea for its lack of novelty but the hard fact it that people like it, so we can say that Veber is a cineast for the vast public and not for his own particular idiosyncrasies. In this film, Depardieu plays the &quot;weaker&quot; person ( in previous films it was Pierre Richard, Daniel Auteuil or Jacques Villeret ) and Depardieu played the &quot;tougher&quot; character ( Les COmpÃ¨res, La ChÃ¨vre, Les Fugitifs and to a certain extent Le Placard, though he ends up weakened ). The &quot;Tough&quot; character in this film is played by Jean Reno.  The plot is not as good as that of Le Placard but Depardieu&apos;s acting of the part of &quot;Quentin from Montargis&quot; is superb and is enough to carry the film on its own, plot failings aside. I predict that the film should have an international success but perhaps slightly less than that of Le Placard. But one does laugh loud and it would certainly be a shame to miss it !!"

Brendan Fraser is a very talented actor, and is not too darn hard on the eyes...*ahem*. Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, Alex Rocco, Eric Idle and one of my favorite character actors, Robert Prosky, head up the cast. So, what exactly went wrong? Well, how about a lame, unfunny script that made for 83 minutes of painful viewing? I think we&apos;re getting WARM. \n\nVery few chuckles here, provided mostly by Eric Idle and Alex Rocco, who do the best with what they have. This was the only thing that saved DUDLEY DO-RIGHT from being a complete catastrophe. If this is the only thing left on the video shelf, make a night of it with a game of Monopoly or Yahtzee, instead. You&apos;ll thank yourself in the morning.",

      "reviewBody": "The former France ELLE editor Jean-Dominique Bauby quoted his life as being trapped in a diving bell and free like a butterfly, and that was how he describes his life after a stroke left him only able to blink his left eye. The Diving Bell and The Butterfly has become the title of his memoirs, which has become a best seller which Bauby will never get to see.\n\nAmerican born director Julian Schnabel picked up the memoir and made it into a movie that will re-examine the way a person will view his life. From the way the movie was presented to the audience, it might seems to be difficult to digest, but if you watch them once again, you will find that the flow of the movie follows closely to what is written on the book.\n\nThe story begins with Jean Dominique (Mathieu Amalric) finding himself woke up in a hospital,unable to move his body. Upon hearing from the doctor that a stroke left him unable to move, except his left eye, he found himself trapped in a prison: his body. He describes his body as a diving bell, where death sentence prisoner would wore the diving bell and drowned in the sea. With doctors and therapists taking care of him, he found himself living without dignity.\n\nWith the help of Henriteet (Marie Jozee Croze), a speech therapist, she uses a unique method of communicating with Jean thru pronouncing the alphabets and Jean would form a word or sentence by blinking the eye. After getting to know her much more better, Jean found his way to survive thru the disabilities: imagination and beautiful memories. Both set his spirit free, and he feels like he is flying like a butterfly. And thus he began writing his memoirs of his life.\n\nThe story is told through the view from Jean&apos;s left eye and reaction in his mind after the stroke. This pulls the audience and the inner world of Jean closer, and audience could have a feel of putting themselves into Jean&apos;s shoes. From the effort the cast and crew puts in the movie, we can tell that the movie is follow everything accordingly to the book, without any adjustments.\n\nThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly is the movie that you need if you want to take a break from normal popcorn flicks, or a movie that makes you think through about yourself, and how you live life to the fullest.",

      "reviewBody": "I hate to give the Muppets anything less than a 10, I really do. I&apos;m an enormous Muppets fan, but this movie disappointed on a couple counts. \n\nFirst, they started using CGI - A lot.\n\nThe charm of the Muppets is that... well, they are puppets. That somehow got lost in translation in this movie when some scenes included full bodies of dancing and walking Muppets. In the past movies, Muppets were shown full-bodied only as stop-action; but the CGI thing just takes the fun and mystery out of it.\n\nAnother negative is over-saturation of the Muppets. They are everywhere now, from car commercials to my lunch at Subway. Disney is milking the franchise to death, sadly, so the movie doesn&apos;t have that special pop.\n\nAll that said, the movie starts with a bang. It&apos;s a hilarious transition from the last film, though the absence of Jason Segal is quickly noticed. A cameo may have done justice there.\n\nOverall, the movie is fun; though the writing didn&apos;t get a lot of laugh- out-loud moments like their other films. The evil Kermit concept was well executed and the human actors were excellent in their roles. A few good songs, but nothing I&apos;d commit to memory to sing on a road trip.\n\nIt&apos;s worth a watch for every Muppet fan, and overall a strong 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The War Inside, November 6, 2007 By Grady Harp (Los Angeles, CA United States) - See all my reviews (TOP 10 REVIEWER) (REAL NAME) HOME OF THE BRAVE is one of those films that is difficult to critique: the message of how war permanently alters the minds and bodies of soldiers and their families is a meaningful one and one about which we need to be reminded. Irwin Winkler has made some good films (DeLovely, Life as a House, Guilty by Suspicion), but in this film he seems to be working against the script by Mark Friedman which has a tendency to oversimplify emotions and thus loses its impact.\n\nThe film begins in Iraq where each of the main characters is at least tangentially connected. Dr. Will Marsh (Samuel L. Jackson) is in a truck driven by Vanessa (Jessica Biel) and accompanied by soldiers Tommy (Brian Presley) and Jamal (50 Cent AKA Curtis Jackson) when a roadside bomb explodes, maiming the hand of Vanessa, killing Tommy&apos;s best friend, making Jamal witness unnecessary civilian deaths, and placing Will in an impotent position as a doctor. Flash forward to Spokane, Washington where each of these four wounded people try to piece their lives together in a world that loathes the Iraq war (not at all unlike the treatment of soldiers returning from the unpopular Vietnam debacle), trying to make sense of it all.\n\nThe problem with the good idea for a movie lies in the too traditional plot lines. The actors (especially Presley and Biel) give it their all, but credibility enters and the smoke rises and we are left with a misplaced patriotism. The message is strong: the delivery of it is shaky.

My favourite part has to be the song &quot;busy doing nothing&quot;, sung by\n\nthe unlikely trio of Bing Crosby, Cedric Hardwicke and William\n\nBendix (the first and last time they ever sang together!). There are nice touches all the way through, including the &apos;echoes&apos;\n\nevery time king Arthur requests something: &quot;MORE HOT WATER! . . . more hot water. . .&quot; Or &quot;CLOSE THE DOOR! . . .close the door. . .&quot;\n\nto which Murvyn Vye&apos;s Merlin replies, &quot;the door closeth sire.&quot; While we are on the subject of Merlin, I&apos;m surprised that with a\n\nvoice like his he didn&apos;t appear in more of Hollywood&apos;s costumers.\n\nI&apos;ve only ever seen him in one other film, and that was &apos;Green Fire&apos;\n\n(1955). Of course, I have to mention William Bendix&apos;s portrayal of &apos;Saggy&apos; or\n\nsir Sagramore. He turns up in Bing Crosby&apos;s prison cell\n\nshame-faced and apologetic for calling him (Crosby) a dragon and\n\nsays the following: Saggy: If only there were ought we could do. Crosby: Well, ain&apos;t there ought? Saggy: Nought. Whoever heard of a knight of the round table with a thick Brooklyn\n\naccent?! I usually detest musicals but this, along with &apos;White Christmas&apos;, is\n\nan exception. The duet between Rhonda Fleming and Bing Crosby\n\n(&apos;Once and for always&apos;) is brilliant. It&apos;s hilarious when he says she&apos;s\n\npretty, to which she replies enthusiatically, &quot;oh, thou art pretty too\n\nsire!&quot; and he, looking round apprehensively says, &quot;no, say I&apos;m cute\n\nor something!&quot;"

It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson&apos;s Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: &quot;Just find the girl.&quot; There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It&apos;s too bad Polanski can&apos;t work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It&apos;s so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest.",

The narrator says something to the effect of - &quot;Yes it&apos;s an interesting tale isn&apos;t it Pepe? You could tell them more about this mesa and the strange things your people tell about it couldn&apos;t you? But this isn&apos;t where the story starts, a month before, doctor Leland Masterson...&quot; and we&apos;re into the &apos;story&apos; at last.\n\nThe whole film is then played out as a flashback - but whose? It starts before the pilot has arrived on the scene so it can&apos;t be his flashback. Because of the focus on Pepe and the fade it looks like it should be Pepe&apos;s but he wasn&apos;t there! So it must be the Narrator&apos;s. If it was the Narrator&apos;s flashback why go to all the trouble of setting up at least two false starts to the film?\n\nYou are so busy pondering the meaning of this multi-layered, layers within layers, Like an Onion!, Russian Doll of an opening that it takes some time before the simple truth reveals itself. Sheer unmitigated incompetence! This movie is so bloody awful and lacks any structure whatsoever... It&apos;s hilarious. I especially love the bit where after surviving the air crash they traipse off into the jungle to rescue George all holding hands like school children crossing the road. Into the darkness they creep - on and on and on and on till they reach the studio wall (and George&apos;s body) then they turn around and all creep back again on and on and onzzzzzzzzzzz. Not one second of shot footage was wasted. It&apos;s totally surreal. The best boring, zen-like, creeping through the jungle holding hands scene in the history of the movies.\n\nOther highlights include the huge spider leg coming out from behind the screen in Dr Aranya&apos;s lab. What was that spider doing behind the screen? Getting dressed? - another movie first! a modest giant mutant spider!\n\nThis film also contains a candidate for the worst excuse for sending someone off to their certain death ever - &quot;Where is the comb I gave you?&quot; asks the rich man of his wife. &quot;It is a family heirloom! Wu, take the only flashlight we have and leave us huddling in the dark around this pathetic fire and go into that monster infested jungle and find it!&quot; (Wu it should be explained is Chinese and a bit creepy therefore falls into the &quot;People who are&apos;t going to make it to the end of the movie&quot; category. If he had been a Chinese happy scared-cat cook he might have made it).\n\nSo Terrible it&apos;s worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "The movie depicts one particular strategy for maximizing performance on the job that happens to be en vogue, in particular for the management of highly qualified, privileged workforces: Tuning all aspects of the working environment in such a way as to provide surrogates for all aspects of private life. At work, people shall feel at home and like to be there, shall feel passionate about their work and like to do it, shall develop a team spirit to the point of feeling among friends at work, shall trust their superiors and HR to the point of openly discussing the most intimate aspects of the development of their personality with them, shall identify with the company to the point of founding their very self-concept on their company role and career perspectives.\n\nOf course, for this concept to indeed maximize performance on the job, all aspects of making work seem like home and personal fulfilment need to have clear limits that, looking more closely, radically pervert the emotional concepts being exploited. You are supposed to feel at home, but never so much that you could ever relax completely - what kind of home is that? You are supposed to feel passionate about your work, but never so much that you ever follow your own, personal goals, rather the company goals have to direct all your efforts - what kind of passion is that? You are supposed to fully trust the company to optimally nurture your talents, personality, and career, knowing that they will drop you as soon as others prove more useful for them - what kind of trust is that? And so on and on...\n\nThese techniques are presented in a potpourri of supposedly documentary scenes so gross and glaring that the atmosphere of the movie regularly verges caricature - or rather, real-life satire, as there can be little doubt that such things do really happen.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms at work, their means-end rationality and functionality as well as their inherent contradictions, is severely hampered by a tendency of the movie to dwell on the surface, in particular when showing long stretches of the typical new-speak management jargon that is regularly pronounced to obscure what is actually happening in a company, spreading a positive mood by making a lot of euphemistic words without actually saying anything at all. Besides, at least according to my taste, various scenes are quite long drawn-out, reducing artistic quality as well.\n\nSo i guess in the end, most spectators will be left in a state of diffuse indignation - &quot;It&apos;s revolting how those management swine are manipulating and exploiting their staff!&quot; - but the movie is so bewildering and confusing that few people will, right after seeing it, be able to quite understand the essence of the concepts shown. Let alone be able to come up with counter-strategies... What might be done about all this, and by whom, would be an interesting question that, unfortunately, the movie hardly even alludes to.\n\nIf you are interested in the consequences of modern human resource management techniques, you should probably go have a look at this one, but without expecting too much. In any case, don&apos;t expect any help for countering them.",

      "reviewBody": "Finally the movie was leaked online after 6 years of ban by the government, so I was very excited and watched it immediately, but after finishing it I am a little bit disappointed. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the movie is good in overall with some amazing segments (1919 was my favorite with Amr Waked, Bassem AlSamra and Eyad Nassar all doing great acting, the one about the curfew was very neat with the best directing in the whole movie, and the last one &quot;Ashraf Seberto&quot; was very touching and great acting from Farrag as well). But some segments were very disappointing (like when the flood hits which was very naive and clumsy, and god&apos;s creation which was my major disappointment because it&apos;s directed by Kamla Abu Zekry -one of my favorite directors- and have a strong cast but was very clichÃ©d with no real message).\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest problem with the movie is the first segment, which was horrible, and certainly the worst segment of them all. Despite being directed by a talented director -Sherif Arafa- it was awfully directed and shooted, very childish and all the actors were very artificial. Starting with this segment harms the whole movie for sure as it gives a very bad impression and may spoil the whole movie for some. The movie also needed some more excitement or some more interesting real shots from the revolution, to capture the real soul of the revolution and the great achievement of finally removing Mubarak, but this doesn&apos;t mean the stories weren&apos;t good, because in general there was more good than bad.\n\nIn general, it is a good experiment and I am happy to see an Arabic movie in this style which is new on the Arabic cinema in general and Egyptian cinema in particular, and more happy to see a movie talking about the Egyptian revolution honestly finally after 6 years, and despite the problems I think it is worth some encouragement.",

      "reviewBody": "How refreshing to see Reginald Owen as star of a movie.  So what if he was the last minute replacement for Lionel Barrymore.  I have read earlier comments for this movie, and I will give you my take.\n\nI first saw Reginald Owen in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, playing Admiral Boom, a character whom I thought was insanely crazy.  I realized, many years later, that Owen was a very intelligent actor who had carried many a movie, mostly in character settings.  Indeed, in &quot;Poppins&quot;, Owen played along with all the craziness in the story.\n\nIn &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Owen plays Ebenezer Scrooge, essaying the lead part well.  How refreshing, indeed.  As an acting student, I noticed how Scrooge&apos;s forehead &quot;old-age makeup&quot; resembled that of what I was taught last summer in a theatre stage makeup class at The Ohio State University.  There is that liquid latex (that has dried, of course) with just enough wrinkle to make his face give the hint of elderliness, whereas in real life Owen was only 51 years old.\n\nAs for Lionel Barrymore, I glean from my studies of the Barrymores that if they had made enough money on the stage they would never have &quot;gone Hollywood&quot;, like they did.  I think they had long ago sold out to the moneyed establishment.  Definitely a lucky break for Reginald Owen, who for most of his career played the-glue character parts or second leads.  Admiral Boom is certainly &quot;an aside&quot; in Mary Poppins.\n\nIn &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, I noticed that &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; was played by the boy who played &quot;Colley&quot; in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;.  So what if the actor was too old. He conveyed the spirit of the story.  He was a good actor.\n\nThe Lockharts were great, especially Gene as Bob Cratchit.  Lockhart also played the double roles of The Starkeeper and The Graduation Speaker in &quot;Carousel&quot;, as an older man, and certainly always a rotund one.  Indeed, it was other actors supporting Reginald Owen this time, not the other way &apos;round.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present was well made up and costumed.  I liked his hair and beautiful robes -- the robes reminded me of the fur-trimmed outfits of modern Santa Clauses.  He did a good job showing Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.\n\nAll, it was a heartwarming story about how a wretchedly selfish individual gets shown the error of his ways, and is given a chance to right his self-centered existence.  A charming holiday season movie to watch."

The romance between the three threw me off a little as the female mossad agent was portrayed as loose ie sleeps around which is not what these types of individuals usually do ie their mental makeup is stronger. Yes people fall in love, but typically not under these circumstances. The end was a little hurried and confusing as the doctor was found but more by chance than any under cover work.",

      "reviewBody": "The seventeen years old newcomer in town Jones Dillon (Elijah Wood) drops out the university on his first day, after a problem with his roommate, and decides to rent an apartment in an old building. Jones pays one year rental at once for the 2B apartment and his only possessions are a trunk and a typewriter that belonged to his unknown father. Jones spends his time fantasizing his life, writing never-sent-letters to his absent father and discussing by phone his childhood and family problems with his alcoholic mother (Elizabeth Perkins), who lives in Texas. He becomes friend of a painter cowboy, who lives on the first floor, and of the aspiring actress Lisa (Mandy Moore), who lives in the apartment 2A on the same floor. Jones has a crush on the temperamental photographer Jane (Franka Potente), who lives in apartment 2C. After a car accident, Jones reaches the maturity and resolves the outstanding problems of his life. &apos;Try Seventeen&apos; is a kind of love-hate movie. My wife, for example, just watched half of the story and gave-up to see the second part. I liked this film, about a young man leaving adolescence and finding his own path. The viewer has to keep in mind that Jones&apos;s neighbors are indeed Lisa and Jane, otherwise it would be very hard to believe that a guy would have Mandy Moore and Franka Potente available on the same floor. There is comedy, romance and drama in this sensitive story well directed by Jeffrey Porter. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Era Tudo o Que Eu Queria&apos; (&apos;This Was Everything That I Wanted&apos;)",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Clayton is not your typical legal thriller. Oh, it has most of the standard trappings of one: double-crossing, shady back room deals, and a guilty client. But in the case of Michael Clayton, the film focuses most of its attention on the questionable moral quagmire of working for guilty clients, living your life protecting those who you can&apos;t help but find reprehensible, wanting to get out, but finding you are good at it and that is where your superiors want you. Michael Clayton isn&apos;t a revelatory film, but it is a smart one that deals in the grey world that we all live in, not the black and white one legal films are usually about.\n\nThe central character is Michael Clayton (George Clooney), a &quot;fixer&quot; at a major Manhattan law firm. His job entails him cleaning up other&apos;s messes, not litigating in a court room. He hates the work, but the senior partner at the firm, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), wants him to stay in the job because he has a talent for it. Things are not rosy for Michael right now: his addict brother has run a business venture that Michael was a partner in into the ground, leaving Michael with thousands of dollars in debt; his relationship with his ex-wife is on the rocks, and into this environment comes a whole new caliber of problem: Michael&apos;s friend, and fellow attorney, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who is a lead attorney for a major case for the firm involving U/North, a huge, multifaceted corporation, has discovered evidence damning to U/North, and has also, seemingly, lost his senses.\n\nArthur begins plotting to publicly expose U/North with this evidence, thereby destroying them, something that U/North&apos;s lead corporate attorney, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), cannot allow. Michael is called in to help calm Arthur and bring the situation under control, but it becomes quickly obvious that Arthur cannot be reigned in, and Karen begins looking at far more dire methods of containment.\n\nWhen you walk into Michael Clayton, you need to be prepared for a limited amount of action, and a fair amount of talk. It is a film about words and far less exciting events than found in many movies. Michael Clayton is also not the most straightforwardly plotted film. A great deal of information is suggested through inference and requires the full attention of the audience. But Michael Clayton is hardly boring. It delves into the decisions that individuals make when their livelihood depends on living in a moral quagmire. Michael is a man who is concerned about making sure that he can make the payments on a huge debt and dealing with the sometimes annoying and reprehensible people that the law firm provides its services to. Arthur is in a similar situation, but he can no longer live with himself and the protection of clients who are obviously guilty. It is debatable whether Arthur is mentally unhinged, or simply woken up to the reality of his actions and what they mean in the grander scheme of things.\n\nMichael Clayton is the directorial debut of Tony Gilroy, a longtime Hollywood screenwriter, who crafts a film that manages to keep you involved like a good thriller without providing many of the requisite elements: chases, shootouts and fisticuffs. Michael Clayton is a thriller that works at a slower pace, but still manages to enthrall with its developments. Critical to the film&apos;s success is its performances. George Clooney gives us a Michael who feels many aspects of his world closing around him and tries to keep all the balls in the air. Tom Wilkinson&apos;s turn as Arthur is that of a man who has experienced an epiphany, seeing the world like a newborn baby. Finally, Tilda Swinton&apos;s Karen Crowder is a woman who is all about appearance (one of her first scenes reveals her practicing a speech so that it will appear perfect) and ensuring that no one rocks the boat of U/North. She has sold her soul to the devil and will do anything to keep the company intact.\n\nMichael Clayton is certainly not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. It requires a strong attention span and a willingness to not have everything spelled out for you. If you can provide that, then it is a film experience that will provide some rewards.",

      "reviewBody": "For years, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam has been known as an inalienable asset in the history of the Hindi film industry, and not without a reason. The movie fully deserves to be called a timeless classic and its story is relevant and fascinating even today, almost half a century after its release. It is an artistic and intriguing presentation of the nature of passion and desire. Guru Dutt was a master of his craft. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is excellent in story, writing, execution and acting. The music is sublime, the sets are fantastic, and the movie exemplifies what true cinematographic excellence of those times was. It is shot beautifully, with a background score that enlightens the film&apos;s melancholic mood. The film is quiet, focused and balanced, and has a very subtle feel to it thanks to all these aspects. Abrar Alvi&apos;s direction is superb - he captures the atmosphere of those times with great skill, his script is marvelous, and many of his rich dialogues remain memorable even today and are often cited by lovers of Hindi cinema. \n\nAll said and done, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam wouldn&apos;t have been what it is if not for the transcendent performance of the divine Meena Kumari. Her mesmerising beauty, grace and screen presence cannot be described in words, but to put it simply, when she was on-screen, no one else existed. Her portrayal of the tormented and deeply frustrated Chhoti Bahu is both heartfelt and artistic. Chhoti Bahu&apos;s desire to get her estranged husband&apos;s affection and become a mother and her attempts to please him by taking to alcohol only to become a fervent alcoholic herself and remain the same neglected wife, are all aptly displayed. Kumari plays the role with great mastery; her appearances in songs, like &quot;Piya Aiso Jiya Mein&quot; in which she dresses for her husband and particularly the seductive &quot;Na Jao Saiyan...&quot; are astonishing; her big, expressive and often tearful eyes, her brilliant dialogue delivery, her emotional outbursts, her breaks into anguished and sarcasm laden laughs, and ultimately her nostalgic monologue towards the end, are unforgettable.\n\nWhile Kumari dominates the show utterly, one must not forget the great job done by the rest of the cast members. Guru Dutt, playing the role of the innocent Bhootnath, who later becomes Chooti Bahu&apos;s confidant and close friend, acted like only an actor acting in his own film could. Rumour had it that he was actually the one who directed the movie, simply because the movie is identified with his own style of filmmaking. This rumour was disproved by people associated with the film, but Guru Dutt, the actor, still played his role exceedingly well probably due to his involvement with the film as its producer. My most favourite scenes of his are those in which we see Bhootnath as a middle-aged architect. There is a kind of yearning and sadness in his eyes which is real and easy to relate to. Waheeda Rehman played Jaba wonderfully and her character&apos;s transformation from an arrogant and careless young lady into a suffering and loving woman was natural and convincing. Rehman, as Chhote Sarkar was restrained and effective.\n\nAs mentioned, Hemant Kumar&apos;s music for the film is great. Shakeel Badayuni wrote fantastic lyrics for the songs, and so every song has a story of its own and comes at the right places fitting the situations. Every song is very much a part of the narration and contributes to the story. Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle were the voices of the ladies, and did a great job. Among my favourite scenes in the movie is the one right after the &quot;Na Jao Saiyan...&quot; number in which Chhoti Bahu bursts out at her husband after he criticises her of becoming mad as a result of her heavy drinking, while she turns on him to reproach him for being the only reason because of which she sacrificed her basic values and all just to please him. A frequent quote in the film, that of Chhoti Bahu asserting that she is not like other landowners&apos; wives, being much more devoted and caring, is very memorable, particularly because it&apos;s well delivered by the lady. All in all, Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam is a gem of Hindi films. It is an all-time great movie, and much of it because it has an all-time great performance by Meena Kumari.",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins with a violent young man named &quot;Dit&quot; (Supakorn Kitsuwon) torturing an aged practitioner of black magic in order to substantially increase his already formidable powers. Although he fails in that regard, he considers it to be just a temporary setback and decides to continue on his evil quest. The scene then shifts to a hospital where a young woman by the name of &quot;Aajan Panor&quot; (Napakpapha Nakprasitte) is suffering from a mental breakdown and is being cared for by a nurse nameg &quot;Pen&quot; (Carolyn Supaluck Neemayothin). More important to this story, however, is the fact that Panor is pregnant because not long afterward she is kidnapped by some of Pen&apos;s colleagues and taken to a house in a remote part of Thailand. It&apos;s then revealed that a woman by the name of &quot;Duen&quot; (Paweena Chariffsakul) has died several years earlier and that Panor&apos;s unborn fetus is the key to resurrecting her. That said, a special ceremony is then conducted which starts with a high school student named &quot;Ta&quot; (Namo Tongkumnerd)--who happens to be the son of Duen--reading from an ancient script while Dit utilizes his knowledge of black magic to transfer the soul of Duen into the screaming woman before them. It then transpires that, as soon as the fetus is ripped out, Duen&apos;s consciousness comes back to life within Panor&apos;s body while Panor&apos;s soul is simultaneously transferred into the fetus and held into place by a mirror bearing her image. Dit then ties a red string around Duen&apos;s wrist which he insists must remain there at all times. Instructions are then given to bury both the mirror and the fetus but, when this not fully carried out, Duen immediately begins having visions of dead people--and the string falls from her wrist. Things take a horrific turn for the worst afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a confusing film due in large part to the overlapping subplots along the way. To that effect, it should be mentioned that this film has absolutely no relevance to the first &quot;Art of the Devil&quot; movie. Instead, it is probably best summed up as a prequel to &quot;Art of the Devil II&quot; as it lays out some extra details and clarifies certain portions of the second film in the process. Beyond that, however, this film is also quite murky with lots of gore and mumbo--jumbo used in place of any real suspense necessary for a horror film of this type. Likewise, even though it had a couple of attractive actresses like Napakpapha Nakprasitte, Carolyn Supaluck Neemayothin and Paweena Chariffsakul, there really wasn&apos;t any sexual tension which could have also improved this picture as well. Be that as it may, in spite of some of these missed opportunities, this turned out to be an okay movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",

This project with its 40-odd 50 second vignettes done by a mix of directors of varying talents and celebrity, using an antiquated camera, gives an opportunity to see snapshots of their work as pure art.  All of them are at least passable, with over half being very, very good.  A few of them are truly outstanding, the most notable being Andre Konchalovsky&apos;s gem on life, death, temporality and nature.  David Lynch&apos;s segment is a close second.  I highly recommend this to any serious student of film as art.",

      "reviewBody": "As the title suggests, Three on a Meathook is a grainy and grisly slice of seventies American horror, although it offers slightly more than similar genre films. The film is apparently based on the classic and influential story of Ed Gein, although aside from the rustic setting, mother themes and the fact that people die; this one strays a lot from the story, and actually takes more influence from Gein-inspired classics such as Psycho. It&apos;s obvious that the film was shot on a very low budget, as it doesn&apos;t feel completely finished, and that along with the bare locations, bad acting and short running time ensure the budget limitations shine through. The plot revolves around a father and son that live on a farm. The film opens with four girls breaking down while on a camping trip, and after taking up the son&apos;s nice offer of a bed at his farmhouse, they decide to stay there. However, they all wind up dead and the son is dismayed when he finds out that he is the killer! His father helps him clean up the mess, but when he brings another girl home; it looks as though history is going to repeat itself.\n\nAs you might expect, there&apos;s a fair amount of gore here - although perhaps not as much as in other similar films. Still, what there is in terms of gore is well done, and Three on a Meathook features some excellent kill scenes, most of which are misogynistic. The film constantly hints at a twisted ending, and indeed the mystery behind the murderer is so obvious that I&apos;m convinced the audience is supposed to guess that straight away - but luckily, William Girdler&apos;s film has more in reserve, and the twist that comes at the conclusion is a definite surprise...although it does hint at how much more shocking the film could have been if it had been incorporated properly into the story rather than just being rolled out at the end. The acting is nothing special, although the director obviously rates his lead stars James Pickett and Charles Kissenger as they both went on to star in two more of his films, The Zebra Killer and Asylum of Satan, both of which may be worth tracking down. The climax to the film is an obvious nod to Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho, and overall; while this is not exactly great cinema, grindhouse fans will definitely find a lot to like.",

Everything else that happens in the film is really just to establish why this young man would be drawn to someone kind and caring.  What I wish would have been delved into more was how the soldier came to feel the way he does about the kid.  He talks a little about his past with his father and mother but never really  explains himself personally.  He does not look like he would have ever had a problem getting a girl, so his &quot;prediliction&quot; becomes even more a mystery.\n\n I really applaud the fact that the film maker was able to tell this story so sensitively without it being lurid.  It is a shame I think that a film like this could never have been made in America, &quot;the land of the free&quot;."

Anyone who appreciates those gorgeous NASA images will be fond of the visual effects work. Characters are quite funny too, and just... real. I love Niels, pilot of the ship and the hero of the movie. He has charisma, humor and just acts like we&apos;d all do in the same situation. His friendship with Sam, the astrophysicist with a twist, is brilliant. It just works, characters are well defined and it&apos;s unexpectedly easy to identify with their incredible situation. We don&apos;t see that often. Scratch that, I can&apos;t remember when I felt that. Two thumbs up.",

      "reviewBody": "Herzog&apos;s films are often about rulebreakers, visionaries and daredevils, something which he has always been himself. Being a daredevil flirting with death makes one feel alive, which is no small thing, but being a daredevil flirting with something even larger than death, is ecstasy. In this film, Herzog, his film crew and a small band of scientists headed by aeronautical engineer Graham Dorrington, head off to a remote area of Guyana to fly a newfangled zeppelin just a toe&apos;s length above the treetops of the jungle. Dorrington has his legitimate reasons for the usefulness of his invention, as does Herzog in documenting what may be an important new discovery in science and technology. But both of these men, as well as us in the audience, see these men&apos;s laughably primitive jabs at besting nature shrunken by the grandeur of the nature surrounding them. From the fierce power of the waterfall where they are camped out, to the unfathomable grace and sheer numbers of the birds who dwell behind it, the plight of two little men in a motorized air balloon is almost comical. I say almost because a man died in such an attempt ten years earlier - a scene that is described in chillingly vivid detail by Dorrington. Also, there is a kind of nobility in man&apos;s stubborn desire to defy his relatively scrawny limitations against nature. Whether it&apos;s Fitzcarraldo dragging a steamship over a mountain, Herzog himself trying to make the steamship climb the mountain for his film, or Dr. Dorrington sailing the skies in a contraption that seems as fragile as a butterfly, the dream is everything. The dreams of Herzog&apos;s characters - be they real or fictional - are usually short-lived, but at least the dreams do come alive briefly. If I could sum up everything that is great in Herzog&apos;s films, it would be in one awesome scene in this film where Herzog shoots the upside-down reflection of the mighty waterfall in a falling drop of rain. This moment, this reflection, this drop of rain is as temporary as life, but in it is the entire universe in all of its beauty, majesty and fragility. If that&apos;s not ecstasy, I don&apos;t know what is!"

      "reviewBody": "The plot kernel of this German black-and-white crime film is very strong, with the protagonist recruited as bagman for an industrial espionage job. But the plot isn&apos;t fleshed out enough, with too many gaps in logic, almost no characterization, and too much left unexplained. A lot of screen time is wasted with transition scenes where characters are driving or walking from place to place. And there are too many segments where two people are talking and the camera only shows the non-reactive listener instead of the speaker, seemingly to make overdubbing easier, since neither character displays emotion. The only seeming emotion in the film was a few seconds when Monika Zinnenberg was happily dancing. The soundtrack includes some cover music from Liberty Records, including numbers by Cher, Johnny Rivers, and The Ventures. The main characters are mostly unemotional but quite attractive, and some of the arty camera shots are visually impressive. The film probably succeeds on some level, as a French New Wave / New German Cinema hybrid, even if it is not fulfilling for a mainstream audience.",

      "reviewBody": "Western. Production picture of the East German film studio DEFA, created with the participation of socialist Romania and the mighty Soviet Union. The eighth painting out of twelve, which I intend to see and revise. I first saw this western on Channel One, which played all these Westerns on New Year&apos;s holidays in the mid-2000s (yes, at that time Channel One was not mired in the endless unwatchable crap and endless repetition of the &quot;Home Alone&quot; series, of which you can watch only the first three parts ), so I remembered this western very well, and this review was a great opportunity to revisit it. The main role was again played by the Yugoslavian actor, &quot;Honored Indian of the Soviet Union&quot; Goiko Mitic. And here is my brief opinion - revenge on the insidious pale-faced. I will say right away that there are no flaws in the picture, but there is a small clarification, which I will highlight in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the expressive merits of this western. So, here they are: 1. Scenario - the picture tells about a strong and brave warrior of the Apache tribe Ulzatse, whose tribe (including women and children) is dealt with by the insidious pale-faced only because deposits of silver and gold were found on the lands of the Indians, which attracts villains of all stripes, and behind them and the army. The surviving warriors of the tribe, together with Ulzana, vow to take revenge on the pale-faced murderers for the crime, and on their way there will be only blood, both their own and others&apos;, death, losses. The final turned out to be worthy. The script does not contain many twists, although one of them even surprised me a bit, for which I can only praise the writers, including the director Gottfried Colditz himself. The script is simple, which is very good for a western. Everything is clear from the very beginning, both future actions and the motivation of the heroes. 2. Nature - this time the studio changed traditions, and the field shooting took place not in Yugoslavia, but in the Soviet Union, more precisely in the Uzbek ASSR, not far from the ancient city of Samarkand, where nature is very similar to the Southwest of the United States. The views turned out to be magnificent, there is even nothing to argue with, and the operator skillfully demonstrates this, highlighting the best and striking shots with their beauty. 3. Entourage - decorations, costumes, atmosphere - everything literally screams about this historical era, when the Apaches found themselves between two fires - the growing United States and Mexico, which is losing its position in this region, the Apache dwellings correspond to historical prototypes, the tense atmosphere, contempt for the Indians , the misanthropic laws of the United States are on display in all their glory. 4. Music - this time I can only praise the music, for it is full of Indian motives and emphasizes the most important scenes of this picture. Apart from the picture it will be hard to listen to it and whether it will work out, but within the framework of the picture - that&apos;s it. 5. Fights, chases, skirmishes - at the level of the picture &quot;The Trail of the Falcon&quot;, only here they still take the number, because there are much more similar scenes here. They are fast-paced, dynamic, with more blood here than in any previous western, though I would like more. The chases are exciting, and the fights are kept in suspense, although their outcome can be guessed almost from the very beginning. These scenes, starting with the previous picture &quot;Tekumze&quot;, are only getting better in quality! A little about the main characters: 1. Ulzana performed by Goiko Mitich is a mighty and brave warrior of the Apache tribe, who vows to take revenge on the insidious pale-faced people for the bloody massacre they committed over his fellow tribesmen, which he does throughout the whole picture. He manifests himself as a reasonable and experienced warrior who does not rush into the heat of battle without thinking through everything to the smallest detail. And again Goiko performs all the tricks on his own and plays at a high level. Bravo Goiko! 2. Nana performed by Kolea Rautu is an old warrior of the Apache tribe (by the way, a real historical figure), who, with his experience and decisive actions, becomes Ulzana&apos;s right hand. At first it seems like a funny old man, but this is only at first. The old tiger still has teeth, and even the claws are sharpened to a shine. The actor on the screen was no less convincing than his character. 3. Johnson performed by Milan Beli is a pale-faced, insidious villain who led and committed a mean crime against the Apaches, for which he must be punished. He has influential intercessors, but this will not save him. Greedy, arrogant, proud, unpleasant. Milan very convincingly played this villain. Here I can only praise. Well, of course, fights, chases and shootouts do not look as exciting today as they did in the year of release, but we will make a discount, because all the westerns of this studio deserve it. Well, next time we will continue to follow the life and struggle for the home of the brave Ulzana, who will again be played by Goiko Mitic. It will be in the picture &quot;Ulzan&quot;. As a result, we have a good western with the inimitable Goiko Mitic, with an excellent and simple script, excellent surroundings, good music, exciting dynamic scenes and excellent acting.",

      "reviewBody": "MST covered this one and did a good job with it.(The quote is from the first zombie attack.) And as I recall, Adam West even introduced their cover of it for its first broadcast during a &quot;Turkey Day&quot; Thanksgiving marathon. (Good for you, Adam! You look good!)\n\nHey, Frank Dietz, it was fun to see your comment about the movie; glad you have a good sense of perspective about it, and I hope you are doing well. ZN was completely cheesy, but it wasn&apos;t your fault...you were just in over your head! \n\nAdam West has taken a lot of crap over the decades for his somewhat hammy style and fruity baritone, but he&apos;s still the real deal as an actor. Put him in a 3rd rate film like this one, and he instantly blows everyone else in the film away without trying. This movie was lucky to have him. \n\nThe film also gets an extra star for starting out with &quot;Ace Of Spades&quot; as the opening song on the soundtrack and a nice little thumbprint graphic for the opening title. It was a great choice and started the movie with a nice burst of energy.\n\nBut after that, things go downhill pretty fast. There are lots of missteps here: pacing, plot holes, characterization and consistency of tone. For instance, the movie stops dead in its tracks at one points and spends 2-3 minutes watching a mediocre tennis match between the tall, lanky mall punk and his blond girlfriend. It spends an inordinate amount of time driving to the local &apos;Twist and Creme&apos; ice cream store. When the hero/zombie-to-be gets run over by the mall punks at the beginning of the movie, his mother doesn&apos;t call a doctor, call an ambulance, or start CPR, she calls her local voodoo practitioner &quot;Molly Mokembe&quot; so she can go about getting revenge for her son&apos;s death. \n\n(This brings all kinds of questions to mind, BTW. The movie seems to find it unremarkable that there is a high priestess of voodoo just down the street in an average Canadian urban neighborhood. Geez, not ONE of the black people I grew up with turned out to be voodoo masters, not even the ones whose life my father saved! I never knew Canada was so wild at heart!) \n\nOh, and if YOU were attacked by a zombie, and you knocked him down with a shotgun and then you got in your car to flee, wouldn&apos;t you a)shoot the zombie in the head and knees a couple of just to slow him down a bit more and b) CLOSE THE CAR DOOR while you cranked the ignition??? I&apos;m just asking...\n\nBut the biggest weakness, IMO, is in the part and performance of the mall punk&apos;s &apos;psycho&apos; member. Ooooo, he has an ATTITUDE! OOooo, he throws pasta at his mom! Ooooo, he harasses a waitress with juvenile remarks about the size of his &apos;member&apos;! Ooooo, he...well, he goes for a drive! (See &apos;Twist and Creme&apos; reference above.)\n\nHe&apos;s about 105 lbs, soaking wet, with pencil thin arms and elaborately blow-dried-and-feathered shoulder length hair, but we are supposed to accept that he&apos;s some kind of menacing James Dean stand-in. And he is, in fact, almost infinitely annoying. But he (the character that is) wouldn&apos;t last 10 minutes at my old junior high school (it was on the &apos;wrong side of the tracks&apos; in a town of 60,000 people.) \n\nThe rest of the cast is OK. The other four mall punks are natural and at ease in front of the camera. Frank Dietz manages to hold his own in his scenes with Adam West. A couple of the murders are fairly gruesome. And the blond cutie looks sexy as she &apos;briskly jogs&apos; away from the zombie in her towel. Some of the other songs on the soundtrack are pretty good, especially the one by Girlschool. Even Jon Mikl Thor is, well, not as bad as he could be, although it&apos;s pretty obvious that the project began to overwhelm him and he was forced to get another actor to play the zombie for some scenes. Don&apos;t quit your day job, JMT. \n\nAn amusing mess. Watch with one dose of alcohol clutched firmly in your mitt and several more readily at hand and you&apos;ll have no problem with &apos;Nightmare&apos;.",

As for the &quot;Creature Theme,&quot; my brother and I took great delight in parodizing the lyrics:\n\nThis is where the creature goes / when he needs to blow his nose\n\netc. etc. etc. and other preteen humor (?).\n\nBut for your basic seventies celebration of Middle American white trash culture, it just doesn&apos;t get any better than this. Young girls in curlers, alone in the trailer with a big hairy creature stalking around outside! Cats meeting horrible fates just from espying said creature! Corn-pone accents galore!

East Germany was, for a communist country, rather liberal (homosexuality wasn&apos;t illegal, just ignored; women were an integral part of the work force and society...), yet still communist. I am a bit confused by one writer&apos;s comment regarding Bush&apos;s oppressive America...I think it rather resembles this movie. But I digress...\n\nOverall, the movie is a success given its origin. No tragedies, but rather a man who struggles with his identity and ultimately accepts himself emotionally as a gay man. I guess it is a period piece as much as &apos;In and Out&apos; may be considered a period piece. Maybe historical representation would be a better term, in particular with this movie, given the timing of its release. The ending is left rather open, leaving the viewer wondering where Philipp might next end up. Maybe there was supposed to be a sequel? We&apos;ll never know, I guess.\n\nAnd yes, he does look good in a pair of jeans.",

While there were a few (the dialogue slips sometimes) I found &quot;Skeeter&quot; to be a somewhat enjoyable monster movie that kept me entertained all the way through.  It didn&apos;t have the standard &quot;look&quot; of a straight to video flick, but the effects were a little cheap in places (you could tell they used two screens) but other than that, the acting is quite good, the directing was competent (could&apos;ve been a little tighter) and the leads were pretty likeable."

The enduring iconic images from the film have weathered better than the film itself, however, but it still stands up as a paean to disaffected youth. \n\nWhen Johnny and the boys ride into town all hell breaks loose, with a culture clash between themselves and the &apos;squares&apos;, resulting in tragedy and some reconciliation. These boys look tame compared to today&apos;s standards (they even pay for their own beer!) but they don&apos;t fit in and so are immediately ostracised by a grown-up world that doesn&apos;t understand their jive-talking, anti-social behaviour. Johnny&apos;s reply when asked, &quot;What are you rebelling against?&quot; says it all...&quot;Whatta you got?&quot;, with a sneer for good measure.\n\nTime hasn&apos;t been kind to the film, and it&apos;s hard to see why it was banned in the UK for 18 years (mainly down to the lack of any retribution for the gang), but there is still a tight story and strong characterisation. It&apos;s a pity the film descends needlessly into melodrama, losing much of it&apos;s credibility in the process."

      "reviewBody": "When I saw LAUREN BACALL do CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on screen. But here Ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be WALTER MATTHAU&apos;s wife so he can go on with the fib he&apos;s told GOLDIE HAWN.\n\nIt&apos;s a story played for laughs from beginning to end, good-humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time. There are plenty of one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on TV--the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives.\n\nAs the daffy girl who contemplates (in the beginning) committing suicide over her unhappy affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star on TV&apos;s &quot;Laugh In&quot;) does a dumb blonde role to perfection. Easy to see why she won that Supporting Actress Oscar.\n\nIngrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role, although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part. At any rate, she&apos;s a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty.\n\nAs Goldie&apos;s next door neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz acquits himself admirably, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene.\n\nMatthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those Neil Simon roles he had--a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie.\n\nIt&apos;s the kind of rib-tickling comedy that&apos;ll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that Abe Burrows and I.A.L. Diamond have managed to scrap together, based on a French farce.",

      "reviewBody": "Violent Cop is the first directorial work of comedian and television host Takeshi Kitano. He wasn&apos;t even supposed to do this job but when the initially hired director pulled out of the project due to scheduling conflicts, Takeshi Kitano took over and rewrote large parts of the script in the process. People must have been surprised when this film was initially released because it has nothing to do with Takeshi Kitano&apos;s quirky, funny and entertaining shows throughout the seventies and eighties. Violent Cop does its title justice and is brutal, cynical and nihilistic. It is often compared to the Dirty Harry franchise but while the titular hero of the American franchise is able to keep his cool, Takeshi Kitano&apos;s main character is unstable, unpredictable and pitiless.\n\nTakeshi Kitano plays brutal veteran detective Azuma who doesn&apos;t show much respect for his superiors, colleagues and rookies. He treats criminals the way they would actually treat their victims. The opening sequence is quite revealing in that regard as the detective follows the leader of a group of teenagers who beat up a helpless old man and proceeds to beat him up in his parents&apos; house. The only person this detective seems to care about is his fragile sister who spent time at a hospital to treat a head injury. Once we are introduced to the detective&apos;s life, the actual plot unfolds. The detective discovers that his partner is involved in drug trafficking but before he can conduct further investigations, his partner is found hanged under a bridge. Azuma understands that the suicide had been staged and tries to track down the boss of the drug trafficking ring by any means necessary.\n\nThe cinematography of this movie is very experimental and foreshadows Takeshi Kitano&apos;s later works. The movie has few dialogues and especially the main character prefers to use his fists before asking any questions. The movie features long moments of silence and static camera work before they are interrupted by hectic sequences and brutal acts of violence. The movie is quite brutal indeed and the body count rises quicker and quicker as the film progresses. Innocent bystanders get killed, a helpless homeless man gets beaten to pulp and even a pitiful woman gets executed. The film&apos;s conclusion is particularly cynical and nihilistic but offers an unexpected twist and some food for thought.\n\nFans of Japanese V-cinema and enthusiasts for brutal yakuza movies will adore Violent Cop. It has an intriguing atmosphere, unusual characters and lots of violence. Despite its cynical, nihilistic and pitiless attitude, the movie is never shallow and actually offers some food for thought. The film has aged quite well and shows the dark side of Japan&apos;s society.",

      "reviewBody": "About the winding paths of a global star: Heike Makatsch embodies Hildegard Knef\n\nThis 2009 film by Kai Wessel is a positive surprise. Based on her best-selling autobiography &quot;Der geschenkte Gaul / The Gift Horse&quot; (1970), he illuminatingly describes the ups and downs in the life and extraordinary career of the actress, singer and best-selling author Hildegard Knef (1925-2002).\n\nIt begins in Berlin in 1966. Hildegard Knef returns to Berlin in triumph. As a now extremely successful pop singer, she wants to give a concert in the sold-out Philharmonic Hall. Burning with stage fright, she thinks back to her beginnings in the last years of the war. And then they all appear in this extraordinary film produced by Judy Tossell and Jens Meurer, the companions of their lives.\n\nGrowing up with her mother (Johanna Gastdorf) and grandfather (Michael Gwisdek), the very young Hilde (Heike Makatsch) already has ideas about a career as an actress. And she manages it too: Accepted by her acting teacher Else Bongers (Monica Bleibtreu), she ends up at the UFA in Babelsberg, plays her first small roles, gets to know her first lover, the ardent National Socialist TOBIS boss Ewald von Demandowsky (Anian Zollner), plays theater (Schlosspark-Theater) under Boleslaw Barlog (Sylvester Groth) and has her first appearances as a singer with Ricci Blum (Roger Cicero). In the post-war period, Hildegard Knef met her first husband Kurt Hirsch (Trystan PÃ¼tter) and filmed the sensational hit &quot;Die MÃ¶rder sind unter uns / The Murderers Are Among Us&quot; for the newly founded DEFA, which made the young actress a star overnight. Although successful producer Erich Pommer (Hanns Zischler) strongly advises the enthusiastic Hilde to stay in Germany and with the newly re-emerging film industry, Hollywood beckons in the form of David O. Selznick (Gone with the Wind). Completely wrong decision! German superstar Hildegard Knef is left out in the California sun. This is another way to get rid of unwanted competition. Only with Erich Pommer&apos;s help is she able to return to Germany, where Hilde becomes a scandalous celebrity as &quot;Die SÃ¼nderin / The Sinner&quot; (1951) under the direction of Willi Forst (Hary Prinz). Her nude appearance (only a few seconds), filmed in the heath village of Bendestorf, attracts at least 7 million viewers to the cinemas. Under the direction of Anatole Litvak (Jeroen Willems), the Hollywood career also works out. &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; (1951) was shot in Germany and nominated for an Oscar as Best Film of the Year. Afterwards, Hildegarde Neff, as she is now known internationally, shoots with Tyrone Power (Courier to Trieste) and Gregory Peck (Snow on Kilimanjaro). And she also took Broadway by storm in 1955: as Ninotchka in the musical &quot;Silk Stockings.&quot; But Hilde wouldn&apos;t be Hilde if she didn&apos;t mess up again. After success comes another crash. In England she meets her second husband David Cameron (Dan Stevens), who is still married. When she unexpectedly received the gold film ribbon for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Man Who Sold Himself&quot; (1959), she was back on top. But when the tabloid press finds out that David Cameron is still married, she ends up on the black list as an &quot;adulteress.&quot; A role offer from Fritz Lang fell through, I would have loved to see her as Marion Menil in &quot;The 1000 Eyes of Doctor Mabuse&quot; (1960)!!! What a pity! But the good thing is: Hildegard Knef reflected on her talents as a singer, became a successful chanson author and celebrated triumphs as a star that the German-speaking world had never seen before.\n\nHeike Makatsch does an extraordinary job as Hildegard Knef. Her playing, her singing, everything is fabulous! She&apos;s becoming a knef! Furthermore, it is very gratifying that this film also serves as a worthy memorial to the singer Roger Cicero (1970-2016), who unfortunately died far too early. Through his songs he made swing popular again in German-speaking countries. His performance with &quot;Women Rule the World&quot; at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki will never be forgotten.\n\nWhat a wonderful film! Of course, it doesn&apos;t hurt if you familiarize yourself a little with Hildegard Knef&apos;s life story beforehand. But even without having read The Gift Horse, you can enjoy this extraordinary film to the fullest.",

It is as if Elvis speaks to us from beyond the grave. A young actor plays Elvis in scenes from his early life. Leo and Solt managed to tap Elvis&apos; private film archives. Young Priscilla is shown at Elvis&apos; birthday party in Germany. Of course, there is the condescending Ed Sullivan assuring us that Elvis is &quot;a fine boy, thoroughly alright.&quot; Roger Ebert&apos;s review implied that Elvis was an alcoholic. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He did not drink. There is a marked contrast between Elvis in his 20s and Elvis in his 40s, but I sense in some a grim exultation regarding the fall of Elvis Presley. The soundtrack contains Always On My Mind. Elvis&apos; version is far superior to Willie Nelson&apos;s.",

Blaming himself Nishi tries to do the right thing by his partner Horibe and the widow of cop, while also trying to salvage some happiness in what remains of his time with his wife.\n\nI came back to Takeshi Kitano about the same time as I left the Movies You Should See podcast. I left it because I don&apos;t think it is as good as it could be and at times offers no real insight into a film other than describing &quot;bits&quot; however I give them a mention because they reminded me that I had only ever seen one or two of Kitano&apos;s films and that it had been some time since I had even seen those. So it was that after watching Brother, my rental site threw me Hana-Bi and I was looking forward to it due to the praise on this site and indeed the podcast itself. The expectation was not unjustified as Hana-Bi is a film of pain and beauty that is well worth seeing even if it is not the image of perfection that some would have you believe.\n\nThat statement is bound to attract a low vote on IMDb but what can I tell you? That it was slow and quiet is not a problem for me but it is a feeling you get watching the film and it is not helped by some scenes feeling irrelevant within the context of the story. This is not a real killer but I felt that the slow pace needed support and seeing two minor characters argue about a fender bender (for example) saw my interest dip and the slow pace start to be felt. Otherwise though, the silence and pace suits the material and the style of the film. The violence is quite subdued (in regards what you actually see) because it occurs in the edit of the action Â so the actual impact is mostly unseen. It doesn&apos;t matter though because the main thrust of the film is less the outward violence but the internal suffering of all the characters. The film does wear this aspect a little heavily at times and some will feel that some sequences are right on the edge of being pretentious and there is no point in denying that it does walk this line here and there.\n\nHowever for the majority it is a really well observed and emotionally engaging story built on the silent but emotive presence of Kitano as writer, director and star. As writer he has, it could be argued, left a lot to the actual making process itself since the script must have been a few pages. As director he sets the pace and I like the way his static style works within this story but it is his work as actor that always mystifies and impresses me. How he can convey so much while also appearing to be doing nothing at all I&apos;m not sure but it somehow works and fits his style in other disciplines. He is well supported by Kishimoto, with whom he has genuine chemistry without betraying his character&apos;s nature. Osugi is not that great and it is with his character that I found the film close to being pretentious, not the actor&apos;s fault of course but I never felt for him as I did for Nishi.\n\nHana-Bi is very slow and quiet and I can totally understand why some viewers will throw it in very early on. However sticking with it reveals a film that manages to be violent, introspective and emotionally engaging at the same time, all wrapped in the style of Kitano, who is creative across the board."

      "reviewBody": "In his last movie, John Wayne plays J B Books, an ageing former gunfighter who arrives in Carson City. Books has in the past killed thirty men in gunfights and has become a legend of the West, but this hard-won status has brought him unwelcome attention from would-be gunslingers hoping to gain their own place in history as `the man who shot J B Books&apos;. Early on, Books is told by his old friend Dr Hostetler that he is dying of terminal cancer, and the film chronicles the last week of his life, from 22nd to 29th January 1901, his search for a dignified death in accordance with his own code of honour.\n\nThe film is about both endings and new beginnings, so it is significant that the action takes place in the first month of a new century. January 1901 marked not only the beginning of a century, but also the end of an era, because it was the month in which Queen Victoria died; this event is referred to several times in the film. The days of the `Old West&apos; were also coming to an end; under the influence of new inventions such as the motor car and the telephone (both of which appear in the film) it was becoming a quieter and less lawless place.\n\nThe time of year is significant in another way. A film which is about both the end of a man&apos;s life and the end of an era will inevitably be elegiac in tone, and the standard way of making it would be to film it in autumn, with plenty of shots of falling leaves and grey, misty skies. Don Siegel, however, takes an alternative approach, setting the film during a brief period of brilliant winter sunshine and mild weather known as a `false spring&apos;. This not only provides some strikingly beautiful images, but also has a double symbolic meaning. For Books and for the Old West it is winter; but for the younger generation, spring is coming. One of the most touching features of the film is the relationship between Books and Gillom, the son of his landlady. Gillom idolises Books and treats him as a hero; Books, in the last days of his life, treats the young man as the son he never had and tries to teach him that there is a better way than that of the gun. The Old West may be passing into history, but there are indications that the New West, although it may be less picturesque, will be a better place in which to live. If winter comes, can spring be far behind?\n\nThe film itself also turned out to mark the end of an era in more ways than one. Although there is some doubt whether Wayne actually knew in 1976 that his cancer had returned, we now of course know that it was to be his last film and that he was to die about three years later, and this knowledge makes the film all the more poignant. It was also one of the last of the great Westerns. Although the genre had seemed in reasonable health in the early seventies, it was to suffer, for various reasons, a sharp   decline in the second half of the decade and throughout the eighties. Perhaps the standard conventions of the genre had become so familiar that they seemed like clichÃ©s; perhaps the post-Vietnam generation had no time for films which often had as their themes honour, glory and courage. (It is notable that the patriotic war film underwent a similar decline at the same time). Certainly, the financial failure of `Heaven&apos;s Gate&apos; made investors wary of backing westerns. Even Clint Eastwood, who had seemed to be the heir-apparent to Wayne&apos;s crown as King (or should that be Duke?) of the West, abandoned the genre for a time, although he was to return to it triumphantly with `Unforgiven&apos; in the early nineties.\n\nWayne&apos;s great strength as an actor was his ability to convey the tough but honourable man of action. Both these qualities are present in `The Shootist&apos;, but he was able to add further qualities, pathos and as sense of a less honourable past. Although Books is hard-bitten and irascible, he is also fundamentally decent, resorting to force only in self-defence. He can show pity- early in the film he spares the life of a villain who tries to rob him at gunpoint, even though he has the man at his mercy. Nevertheless, we are always well aware that he did not gain his fearsome reputation by a scrupulous observance of the Ten Commandments; although this is not an overtly religious film, the story of his last days can be seen as the story of his search for atonement as well as for dignity. In his last film, Wayne achieves one of his greatest performances; it is remarkable that he was not even nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe other performance that stands out is that of Ron Howard as Gillom. Howard, of course, is now best known as a director; if his acting career is remembered it is for his role that bland TV series `Happy Days&apos;. Nevertheless, he was also capable of giving good contributions in films (`American Graffiti&apos; is another example), and here he brings a touching youthful innocence to the part. There are also good contributions from James Stewart as the gentle, dignified doctor and from Lauren Bacall as Gillom&apos;s mother. (She has the unusual Christian name Bond, possibly symbolic of the close ties that grow between her and Books at the end of his life).\n\n `The Shootist&apos; is a marvellous film, sombre and elegiac, and yet at the same time with a message of hope. A fitting end to Wayne&apos;s career. 9/10.",

At least it&apos;s better that the usual Golan-Globus stuff.    (**1/2)",

That gets the FBI involved and Jerry Cotton and Phil Decker put on the case. They suspect that there is a gang readying another big heist in the Big Apple. Jerry finds a lame way to infiltrate the gang (as a drunk he beats up the members of the gang impressing the leader). While some of the plot does lack credibility it is an action packed film that moves along at a good pace. There are similarities to Death and Diamonds in the plot with Jerry gaining the affections and confidence of gang moll, in this case Sylvia Pascal, to help crack the case. However, this movie has more depth in the storyline and makes it a more enjoyable viewing. The unusual musical score throughout is an additional bonus. Recommended especially if you enjoy crime dramas.",

I agree with those that said there is something mysteriously appealing about this film, as I have remembered it since it came out in 1946 when so many other movies have long faded from memory. Ward Bond was not known for playing villains, and this performance was truly scary and sinister.  Lloyd Bridges plays the friendly good guy that characterized his roles, and Dana Andrews is perfectly cast as the leader. The film is rather hard to find, and I am hoping a DVD will one day be available.  It is well worth watching and collecting."

This movie, has a simple story, of a guy who is in love with a woman, and then another man comes in and also falls in love with her. Edgar Ramirez gives a very strong performance as Cyrano, the main characters who forms part and leads a group called the tupamaros, which defends the barrio from delinquents and drug dealers. The dramatic effect and the plot of the movie is affected negatively by poor acting from the other leads and supporting actors, who did not convince the public, or at least me as real actors. I would recommend the movie, I know acting is almost the most important part of cinema, but the lead actor gives a good performance and it is a good story set in the barrios of Venezuela.",

I also feel privileged to have co-written the song, &quot;For Such A Time As This&quot;,(once again) following a sermon preached back in the mid-1980&apos;s.\n\nThis story transcends the &quot;Top 20&quot; list and it goes beyond an &quot;Inspirational Fad&quot;, because it continues to be reborn in anyone who will rise to embrace the Call that leads a person to their Destiny.\n\nThe cinematography of this motion picture is lavish and the music is luscious. Judeo-Christianity and all love-based religions have come out of the closet in the telling of this age-old story and we may be witnessing the re-birth of secular Hollywood, all because someone stood up and came forth... &quot;For Such A Time As This&quot;.\n\nNot only did this movie make me feel good. It challenged me to once again embrace the hope and courage of Esther -- something more than religion; rather, a way of life.\n\nSee this film not just because of it&apos;s &quot;Faith-Based&quot; theme. See it for the message of enduring Courage that it portrays. And stay tuned for the sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "Last night I saw this film for the first time in 35 years. Time has been kinder to it than it has to many Hammer films, but this one is less driven by effects and make-up and more by dialog.\n\nThat&apos;s all for the better because once again, when need be, Hammer fails in the effects department. I had forgotten how the theater went wild in 1968 while looking at the cheap tarantula effect - was it growing or not, the perspective changed constantly.\n\nSome of the effects are of the &quot;stop the camera&quot; variety, no more convincing here than on &quot;Lost In Space.&quot; But still, it is the performances, situations and the dialog that engage us. Christopher Lee, who brought the project to Hammer, seems to be enjoying himself as the Duc de Richleau, finally getting to play a hero. His longtime friend Rex, played by Leon Greene (but voiced by Patrick Allen) is a real stalwart guy, given to punching out windshields when necessary, climbing into car trunks, and throwing a crucifix from a running board to eliminate the specter of the devil himself.\n\nThe best scene has Lee and company in a circle in which to protect themselves from the evils sent by Mocata, played by Charles Gray with a suaveness that matches the twinkle of his blue eyes. Mocata tries every trick in the book, including trying to make it appear that the daughter of the household is being threatened by the tarantula, as well as an Angel of Death on horseback (it is a large room). Meanwhile, outside, Rex has a potential female victim tied up for her own good, she later becomes a medium when the previously &quot;threatened&quot; little girl is kidnapped - to take the place of the medium on the sacrificial altar! \n\nNike Arrighi plays the &quot;medium&quot; - a young woman who was to have been re-baptized as a servant of the devil, but whose life now hangs in the balance between the black magic of Mocata, or the efforts of the Duc de Richleau, and she has more talent than most of the Hammer actresses of the period. The Duc&apos;s friend Rex falls for her, but is hard pressed to keep up with the spells of Mocata, who will stop at nothing to reclaim his servant.\n\nWhat really helps the film is a great sense of period - somewhere midway between the two world wars. The props (especially the vehicles) and costumes are quite right, and the landscapes are far more diverse than the usual Bray Studios trappings. There&apos;s no doubt that the team sought to make this one special and shoot on some real locations - and it&apos;s perhaps here rather than in the effects that the budget was concentrated. All in all, despite some shortcomings, a very enjoyable Hammer film, a solid Richard Matheson script from a superior Dennis Wheatley novel makes for exciting viewing, far superior to the previous Satanic Hammer film &quot;The Witches&quot; (aka &quot;The Devil&apos;s Bride&quot;) and equal to the later adaptation of Wheatley&apos;s own &quot;To the Devil A Daughter&quot; - the last Hammer film which may have its less than sterling reputation for that measure alone."

      "reviewBody": "The film starts in Sarawak , a province of North of Borneo where an idealistic doctor named Ash (Mark Dacascos of Double dragon). He mistakenly reveals his DNA theories to an evil scientific (Jurgen Prochnow , Das Boat) who utilizes on illegal genetic experiments , blending beetle and alien DNA . As a nasty scientist&apos;s DNA experiment on the bones of a mysterious jungle creature brings the carnivorous beast to life . Two years later , there appear various bodies dead and wounded ; one mutant , a giant insect-like specie with super powers , lurks in the lush forest from into perilous jungles , waiting for prey . The weird creature begins attacking one by one . Meantime , Ash along with a beautiful doctor( Robin McKee) are surrounded and both of whom set out to track it down.\n\nThis is a semi-remake to Â¨PredatorÂ¨, told in terms of jungle warfare with an over seven-foot-tall monster on the loose . It&apos;s a brutal , exciting and violent Sci-Fi thriller with gory action and little logic . So we ought sit through the creature dispatch enemies one by one before the ending showdown comes , leaving the utter mechanics of the thing to keep our interest buzzing . The final confrontation is particularly exciting stuff , even though it makes no great sense . The result is thoroughly unpleasant but undeniably thrilling action movie . Acceptable special effects and special make-up by , nowadays famous , : Robert Kurtzman , Greg Nicotero , Howard Berger . Adequate cinematography by Gerry Lively and nice musical score fitting to action by Christopher Stone . The motion picture was regularly directed by William Mesa , he&apos;s usually visual effects supervisor (Dark Water , Deep blue sea) and occasionally cinema director . Rating : Passable and entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "What is certain about Klondike fever is that young Jack London arrived in Alaska and traveled to the Yukon territory. Legendary outlaw Soapy Smith was operating in both Alaska and the Yukon at that time. So was legendary Mountie Sam Steele.\n\nThis is the basis for the film Klondike Fever as 21 year old Jack London&apos;s encounters with them and other characters would form the frame of his first writings. London is properly cast in the right age bracket by young Jeff East.\n\nPlaying Smith is Rod Steiger and Sam Steele is played by Lorne Greene. In real life Smith woul be dead the following year and Steele would serve in the Boer War and compile a good record.\n\nAny aficionado of London&apos;s work will of course recognize the genesis of his classic novel White Fang. London&apos;s already budding socialist views were most certainly sharpened by his Yukon experience.\n\nThe beauty of the Canadian frotier is captured in the cinematography in British Columbia where the film was shot. I imagine the real Yukon was a bit too forbidding for movie crews.\n\nDon&apos;t be worried by accuracy here. Klondike Fever is a plausible film about some real folks who could have all met.",

      "reviewBody": "I have long been a fan of Film Noir. I consider this film to be unique and one of the best. The first and only time I saw it in a theater was in 1949 when I was 14. It was titled &quot;Gun Crazy&quot;. I thought it was great but it didn&apos;t receive rave reviews or last long in hometown theaters. I understand they renamed it &quot;Deadly Is The Female&quot; in 1950 for its release in England, reason being that co-star Peggy Cummins was British and emphasizing the female star would be better box-office.\n\nIn the years that passed I wanted to see it again but it didn&apos;t appear on TV or later on any videotape that I knew of. In the 1983 Richard Geer film &quot;Breathless&quot; there is a chase scene where he is trying to escape by way of the stage behind a movie screen. On that screen was playing what I immediately recognized as &quot;Gun Crazy&quot;. Over the years since then I have continued to look for the movie but was unable to find it. Less than a month ago I found it on DVD and purchased an excellent copy. I found that the movie is just as good as I remember it.\n\nThe film is essentially a story of a boy named Bart Tare (Russ Tamblyn) who loves guns for sport but refuses to harm any living being with them. After stealing one from a local store, he is caught and sent to a reformatory. The story continues four reformatory years plus one army hitch later when an adult Bart (John Dall) is discharged. He and some friends go to a cheap carnival where he sees and immediately falls for a trick shot artist, Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins). He beats her in a shooting contest but is offered a job in the act rather than the prize he was supposed to win.\n\nBart is unaware of her dark past, which includes hints of prostitution and the murder of a man in St. Louis. After a showdown with the jealous carnival owner they run off together and get married. When their money runs out, Bart wants to get a job but Annie Laurie&apos;s mind runs in a different direction, armed robbery. Reluctantly, Bart gives in and they set off on a spree of low paying stickups. By this time, Bart is increasingly aware that Annie Laurie has homicidal tendencies that he is barely able to keep under control. They plan a big-time robbery during which she kills two people without his knowledge. The rest of the movie deals with their flight from justice and ultimate payment for their crimes. In all, it is a classic scenario of &quot;Bad Girl&quot; leads a &quot;Good Boy&quot; into evil.\n\nPersonal opinion is that John Dall did a better acting job in this movie than he did in &quot;Rope&quot;. In a bit of self-analysis I must admit that I have long been fascinated by &quot;Wicked Women&quot;. This movie alone placed Peggy Cummins among my favorite &quot;femme fatales&quot;, which included the queen of mean, Barbara Stanwyck, Marlene Dietrich, Beverly Michaels and other notables.\n\nIf you like classic film noir, it is a good movie to remember and see again.",

In Denmark the movies, been seen of german tourist and people who just seen it of a comedy. Many great danish actors, was in the films, but in 78 was it over. Hard-core porn took over from the danish comedy-film. The film was not good. The humor was awful and the sex-scenes was just horney.

I think this film may be alot more scary for us, as norwegians (or scandinavians) than it is for americans or whatever. Because of this, I think it is unfair of imdb.com to speak such bad of it.\n\n The Woods have always been an important part of the norwegian &quot;tradition&quot;, and it is very appriciated. Therefore, I find it particullary scary since the setting takes place in a typical norwegian forest. Never before, have I seen a horror-film so realistic made, because of the setting, and the language. (Norwegian)\n\n&quot;Villmark&quot; is indeed a good (Except the ending ;)) horror-movie which Norway, as a folk, should be very proud of. It scared the hell out of me and my friends.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n* GnarusLeo - 18 of age.\n",

I&apos;m not exactly sure what the hell the film is about but it goes something like this. After a carriage wreck, a young woman (Ewa Aulin) is left without her memory so she stays with a husband and wife who both take a sexual liking to her. There&apos;s also a strange murderer going around and there&apos;s also a weird doctor (Klaus Kinski) who is trying to create a formula that will bring the dead back to life. Before long, the wife kills the young woman but soon she reappears. Is it a ghost or something else? As I said, this film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are several other story lines that I could have included in the plot but I&apos;m not exactly sure what they had to do with anything either. D&apos;Amato does a good job with the cinematography, which added with the music score makes for some nice atmosphere. Aulin is easy on the eyes and delivers the best performance in the film but overall this thing it too much of a mess to really enjoy. The film&apos;s pace, although gets quite tiresome after a while."

      "reviewBody": "It sounds implausible and impossibleÂthat a man&apos;s accidental flub-up in the voting booth causes his vote to stall the election and coincidentally determine the next U.S. President. But Swing Vote has a great time using that as a platform to tell a really cool tale.\n\nBesides, the movie wants to move past that impossibility anyway (suspension of disbelief, right?), and into the fun stuff. Swing Vote isn&apos;t necessarily about the likelihood of the above-mentioned phenomenon occurring; it&apos;s about bigger things, things like the nature of freedom in America, the right to vote, politicians and their campaigns, and various issues that unite and divide America as a nation.\n\nErnest &quot;Bud&quot; Johnson (Kevin Costner) is a beer-drinking, blue-collar simpleton whose wife left both him and his daughter, Molly, for a Nashville singing career. Molly (Madeline Carroll), a precocious little girl who is passionate about politics and the preservation of her country, and unfortunately for her, Bud couldn&apos;t care less, even if her were sober. Molly seems to be the parent in the relationship, taking care of Bud&apos;s daily hangovers and prodding him to get up for work.\n\nMolly is in constant frustration with her father&apos;s apathy toward life and her interests, and is perturbed when Bud seemingly sets in motion an ironic, history-making turn of events where his vote actually ends up being the deciding factor in the election. This forces the Presidential candidates to campaign only to win Bud&apos;s vote. Along the way we are treated to a satirical look at the lengths campaign managers and the candidates will go simply to get a vote.\n\nHow this plays out is both hilarious and sobering, as well as inspiring and totally enjoyableÂthanks to some good storytelling and direction, as well as an excellent cast of talented actors who make this movie shine. The brightest stars on the screen, however, are Kevin Costner and Madeline Carroll as Bud and Molly. Costner has found a perfect role in the dimwitted Bud, and Carroll as Molly is a brilliant young actor whose performance almost brought me to tears at one point.\n\nLike I mentioned before, though, Swing Vote is not a simple &quot;voting is your civic duty&quot; story. While the importance of voting is emphasized as both a privilege and a blessing in a great country, Swing Vote goes over the issues that affect daily life in America, and through the story reminds us how we can take some sort of action to better that life.\n\nHowever, Swing Vote is careful not to play too much on the emotional arguments regarding various issues like abortion, immigration and gay marriage, making the movie all the more charming. There are a few emotionally charged scenes in the movie that give weight to the hilarity throughout, but within the context of the film, the story never speaks in self-righteousness.\n\nAt one point, Molly makes a simple yet convicting commentary about how much she appreciates her father at a &quot;Bring Your Father to School&quot; Day. Without giving too much away, Molly&apos;s emotional message about her father is a hopeful and heart-wrenching commentary about the beauty and freedom of America, along with the tragic complacency and apathy of its people.\n\nAnd rather than going down the typical Hollywood route and picking a more liberal stance, Swing Vote instead manages to poke fun at everyone on both &quot;sides&quot; of various issues. It carefully gives respect to all Americans, while pointing out absurdities in America&apos;s political process. Although the mockery is at times absolutely hilarious, the film&apos;s humor never ventures into the vile and mean-spirited. There is purpose behind all the fun, and it is carefully crafted into the story, with the goal of giving a message of hope and focusing on the (hopefully) common goal of compassion, care, peace, and freedom to all people (to all Americans, anyway).\n\nIn that sense, Swing Vote could almost be seen as patriotic (even the movie&apos;s production design seems to have red, white, and blue hues throughout). There are many inspiring moments that make you think, &quot;Wow, America is a great country,&quot; and &quot;Shame on me for taking my freedom for granted.&quot; Okay, well, that&apos;s a little simplistic; but you&apos;ll understand what I mean: Swing Vote is an American story with a clear and powerful message.\n\nIt may be convicting in its truthful satire and simple wit, but it is also encouraging in that it promotes the hope that we can make a better country by actively changing (ourselves and our country) and refusing to passively observe our nation&apos;s future unfold... not only for us, but for generations to come.",

Shot entirely in silence and in a kind of scratchy black and white &quot;Les Hautes Solitudes&quot; could best be described as a meditation on the nature of celebrity or perhaps on pain or on the concept of &apos;cinema&apos; itself, that one on one experience of sitting in the dark in a building we call &apos;a cinema&apos; or even in our living rooms, interpreting in our mind the images in front of us.\n\nCinema is an entirely personal experience. What one person might love about a film another will hate; sometimes even discerning what a film is about will differ from person to person. &quot;Les Hautes Solitudes&quot;, it seems to me, was made for no-one other than Garrel and perhaps his &apos;star&apos;, if &apos;star&apos; is the correct term here, who happens, in this case, to be Jean Seberg.\n\nSeberg, as any cineaste will know, was an American actress who, at the age of nineteen was cast as Joan of Arc in Preminger&apos;s film of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. It was a disastrous piece of miscasting as Seberg, a natural beauty, seemed to have no discernible acting talent, certainly not enough to carry off such a demanding role. However, it was said that Seberg was not only Preminger&apos;s protÃ©gÃ© but also his lover and he cast her again as Cecile in his film of Francoise Sagan&apos;s &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;. This time the casting was perfect and Seberg was superb as the spoiled, willful woman-child who goes out of her way to destroy her father&apos;s romance. A couple more films of little distinction followed then Seberg returned to France and to &quot;A Bout de SoufflÃ©&quot;. The role, her performance and the film itself are iconic. Whatever her limitations as an actress, in the right part and with the right director Seberg could be extraordinary. Perhaps her greatest performance was again as the willful, destructive and mentally unstable &quot;Lilith&quot; in Robert Rossen&apos;s film of J.R. Salamanca&apos;s novel but by then it was clear that Seberg had her own demons. Her marriage to the writer Romain Gary would end in divorce in 1970 and though she remarried the actor and director Dennis Berry, her name was linked to the Black Panthers and she was &apos;investigated&apos; by the FBI. She died in Paris in 1979 &apos;under mysterious circumstances&apos;, a probable suicide.\n\nGarrel shot &quot;Les Hautes Solitudes&quot; three years before Seberg&apos;s death. As I said, this silent picture concentrates largely on Seberg&apos;s face and on the faces of &apos;co-stars&apos; Tina Aumont and Nico and is nothing more than a plot less series of images like out-takes from an altogether different film dealing, perhaps, with a young woman&apos;s descent into madness or perhaps simply from a documentary about Seberg&apos;s descent into madness where she is cared for by the actress Tina Aumont. Since there is no soundtrack of any kind we can only judge by what we see. We, the individual members of the audience, are left to make up our own minds on what Garrel&apos;s film is &apos;about&apos;. Ironically, Garrel&apos;s concentration on Seberg&apos;s face reminded me of Carl Dreyer&apos;s concentration on the face of Falconetti in his silent masterpiece &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; as if Garrel was paying some kind of conscious tribute to the role that launched Seberg&apos;s career. It also seems to me that films don&apos;t have to be &apos;about&apos; anything and that we can certainly do without sound. As Norma Desmond said, &quot;We didn&apos;t need words, we had faces then&quot; and again, whatever their limitations as &apos;actresses&apos; the faces of Seberg, Aumont and indeed Nico are among the most expressive ever put in film.",

The years haven&apos;t been overly kind so it would seem, since her walk-on slinkathon in furs with Rock icon Bryan Ferry at the latter end of his &quot;Lets Stick Together&quot; film clip! Mind you...a life with Jagger??? \n\nBut I digress! Arquette can never be anything but the goof he is..the film has by necessity been dumbed down to accommodate his dubious talents here. EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS I suspect is as good as ever he&apos;s likely to get. Having said that...he alone is not responsible for the talentless end-product that masquerades here as passable entertainment. You&apos;re talking el-cheapo production values, first-time actors, a script by creatively bereft 8th graders and hammy directing. Regrettably its not bad enough to be notable or off-beat enough to be vaguely interesting. \n\nWhat it IS....is a home movie that neither Janssen or Arquette would want to include on their resume!"

I&apos;m surprised that Salva still manages to find work in Hollywood, not because of his private indiscretions (to put it mildly), but because his films are just so pitiful. CLOWNHOUSE, the two JEEPERS CREEPERS flicks, they&apos;ve all been below par and DARK HOUSE is no exception.\n\nThe house of the title is an ancestral home sought out by a group of faceless teenage types without an ounce of charisma between them. The house has some magical properties including the ability to move at will, but other than that there&apos;s little of interest here, apart from the requisite bloodshed. No scares, no atmosphere, just monotony. Lesley-Anne Down has a minor part and there&apos;s a nicely complex turn from SAW&apos;s Tobin Bell, but otherwise DARK HOUSE is a mess and nothing you&apos;ve not seen before.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always had a feeling that John Wayne had some kind of health crisis and deliberately chose The Cowboys to be his swan song film. When it didn&apos;t work out that way, he went on and did some more until The Shootist. \n\nEver since his Oscar in True Grit, Wayne began playing men of his own age in his films and a common thread seemed to be imparting values to the next generations whether they wanted them or not. You can see that readily in films like Rio Lobo, Big Jake, Chisum, The Train Robbers, and Cahill, U.s. Marshal. Most especially in The Shootist with Ron Howard as his pupil.\n\nBut in The Cowboys he had a mess of pupils. Wayne&apos;s a hardworking rancher whose hands have deserted him because of a rumored gold strike. He has to get his cattle to market, so out of desperation he hires a bunch pubescent and pre-pubescent youngsters from the town. \n\nThe trail drive is quite the lesson for these kids. They learn about life that it is about hard work, responsibility, and keeping your given word. Wayne gets a second chance at fatherhood, he didn&apos;t do such a good job of it with his own two sons. More like grandfatherhood at his age, but the kids learn well.\n\nAlong as a second role model is Roscoe Lee Browne. Possessor of one of the greatest speaking voices in the English speaking world, Browne is the first black man they&apos;ve ever met. In fact one of the kids uses the &quot;N&quot; word when first meeting him, out of ignorance more than racism. Browne sets them straight by example more than preaching.\n\nThe oldest two kids, A Martinez and Robert Carradine, have gone on to some considerable adult careers which they are still enjoying. All the kids are a winning bunch however.\n\nA couple of the Duke&apos;s later westerns like The Train Robbers and Cahill I found to be flawed. Not so here. Director Mark Rydell keeps this one going at a good pace and does wonders with his cast of all ages.",

They all turn up, and it&apos;s bound for disaster when it&apos;s mixed with alcohol.\n\nThere&apos;s a bitter undertone to this comedy, which is a criticism of the free and open modern society, where family relations are mixed with too modern thinking. Well, it&apos;s over the top, and here the kids are the most reasonable.\n\nThis film is best seen upon as an over-the-top crazy comedy, still with some serious undertones. And a great moral underneath as well. Very entertaining, and much better than expected.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has some fine acting.  It is driven by character rather than plot.  Nathalie Baye, as AngÃ¨le, plays a 40ish beautician in Paris.  She has had a traumatic childhood and has been burned in love so she limits herself to one-night stands where she is in the driver&apos;s seat.  Then a man obsessively falls for her and she has to decide whether to open up to love, or at least the possibility of it.  This does not play out quite the way it would if this were a Hollywood high concept movie.\n\nThere are many minor characters, affectionately drawn.  Some pieces of AngÃ¨le&apos;s past never quite get explained or resolved, which some people might complain about, but, hey, life is a lot like that.\n\nThis film is set in Paris, right before and right after Christmas.  (I also saw &quot;La Buche&quot; at the same theater, also set in Paris at Christmas, also very good)\n\nThe jazzy score is particularly nice.\n\nThis is not exactly an upbeat Christmas movie, but it&apos;s well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "4D Man is a very entertaining Sci Fi thriller that utilizes the talents of actor Robert Lansing to their fullest extent. He strikes the right cord as Dr Scott Nelson. Using the research gathered by his brother Dr Tony Nelson, and the data he has gathered through his own work Nelson discovers a method of projecting himself into a fourth dimensional state which allows him to pass through solid objects. The downside is that each projection he attempts causes his body to age very rapidly. He then discovers that with his touch he can absorb the life energy of other living creatures which will renew his own life force and restore his youth. This has the added effect of killing those whose energy he has drained.\n\nThe old adage that &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot; comes through as Nelson allows his pent up frustrations to surface and he uses his powers to rob, and take revenge on those who feels have wronged him.He eventually is able to project himself through shear force of will. When he finds that his fiancÃ© and his brother have fallen in love with each other and have gone to the authorities about him, he targets them both for death.\n\n4D Man has an interesting and unusual premise for a science fiction film. Irvin S Yeaworth Jr directed and did a first rate job of making an absorbing and tightly wound story. Lansing was a low key actor who generally underplayed his scenes. While it didn&apos;t not always work, it&apos;s the right method for Dr Scott Nelson in this story.Good special effects also help. Sci Fi fans and fantasy buffs will enjoy and appreciate 4D Man.",

      "reviewBody": "The reporter Gregory Moore (Jean Sorel) is found dead somewhere in Cold War Prague and brought to the morgue, but he is not really dead Â his mind works, but he cannot move. Now he tries to figure out how he ended up in the morgue. Most of the movie is told through Moore&apos;s flashbacks from the morgue where an old friend of his is trying to revive him because he suspects something is wrong with the body since rigor mortis have not set in.\n\nThe next hour of the movie is very slow moving Â through the flashbacks we learn that Moore had a girlfriend, Mira (played by the gorgeous Barbara Bach), who he loved very dearly. At a party she disappears without a trace and Moore starts his own investigation when the Prague police (almost dressed like the Gestapo) is of little help. His investigation leads him from place to place and he discovers that Mira is not the only missing girl in Prague. As he gets closer to the truth about the missing girls someone tries to stop him and the people who are willing to help him. It looks like a giant conspiracyÂ And the twist ending is magnificent and gruesome at the same time!\n\n*****SPOILERS***** \n\nThe truth is that a satanic cult is behind it all. They sacrifice young people at giant orgies Â we are so &quot;lucky&quot; to catch a glimpse at an orgy so we are treated to loads of old people having sex! Moore discovers the truth and is drugged. The effect of the drug is pretty gruesome since it is like being buried alive Â he appears to be dead and cannot move, but his mind will be fully working! In the end the doctors at the morgue realizes that Moore must be dead and any attempt to revive him is abandoned. Instead they are going to perform an autopsy on him. Just before the autopsy is going to begin Moore gains a little control over his hand Â sadly the doctor performing the autopsy is a member of the cult and he kills him! Pure evil! \n\n*****END SPOILERS***** \n\nShort Night of the Glass Dolls is a very unusual giallo mainly because of the pace. It is remarkably slow moving and lacks the stylish and vicious killings, which almost defines the giallo genre. The overall feeling of the movie reminds me a lot more of Roman Polanski&apos;s The Tenant (1976) and Rosemary&apos;s Baby (1968). The Anchor Bay DVD from The Giallo Collection is brilliant and the 11-minute interview with director Aldo Lado is very informative. Especially his views on how the movie reflects on how the political elite buries people alive (reassigning them for example) when they come too close to the truth about the elite (hey, he is from Italy!), and how the old generation (the elite) lives of the blood of the young generation (the young has to fight the wars the elite engages in). Aldo Lado also directed the giallo Who Saw Her Die? (1972), which is also part of the box set. Both movies have a brilliant score by Ennio Morricone, but they are used very differently Â in Who Saw Her Die? it was almost vulgar and in Short Night of the Glass Dolls the score is used very subtle. This has to be my favorite giallo so far! Go see it!\n\nMy rating: 8/10",

He&apos;s in town to sell some hard-core weapons to the US military; she&apos;s in town to cover war games. I think he is supposed to be a charming-but-insincere international playboy, while she is supposed to be a highly principled feminist (!) just trying to get ahead in a man&apos;s world. \n\nUnfortunately, the whole thing never really gets past the level of farce: it&apos;s just one stereotype after another. Her portrayal of &apos;feminism&apos;, for example, seems to consist entirely of shrieking about how terrible men are and storming off in a huff. And we never actually see her doing any &apos;reporting&apos; at all, unless putting a piece of paper in a typewriter just before getting distracted by something (a phone call, a daydream) counts as &apos;reporting&apos;.\n\nNow this kind of stereotyped farce works fine when you&apos;ve got lots of action, a fast-moving plot, evil villains, stylish art directing, great music, etc. But this movie hasn&apos;t got any of that. On top of which, the supporting actors don&apos;t seem to know whether they are in a comedy, a drama, or an action film.\n\nBottom line: Only for die-hard fans of Roger Moore or British films set in European countries during the 1965-75 period.",

I guess there&apos;s few ways to be more final than to devote a work to the end of humanity. And I&apos;ve never seen a film that struck me as more authentically apocalyptic than this one. It is immediately strange to say then, that one of the things that most impressed me about this juggernaut is its ultra-sly humor. Tarr really is a nihilist and a misanthrope, at least philosophically. The fall of our silly little species really is funny to him, in the darkest way possible, and in half audible beats he makes it funny for us too. All of the other species have sensed the death of the world and have, reasonably, stopped trying to survive. Only homosapiens, represented by a half-functioning horse-carriage driver and his daughter, are clueless enough to continue their wretched routine in the face of a blatant apocalypse. We, along with Tarr, laugh at, pity, and admire the duo for this all at the same time. This is why I call Tarr a misanthrope in philosophy only. In practice, he has love for his fools, even as he leads them towards annihilation. The film includes many references to cinematic finality as well. Fading lanterns, windows that show a world that is becoming not, opaque, all suggest an abandoned cinema. The empty shell of a cinematic artist imagining his own abandoned corpse.",

Great sets and physical effects. Despite the dark tone of the film, there are some moments of humor. I love the poster.\n\nUnacceptable: Some actors were a little questionable, but thanks to the blurring of reality and LARP life, that never impacted the emotion of the movie. Some reviewers claim that the world of LARPing is inaccurately portrayed. The music could be overbearing at times. I have no idea how Erik managed to speak in his angry viking voice the entire movie without losing his voice.\n\nSummary: This was a very bleak film. I figured it would go down the path it took, but I was surprised at how cohesive the entire movie felt as a whole. There are some excellent performances, especially from the two brothers and the referee, who deserves more praise for her part. This is not a pleasant movie - it&apos;s almost Coen Brothers-esque and you wont leave it with a good feeling, but it is worth watching. An interesting take on the potential violence within us.\n\n4/5"

I&apos;ll start with the plot which isn&apos;t that layered and has all the clichÃ©s you&apos;d expect. Typical opening credits that rip off the Drew Barrymore scene in Scream...then we are introduced the the cannon fodder at the local university. All of them brag and act arrogant, which wasn&apos;t exactly annoying...kind of fun because you know the majority if not all will meet their just desserts.\n\nWell anyways it&apos;s the night of the grad and all these yuppies want to throw a unique party so they get some dude who looks like the older brother in Adventures in Baby Sitting to break into a huge pool/resort type health spa thingy and they of course all get access to the free booze and are all supplied with swim wear. While this is going on some angry bimbo who dumps her one dimensional boring boyfreind gets sliced and diced...for some apparent reason she was walking in the thick of the night in deep forest for no apparent reason...\n\nAfter montages and constant unlikely dialouge of the partying teens the killer has made his presence apparent by slicing some ditzy couple in a water slide scene that was one of the best things in this movie. (Reminded me of the ice stalking scene in &quot;Curtains&quot; and the swimming scene in &quot;The Prowler&quot;) the group all split up and we are in 80ies land as the plot drops everything but a a very uneven pace and a positive body count. A big peeve with this movie is that there was far too many characters, where you stopped even trying to keep track of names. Just wait until each die in brutal and unrelenting glee. Then you find out who the killer is by a boring and pointless sub plot involving some fat cop who gets all these back ground stories from various moronic bland characters.\n\nThe revealing of the killer was dumb and predictable, and he had a very tedious monologue like all those Scream/Urban Legend type killers and his costume was far from interesting or inventive.\n\nThough for its awesome high body count, very visually appealing and stylish directing that set ups all the kills nicely and has a take no prisoners mean spiritedness streak to it, and some tension at certain stalk scenes, it wasn&apos;t a total waste of time.\n\nWhoever was responsible for the soundtrack should wait till there at least 20 before composing and selecting songs for movies. It reeked of cheese and was lamer then the soundtrack of hmm..save the last putrid dance? I give this movie **out of **** You&apos;ll watch it it and most likely just forget about it it shortly afterwards."

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;ll probably hear a lot about how shocking and unrelenting this film is. My first reaction was to call the film &quot;Pink Flamingoes&quot;-esque, but I knew this was wrong, as this movie never shocks for the sake of shock itself. I&apos;ve never seen another Moodysson film (although I will now), but his fury really came through and spoke to me here. He is taking our civilization&apos;s obsessions with seeing everything, with pushing limits, and shoving it in our face, making us hurt for it. That said, there is much beauty here as well, and a pitch black humour that carries viewers through the darkest moments. The protagonist, a teenage boy who spends most of his time in his room with headphones on, attempting to block out the increasingly depraved porno being filmed by his father and friends in the living room of a tiny apartment, tells a couple of stories based around the theme of beauty existing under the most impossible conditions, life flourishing where no one would&apos;ve thought it could, and he is referring both to himself and the moments of grace that Moodysson places throughout the film. He even manages to give a feeling of hope by the end, which stuck with me as I walked down the street, although my stomach gave a serious churn as I walked by an adult video store.",
