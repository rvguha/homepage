It made the cartoon story flow well. Some additions in there such as the rocket bursting out the slime was good fun.\n\nSally Hawkins is a great actor. The narration on Donaldsons books in this format has though become all too serious. The style is a breathless high diction whisper. It&apos;s ok for the narration to reflect that it&apos;s a kids book and not an ultra serious oscar winning documentary. They&apos;re Smeds and Smoos!\n\nOverall enjoyed it, my kids did too. So I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be watching it again ðŸ˜ƒ",

      "reviewBody": "Universal made a great hit with this one due to the way the story is put together. This had to be one of the best &quot;spooky house&quot; films. The use of atmosphere in terms of foggy nights, shadows on the wall, creepy facial expressions (this is why &quot;The Ring&quot; was such a hit), creaky doors, puddles of blood, a skeleton materializing in a room, Bela Lugosi looking mysterious, frogs/crickets coming to a sudden silence, sinister residents of &quot;The Towers&quot; and more, make this one of the best shockers of the 1940s.\n\nEver spook yourself in a darkened room ? (Great fun!) Ever get spooked by inanimate objects in a room based on their shadows on the wall? (I used to have nightmares as a child (about 5 years of age) due to the wood patterns on a dresser that looked like ghoulish figures. My mother told me that I used to run high fevers as a child and this may account for it.) Not being a psychologist, I am not familiar with a lot of the theory underlying why this sort of thing happens, perhaps it is based on subliminal reactions to the unknown, but it is very simple to scare oneself by associating objects,shapes or shadows with some sort of subconscious fear. In any case, this movie does the same thing to an extent by creating an atmosphere of overwhelming dread by tuning to the subconscious anxieties (such as the proverbial &quot;things that go bump in the night&quot; ) which exist in all of us.\n\nI am a great Bela Lugosi fan and even though he plays a red herring butler in this film, through the use of creepy facial expressions, he adds to the nightmare quality of this film. Some fans think he would have been better off in the Angar Singh role (as he played in another great film, &quot;Night of Terror&quot; 1933), but he is fine as the sinister butler this time. Lionel Atwill is also fun to watch. The ladies Fay Helm and Irene Harvey are great eye candy. In the last reel of the film, people are knocked off one by one until the film reaches a ghoulish climax (I won&apos;t give the ending away).\n\nThe film is similar to &quot;Night of Terror&quot; (1933) (one of my B-movie favorites) which is equally creepy and equally fun. The difference is that in &quot;Night Monster&quot;, a supernatural element is added.\n\n10/10.\n\nDan Basinger"

      "reviewBody": "A movie about a professor who notices a mistake in a math exam. The bosses want to cover it up and he refuses to agree to it so they fire him. He returns to South Korean when a new law allows unfairly fired professors to get their job back yet in the trials the judges simply refute him unfairly. So he threatens a judge with a crossbow and this judge is either shot or stabbed himself afterwards. It never becomes clear what really happened as this is a trial with 2 stories.\n\nIt&apos;s about 5 to 6 stars depending on how critical you are. The movie is about a true story so there is some magic to it just because of this yet it doesn&apos;t quite make the most of it. Frankly the worst thing is when he complains to the judge and when he returns to prison they guards put him in a cell with 2 prisoners. One is a very overweight gay guy who is put there to punish the professor. I assume this and many other scenes are fully invented for the movie which is a damn shame. Much of the film becomes melodramatic and overblown and it&apos;s hard to believe about half of the events. A lot of scenes are just melodrama like the whole fake affair thing between the lawyer and a journalist. You never quite get what is happening between them and it feels kinda pointless. Similarly many other characters just kinda appear for some scenes and their storylines are ignored fully.\n\nWe also never really get into the trial. There are 2 point of views, but the defense mostly uses the media to get their case across and largely just shout in court or threaten the judge to get their way. The prosecutors are very seldom seen at all unless they respond to a critical question to make themselves look silly. The whole thing does feel unfair, but on the other hand I doubt any judge would stab himself in the stomach after getting shot with a crossbow. This is a regular judge who supposedly experienced the attack, then went up to his apartment, and according to the defense stabbed himself or had his family, doctors, and cops just lie about having a wound. In both stories he had his family plant the blood on his shirt. It would make sense if this was a criminal of someone who sued the professor for money. But in this case he has basically zero to gain from this lie. Attacking your judge with a crossbow is a big crime in itself even if there is no injury whatsoever. And a regular person wouldn&apos;t think up such an insane plan in minutes for no good reason. Plus there are supposedly tens of people who lied too to make it all seem real. I&apos;m not sure the defense have a case here at all. Rather it seems like the crossbow fired, but didn&apos;t go full speed and so his wound was not that deep. But we never really get anywhere because it&apos;s a shouting match about smaller laws and about what the judge can and can&apos;t do. Obviously the judge will try to defend another judge which makes the case unfair. Yet I&apos;m not fully convinced a ton of professional people covered for the judge and hid evidence just to ... I&apos;m not even sure why they would do it. If it was found out they would get fired and likely go to prison for quite a long time as one of the claims is that the cops threw away the arrow because it went against their case. This would not only get them fired this would basically get the whole police department disbanded. It&apos;s extremely illegal.\n\nYeah, the prosecutors do look silly here. But on the other hand I do feel their case is pretty simple and clear. A judge was shot, that&apos;s it. They don&apos;t really need to do more to make a case. The defense meanwhile needs to present evidence for us to believe their extreme and unlikely story and the only thing they had was a video they made themselves about the crossbow. I&apos;m not really sure what the movie even tries to tell here.",

      "reviewBody": "A few years before this was released, there was &quot;The Longest Day&quot; - a movie version of the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. That was a very good movie with a star-studded cast. I&apos;m guessing that &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; was an attempt to unofficially follow up on that movie. It&apos;s not as star-studded (although there&apos;s a bit of cross over in the cast, most notably Henry Fonda.) Truthfully, though, this movie is nowhere near as good as &quot;The Longest Day.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s supposed to be an account of The Battle of The Bulge, which took place in December of 1944. It was the last significant German offensive of the war, intended to break through the Allied lines and re- capture the port city of Antwerp, Belgium - thus throwing Allied supply lines into chaos. The movie gets some things right. The Germans did, indeed, get troops disguised as American MPs behind the American lines, and they were able to cause confusion and chaos. The Germans were also woefully short of fuel, and had targeted an American supply depot which would have given them access to a huge amount of gasoline for their tanks. The famous demand for the surrender of Bastogne, and the reply of the commanding American general to that demand - &quot;NUTS!&quot; - is accurate. But there are also a lot of problems with the historical accuracy of the film. First is that all of the characters are just that - characters. Composites, perhaps, but there&apos;s no portrayal of anyone who actually fought in the battle. There&apos;s also no mention at all of General George Patton&apos;s 3rd Army dramatically saving the besieged Americans at Bastogne. That&apos;s one of the better known incidents of the Battle of the Bulge, and why you wouldn&apos;t even mention it is beyond me. Many, of course, note the problem that the tanks used in the movie were of a much later vintage, and were&apos;t an accurate representation of the tanks that would have been used.\n\nAt best, I&apos;d say that this movie was OK. Terrible if you&apos;re thinking that you&apos;re learning much history from it, but OK as a movie that&apos;s somewhat dramatic, and I thought it was a reasonable portrayal of the ugliness of war - the Malmedy massacre (the cold blooded murders of Americans who had been taken prisoner by German SS troops) was portrayed, for example. \n\nI&apos;d definitely say that if I were going to watch either again, I&apos;d take in &quot;The Longest Day.&quot; It&apos;s the better movie. This one gets a 5/10 from me.",

      "reviewBody": "China Girl (1987) was an urban take on the classic Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet (courtesy of Nicholas St. John). The film was directed by the gritty street level film maker Abel Ferrara. Instead of the Capulets and the Montaques, this version involves two crime families (the Italian Mafia and Chinese Triads). Not only is this film about true love but it&apos;s about honor and old school loyalty. Instead of trying to follow the source material verbatim, Ferrara re-invents the classic tale.\n\nI happen to be a big fan of Abel Ferrara. His style of film making is very unique and it&apos;s greatly missed in Hollywood. We need more directors like him. Someone who not only can make a movie on the cheap but produce a well thought-out film that&apos;ll force you to think and look outside the box.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "REVIEW - MIA AND THE WHITE LION\n\nOccasionally while watching all of the films I find a gem, a film that stands out and as an impartial independent reviewer I can write without influence.\n\nThis is one such film, whilst the acting could be better and the editing is terrible the subject matter and of course the white lion truly make this a film too watch.\n\nSimple story but what I absolutely loved about this film is the time it took to make, it must have been filmed over a period of about 4 years because you literally see the same lion grow from a lion cub to maturity and the children grow also!\n\nOf course the actual white lion steals every scene Charlie is in and the actors were in my personal opinion very very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with such a beautiful creature.\n\nEasy to follow but with a very important message to share about tourism and hunting.\n\nOne to watch but as I&apos;ve said acting isn&apos;t the best and the editing is terrible but on this occasion I can forgive.\n\nRating 8 out of 10",

But two decades later things have changed...Kristel is grandma and other movies are so much more erotic that this sixth sequel is one of the most useless movies ever. The story : urrrmmm...Emmanuelle has been kidnapped and was sold as slave and through this trauma she forgot who she really was. VoilÃ , that&apos;s it and you can&apos;t add nothing more to that.... The actors : Nathalie Uher (Emmanuelle) is a beautiful woman but I really shouldn&apos;t come up with something else. The acting is at its baddest (the cast of Neighbours are all Robert De Niro&apos;s if you compare it with this disaster). Forget all those idiots who like it so much because it&apos;s bad. A B-movie??? My ass... And the erotic scenes? Phew, just watch the newest commercial from Fa and you see lots more. If all movies would have been like this, I am sure I would never watch it at any second. Why have I watched it then? Because of the thrill to slash it down...Nothing can be more crap than this!!!",

Soon after lights out screams are heard and Myles and the rest of the cell block find themselves in deadly danger \n\nYou can see what INSIDE is trying to do . It&apos;s a minimalist horror thriller with a very small cast . Some congratulations should be in order because it&apos;s always nice to see a low budget movie trying to scare the audience and at the same time not having to rely on gore to appeal to the lowest common denominator . On this level the film is moderately effective \n\nThe downside is however that if you&apos;re trying to make a try classic in this genre then the screenplay should be perfect . It is some what clichÃ©d but that&apos;s not the fundamental problem . The problem is that there&apos;s some very obvious plot holes that&apos;ll have you saying to yourself &quot; Why didn&apos;t so and so do such and such a thing because if that was me I would have done the sensible thing and ... &quot; Well you get the idea ? In other words the screenplay needed a bit more development to set it apart from its peers . That said I didn&apos;t bother reading the opening credits and wasn&apos;t until I came to this page and found out the protagonist is played by pretty boy Bros member Luke Goss who despite being the front man of a very untalented manufactured British pop band from the late 1980s did manage to convince me he was an American actor playing an American character",

      "reviewBody": "A new &quot;odd couple&quot; is born with a new spy-film twist.\n\nMichael Douglas is Stephen Tobias, a rugged deep-cover CIA agent, who focuses more on his work that his life with his son, Mark (Ryan Reynolds) or his now ex-wife, Judy (Candice Bergen).\n\nIt turns out that Mark is about to get married to beautiful Melissa (Lindsay Sloane) but has yet to meet Mark&apos;s parents. Mark assures her that is a good thing. But Melissa&apos;s parents, Jerry (Albert Brooks) and Katherine (Maria Ricossa) insist on meeting at least Mark&apos;s father.\n\nDuring the first meeting between Mark&apos;s father and Melissa&apos;s parents, mild-mannered foot-doctor Jerry stumbles in on one of Stephen&apos;s spy plans and finds himself swept up in Stephen&apos;s mess on the eve of his daughter&apos;s nuptials. How will this revelation effect the up-coming marriage and will the two fathers live long enough to get back to the wedding?\n\n&quot;The In-Laws&quot; is one of the biggest surprises I have seen this year. I never thought in a million years that this film would be as funny as it is. The odd pairing of Brooks and Douglas pays off tenfold. Their odd pairing and hilarious antics made me think some of the classic film, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The film also reminded me a little of the 80s comedy, &quot;Real Men&quot; because of its off-beat way of bringing the audience into the story.\n\nBrooks hasn&apos;t been this funny in years. His neurotic schtick, which is probably more famous when played by Woody Allen, gives his character such innocence. There were so many priceless moments involving Brooks and how he relates to the spy-world.\n\nDouglas seems to have journeyed back to his Jack Colton character, which he played in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. There is definitely some of Colton in Tobias. You can really see it when Douglas allows Tobias to put his guard down. That was always the funniest part of Colton and it is the same for Tobias.\n\nAnother great thing about this film is the caliber of people who are in the cast. You have some great upcoming comedy actors like Reynolds and Sloane and on the other side veterans like Bergen and Brooks. I wanted to see more of Reynolds since he is such a great comedic find. I have high expectations for that guy. I also really enjoyed Sloane when she was in the short-lived WB series, &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot;. I so miss that series. She to has a great potential to be more if given the chance in comedy.\n\nThis film knows where its strengths are and it continues the laughs over and over. I just wish we could have had more time with the supporting cast.\n\nThe film also has some interesting uses of music in its soundtrack. For instance the opening scenes involving Michael Douglas escaping from one of his spy missions involves a great car chase and a gun battle but the whole scene&apos;s overture is accented by Paul McCartney&apos;s infamous James Bond theme, &quot;Live &amp; Let Die&quot;. It is a great addition as it seems to help build the spy feeling of the scene. Throughout the film there are interesting musical additions, which help put interesting slants and accents on the various scenes.\n\n&quot;The In-Laws&quot; was such a surprise and is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year, thus far. (4 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1831, in Edinburgh, the prominent doctor and professor Dr. Wolfe &apos;Toddy&apos; MacFarlane (Henry Daniell) buys corpses for his studies and classes of anatomy from the notorious cabman John Gray (Boris Karloff), who is also a body snatcher. When his talented student Donald Fettes (Russell Wade) tells that he will quit medical school since his family cannot afford to support him, MacFarlane hires him as his assistant to permit Fettes to proceed his studies. Fettes meets a little girl that cannot walk anymore due to a coach accident, and he tries to convince Dr. MacFarlane to operate her but the doctor is reluctant. Soon Fettes discovers that Dr. MacFarlane has a secret from his past and Gray blackmails him. When Fettes learns how Gray obtains the corpses for Dr. MacFarlane, he has an inner conflict and does not want to continue as Dr. MacFarlane&apos;s protÃ©gÃ©e. But isn&apos;t it too late?\n\n&quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; is a dark and gloomy horror tale with a creepy story about ethic in medicine, or how far a doctor should go in his researches. Boris Karloff has a magnificent performance, maybe the best I have ever seen of this actor. The direction of Robert Wise is sharp and the cinematography in black and white is impressive. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O TÃºmulo Vazio&quot; (&quot;The Empty Grave&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Called the first British science-fiction film, this is more precisely a fantasy inspired by &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with the moral guidance coming not in a dream but from Mars. It stars Charles Hawtrey, at 56 far too old for the role of a selfish young man, Horace, a part he first played on stage in 1899. Although this play has been considerably opened out, with scenes on Mars and in the streets of London (including Trafalgar Square), it still offers rare insight into the way a drama would have been staged more than a hundred years ago. Hawtrey was regarded as one of the first of the naturalistic actors and yet he still uses what would now be called stock gestures. He rubs his hands with glee about four times in succession. The supporting cast is even more melodramatic. The film is also of interest because of its relative sophistication. Although the camera is static, there are several special effects, the most notable (and contemporary) being the process used to suggest that Horace has been &quot;zapped&quot; by the Martian. The budget also allowed for a burning building, not common in 1913. The version under review was restored by the BFI in 2014. It&apos;s tinted and so the tech specs should reflect that, officially, the film is now in colour. (The night scenes, tinted blue, are disorienting because the shoot was clearly done in bright sunlight). The new electronic score, commissioned from Matthew Herbert, suggests other-worldliness but doesn&apos;t aid the ballroom scenes. The print, available online and on TV, is around 60 not 69 minutes. It&apos;s not clear whether the reviewer who posted here in 2002 somehow saw a longer version; but for the record this is how the new version differs from his. We don&apos;t know that Horace is an astronomer, he doesn&apos;t read a magazine article about intelligent life on Mars, and he doesn&apos;t go to sleep in his study. He is only shown in his living room and the opening scenes and inter-titles imply that what follows is not a dream. The Martian does not wear &quot;tight-fitting black clothes&quot; and he is shown arriving outside Horace&apos;s house. There is no indication that the tramp is &quot;an inventor who was cheated out of the fruits of his labour&quot;. He too merely turns up at Horace&apos;s house seeking work. There are no scenes in which Horace is allowed to eavesdrop on his friends&apos; conversations nor those in which Horace&apos;s fortune is lost. The film is also valuable in that it shows that it was once common to tip policemen. Postscript 2018: The other review I refer to above is by the notorious F Gwynplaine Macintyre. By the time I reviewed &quot;A Message from Mars&quot; he had been dead for 5 years. Many will know that, after his death, it was revealed that he made a habit of pretending to have seen very old films, many of them presumed lost. I think we can safely say that he did not see a longer version of this film.",

      "reviewBody": "I am 51, single, and a black woman. I have seen this movie twice, once with my youngest single sister and the second time with another younger single sister. I paid full price each time and will see it for a third time with a married girlfriend. I like the subject matter and say it is about time, not just for the subject, but also that it did not portray us black sisters in a derogatory light. We can be more than hookers and gangsters and maids on the big screen. My sisters and I identify with Kenya and unfortunately, we are all in that percentage class of the unmarrieds.\n\nIt reminds me of the classic &quot;Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner&quot;. I loved that movie too. It broke barriers. There are more relationships going on like this than we care to admit. My sisters and I would date a white man in a minute, if it was meant to be. Race isn&apos;t a preference. If we could each find one good man, he could be green and we would date him.\n\nAt the second showing, some in the audience clapped at the end, and we lingered for sometime afterwards and read all the credits. We really liked it and so much of it was true. The soundtrack is beautiful. I can&apos;t wait for the DVD and the CD soundtrack to be released. I fell &quot;in love&quot; with this movie. Love is more than color. The only thing that would have made me more love sick is if Brian was played by the hot and cute flavor of the day Matthew McConaughey!! I said it, yes I did!\n\nAdditional comment: Okay, I saw this movie for the third time and paid full price cause I loved it. It saddens me that this movie is not getting the PR it deserves. It&apos;s a hot topic, especially since it deals with us being seriously involved with a white man. The brothers have been doing this for years, yes years! Sisters, I say allow yourself to flip the script.",

As a resurrected witch who was burned to death at a small medieval town seeks revenge on her pursuers . That&apos;s why two hundred years after , they are accidentally brought to life , being resurrected at a crypt by two doctors played by Andrea Checchi and John Richardson . In vengeance , Asa goes after her descendants , including her lookalike , Katia : Barbara Steele, playing a dual role .\n\nGreat fun late at night , it is full of thrills , chills , surprises and creepy atmosphere . Based on a story by Nikolay Gogol , in fact Bava also adapted other Russian writers on the anthology horror movie : Black Sabbath in the episode Wurdalak with Boris Karloff . It contains exquisitely realised expressionit frames of sexual suggestion and cruelty that shocked spectators in the early Sixties. Gorgeous , brilliant and foggy cinematography in black and white by Mario Bava himself and assisted by Ubaldo Terzano. The cinematographic visual style still impresses and it retains its original power . Adding a thrilling and mysterious musical score by Les Baxter , Roger Corman&apos;s regular .\n\nThis astonishing motion picture titled Black Sunday or The Demon&apos;s Mask , House of Fright , Revenge of the Vampire or Mask of Satan was competently directed by horror maestro Mario Bava . He was a prestigious cameraman who turned into a notorious filmmaker, directing all kinds of genres with penchant for the terror, such as : Blood and black lace , Black Sabbath , Hatchet for the Honeymoon , House of Exorcism , Planet of of the Vampires , The Girl who knew too much, Torture Chamber of Baron Blood , Beyond the Door II . A must watch for terror fans , first important film with Steele as star and Mario Bava as director. Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . The picture will appeal to horror aficionados and Mario Bava/Barbara Steele enthusiasts . Essentian and indispensable seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "What is it with me and these cheapo 80&apos;s movies that all revolve around the apocalypse? I seem to pick up another one every time I venture out to the market these days. Was Mad Max really that inspirational? Or is it a case of lazy screenwriters not being able to impose their vision on any other scenario than the end of the world? In any case, I&apos;m glad that 20 years on.. the genre is more or less absent from today&apos;s culture, so let&apos;s try to keep it that way, shall we? A remake of this or similarly themed films is something I definitely could not handle..\n\nIn this telling of the age-old tale, we have a bunch of survivors slowly trudging through the wasteland, barely scraping by on food and water. They each have their own specific label (A smart old guy, a cool dude with shades and a leader covered in body hair to show how manly he is) but mostly they are your usual stereotypical rabble of rednecks. They run into a bit of trouble when they are constantly under attack by a tribe of pygmies who seem to have the ability to rejuvenate whenever they are killed. After being captured by these little men, they find themselves as prisoners of a 175 year old princess and her duplicitous head priest. Fortunately, their jail is a treehouse village paradise populated by gorgeous amazon-like women who see them as future fathers of their children. Not surprisingly, they want to stay now. But is there a darker side to this utopia? What do you think?\n\nI&apos;m still suppressing the giggles from watching this video. Gun battles where people throw themselves in front of bullets, slow-motion fight scenes where people very obviously never make any contact, the hideous, repeatedly used special effect where light beams come out of someone&apos;s eyes (has to be seen to be believed), the customary fat girl used as comic relief because she can&apos;t get any action, the wobbling set that looks like it was assembled from old pantomime props.. I could go on. At least it is never a chore to sit through, there is always something unintentionally hilarious round the corner just when things seem to be getting dull. This doesn&apos;t mean it gets a good rating, but at least it would be a great choice for a MST3K night when you&apos;ve had a few with your mates. I recommend it on that level alone. Filled with all the softcore nudity and cheesy dialogue you&apos;d expect just by looking at the title, this &apos;not quite good enough to be a B movie&apos; gets 2 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Even with Ruby Keeler&apos;s tinny voice and the fact she doesn&apos;t dance a step, Flirtation Walk is an utterly charming musical from the Thirties with Dick Powell at the height of his lyric tenor period.\n\nWest Point&apos;s image has done very well by Hollywood. The West Point Story and The Long Gray Line are the other two big films about the U.S. Military Academy on the Hudson. But this was the first film of a grand tradition.\n\nDick Powell is an army private stationed out in Hawaii who&apos;s assigned by his sergeant Pat O&apos;Brien to be a driver for Ruby Keeler, daughter of General Henry O&apos;Neill. She&apos;s got a boyfriend in her Dad&apos;s aide John Eldredge. But on a moonlight night in Hawaii, the old boy/girl thing happens.\n\nPowell receives a rude awakening the next day when he&apos;s made to realize the difference in class between officers and enlisted men. Something like the rude awakening John Agar got in Fort Apache when he was courting Shirley Temple even though he was an officer, albeit a newly minted one from an enlisted man&apos;s family. So Powell decided he&apos;s going to become an officer and sets about applying for West Point.\n\nThe next half of the film is set in West Point and in Powell&apos;s final year, Henry O&apos;Neill becomes the Academy Superintendent bring of course Keeler and Eldredge come with him. Here we have the same plot device that was later used in The West Point Story, breaking precedent in having a woman in the Hundred Nights show for the graduating class. Who do you think the woman that the cadets want?\n\nAllie Wrubel and Mort Dixon wrote two nice numbers that are used in the musical show, Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name and Flirtation Walk. Powell sings them well although he didn&apos;t need Ruby&apos;s thin voice doing the reprise. During the Hawaiian portion of the film Powell sang Aloha Oe. Why Ruby wasn&apos;t given any dance numbers is beyond me since that was her strength as a performer.\n\nI should also mention Ross Alexander, who came to a tragic early end three years later, as Powell&apos;s roommate at the Point. He was a funny guy and had a nice career going in playing best friends to the hero in film. A sad waste.\n\nI think you&apos;ll like the characters created and directed by Frank Borzage in this very charming film.",

The hopped up hoods fretful flight to the Stateline Motel is propelled by robust filmmaking, and a booty-boppin&apos; deluge of righteously funky &apos;action-riffs&apos; from the funk-master general of B-Movie cool, Luis Bacalov! While much of the amusingly pulpy narrative feels overly familiar, its reliance on all the bellicose, bullet-blasted poliziotteschi clichÃ©s works to its advantage.&apos;Stateline Motel&apos; is well worth a visit, the decor&apos;s a bit dingy, but who cares about the skeevey upholstery when you can eyeball dazzling screen sirens, Barbara Bach &amp; Ursula Andress?",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Hairspray&apos; is perhaps one of the most spirited energetic musicals of recent time. Right from the beginning till the end, it&apos;s all energy. There is not one boring moment. Actually there is no time to be bored. Shankman does the admirable task of directing the film AND choreographing the dances. The film&apos;s also a treat to watch. It&apos;s very colourful and reminds one of the 60&apos;s glamour. The songs are of the foot-tapping and head nodding sort (pretty much any upbeat song of the 60&apos;s has this kind of effect on me).\n\nThe cast is splendid. The actors do the multiple task of acting, singing and dancing. It&apos;s quite obvious that Travolta&apos;s Edna is played by a man but his acting isn&apos;t bad. He manages to emote well and his dance number with Christopher Walken is hilarious. He does get into the skin of the character if not entirely the gender. Walken excellently plays the loving kind-hearted, slightly naive, father. Here one will see a different Christopher Walken. This is Michelle Pfeiffer&apos;s second negative role this year (the other being her character in &apos;Stardust&apos;). The role was originally played by the famous Deborah Harry and it&apos;s noticeable how they eerily look alike. Pfeiffer both looks and acts the part of a skinny manipulative obnoxious bitch, making it her own. A lesser actress could have easily messed up the part. James Marsden is spot on as the host of a 60&apos;s musical show. He keeps proving his versatility. Amanda Bynes is adorable as the daft and supportive Penny. Allison Janney is a fantastic scene stealer. Jerry Stiller, who played Wilbur in the 1988 version, makes his presence felt with just one scene. It&apos;s hard to picture anyone other than the divine Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle. Elijah Kelley dances well and Zac Efron&apos;s acting is wooden but his dances are okay. However, the &apos;Hairspray&apos; rests on newcomer Nikki Blonsky. Not only does she hold her own among a host of incredibly talented actors, she bravely carries the film.\n\nNext to being a wonderfully entertaining film, &apos;Hairspray&apos; also brings forth some issues such as acceptance, tolerance and integration of people no matter their gender, race or sexuality. This is what the film is essentially about and it is brilliantly interwoven into this musical extravaganza. I wasn&apos;t expecting much from the film but right from the opening sequence it absorbed my attention and I was completely into the energy of the film, forgetting everything else around me during its 2 hours. A great experience."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Death Race 2000&quot; is a low budget genre melting pot from 1975 starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone as two of five feuding race car drivers competing in a futuristic sport that is won based on racking up points from killing pedestrians and others. Based on a 1956 short story, it&apos;s a highly satiric sci-fi actioner that uses ironic and downright sadistic touches to examine America&apos;s abhorrent fascination with violence.\n\nThe ridiculously contrived and outlandish futuristic setting was put into heavy rotation during the mid-70&apos;s in several other films (&quot;Westworld&quot;; &quot;Soylent Green&quot;; &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot;) as a means to tell downbeat and cynical stories that allowed the audience to escape their own reality, but still experience a certain catharsis.\n\nIn the case of &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; the results are a mixed bag, as the over the top material races from dark comedy to &quot;Sleeper&quot;-like sci-fi to undercooked romance and back again. It works because of the tongue-in-cheek direction of Paul Bartel, who would go on to helm the brilliant dark comedy &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;. The whole thing is great fun, and has a surprising innocence underneath all of the mostly cartoonish violence.\n\nThis said, the main gripe would have to be the inconsistent pacing, as the race and the story took breaks between laps, which leaves the viewer peeking at their watch.",

      "reviewBody": "(Spoilers) Redicules and bumbling film that wouldn&apos;t even be good, or bad, enough to make the famous Bad Movie TV show &quot;Mystery Sicence Theater 3000&quot;. The movie is about this rock group the Take Ten, even though there&apos;s only five members in it, who&apos;s suddenly out it&apos;s lead singer Gordo, Greg Chipes, and is desperately looking for a replacement. \n\nYou see Gordo found out who the members of the group really are and tried to make a run for it from the groups island, Compus, where they were all staying at. Captured on the beach Gordo tells the group members that he&apos;s going to spill the beans on them, to the National Enquire. Only to get spilled into the ocean by them never to be seen again.\n\nComing up with this cock &amp; bull story that Gordo was a drug addict and was sent by the group to some secret rehabilitation clinic they through their manager Alex, Adrienne Barbeau, conduct a nation wide search for Gordo&apos;s replacement. Narrowing the competition for Gordo&apos;s job down to three lucky guys Max Jonah &amp; Shawn, Eric Dearborn Jeff Paterson &amp; Coltin Scott,their flown to Compus for what would be a battle for the lead singers contest to see who&apos;s the one to finally replace Gordo. \n\nAt the island strange things begin to happen in that Jonah turns out to be an undercover reporter working for a supermarket tabloid magazine, The National Enquire?. He&apos;s soon discovered by the group members only to be iced and never seen or heard from again. Max who would give his right arm to make the group &quot;Take Ten&quot; ends up giving up a lot more, his life. When they feel he&apos;s not cut out to be with them and do a little bit of cutting up of Max on their own. \n\nShawn who&apos;s at the island with his girlfriend Stacy, Ryan Starr, isn&apos;t really interested in becoming a group member, It&apos;s all Stacy&apos;s idea. He tries to leave the island only to be captured by the Take Ten and their manager Alex, who seems to have the hots for him,and. He&apos;s then put through this really weird ritual at a secret cave by the beach where Shawn as well as all the group members, striped down to his boxer shorts as the group preforms some kind of Satanic rites or ceremony on him. Shawn is at last rescued by his girlfriend Stacy who comes to his aid with a cross-bow. Later Shawn unties himself and takes what looks like a bunch of voodoo dolls and throws them into the fire, that the group set for their ceremony, causing them as well as the group members to burn to a crisp. \n\nThe movie tries to give us a surprise ending which is about as effective as the rest of the story that preceded it: it&apos;s totally unbelievable. Were given this BS story about the group being around since the mid 1950&apos;s changing their name every five years or so. The rock &amp; Roll group kept hitting the top Billboard Charts with hit after hit for the last fifty years starting with the 1954 Rock &amp; Roll band Bobby Coolly and the Sea Sharks. \n\nAs for the Busty Adrienne Barbeau who played Alex, the Take Ten&apos;s manager, looked like she was either out in the sun too long or went the distance in the boxing ring with &quot;Iron Mike&quot; Tyson.",

      "reviewBody": "I use the word &quot;normal&quot; to mean &quot;real world normal&quot;, meaning NOT perfect. These people have issues, they don&apos;t know necessarily what they&apos;re doing with their lives, they are on medication, the film begins with a suicide attempt. And yes, in the real world this is certainly more normal than chasing through an airport to a swelling symphonic soundtrack and declaring a perfectly rehearsed monologue to the person you love, followed by rapturous applause from everyone at the gate. &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, while lacking in the sort of clichÃ©s and melodrama that makes theatergoers all starry-eyed, delivers one of the best love stories I&apos;ve seen on the big screen.\n\nDon&apos;t be fooled by the title; this is not a steamy tale of infidelity and illicit passion. It&apos;s about a person who is faced with a mostly theoretical choice between 2 lovers. We&apos;ve all been there. Whether you&apos;re married, in a new relationship, playing the field or just dreaming &quot;what if&quot;, in matters of the heart there&apos;s the sure thing, and then there&apos;s the crazy impulsive route.\n\nJonquin Phoenix plays &quot;Leonard&quot;, a man whose life recently underwent an upheaval and who simultaneously meets 2 women: &quot;Sandra&quot; who is the sure thing (Vinessa Shaw) and &quot;Michelle&quot; who is the crazy route (Gwynneth Paltrow). As the relationships slowly develop (very slowly, at a real world pace), we start to see the conflict not in terms of passion &amp; romance but in terms of life choices.\n\nRefreshingly, Leonard is a character who knows what he wants from the beginning, so the audience isn&apos;t insulted with annoying &quot;what should I do&quot; scenes. Rather, Michelle is the one who represents the unknown, speculative bet in Leonard&apos;s world. As the story progresses, all of Leonard&apos;s actions are consistent with his feelings, and it&apos;s just a matter of seeing how things will play out. Again, this is such a great, unusual, non-Hollywood approach to love stories which, if you really analyze your own experiences, is probably much more in line with the way you handle yourself.\n\nDespite this stability of the main character, the story remains unpredictable right up to the final minute. No sappy airport chase scenes here, but I guarantee you&apos;ll be riveted in the final act. If you want to see a story that you can apply to your own love life, regardless of your situation, check this out for some deep insight.",

      "reviewBody": "Good movie about a singer whose popularity serves for societal manipulation. The rather timid rock star is part of an effort to control English youth by coercing them into accepting the government line, which is subtly expressed in his lyrics and behavior. The concept of using rock for social control is a bit dated, but try reworking it in the context of modern consumerism: Huge corporations and their musician-sponsors.  Why, Madonna and Michael Jackson would never\n\nallow their artistic talents to be used to get people to buy Pepsi, right?  The Beatles &quot;Revolution&quot; in a Nike ad is out of the question, true? Janis Joplin&apos;s estate wouldn&apos;t allow Mercedes-Benz to feature her tune about the car,\n\ncorrect? We aren&apos;t being manipulated by that old time rock and roll, are we? Not even to buy &quot;Like A Rock&quot; Chevy trucks?  Paranoid enough?  Then you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;Privilege&quot;.",

Yes, the script is sometimes silly and awkward, but you can feel that the comedians were having a good time on the set. Some gags are really good and nobody acts too seriously. The humor is not always very subtle, but the film is just an unpretious pretext for a good time.\n\nThis movie is criminaly underrated. It&apos;s good clean fun. Not a masterpiece, for sure, but not the dud some have said.\n\nIf you wanna laugh without having to think too much, try Safari.\n\nYou may have a good surprise.",

It is an exquisite film in all senses: the story, acting, visuals, and sound. The kid is superb. Well, it deserves a Golden Bear in Berlinale. I organized a special screening of the film for some European film professionals in Istanbul. Everybody was quite impressed by the masterful naivite and simplicity. The film skilfully manages to portray the kid&apos;s world and perspective. There are strong symbolic references waiting the viewers to decipher. The best thing to do is to watch the film. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll not regret it. Just some questions: lets all of us just think why the bees are dying. What kind of a relation do we have with the nature that we cause the bees to die? What is missing? Honey: a sweet thing which is a natural product of the bees. If the bees all die, where shall we find the honey? BAL poses a calm question to our modern civilization, to our modern selves."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Porcile&quot; is fine if you have the patience and the will to endure its lost and bizarre images or its strange deviate messages. Reactions about it will be mixed, rarely reaching some certainty, but the one that&apos;s definitely is that this is one of weakest films ever directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. It&apos;s too pretentious, looks like his own version of Godard&apos;s &quot;Week End&quot; but less brutal, less gross yet more confusing in its speech. Both films deal with world going to its ending, total destruction all around and all hope lost, and Socialism seems to be the good alternative for our better sake. The directors of both films mixed their political speech in the middle of the controversial and shocking images.\n\nTwo stories form the whole: 1) one young man (Pierre Clementi) who has killed his parents and ate their flesh walks around from village to village after being sentenced to perish in the vast desert. The only thing he&apos;ll be able to do is to kill whoever show up on his way and then eat them too. That&apos;s the story of the young cannibal, marvelously presented without words (he only has one spoken line repeated towards the ending). Beautiful cinematography, scary and thrilling sequences in it. 2) this story, very talky and quite messy brings Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud (who was also in &quot;Week End&quot;) as the son of an German industrialist who can&apos;t connect with people, preferring the company of the pigs (&quot;Porcile&quot; translates to &quot;Pigsty&quot;). He tries some involvement with a girl (Anne Wiazemsky) but with no luck. And there&apos;s his father (Alberto Lionello) business deals with a former Nazi of name Herdhitze (Ugo Tognazzi) also businessman but a rival of his, who hasn&apos;t aged through the war years after successful plastic surgeries. Foggy speeches about life, politics, mankind are dissolved into this other story and it&apos;s very hard to form a whole idea. \n\nThey&apos;re apart in time but what they have in common? World going to an end, the destruction and corruption of societies, with everything out of control. Those are recurring themes in Pasolini works (&quot;Teorema&quot;, &quot;SalÃ²&quot; just to quote a few) but in here there isn&apos;t much going on to make them feel useful for all of us. This is a case that might look better in a book/screenplay/written work than filmed. The experience is distractive, confusing, rarely captivating even with the two known main stars, who had their voices strangely dubbed in Italian (I have my doubts about Pierre, I believe he really learned his lines in the other language). I like the film even though I can&apos;t connect with much of what&apos;s shown in it. The cannibal story is interesting; the one about the industrialist&apos;s son isn&apos;t all that much. The final result is chaos. Chaos in this problematic world that doesn&apos;t seem to get better. Well, at least in those predictions the master wasn&apos;t all that wrong. \n\nEnjoyable but unsustainable for more than one view. 6/10",

It seems that the masked hero can repair damaged cells at an accelerated rate. Because they don&apos;t have a chance of taking him through force, they kidnap his girlf. The rest of the movie is spent either in the sheriff&apos;s office or Frankenstein&apos;s lair.\n\nIt is not as campy as the other Santo films that I&apos;ve seen; moreover, there are some accelerated aging sequences that might disturb younger viewers. It wasn&apos;t bad, though.\n\nMaybe I just have a weakness for mad scientists in short skirts and go-go boots...",

      "reviewBody": "Thoughtful and thought-provoking war-drama based on the memoirs of N.Y. Times correspondent named Sidney (Sam Waterston) and his relationship to journalist assistant and guide named Pran (Haing S Ngor ) . Extraordinary feature debut for Ngor who won Best Supporting Actor Academy Award . Haing S. Ngor a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the deeds depicted at the movie , he became the first Southeast Asian , and the first Buddhist , to win an Oscar ; furthermore also first film for John Malkovich who gives an awesome portrayal as an intrepid photographer . Ngor&apos;s own experiences (in real life he lived Cambodian war ) echoed those of his character and usually played Vietnam roles (Tortures of war, Heaven and Earth , In love and war , Vietnam Texas , Eastern condor) until his violent death by an Asian band . This exciting story depicts the war chaos , Cambodian turmoil and primal bloodletting , but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth . Marvellous cinematography by Chris Menges who also deservedly won Academy Award and filmed in Phuket , Railway Hotel , Hua Hin, Thailand and Royal York Hotel , Toronto, Ontario, Canada . Screeching and sensitive musical score by Mike Oldfield that accompanies perfectly to the film . Roland Joffe&apos;s direction shows a generally sure-hand with a bit of melodrama at the end . Alain Resnais&apos;s seminal documentary Â¨Nuit et Brouillard (1955)Â¨ was a touch-point for both director Roland JoffÃ© and prestigious producer David Puttnam when they were preparing this magnificent movie .\n\nThis excellent movie contains a relentless criticism to Pol Pot regime , but also US and an exact description about historic events . In power , the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence, closing schools, hospitals and factories, abolishing banking, finance and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all private property and relocating people from urban areas to collective farms where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn Cambodians into &quot;Old People&quot; through agricultural labor. These actions resulted in massive deaths through executions, work exhaustion, illness, and starvation. In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about &quot;two or three kilometers&quot; outside the city and would return in &quot;two or three days.&quot; Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the &quot;threat of American bombing&quot; and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would &quot;take care of everything&quot; until they returned.Money was abolished, books were burned, teachers, merchants, and almost the entire intellectual elite of the country were murdered, to make the agricultural communism, as Pol Pot envisioned it, a reality. The planned relocation to the countryside resulted in the complete halt of almost all economic activity: even schools and hospitals were closed, as well as banks, and industrial and service companies.During their four years in power, the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population, at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state (including intellectuals or even those that had stereotypical signs of learning, such as glasses) and killing many others for even breaching minor rules . The Khmer Rouge forced people to work for 12 hours non-stop, without adequate rest or food. They did not believe in western medicine but instead favoured traditional peasant medicine; many died as a result. Family relationships not sanctioned by the state were also banned, and family members could be put to death for communicating with each other. In any case, family members were often relocated to different parts of the country with all postal and telephone services abolished. They committed crimes against humanity , the Khmer Rouge government arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed &quot;enemies&quot;. Today, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as &quot;Comrade Duch&quot;. Some 17,000 people passed through this centre before they were taken to sites (also known as The Killing Fields), outside Phnom Penh where most were executed (mainly by pickaxes to save bullets) and buried in mass graves . Of the thousands who entered the Tuol Sleng Centre (also known as S-21), only twelve are known to have survived.",

Do the producers really believe this burlesque. Or maybe they&apos;re shilling for the liquor lobby then regaining its post-Prohibition popularity, or maybe the plastics lobby worried about the manufacturing possibilities of hemp oil. \n\nIn a way, it&apos;s too bad the movie comes across now as a joke. Pot may not be the Devil&apos;s brew, but it does dull awareness, and in that sense remains a risk. So hyping the effects has had a reverse effect that also needs to be considered. Nonetheless, the movie&apos;s smug authorities from school principal to courtroom judge to official narrator are enough to get me to light up and puff away. Plus they&apos;re not even good for a laugh."

      "reviewBody": "The version watched was the U.S. abortion which ran 54&quot; out of the originals release of 105&quot;. Which was truncated down from 180&quot;+ so a-lot of the film has gone missing. What is left is barely comprehensible since almost all of the original dialog is gone as well as any character development and sub-plots.\n\nLA FIN Du MONDE (1931) THE END OF THE WORLD was Abel Gance&apos;s first sound feature. It is based on the 1894 Novel &apos;OMEGA: The Last Days of the World&apos; by Camille Flammarion. The plot is how will Humanity react when informed that the Planet is going to be hit by a Comet in 114 Days. What follows is first disbelief, acceptance of the inevitable and how different facets of society react to the coming DOOM!\n\nThe Scientists led by Martial Novalic (Victor Francen) plan a rebirth of the World (if anybody survives) in their idealized vision of the UNIVERSAL REPUBLIC. Which appears to be a sort of Neo-Fascist governing body like &apos;Wings Over The World&apos; in THINGS TO COME (1936). Most people run around in a montage of scenes like their heads were about to be chopped off. Some continue business as usual, literally, others decide the best way to check out is in a orgy of &apos;Booze &amp; Sex&apos; or religious resignation. The merits of each choice are left up to the viewer to decide. Somewhere in this mess is Jean Novalic (Abel Gance) Martial&apos;s Brother, for the most part he appears to have ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nIt is a close run thing and the Comet passes through the Earths atmosphere missing the Planet but causing great damage in it&apos;s wake. The SFX scenes are poorly done even by early 1930&apos;s standards. What happens next is up to the viewers imagination for the film abruptly ends there. Gance&apos;s backers had run out of both faith and money, seized the film, trimming it with a meat Axe, which U.S. distributor Harold Auten (1934) added his incompetence.\n\nThe concept of the film was bold and very original for it&apos;s time though it is hard to tell how well it was executed from this version. Their knowledge of Comets was lacking compared to 21st Century sensibilities. There is certainly a political message here, though any time I hear/see the words UNIVERSAL REPUBLIC, I get nervous. Gance&apos;s version being a combination of the less savory aspects of Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Republic(s). Another Director/Producer saw some merits in this film, Cecil B. DeMille (C.B.) who was also considering WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE (1933) by Balmer &amp; Wylie for filming. That may have been a not a bad idea. C.B. would have jettisoned the political baggage concentrated on the human story and the SFX scenes and made another commercial success.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1989 after a Cannes Film Festival Market screening.\n\n&quot;Fortress of Amerikkka&quot;, a/k/a &quot;The Mercenaries&quot;, is an old-fashioned sexploitaton film that will appeal to that fringe which enjoys truly bad acting, t&amp;a and gore effects.\n\nSecond Troma release from filmmaker Eric Louzil, pic is a slight step from his &quot;Lust for Freedom&quot;, but still suffers from awkward direction and the annoying Troma practice of adding hokey dialog and sound effects to fill up dead air.\n\nHandsome, low-key Gene LeBrok (he looks like Christopher Reeve playing Superman) plays an Indian halfbreed fesh out of prison who has a score to settle with the Georgia County, California, sheriff (stolid David Crane) who killed his brother in cold blood.\n\nPersonal grudges soon take a backseat to the main problem: a band of mercenary soldiers calling themselves &quot;Fortress of Amerikkka&quot;, led by evil William J. Kulzer, is camped nearby. Instead of mere survivalist wargames, this coed bunch is killing folks right and left. Pic&apos;s anticlimax -coming after the sheriff is wiped out -is the townsfolk and cops banding together to fight the mercenaries.\n\nUntil then, Louzil contrives to include as many scenes of women going topless as time will permit. Heroine Kellee Bradley abstains, but exotic porno star Kascha shows off her surgical implants memoably, given a run for he money by busty blonde Karen Michaels. Oddly enough, the statuesque blond featured on the film&apos;s poster doesn&apos;t show up in the film; she&apos;s the same model who was postergirl for anothr recent pic, &quot;Shotgun&quot;, without appearing on screen int that one either.\n\nWhile LeBrok glides theough the picture without losing his cool, there is hysterically bad acting provided by Kulzer (a regular in Louzil films who also handles the stuntwork). Crane and especially Michaels, who smiles (unintentionally) in the face of danger. Pic&apos;s campiest scene occurs when Kascha and her boyfriend recite patriotic sentiments, echoed by th foolish narration.\n\nApart from scenic views of forests and mountains, film&apos;s technical credits are weak. The background score is extremely poor."

      "reviewBody": "Although this is one of the least ambitious of the Pippi movies, it happens to be my favorite.  It doesn&apos;t have the pirates or exotic locations of the South Seas adventure, or the flying cars of the one where they run away from home.  It&apos;s basically just a continuation of the first film, with Pippi and her friends tramping around town irritating people and showing complete disregard for property laws.  Since the back story and exposition are already in place, no time is wasted and the children set to work immediately.  And, unlike the other films, the children are a bit more malevolent in this one.\n\nThere&apos;s a strong, negative undercurrent to the proceedings this time around. Tommy and Annika are noticeably more fault-finding of Pippi, critisizing her singing voice and expressing displeasure on several occasions.  Tommy insults her shoes.  Annika says her games are dull and uninspired.  Pippi, in turn, plays cruel jokes on them involving guns, drugs, and sinking boats. She makes Annika cry and forces Tommy to compromise his manhood by spraying ladies perfume in his face.  The animals aren&apos;t spared from Pippi&apos;s abuse, either.  She throws a pair of panties on her horse&apos;s head, admonishes him harshly for eating sugar (which she encourages him to do), and brutally traps Mr. Nilsson under an overturned laundry basket, furiously telling him &quot;If you&apos;re going to act like an ape, you belong on a cage!&quot;\n\nIn &quot;Pippi Goes on Board&quot; there&apos;s actually three different children doing voices for Pippi, Tommy, and Annika - as opposed to that one old lady who did everything in the first movie.  However, most of the characters are dubbed with unvarnished, lower-class New York accents - which makes their kvetching all the more hilarious."

Naturally, there are aspects of the story that are forced aside- too little time is spent on the relationship between Kitty and Levin (who was a self-portrait of Tolstoy)- but Brown manages to portray the affair between Anna and Vronsky with plenty of depth and emotion.\n\nGreta Garbo, one of the greatest actresses of the 30&apos;s, is stunning in the lead. Frederic March is a little flat as Vronsky, dressed in his military uniform in almost every scene, but manages to do well with the character nonetheless. Basil Rathbone&apos;s usual grimness suits Karenin perfectly. The production design is spectacular. Brown directs his cast so that they always stand out from the scenery, clearly visible amidst the decadence and imperial settings. The ballroom scenes, where characters dance gracefully while exchanging crucial dialogue, particularly impressed me.\n\nA delight for Garbo fans, as well as anyone who likes costume pieces or literary adaptations.",

      "reviewBody": "Usually, when you go to see an action/adventure movie, especially an Indiana Jones movie, you&apos;re going to suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to &quot;get into&quot; the movie. These kinds of movies are supposed to be mindless escapist fun. Still, one might expect some small modicum of plausibility or connection to the real world. When it comes to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,&quot; forget about suspending disbelief. Just pretend you&apos;re in another dimension altogether. If you do that, you&apos;ll have have met one of the two prerequisites for seeing this movie. (If you don&apos;t believe me now, you will when you see this film and see our hero survive a cataclysmic event in a fairly cartoonish manner a mere 15 minutes into the film.) The other prerequisite is that you&apos;ve seen the other three movies...religiously. A huge chunk of the entertainment value of this film comes from nostalgia, in-jokes, and self-parody. It is an entertaining movie and I had fun and laughed while I was watching it and the reason for this is because we are either enjoying seeing all of the same old gags done once again in a bigger and cooler way, or we are enjoying seeing those gags mocked. Trusty bullwhip? Check. Fedora? Check. Long car chase with fighting and leaping and what-not? Check. Dark tombs lit only by torches? Check. Gross creepy crawly critters? Check.\n\nThis is what makes the movie entertaining, but is also what prevents it from greatness and what makes me hesitant to call it a true &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movie. George Lucas (who co-wrote the screenplay) has tried to do here what he did to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, namely that he thinks that appealing to the fan base with in-jokes, self-parody, and re-hashing the same old stuff can take the place of actually writing a a story that can stand on its own merits. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels failed because Lucas could not get past his constant references to the original trilogy and so instead created fan fiction instead of true prequels. (Well, there was also the fact that Lucas&apos; dialogue SUCKED.) Here, the stunts and action sequences and in-jokes keep us feeling entertained during the course of the film, but when we walk away, we wonder where was the real story.\n\nIndiana Jones is a homage to 1930s serials about treasure hunters. He&apos;s out of place in the 1950s. Also out of place are the Soviets(led by Cate Blanchett in a Rosa Kleb-like role). And there are many, many, MANY instances where you will get to wondering just how implausible the next stunt will be. All of that I can put up with, though, and in fact can and do add to the entertainment value of the film. What I could not put up with was the ending, which will remind you not of Indiana Jones but of the ending to another Spielberg movies that pre-dates &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot; \n\nThis movie is lots of fun to watch, but it doesn&apos;t take itself seriously and probably shouldn&apos;t be part of the Indiana Jones canon.",

      "reviewBody": "It has become a new thing of amusement for sports fans to research old rants of coaches, particularly football coaches, that they gave in a live press conference while currently in the heat of the moment. Quite possibly the most iconic was the professional and motivating Herm Edwards sending a message to his players saying, &quot;you play to win the game&quot; after Herm&apos;s New York Jets lost to the Cleveland Browns in 2002. The rant I thought of during Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Martin&apos;s documentary Undefeated was Jim Mora&apos;s &quot;Playoffs?!&quot; remake when asked about the Colts&apos; future after a devastating loss. &quot;I just hope we can win a game!&quot; he stated shortly after.\n\nIt&apos;s that kind of mentality I feel that the Manassas High School football team and their long-suffering coach, Bill Courtney occupied for a long, long time, as the school&apos;s team, which existed for 110 years, never won a playoff game and have become the devastating team that you look on the schedule and cite as an easy win if you play them. The school is located in Manassas, Virginia, and is grossly underfunded, along with possessing an athletic program unfit for even a third-rate school. The kids need to get by with what they have, and that&apos;s not much. Coming from a prestigious and often highly-regarded public high school, I look on with great sympathy and possess deep gratefulness in what I was born into.\n\nUndefeated primarily focuses on Manassas High School football team&apos;s 2009 year, where they plan to turn things around for the better (not like they could get any worse). They figure that since they&apos;re at rock bottom, they can only go up from there, and Bill Courtney plans to turn the team around, putting heavy emphasis on character and frequently telling them, &quot;character is not how you handle successes, because anyone can bask in the glory of a win, but how you handle failures,&quot; and that is a bold and admirable message for an unpaid coach to tell his players. He believes in them, even when their previous record was 0-10. You won&apos;t find too many high school coaches who take the game as seriously as Courtney, or are prepared to give them advice they can use off the field or when they hang up their jerseys and helmets to pursue other things.\n\nCourtney explains that the school is so underfunded athletically that they considered taking part in &quot;pay games,&quot; which involves the team traveling miles across the state to face a team they have no chance in beating and accepting a $3,000 - $4,000 in exchange for brutal humiliation. When your only option to get money is to belittle your self-esteem, you really need help in some way, shape, or form. He even goes on to say that the reputation the football team gets is so putrid, ugly, and dehumanizing that athletes that come to Manassas High from eight grade don&apos;t even consider playing for the team. Can you blame them? Yet not only are they out of an extra-curricular activity in their high school career, they&apos;re almost completely out of a future career with football.\n\nThankfully, Courtney has a reliable lineup, involving O.C. Brown, a senior whose passion is more suited for the field than the classroom, the quick and dependable Montrail &quot;Money&quot; Brown, and a man by the name of Chavis Daniels, who is the team goon, often causing trouble and possessing a very suspicious anger problem. Courtney accepts the challenge with no regret at all, and often connects personally with many of his players. There&apos;s a touching scene in the latter half when O.C. and Courtney are traveling somewhere in a car together when O.C. tells the coach that he is attracted to another girl. As a result, Courtney hands over a small bottle of cologne telling him to use it conservatively and he will get all the ladies he wants. The warm, innocuous, yet comforting feeling of bonding goes right to the viewer&apos;s heart in just a wonderful scene.\n\nThe film chronicles the 2009 season, showing modest beginnings, but a wonderfully unbelievable conclusion with opportunities soaring for the team, players, and school. We also see how the players not only adapt to the new opportunities, but also the inevitable ones, like college approaching their line of vision and high school entering their rear-view mirror. Courtney devastatingly explains that once the football season ends, some kids recognize that they have a 2.0 grade point average, a 14 on their ACT, and no scholarship, resulting in almost nowhere to go. It&apos;s a depressing state of affairs, especially for kids who have no other experience other than the kind they obtained on the field.\n\nUndefeated is a nicely made documentary that had the honor of beating Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory at the 2012 Oscars for Best Documentary Feature. The film will without a doubt will strike an emotional chord for some audiences, yet despite being a true story, there&apos;s something about hearing the perfunctory tale of a coach turning a ragtag bunch of half-wits into a winning team, real or not, that feels sort of artificial. Yet there is a divine humanity in this story that isn&apos;t ignored, and the result, in the long run, was a long-overdue one Manassas will cherish for another 110 years. It&apos;s light years more efficient than a clichÃ©-ridden tale like Rudy, I suppose.\n\nNOTE: Undefeated will see a DVD/Blu-Ray release on February 19, 2013, but is currently on several video on demand outlets and on DirecTV&apos;s Pay-Per View feature.\n\nStarring: Bill Courtney, O.C. Brown, Montrail &quot;Money&quot; Brown, and Chavis Daniels. Directed by: Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Martin.",

Based on true events, this is an absorbing drama about one of the most explosive chapters of American history. Hackman is terrific as an agent who doesn&apos;t condone the racism, but understands the culture of hatred, having grown up in the South himself. Dafoe is equally good as a young agent who struggles to reconcile his idealistic views about justice with the reality he confronts. McDormand is also fine as the good wife of a redneck sheriff. Parker wisely uses a documentary approach to infuse the events with a sense of authenticity.",

I found myself first seeing through a very direct lens of a slave narrative/American liberal white guilt. This is an easy interpretation that lives on the surface.\n\nThe film then transformed into a statement about the presumption that &quot;we&quot; can teach others how to govern when &quot;they&quot; may have a system that works better in their context. The system in Manderlay was not overseer/slave, the system was socialism/communism and each &quot;slave,&quot; as Grace saw them, had his or her own specialized role. The inhabitants of Manderlay were free within their system, but Grace was so completely blinded by what her culture had taught her about &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; and the inferiority of all other ways of life. The democracy she implemented was a complete farce. Their society did not function when the arrogant outsider who thought she knew what was best for them began implementing her system with force. The most direct comparison is &quot;operation iraqi freedom&quot; and other US nation building exercises or sponsored coups.\n\nI found many other characters to be representations of a global system of oppression. The card shark was an international lending institution like the World Bank or the IMF and the &quot;prince&quot; was a corrupt leader who sold out his people for a cut of the profits of the international business elites (like Marcos, Suharto, or seemingly countless others).\n\nI was very pleased with Manderlay and thoroughly frustrated by simplistic the reviews I read of it. I feel that this film falls apart with a straightforward viewing. As a white guilt slave narrative the film is mediocre. As commentary on imperialism and an absolutely corrupt global system, the film is a wonderful composition. I can&apos;t wait for Wasington.",

Stylings are very &quot;&apos;60s-ish&quot; but the story and conversations will never grow outdated! A very influential film, expertly constructed and directed by Haskell...good luck finding it on video. You&apos;ll have better luck waiting for it to air on television.\n\nThe acting is very good, and convincing. Sometimes I wondered whether they were _really_ actors at all! The direction is shaky and utterly superb, capturing the &quot;feel&quot; of these sort of documentaries broadcast on &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; etc.\n\nAll in all a very fascinating look at the media during the 1960s and beyond. It still relates. Vietnam has passed but the media is still the same!"

      "reviewBody": "I finally saw Shoah yesterday at the Ontario Cinematheque. I sat through the entire 9 and a half hours in one sitting.\n\nShoah surprised me in several ways. The first was how the interviews were conducted. Lanzmann is a very direct and aggressive interviewer and initially, I was very put off by how he delved into his subjects. He seemed almost wreckless and completely devoid of empathy as he continued to ask the most personal and private questions, never hesitating to force his subjects to think back to what was not only the darkest moment of their lives, but the darkest moments of modern Western history.\n\nEventually, what happens however, is astonishing. Most interviewees eventually give up their resistance, and very carefully relate their stories. Lanzmann forces them to consider details. How many bodies per furnace? How wide was the ditch? How far was the train ramp from the camp&apos;s bunkers? These details facilitate memory and soon, the subjects open up in the most remarkable way.\n\nNo matter how you feel, or what you think you know about the Holocaust, this film puts faces to the tragedy in a way few conventional documentaries could. The emphasis here is on memory and oral history.\n\nAs one Holocaust victim says early in the film, &quot;It might be good for you to talk about these things. But for me, no.&quot; Eventually however, he realizes he must bear witness.\n\nThere&apos;s one remarkable scene where Lanzmann confronts German settlers in Poland about the previous owner of their home, who were Jewish and sent to Auschwitz after their properties were confiscated.\n\nPeople who don&apos;t find this film &apos;entertaining&apos; or perhaps &apos;boring&apos; probably feel that way because, outside of the immediate experiences of the subjects being interviewed, there is no wider context to present the events. A worthwhile companion to this film would be the BBC&apos;s Auschwitz: Inside The Nazi State which runs 4 and a half hours, but will help you understand Shoah better.\n\nThe other thing I found fascinating about this film was how the translations actually helped you absorb what is being said in a way direct subtitling wouldn&apos;t. For instance, most of the subjects speak German or Polish. Lanzmann speaks French mainly and some German. His translator translates what&apos;s being said into French and then the subtitles translate the French into English. By being able to look into the eyes of the people speaking, in their own native language, and then read the subtitles, was a very subtle, but very effective tool that deadens the &apos;shock value&apos; of what is being spoken and gives the viewer more time to absorb the content.\n\nSome people have complained also that the film also has many long takes, which are seemingly of nothing. For instance, Lanzmann lets his camera linger on the remnants of Chelmno, which was razed after the war. Although it just looks like a five minute shot of a field, what struck me was how different this bucolic field must have been in 1942. Making this connection justifies every frame shot. Lanzmann, however, will not force this down your throat. You must be patient.\n\nThis is an astonishing film that must be seen by everyone, at least once. Please review the general historical context of the Holocaust before you see it, to get the most out of it, but otherwise, this is living testament of the most vital kind.\n\nBrilliant, essential film-making.",

The monologue begins with the hotel manager talking to the bell boys, then the editing takes us to housekeeping, the restaurant, the bar, etc. and each manager picks up the monologue, ending with the hotel manager summing up his expectations.\n\nI think that sequence opens an interesting window on what hotel workers might have dealt with back then."

      "reviewBody": "Luc Merenda and the revenge of a desperate father\n\nThe widowed motorcycle mechanic Mario Colella (Luc Merenda) lovingly looks after his son Fabrizio (Marco Liofredi). One day he and a classmate are kidnapped in front of school in broad daylight. The boss (Marino Mase) of the blackmailers demands 10 billion ITL ransom. Completely impossible for the penniless Mario, but the other boy is the child of the rich construction lion Filippini (James Mason) and his wife, Countessa Grazia (Valentina Cortese). The competent inspector Magrini (Vittorio Caprioli) intervenes, but the stubborn Filippini negotiates on his own and deliberately delays payment. The kidnappers lose their nerve and kill Fabrizio to reinforce their demands. Now there is no stopping the desperate Mario...\n\nCult director Fernando Di Leo shot a typical revenge thriller of the time (a man takes action where the police and the system fail) in the style of Charles Bronson in Rome and Milan. CINECITTA was simply great when it came to creatively copying successful formulas from Hollywood. The plot is not necessarily logical, but it is very exciting and entertaining. Luc Merenda can&apos;t shine with differentiated acting, but he can do action scenes. A more exquisite achievement was achieved by Hollywood star James Mason (1909-1984), who shortly before his death would become the father-in-law of pop singer Belinda Carlisle. And Valentina Cortese was nominated for an ACADEMY AWARD for Best Supporting Actress in 1975, when the film was released in Italian cinemas (in German-speaking countries it was not released on video until the 1980s) with &quot;La nuit americaine&quot; by Francois Truffaut.\n\nQuite a quick contribution from the poliziottescho genre that is appealingly entertaining!",

The dialogue really isn&apos;t that sharp at all, and the characters are either incredibly unlikeable or just plain bland. There&apos;s only a few minutes of side-splitting humour (the rocket/plane being the highlight), and there&apos;s some moments of sly comic brilliance (loved the three different stories told), but it just turns into the very thing it&apos;s trying to mock by the end. The villains are too real and too human to be properly made fun of, and thus any joke involving them just falls flat. It&apos;s not nearly funny enough to be labeled a hybrid, so instead it&apos;s just a horror with some black comedy elements. Shame.",

      "reviewBody": "The plot: Searching for his missing brother, a soldier runs into the killer ghost from Rest Stop, with predictable results for him and his friends.\n\nRest Stop 2 follows many of the conventions of the first movie, but manages to excise some of the pointless filler, replacing it with extended scenes of gory torture. Also, the origin of the ghostly killer is revealed, along with his connection to the creepy religious family. If you were dying to know these things, then I can understand why you&apos;d want to see Rest Stop 2, but there really isn&apos;t much reason to subject yourself to this movie, when you can just read the synopsis on Wikipedia or the IMDb.\n\nOne of the saving graces of the original Rest Stop was its atmosphere and judicial use of gore. Unfortunately, the parts without gore tended to be a bit boring. In Rest Stop 2, the gore is pretty much its sole reason for being. As a result, I would recommend this movie only to fans of Rest Stop, gorehounds, and torture porn enthusiasts. Most other people will probably be either bored stupid or too grossed out. It&apos;s no masterpiece, but the gore effects are pretty good, for a low budget, direct-to-video sequel. Honestly, I&apos;m a bit tired of horror movies that are nothing but young adults being tortured to death slowly, but I&apos;ve seen worse ones than this. Some of the scenes were twisted enough to be memorable, but the movie itself really isn&apos;t.",

After all these years its rare for a Carry On film to make you laugh out loud but surprisingly this manages to do that a few times.\n\nTYPICAL: Very typical - it&apos;s a really good example. Having spent what amounted to a fortune for this team with their period, full-costume comedies it was back to filming outside Maidenhead&apos;s council offices but that enthusiasm is still there and this has tons more energy than most of the modern dress entries.\n\nEveryone is in this including Frankie Howerd who for once doesn&apos;t try to take over. The plot is as nuts as ever but it all seems to make perfect sense when you&apos;re watching it.\n\nSEXY LADIES: The other essential of a Carry On film is saucy, sexy ladies. This definitely is one for those Barbara Windsor fans as she does feature quite a lot - often taking her nurses&apos; uniform off for seemingly no apparent reason whatsoever other than because she&apos;s Barbara Windsor. This one&apos;s also got the popular 1960s TV personality and singer Anita Harris who&apos;s got a really pretty smile.",

The diary belongs to 14 year old Mary Bedford (Mary Brave) as she writes about the heart breaking emotional trauma she suffers during her first year at boarding school. Lost And Delirious is a movie about the purest form of committed love, the kind that transcends all boundaries and causes those committed to devote every fiber of their being, heart and soul, to their loved one. There is no turning back or &quot;getting over&quot; this kind of love; once broken the heart can never mend. Most people will never experience this kind of pure love and, even if the opportunity were there, would never take such a chance with their emotions. If you have ever loved another person so intensely that you felt your life would be over if the relationship ended, you will identify with the character, Paulie Oster, and this movie may break your heart.\n\nL&amp;D is not a lesbian movie about girls being naughty and experimenting at boarding school. If you&apos;re not the sensitive type and expect to be inflamed with lust this movie would be wasted on you. Get yourself a pound of fried pork skins, a six-pack of $1.49 beer on sale at the local convenience store, and rent Bimbos From Planet Lesbos instead.",

Alan Bates is outstanding walking that very thin line but totally committed to that duality that makes him so human, so real. Lila Kedrova won an Oscar for her performance, deservedly so. Simone Signoret had been offered the part and she was the one who suggested Lila Kedrova to the director, Michael Cacoyanis. I love that story. Zorba has also the power of Irene Papas who makes her silent calling absolutely riveting and the contagious Mikis Theodorakis&apos;s score all together in a beautiful, savage, compelling film that doesn&apos;t show any signs of aging",

IMDB.com shouldn&apos;t have rated this 5.9 out of ten because this movie deserves much higher, almost an 8. Watch this movie if you&apos;re a fan of crime dramas, comical action flicks or Diesel fans and you&apos;ll truely get a kick out of this flick. 7.2/10- my movie pro rating"

Unfortunately, few of his movies benefit of the elegant and intelligent humour that he possessed.\n\nThis movie is one of the best to feature him, and for its time, it&apos;s even reasonably impressive on the special effects (having him play triple brothers in the same frame). The story is simple: Triplet brothers live in a flat, one is a poet, the other is a composer, the third is the maid for everything who cleans up behind the others and runs the flat. One day, the third (and youngest) brother steals a melody and a poem of his two elder brothers, mixes the two into a Schlager, and sends it to a contest, where he wins the first prize: A cruise. Unfortunately for him, his two brothers decide to tag along, resulting in lots of confusion and fun on the boat.\n\nOld 1950s comedies aren&apos;t everyone&apos;s taste, but this is one I certainly liked a lot, and still do. The movie is carried by Heinz Erhardt delivering a good performance as three different characters. Too bad the dialogue does not have the same grace as his short verses, but it&apos;s still funnier than most his other movies."

The supporting cast, featuring many well-knowns like Catherine Keener, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Shue, etc. are all perfect. But the icing on the cake is the final act which, in addition to being funny, is actually quite moving. In that regard, I think this movie really stands out, not just as a good comedy, but a solid film in a larger sense.",

      "reviewBody": "Though overshadowed by later versions, this 1935 Seymour Hicks version of &quot;Scrooge&quot; is pretty good, with the main strength being Hicks&apos;s effective portrayal of Scrooge.  Aside from Hicks, most of the other characters do not have that much of a presence, and it does not have the kind of lavish detail that enriches, for example, the great Alastair Sim version.  But the atmosphere works, and the story is faithfully told and moves fairly quickly. Every actor who portrays the famous miser has his own interpretation of the role, and Hicks himself is above average, lending appropriate nuances to his character&apos;s personality change while remaining believable.\n\nThe story has been filmed so many times that it&apos;s hardly possible to avoid making comparisons among the various versions.  This is not going to be anyone&apos;s favorite version, but it&apos;s not a bad one, either."

      "name": "Morgan Freeman Is Great As Always, But Story Lacks Crucial Plot Points",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Street Smart&quot; is a movie not a lot of people appear to remember from the 1980&apos;s. What attracted me to the movie was the fact that Morgan Freeman received his first ever Academy Award nomination for his role as a pimp in this film. Freeman hasn&apos;t played a role like this before or since, and his best known roles to come after this (including Oscar nominated roles) have consisted of more positive characters with effective leadership skills. Although Freeman doesn&apos;t play the type of positive African-American role model here that he is now best known for playing,he gives the character of Leo Smalls, Jr., a.k.a. &quot;Fast Black&quot;, a three-dimensional performance that few other actors, black or white, would have been able to pull off. He&apos;s not just an intimidating presence, or a guy who wears flashy clothes. In fact, the scenes where he goes back to his apartment, and a poster of Martin Luther King, Jr. can be seen in the background, says volumes about his character.\n\nWithout a doubt, Freeman&apos;s performance is the best thing about this movie. The rest of the movie is indeed intriguing, but has a few weaknesses which makes it feel a little half-baked. With a running time of 94 minutes, at least 20 minutes of footage could have been added to account for these skimmed-over plot details without throwing off the pace of the film.\n\nThe late Christopher Reeve is Jonathan Fisher, a Harvard educated print journalist who is under pressure to write a magazine article in a weekend. He submits an idea to his publisher, seemingly off the top of his head, about 24 hours in the life of a pimp. The story is supposed to be true, but Fisher, feeling intense encumbrance to get a story to his editor, fabricates one instead. To his surprise, the story makes the front page, Fisher becomes a celebrity overnight, and moves up to his own TV news segment.\n\nThe trouble comes in when some readers believe the article is about one particular real pimp (Freeman) who happens to be on trial for murder. Among those wary readers is the leading prosecutor for that case. Although the fictional article depicts no murder of any kind, Fisher is still ordered to give the court his notes in the trial, or be subject to a jail sentence.\n\nWith the trouble comes a story that keeps the viewers&apos; interests high for what comes next, but plot holes that accompany the story remain unexplained throughout. For instance, we have some of an idea what Reeve&apos;s character wrote in the article, but no idea what in the article would be considered circumstantial evidence in a murder trial. Having a series of imaginary montages with Reeve&apos;s idea of a pimp as he&apos;s writing the story would have cleared that unexplained plot point up easily. Plus, although Reeve&apos;s character is Harvard educated, that&apos;s all we know about his character. How did he come up with the idea to write about a pimp in the first place? Since we never see him in the inner city until after he submitted the story proposal, that occurrence remains unexplained also. Reeve did a great job playing a guy who tries to maintain control of his life and career, only to have both be in jeopardy as his situation goes over his head. It would have been more helpful to establish some real roots for his character, though, not to mention a moral compass of some kind.\n\nThere were some other times where the story felt shaky, but the film had other great qualities. For instance, the inner city in the film looked far more real than other &quot;gritty urban dramas&quot; I&apos;ve seen over the last few years where the movie sets looked like movie sets and the houses looked too polished. Overall though, the film is worth checking out for Freeman&apos;s performance, and probably should be remembered better in Reeve&apos;s career than &quot;Superman IV: The Quest For Peace&quot;. If anything, this movie showed that Reeve can play a character who has everything under control (Superman) just as well as one who does not.",

      "reviewBody": "The destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a historically significant event not just for the people of Germany, but also for much of the rest of the world.  Aside from reuniting two vastly different political systems, this remarkable incident marked a turning point for the capitalist uprising occurring within many of the other socialist states.  Filmmakers worldwide have since explored the causes and effects of the German Reunification, and even today, they continue to bring new insight and a fresh perspective to an event that occurred nearly fifteen years ago.  Wolfgang Becker&apos;s GOOD BYE, LENIN! is among the most recent of such films, and probably among the best of them as well.\n\nRather than charging head-on at a specific political standing, GOOD BYE, LENIN! uses carefully controlled satire to poke fun at the absurdities of both communist and capitalist societies.  And despite criticism from gung-ho supporters of either system, Becker is careful not to take sides or appear sympathetic toward any political institution.  Instead of concentrating exclusively on the governmental changes of the newly reunified Germany, he wisely opts to narrow his focus on the effects that these changes have on one particular Berlin family.  By doing this, Becker is able to show the challenges of adapting to a new, unfamiliar way of life in a context that is much more personal and easier for the viewer to identify with.\n\nThe humor in GOOD BYE, LENIN! is plentiful, and Becker takes advantage of every possible opportunity to fit in a comedic moment.  Even during the most somber parts of the story, the film never lets go of its astute sense of humor; and because the humor is always thought-provoking and cleverly executed, it never feels forced or gratuitous.  The running joke about Alex&apos;s unremitting quest for Spreewald pickle jars and the scene where Alex&apos;s bedridden mother is perplexed by the Coca-Cola banner hanging from the building across from hers&apos; are brilliant examples of the movie&apos;s sharp, yet sensitive wit. Aside from just being funny in themselves, these bits work doubly well because of their uses of symbolism and metaphor.  The Spreewald pickles, now impossible to find because of the fall of the GDR, are representative of the `good old days&apos; when Alex was familiar with the ways of his country and when his mother was in good health.  His almost frantic search for them shows his longing to return to the way things used to be.  Likewise, the unfurling of the Coca-Cola banner is the perfect embodiment of all the capitalist changes occurring within the new Germany.  Once you begin to see the Coca-Cola and Burger King logos, you know that capitalism has truly grabbed hold and that there is now no escaping its embrace, for better or for worse.\n\nGOOD BYE, LENIN! makes great use of this type of imagery to emphasize the country&apos;s transformation and to provide insight to the emotions of the main characters.  A most notable instance of this is the scene where Alex&apos;s mother, a staunch supporter of socialism, finally leaves her home to a very different East Germany than the one she remembered.  She then looks to the sky and sees a helicopter airlifting a statue of Lenin off the top of a building.  As Lenin is being hauled away, his outstretched arm seems to be reaching out to her, as if he&apos;s calling out for her to rescue him and his ideals, and restore her beloved country.\n\nAlex&apos;s complex lies and meticulous attempts at preserving the past for his mother are innocent enough at first, but eventually they begin to take on a life of their own.  The lengths he goes through to maintain the atmosphere of a bygone era and keep his mother happy are indeed funny, but they are also very tragic as well.  Though the lies do work temporarily to keep his mother oblivious to the events outside of her apartment, they also plunge Alex and his family into such a deep pool of deception that they eventually lose their closeness with one another.  The stress of keeping up the faÃ§ade becomes unbearable for Alex, and at one point he even wishes his mother were dead.\n\nOther humor was purely cultural, and probably only appreciable by people who have actually experienced the Reunification.  I noticed this only because of the native German family sitting in front of me at the theater, laughing in unison at dialogue and images that didn&apos;t look to me like they were meant to be interpreted as humorous.  But still, even though the older generations of German people are likely to get more out of this movie, it is still a hilarious, heartfelt, and incredibly rewarding experience for people of all cultures and ethnicities."

While the acting for the most part is typical teenager and a little disappointing except for the bad guy, the film looks fantastic, the actions sequences are great as well as the kills, some of which were hard to watch due to their realism. In this version at least, the cheesy special effects seem to be gone or at least vastly improved from what the other reviewer saw. It moves pretty well except for a few scenes of obligatory explanations regarding the voodoo deal and &quot;teen angst&quot;, but there are a couple of really good scares as well as a good sustained overall tension throughout. The kills are brutal for the most part with one exception thats kind of lame, but the fight sequence close to the end is especially effective and looks just great as well as what has to be some new scenes, possibly even a new ending, since the lighting and overall look is so different from the rest of the film, but it still looks great. In my humble opinion it&apos;s definitely worth seeing and an R rating based on the blood and gore if thats what you expect from a horror movie. Gillespie definitely knows how to make an audience squirm.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn&apos;t see people saying a lot here.\n\n&apos;Doctor Strange&apos; is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel&apos;s best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn&apos;t quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn&apos;t buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. BeyoncÃ©).\n\nHowever, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams&apos;s character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film&apos;s most interesting character and played with relish by her.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.\n\nThe story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).\n\n&apos;Doctor Strange&apos;s&apos; script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn&apos;t have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.\n\nWhere &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; is particularly good is in the production values. It&apos;s very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it&apos;s the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.\n\nOverall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it &apos;Doctor Strange&apos; was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel&apos;s best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Are you kidding me? This movie has completely no sense, not even a seem of good acting...\n\nWhen I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which has - I think - nearly the same rating, I had to bang my head on the table , because I watched 00 Schneider directly after Sakrileg, and oh my god , there are worlds between them.\n\nThe majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6.3 and denominates Helge as a genius. Of course , he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact, that German isn&apos;t your native language and you just ignore - or rather don&apos;t notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences. OK , I must confess that some scenes ARE funny, but all in all , a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot ;)",

      "reviewBody": "During the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s there were plenty of films that tried to duplicate the James Bond films with varying degrees of success. Well, this one was not too much of a success, but it was rather fun to watch. Peter Graves is out to stop the bad guys in this film that wants to be a super great spy film, but like most copies, you do not get the multiple exotic locations or the super action scenes one typically finds within a James Bond film.\n\nThe story has a bomb being stolen and then we learn it is the guy who was the bad guy in the Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me who is the villain! A lot of random scenes play out including a man in a turtle neck putting a beat down on someone and then he is killed. Soon Peter Graves enters the film and is the hero as he travels somewhere and gets attacked immediately upon arrival to somewhere, I think Iran? Soon he is joining up with a Russian agent with no Russian accent to speak of and fighting in a casino so that he can stop Missile X!\n\nPeter Graves does alright in the lead role though he looks a bit too old to be playing a super spy, especially one who can easily get the hot chicks. Curt Jurgens as the bad guy does pretty much the same routine as he did in the Bond film and he even has an evil henchman who instead of sharp teeth as a wacky knife hand! John Caradine is in this too, but try not finding a movie in this era that did not feature him in a role!\n\nSo, was it good? Not really, but it was fun to watch and it was not boring. It is better than other Bond wannabes I have seen over the years as at least they try to have a good chase and gunfight here and there. I would have liked to see the evil henchman actually get to use his knife hand and I would have enjoyed not seeing the one girl&apos;s pointless dance before dude with bad toupee tried to escape, but overall we got ourselves a good so bad it&apos;s good movie!",

Like the acting in Starship Troopers but with less memorable faces.\n\nThe plot had potential, but turned out to be a bad Matrix Revolutions rip off.\n\nMost disappointing of all was the graphics. The special effects throughout the movie were simply horrible. Way below par anything you would expect to see today. It would have looked amateur 15 years ago.\n\nI don&apos;t recommend taking this one on sober.",

      "reviewBody": "I must admit that this film has a special place in my heart... not quite as big as the one my fiancÃ©e holds, but it&apos;s still in there. It&apos;s the first Olsen Gang film I ever saw, and owned, and thusly, the one I&apos;ve seen the most. Years before I saw their other efforts, I had watched this more times than I suppose I should admit. This is a unique entry, in many ways. It starts(though at Mallorca, like the last one) and ends very differently than any of the others. An interesting thing is that with the last film, the two had written these characters into a corner... the former movie ended the series perfectly, with the gang reaching their dream: Mallorca, as millionaires. But the audience requires more of the great series. How to solve this conundrum? Where Bahs and Balling could have written a cop-out explanation, as lesser writers surely would have, they simply properly explain the return by showing how these people are affected by their new way of life. After an incident(that I refuse to describe, as its simplicity and pure genius would not translate properly through my words. It *needs* to be seen), they find themselves back in this country. While that isn&apos;t a choice they themselves made, we still find that they are much happier here... in spite of still needing money, of being mediocre citizens, of suffering under the same shortcomings as they did before. Yes. East West, home is best. Be careful what you wish for. ClichÃ©s. But aren&apos;t clichÃ©s (often) just truths that we find we&apos;ve heard one too many times(and one does tire more easily of hearing something that is an annoying truth to have to admit to)? So, with that, we&apos;re back... Egon&apos;s got a plan, he&apos;s released from jail and he seeks out Benny and Kjeld, trying to get their backup for his latest genius and well-devised scheme. That leads to what might just be the most excellent scene featuring Yvonne in the entire series... and that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say of the plot. The plot is brilliant. The way it develops is magnificent. Pacing is as good as it comes. Despite having seen this countless times before and knowing basically everything that would happen, I wasn&apos;t bored for a second. The acting is top-notch, as always. BÃ¸ffen returns, still messing up the gang&apos;s plans. This time, Ove Verner Hansen truly gets to show off his great facial acting. Pouel Kern jumps on, as well, in a very small but incredibly funny role. Furthermore, Paul Hagen and Helge KjÃ¦rluff-Schmidt(his only role in any of the Olsen Gang films, and it&apos;s tailor-made to suit him) join in, as two preposterously old-fashioned high-ranking train workers(doing a nice job of making fun of the Danish railways, which are featured quite prominently in this film(hence the title); that(the Danish train system), by the way, is also such a definite Danish thing that it&apos;s no wonder they basically built this film up around it), and managing to reference a well-known song by Benny Andersen several times in their dialog. The humor is always brilliant, mostly sophisticated and at times downright sublime. The police are thoroughly made fun of yet again(as is the general &quot;Danish-ness&quot;). The human touch remains, still spreading smiles and laughs. This may just be the most hilarious of all the films in the series, and the one that features the most laugh-out-loud moments. You&apos;ll laugh upon hearing Kjeld announce what he&apos;d rather be doing than live in Spain. The laughter will become hysterical upon seeing his idea for making money. If you&apos;re not already crying with laughter by the time he misquotes the Three Musketeers, you&apos;ll start. This may also contain the most of Benny&apos;s silly laughter, in any one of the films. One of the best in a great series. Humorous, well-written and highly memorable. I recommend it to any fan of the franchise as well as any fan of comedy and Danish humor in general. I would say, though, that having watched the previous entries is a must. 8/10",

This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from &apos;The Truman Show&apos; feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he&apos;s a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don&apos;t know whether he&apos;s helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.\n\nWeir, who directed the great &apos;Witness&apos;, uses different camera angles to make you feel like you&apos;re actually watching &apos;The Truman Show&apos; and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it&apos;s inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, &apos;The Truman Show&apos; is what I like to call a true American classic.",

Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood plays everything a little too straight for its own good, with not nearly enough in the way of knowingly dumb nonsense: the death scenes are forgettable, and with some of the least likable protagonists of the whole franchise (drug smoking, gun toting thugs with few redeeming qualities), Back 2 tha Hood proves to be quite the painful experience.\n\nThe funniest scene in the whole sorry mess is when Leprechaun (Warwick Davis, returning for the paycheck) smokes a bong, but we already saw the little guy get stoned in the previous film (which handled the whole &apos;G&apos; thang with a lot more fun).",

The cinematography is stunning; full of visual metaphor and gorgeous composition, it&apos;s an unyielding show of movie-making expertise. Welles plays up the bleak, &quot;no tomorrow&quot; nature of the exterior scenes, the structured chaos of the workplace and the hedonistic excess exhibited by the various stages of the trial itself, each to great effect. The story, though, feels too flighty and nebulous for my taste. It should come as no surprise, being a translation of a Kafka novel, that the entire picture often feels surreal and confusing. It continuously floats and sputters just beyond the grasp of understanding, like a moth delicately avoiding a set of flailing hands. The premise may have been established nicely during the slightly more straightforward opening scenes, but as the duration grows it becomes too ambitiously ambiguous for its own good.",

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with a married woman by the name of &quot;Samantha Felton&quot; (Rosalba Neri) arraigning to have her wealthy husband killed in order to inherit his sizeable ranch and fortune. The problem, however, is that her husband had recently written to his nephew &quot;Johnny Yuma&quot; (Mark Damon) who has agreed to give up his life as a gunslinger in order to work on the ranch and eventually inherit a part of it on some future day. Not at all content with that idea, Samantha reaches out to another gunslinger by the name of &quot;Linus Jerome Carradine&quot; (Lawrence Dobkin) to help her out in that regard. But what she doesn&apos;t realize is that both Johnny and Linus have previously met under somewhat amicable circumstances, and both share a healthy respect for one another--and this complicates things to a certain degree. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an interesting film due in large part to the involvement of several different characters with their own individual agendas. That being said, while it may not be the best Spaghetti Western ever produced, it&apos;s certainly worth a watch and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

Throughout it all, though, one nagging flaw keeps resurfacing in that there&apos;s absolutely nothing at all shown to make us fearful of the vampire since he never gets into action and hypnotizes the girl to do the dirty work while he&apos;s off-screen, leaving him absent for the majority of the time. Not a great way to ensure fear in your lead, despite the promise within the plot, so overall it lowers it somewhat but not enough to completely discard it at all.\n\nToday&apos;s Rating/R: Violence, Nudity and some language",

      "reviewBody": "A painful but important French documentary about what happens to a handful of foreigners who present themselves as asylum-seekers to a Paris charitable organization specialized in such cases, seeking permission to remain in France. They are couples, have children; several of the women are pregnant. Since summer 2008 when the film was made, only one couple has been granted asylum. One young woman from Eritrea with a newborn, who has been an exile all her life and was sexually assaulted in prison, has been sent to another country. A family with several children from Sri Lanka, who don&apos;t know how they got here or through which countries they traveled, is still waiting for action. A Mongolian couple was denied. All of them have arrived with their papers definitely not in order, with no money, nothing. The film also focuses on the two of the organization&apos;s enablers who deal with this group. Caroline is young and impulsive; she seems ill-suited to this work, often losing her composure. Colette, who&apos;s older, is sympathetic but disorganized. They have to deal with people whose languages they don&apos;t speak, and an English interpreter speaks English that&apos;s as spotty as the newcomer&apos;s; some interpreters can only be contacted by telephone. At one point Colette tells a couple with a newborn that she can only provide them with food vouchers for one meal a day for the coming month. The film is in French, Arabic, Sri Lancan, English, Mongolian. One staggers out with renewed awareness of what a tough life much of the world is forced to lead. The French are trying to help those who come in, but can only accept a certain number of them. An interesting coupling is this film with Anne Le Ny&apos;s recent narrative feature about asylum seekers who disrupt a rich Paris family, LES INVITÃ‰S DE MON PERE, which was showing at the same time in France. Very high critical rating from French reviewers according to AllocinÃ©: 3.2/72. I saw LES ARRIVANTS in Paris in April 2010.",

      "reviewBody": "Very moving and powerful look at both the caste system and the treatment of women as objects in rural India, in the early 1950s. \n\nA young woman from the serf class is taken in and slowly seduced by her arrogant, handsome young &quot;master&quot; whose house she keeps. But when she becomes pregnant, and his promised child bride finally becomes old enough to join him in the house, our heroine is slowly, painfully pushed aside and locked out. \n\nThe film is occasionally heavy handed in its politics, but the truth behind the story makes the slightly agit-prop nature forgivable. \n\nThis has none of the singing, dancing and theatrics we have come to associate with modern Indian cinema. This hearkens back to the stark, quiet realism of Satyajit Ray, with complex characters and surprising subtlety.",

Turns out Cybercore, and the local senator guy, are all corrupt and stuff and are secretly executing some bunch of do-gooders protesting against the Trackers. This doesn&apos;t sit well with Don &quot;The Wilson&quot; Dragon, who becomes a turn coat and gets a tracker set on him as a result. All he wanted to do was pine after his departed wife while talking to his robot house, Agnes 4000 (Agnes?).\n\nSo now The &quot;Dragon Don&quot; Wilson is being chased by a Robo-Tracker of the Cyber Cop variety, and that would be enough to put a dampner on someone&apos;s day, but he&apos;s also got another enemy on his tail: Richard Norton of City Hunter fame. Richard (great hair man, great hair) thinks that these cyber skinheads aren&apos;t too good (and he&apos;s right) and he also thinks that he would be better at kicking Dragon Ball &apos;W&apos;&apos;s arse (and he&apos;s wrong), which leads to a bizarre half kickboxing, half rolling around on the floor fight.\n\nFull of cars and trucks exploding, people firing several tons worth of bullets at each other, kickboxing and evil company bosses, Cyber Tracker probably contains enough action to keep your mind off your life for an hour and a half. They even through in a shower scene with Dragson Won Ildon for those who like to see Kickboxing champions have a shower.\n\nBears no resemblance at all to Robocop, Terminator, Cyborg Cop, Cyborg Cop 2, Cyborg, Atomic Cyborg or Gofrey Ho&apos;s Robo Vampire (where it all started, I believe).",

Cant wait to see the third one, if there is one. \n\nTo be honest, I think the editing sucked in the movie cos at some points, there was no transition. Also, the director should have considered making a 2 hour 15 minute movie instead of the 1 hour 57 minutes. But it was good regardless. The movie was well written and had a lot of humor. The actors did a great job. The cinematographer was good too. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the editing. \n\nI don&apos;t want to spoil the movie by discussing about it. But I will be back after it releases on the 30th. Hope it gets released nationwide so that more people will know about the Saints.",

Many use the documentary &apos;Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music&apos; as the ultimate example of a music-doco, but whilst the music in The Last Waltz is actually on par with the great performances of Woodstock (bar Jimi Hendrix[there&apos;s no substitute]), the thing which elevates The Last Waltz is the photography.\n\n This was the first music doco to be shot on 35mm and watching the concert, you&apos;d think that each performance was carefully choregraphed over a few weeks of shooting rather than over one night. Special thanks must be given to Cinematogrpaher Michael Chapman for his efforts on this film. The look of the film is what elevates it&apos;s overall appeal, because the music was always going to be epic, especially with the cavalcade of great names performing. This is just great filmmaking from contemporary cinema&apos;s most accomplished filmmaker. And how about that haunting theme that both starts and ends the film. Just great."

      "reviewBody": "This was the fourth and final offering in the Rutherford/Marple quartet of old English masterpieces. As good as it was though - and it did not let us down as yet another reminder of how quaint some parts of a middle class England of yesteryear were - this was, perhaps, the least riveting of the great Dame&apos;s portrayal of the delightful Miss Marple.\n\nFor those who are interested in locations, the centrepiece of the tale, H.M.S.Battledore, was anchored in the bay betwixt Falmouth and St.Mawes (in cushty Cornwall) with the latter named small town providing the backdrop for the thefts of the scallywags who were supposed to be being reformed as part of a trust initiative to aid young men who had been led astray. From the outset of the plot, a &apos;snuff&apos; murder way ahead of its time, we were kept on our toes as Miss Marple (as ever, ably assisted by her elderly beau, Mr.Stringer) weaved her way through the suspects aboard that fabulous old ship which looks as if it has just been vacated by Drake or Nelson. Nevertheless, the contemporary Captain, played to perfection (by Lionel Jeffries) with a mixture of &apos;old sea salt&apos; zest and a zany personality unmatched by the rest of the crew, almost upstages the film&apos;s star with his demeanour ranging from the seeming son of Blackbeard through to a sort of Peter Pan who has lived all his dreams and desires of great seamanship within a perpetual stone&apos;s throw of land.\n\nThe sword fight at the end may ahve been a bit naff - but it didn&apos;t matter, we knew who would win as Jane was bound to have been a fencing champion of some sort in her merry old past.  But what was surprsing was that this proved to be the last of a proven fromula that ought to have been repeated many times over.\n\nA thoroughly good yarn - best watched with a flaggon of cider to keep one&apos;s whistle wet!",

As much as you might hate him personally, he knows a good story when he sees one.\n\nThis film I had heard very little about, I knew it had something to do with war, but not much else. Seems it is highly underrated. I&apos;m not even sure if it had a theatrical release or not.\n\nWhen the film opened I was pretty skeptical. It seemed boring as all hell. Slow moving. Not very interesting. Military guy, yadda yadda. The opening was tinted with confusing &quot;flashback&quot; type scenes, boring paranorama or desolated wasteland that wasn&apos;t explained and other apocalyptic type scenes that didn&apos;t seem to fit into the rest of the movie. I kind of started losing interest and was barely paying attention, when all of a sudden...\n\nThe movie took a crazy turn, and I realized what was really going on, and why everything seemed confusing and off with the timing. It all came together, and I was sincerely impressed.\n\nThe music is a little over the top and too sentimental at a lot of parts, but the story is very well written. You just don&apos;t realize it at first how brilliant it is.\n\n7/10 because the first part was so confusing and I felt a lot of the music was bad and just distracted from what was happening.",

It is film that is meant to show you exactly what it takes and the dedication that these female boxers have to this sport. It was an honest film, showing the dangerous aspects but also a very touching film because it showed how powerful these women could be in this sport (especially touching to another boxer like myself). I fully went into this movie thinking it was gonna make boxing look just like a brutal, gladiator type of sport, and came out surprising happy.

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s see - you&apos;re a classically trained singer with a gorgeous voice, you&apos;re pretty, a good actress, highly paid...and all you want is to get out of show business.\n\nThat&apos;s Deanna Durbin&apos;s story, and thank goodness, she didn&apos;t get her wish until she made films like &quot;It Started with Eve,&quot; also starring Charles Laughton and Robert Cummings.\n\nDurbin plays Anne Terry, a hat check girl trying to make it as a classical singer. One night, she is drafted by Johnny Reynolds Jr. (Cummings) who believes his father (Laughton) is dying. His father has insisted on meeting his fiancÃ©e, but when Johnny returns to the hotel to find her, she and her mother (Margaret Tallichet and Catherine Doucet) aren&apos;t in their room. Desperate, he offers Anne money if she will pose as his fiancÃ©e. Anne wants to return home to her family, so the money will come in handy. She accompanies him to his father&apos;s deathbed.\n\nWell, Jonathan Reynolds Sr. rallies! He&apos;s not going to die, and his son may well -- he now has two fiancÃ©es. Jonathan Sr. plans a party for all his high falutin&apos; friends, including people like Leopold Stokowski, to meet Anne and to have her sing for them.\n\nJohnny Jr. is in a pickle and tells Anne that he will say that they broke up and then introduce his father to his real fiancÃ©e, whom Reynolds Sr.&apos;s doctor will bring to the house. But Anne wants to sing at the party, so after he announces the big breakup, Anne rushes in and begs forgiveness.\n\nRobert Cummings, a huge star in television, was usually second tier in films. He always excelled in comedy, and he does a great job here. Laughton, playing a man who&apos;s supposedly dying, looks quite gaunt and is, of course, marvelous as a man who has a great relationship with Anne and grows fond of her.\n\nDeanna Durbin herself acts and sings like a dream and looks beautiful. Her warm personality shines through. She sings &quot;Clavelitos,&quot; &quot;Goin&apos; Home,&quot; &quot;When I Sing,&quot; and &quot;Ahi, viene la conga&quot; impressively.\n\n&quot;It Started with Eve,&quot; is a fast-moving, fun, highly entertaining film with moments of poignancy. This film marked the end of Deanna Durbin&apos;s work with producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster; Pasternak went to MGM, and Deanna went on suspension for turning down a script. In the end, she was given approval of her directors, stories and songs.\n\nHard to believe this songbird, now 90, retired at the age of 26 and never looked back. It&apos;s a tribute to her that 64 years post-retirement, Deanna Durbin still has plenty of fans.",

Anne wants to move to New York and has an argument with Jon while driving on the road. She distracts with an impatient driver and has a car accident with a truck where Jon loses his right hand. The hand is not found and Jon needs to use prosthesis. They move to New York and his editor Karen Wagner (Rosemary Murphy) offers another cartoonist to proceed with &quot;Mandro&quot;. However Jon is not happy with the modifications introduced in his character by the new cartoonist and Karen let him go.\n\nWithout money, Jon moves to California to teach in a college while Anne and Lizzie stay in New York for a few more months. Jon has a love affair with his student Stella Roche (Annie McEnroe) and he feels attracted by her. However when his colleague Brian Ferguson (Bruce McGill) tells that Stella is an easy woman, Jon does not want to see her. However, his severed hand kills Stella and when Brian tells that he is going to the police to report that Stella is missing, his hand also kills him. Meanwhile Anne and Lizzie come to his house to spend Christmas with him. Soon he learns that Anne is betraying him and that she intends to go to Los Angeles with Lizzie. Out of the blue, his hand tries to strangle Anne and Jon follows it. Is it possible that the hand does exist to kill whoever anger him?\n\n&quot;The Hand&quot; is an early film directed by Oliver Stone with a creepy story. The plot is developed in slow pace and the mystery remains until the last scene when the viewer finally understands what happened. Michael Caine has a great performance as usual and the movie is intriguing and engaging. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A MÃ£o&quot; (&quot;The Hand&quot;)",

The same team that made that movie a success got together to create another pumped up movie. \n\n Cruise plays Cole Trickle, a very cocky and smooth indy car driver that lost his ride and decided to head to NASCAR with team owner Tim Daland,(Randy Quaid), and be coached by legendary crew chief Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall). During the Daytona 500 Cole and nemesis Rowdy Burns are involved in a nasty wreck that hospitalizes both of them and threaten to end their careers.  They become friends but Cole realizes his mortality and must overcome it if he is to ever race effectively again. \n\nThis has better romantic chemistry than Top Gun.  Due in part to the fact that Cruise and Kidman really were attracted to each other and we know the rest is history.  The action scenes are great and filmed superbly.  It&apos;s also a very loud movie.  It received an Oscar nomination for best sound. It&apos;s just another mindless action movie to help relieve boredom.  7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "TARZAN&apos;S FIGHT FOR LIFE (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1958), a Sol Lesser production, directed by H Bruce Humberstone, marks Gordon Scott&apos;s third go-round as the jungle warlord and the second in color (compliments of MetroColor). After two prior Tarzan adventures where the title character goes solo without his mate nor son, this edition returns to formula material commonly found in the 1940s starring Johnny Weissmuller where the plots revolved around Tarzan, Jane and their son, Boy. As with the latter Weissmuller entries, the Jane character, played then by Brenda Joyce from 1945-1949, enacted here by Eve Brent, is also blonde, this time wearing lipstick in certain scenes! The adopted son is not characterized as Boy, the name earlier used for Johnny Sheffield&apos;s carnation during his performance in eight entries (1939-1947), is now performed by Rickie Sorensen going under a new name of Tartu. There is still Cheta, however.\n\nThe story begins with Doctor Sturdy (Carl Benton-Reid) of the Medical Association, experimenting in a native hospital in Randini accompanied by his daughter, Anne (Jil Jarmyn). Hoping to fine a cure for a fever that had earlier killed a tribal chief in the distant village of Nigasso, Futa (James Edwards) does what he can to keep his tribe from accepting Sturdy&apos;s modern medical efforts of curing the sick in favor of using traditional witch doctor and black magic. Because the tribe shows no appreciation for her father&apos;s dedication in his hard work, Anne wants for them to leave before the natives turn hostile and form an attack towards them. Arriving to join Sturdy is Ken Warwick (Harry Lauter), arriving from England after two years of medical school in England. As the tribe comes to attack Anne and Ken, Tarzan (Gordon Scott) arrives in time to rescue them. Being a friend of the Nigasso tribe, Tarzan tries to learn from Futa why he and his tribe cannot be civil. Moments after their talk, one of the native girls is attacked by a crocodile. Tarzan dives into the water to bring her back to safety. Because the bite on her leg has caused a great loss of blood, Tarzan goes against Futa&apos;s orders by taking the injured native girl and placed under Sturdy&apos;s care. Though the native girl&apos;s leg is amputated, she later dies. Only because Tarzan continues to support Sturdy&apos;s medical methods does he become the enemy of Futa&apos;s tribe. During the course of the story, Tarzan&apos;s mate, Jane (Eve Brent) suffers from appendix pain, forcing Tarzan and son, Tartu (Rickie Sorensen, to immediately take Jane by down the river by canoe for emergency operation by Sturdy. Later Molo (Nick Stewart) comes to the hospital to carry on Futa&apos;s vengeful attempt to kill Jane in her hospital bed. When all fails, Futa orders to have Tarzan captured and bound so he could be sacrificed by having his heart taken from his body.\n\nAn acceptable production being a bit longer than usual (86 minutes), TARZAN&apos;S FIGHT FOR LIFE offers enough material reminiscent to the older &quot;Tarzan&quot; formula of the Weissmuller days, including Tarzan and Jane kissing and having their leisurely play swim in the lake. Tarzan even shows he has his fight for life when combating realistically with a giant python. Here&apos;s one added bonus: Tarzan riding through the jungle on a giraffe. Some actual African jungle photography mixed with indoor sets along with color add greatly to its background and scenery. Then there&apos;s the chimpanzee, Cheta, this time sporting a loincloth around its waist like her master, Tarzan, allowing time for comedy relief with his junior Tarzan companion. Rickie Sorensen, around age nine here, does what&apos;s expected for little Tarzan. His character is never fully explained who he is or where he came from except that he&apos;s adopted by Tarzan and Jane. There must have been an orphanage nearby as opposed to Tarzan finding an orphan boy somewhere in the jungle and taking him home to Jane as was done in TARZAN FINDS A SON (1939) and TARZAN&apos;S SAVAGE FURY (1952). James Edwards, who did a masterful job in his debut film of HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949), is nearly unrecognizable playing the evil warrior chief, supported by Woody Strode (Ramo); Roy Glenn (The High Counselor); and Milton Woody (The Temple Native). Gordon Scott shows himself to be better muscular and agreeable to the latest Tarzan of the 1950s, a role he would continue to play belting out his Tarzan call until 1960.\n\nAside from frequent broadcasts on commercial television in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, this and other Tarzan adventures have played on cable television as well, especially American Movie Classics (1997-2000) and Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: August 5, 2010). Though this was to be the final theatrical Tarzan adventure to include the nostalgic feel revolving around the Tarzan family trio, Scott, Brent and Sorensen united together once more in 1958 for a proposed television series that never sold, in which three episodes were edited together to form another feature-length venture titled TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS. Of the two, TARZAN&apos;S FIGHT FOR LIFE is much better. (***)",

He reasons why the west is in war with the Muslim world and then explains that in war times unbelievers have no rights. Also, and independent of this, any contract that is not based on the Quran is null and void. Hence the upright Muslim must feel no shame for taking the fight wherever he chooses to.\n\nI must admit that I liked his point of view, it&apos;s such a nice response to the Hamburg bourgeois dealings that I can&apos;t help myself thinking: &quot;Wow, they finally met!&quot; As clear as the picture within this film is, it&apos;s of course a partial picture. Nevertheless it&apos;s interesting, because it shows that there are more things out there in the dark than we usually suspect.",

The ideas are different, though there are many elements of black humor, criticism of machos&apos; vices, The critical idea is the didactic message of the film. The film reminds that people would not die of hunger if more money are spent not for creating ads to increase turnover, also true critical insights about consumerism, the idea that advertising in many cases sell only dreams for some time.\n\nThe plot of the film is also full of visual experiments, some elements of animated cartoons, some repeated episodes which get more meaning at the end of the movie. Also the end of the film obviously make the viewer think more deeply about the nature of the change of the human being discarding commercial things.\n\nIt is worth to spend time watching this French film full of experiments and critical ideas about consumerism.\n\nThe book of Begbeider and the film are truly two different things, which add more ideas about critical insights about consumerism, advertising business.",

      "reviewBody": "Rent this film...now! This is ineptness at its most sublime, a turd of a straight-to-video flick that is so bad you&apos;ll swear the filmmakers tried to make it as crappy as possible. The box cover shows Dennis Hopper (who is in the &quot;film&quot; for about 5 minutes...he must have needed some money...bad) and Michael Madsen (who wears a police shirt far too small for him...I guess they couldn&apos;t afford a plus-size cop shirt from the local surplus) and completely ignores the two lead actors. There&apos;s some plotline about corrupt cops and such but who cares? Just sit back and laugh at: The big old fat dude getting &quot;hit&quot; in the face with the stock of a shotgun (despite the fact that the gun is about ten feet away from the guy), the old homeless dude getting hit by a car while &quot;sad&quot; music plays on the soundtrack (isn&apos;t there a better way to kill someone?), Michael Madsen swinging his arms around rapidly whenever he talks (you know when someone tucks their arms behind their back and someone behind them does overdone hand motions trying to simulate the movements of their arms? That&apos;s what this looks like to the tenth degree) and finally (and this is the best part!) the police officer having the wildest orgasms ever (I swear this guy overdoes his orgasms more than any porn actress I&apos;ve ever seen...I mean the way the guy&apos;s face contorts and distorts he looks like someone&apos;s knifing him in the back...and all this while his lover just sits there...seemingly bored).\n\nAnycrap, if you love bad films see this one. It&apos;ll be some of the best fun you&apos;ve ever had in your short life."

The woman who does the voice of Riley and Huey Freeman reluctantly portraying Tina Turner, with Sandra Bullock behind her moving her arms in a Tina-eque fashion Â– nice. The metatextualism of folks commenting on the Shatner&apos;s singing Â– nice. There was even a visual shout out to Star Trek&apos;s &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; that I found quite charming. The frantic car chase to save the victims with a dancer&apos;s feathered headdress streaming out of the skylight; good fun. I&apos;m a sucker for a costume drama that involves fights and shiny things. And I do like the way Sandra snorts. \n\nBut . . . it just didn&apos;t cohere. It couldn&apos;t decide if it was supposed to be slapstick or comic drama; couldn&apos;t decide if it was absurdist or plausible. The lead&apos;s transformation into a glamor queen just wasn&apos;t psychologically or dramatically convincing. \n\nThere was true talent in this film. Real charisma. But it was lazy. One more hard edit of the script, and I think this could have been a fine film. But someone started filming before they had that final edit, and no one made up for it anywhere along the line.",

It wasn&apos;t just the romance I liked, though - I also liked the straight sister&apos;s fiancÃ© and her little wedding in the backyard, and the parents dealing with a family medical issue. I understand why some people wouldn&apos;t like it, because they equate &apos;cute&apos; with &apos;sappy&apos;. And that&apos;s fine.

      "reviewBody": "This film, &quot;The Infernal Caldron&quot; is a single-scene trick film by Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, who made many such subjects, which creatively exploited cinematic techniques, mostly substitution splices and multiple-exposure photography. This film is the earliest one that I recall where the filmmaker used multiple exposures to create such indistinguishable ghostly images. I know that he had made ghosts or spirits with the technique before, such as in &quot;A Fantastical Meal&quot; (1900), as had other early filmmakers, but those ghosts that I&apos;ve seen are distinguished as human lookingâ€”only fainter or more transparent in appearance than the living. The trick for the blurry ghost blobs in &quot;The Infernal Caldron&quot; was to alter the lens to go out of focus for their exposure. MÃ©liÃ¨s repeated the trick for his next film, &quot;Apparitions&quot; (Le Revenant)(1903).\n\nAdditionally, this particular trick film remains appealing today because it&apos;s available in a vibrant hand-colored print. The color especially aids in making the fire red, as well as bringing attention to the dÃ©cor and costumes. In the film, the director plays a demon who places people in a cauldron. The out-of-focus spirits fly out of the cauldron and then transform into fireballs. There are quite a few macabre little pictures among MÃ©liÃ¨s&apos;s surviving films, but this is one of my favorites.\n\nP.S. Many, if not most, of MÃ©liÃ¨s&apos;s films were offered to be hand-painted for exhibitors (for an additional fee). Most films from this era are lost, and many of the films that do survive and that were in color have lost their paint over time or only remain in prints that weren&apos;t colorized. An all-female staff headed by a Madame Thullier, reportedly, provided the color for all such Star Films, from 1896 or 1897 to 1910, as well as for other French studios. The coloring was done manually in an assembly-line procedure, film-by-film, frame-by-frame, with each laborer specializing in a certain color. Otherwise, some fairground exhibitors may have colored their own prints to cut costs. Later, PathÃ©&apos;s stencil process made coloring easier and more consistent (main source: Frazer, &quot;Artificially Arranged Scenes&quot;)."

      "reviewBody": "This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

      "reviewBody": "So in a plot that almost immediately makes you think of 28 Days Later, a possibly mad scientist inadvertently creates a deadly rabies-like virus while experimenting on the brain of a baboon to try and reanimate dead brain cells or whatever, that gradually transforms its victims into mostly mindless bloodthirsty savages, and when a shaggy-haired young student journalist breaks into the lab looking for a scoop gets bitten by the maddened creature, a slaughter looms unless the infected can be stopped! This frankly wasn&apos;t that much of a movie, and I&apos;d never ever heard of it, but I was entertained and engaged enough while watching it, I liked how everything was eighties to the max and everyone had the hair shaped like a helmet and was rocking the colourful and very tight sweatpants! It&apos;s probably one of the most eighties horror movies ever made, I found that side of it quite cute! I thought it had a really weird atmosphere, it looked very American, but it felt distinctly like an Italian horror movie, there are certain unmistakable similarities to Argento&apos;s Demons movies, like how the fully infected act and when the soundtrack would spontaneously turn into fast metal during the action scenes! Some of the acting was downright bizarre, the trio of crazy bro-bullies who were pretty shameless about their nasty intentions towards the opposite sex are so dumb and over the top they&apos;re like live-action cartoons until they get infected and actually become a little scary as they descend on the big Halloween hi-school party like three jacked-up murderous Sketetors! Patrick Lowe was about as wooden and boring as his more famous brother, and he didn&apos;t do too much of anything except flee from the savage infected and try to look as cute as possible as he popped up in his silly little red motorbike. The most effective actors in the movie for me were Sara Burton and Mitch Williams as they slowly lost their minds to the rage and struggle not to kill their friends, except for the ridiculous ape sounds that he made! Whether it was because of budget reasons or not, I thought it played it a little safe in terms of the horror, I mean only a handful of people get infected and are killed during the big Halloween bash which I thought was the best part of the movie because I loved the costumes and how some of the movie played into a few of the victims&apos; deaths in a darkly comedic way, it still needed a lot more blood though, which is too bad because when there was gore it was quite brutal and effective! So for me Primal Rage the movie not the video game, is definitely not a good movie but it&apos;s a fun entertaining little romp that&apos;s very enjoyable in an unintentionally bad kind of way, not nearly amongst the horror greats of the 80s but I liked it for the idea, the goofy 80s fun factor, the infected raving savages are genuinely scary and it&apos;s a pretty fun watch. Worth seeing if you never have for a harmless bit of old school bloody horror fun! X.",

Antares focuses on three women, whose paths cross in a building complex. A married nurse who has a lover that hardly speaks. The lover is only interested in sex and taking nude pictures of her. The sex and pictures are a tad explicit. The other is a young girl who is lying to her boyfriend that she is pregnant. The boyfriend is happy, but that does not stop him from sleeping with the third woman, a divorced woman who has problems getting rid of her ex-husband. The three destinies bond together in a refined way.",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins with a group of outlaws led by a man named &quot;Sandy Cassel&quot; (George Martin) attacking a peaceful ranch and, after killing several cowboys, stealing all of the horses in the corral. Not long after that, having witnessed part of the shootout between the horse thieves and the ranch hands, a smaller group of cowboys led by a man named &quot;Billy Mack&quot; (Craig Hill) negotiates with the widowed owner of the ranch to retrieve the stolen horses--for a price. After she accepts the offer, Billy Mack&apos;s men ride off in search of the horses. The scene then shifts to yet another widow by the name of &quot;Mrs. Cook&quot; (Margarita Lozano) helping one of her daughters named &quot;Anne Cook&quot; (Maria Montez) prepare for her wedding scheduled for the next day. As fate would have it, however, Sandy Cassel&apos;s men just happen to appear and politely ask to stay for the night with a promise to leave in the morning. Mrs. Cook graciously agrees and tells them they can sleep in the barn. It&apos;s then that Billy Mack appears with his men and they are also allowed to stay the night as well. Unfortunately, not long afterward, a man slips into the house and brutally kills Mrs. Cook, Anne and the younger daughter &quot;Elizabeth Cook&quot; (Eleonora Brown). Needless to say, when the word gets out about what has happened, both Sandy and Billy Mack are quite upset. Unfortunately, they have no time to find the guilty culprit because the news has also reached the citizens of a nearby town and an extremely large posse is headed their way--and they are determined to see each and every one of them hanged. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a rather disappointing Spaghetti western due in large part to the way the numerous subplots were connected with one another. Nothing seemed to flow together very well and that made everything seem quite uneven. Likewise, considering that the horse thieves had previously murdered several ranch hands in cold blood, it was hard to feel any sympathy for them when the lynch mob started closing in on them. Be that as it may, I don&apos;t consider this to be one of the better Spanish-Italian efforts and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",

A casual meeting with aspiring Fascist &quot;Astarita&quot; (Raymond Pellegrin), however, soon puts that plan on the fire - especially as he clearly has designs her himself. She&apos;s a bit despondent and turns to the game to make her living. At times she comes across as almost desperate for love, for attention - yep, even sex, but perhaps when she meets &quot;Mino&quot; (Daniel GÃ©lin) she might find some sort of purpose in life? Well the fly in that ointment is that he&apos;s a committed anti-Fascist and is known to the authorities. With him taking risks on a daily basis and her in possession of some fairly profound news, is there any hope for redemption for her and happiness for them? This is certainly one of Lollobrigida&apos;s better efforts as she tackles this role with quite a degree authenticity. There&apos;s virtually no glamour for her to hide behind and she delivers with a rawness as the young woman whose options are largely limited by her looks - a situation common to many women at the time. The choices of men her character makes are maybe not the best but both GÃ©lin and Pellegrin provide solid foils as the story develops juggling romance with elements of politics and crime. It&apos;s touching at times, steadily paced and well worth a couple of hours, I&apos;d say.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I want to be a soldier&quot; is a wonderful movie for all the wrong reasons. The general plot follows the vicissitudes of Alex; he is a child who wanted to be an astronaut and had an astronaut imaginary friend, up until his parents bought him his own TV. Since the TV shows lots of violent acts like shootings, murders and war movies, Alex is now a violent 10-year-old who wants to be a soldier (and has a US officer as his new imaginary friend).\n\nThe direction is quite poor in and of itself. A good portion of the movie consists of the main character monologuing about being a soldier so he can kill people, torture prisoners, make Nazi-like experiments on his victims, become a dictator and so on, while a collage of violent stock footage runs on the screen. This happens quite often, too, and I think makes at least 25-30% of the whole movie.\n\nThe characters are about as stereotyped as possible, what with Alex hanging around with the geeky kid when he&apos;s &quot;good&quot; and then with some bullies who smoke and have knifes after he switches over to the &quot;bad&quot; side. Alex&apos;s family is about as clichÃ© as possible, with the mother being obsessed with the newborn twins, the father having an affair and both dismissing their kid&apos;s behavior as &quot;a phase&quot;.\n\nThe &quot;imaginary friend&quot; concept is sort of nice and adds an interesting layer to the movie as both friends (astronaut and officer) are played by the same actor, and they switch roles depending on the phase Alex is currently in. It&apos;s not enough to save the movie from its silliness, though.\n\n&quot;I want to be a soldier&quot; is quite enjoyable to watch for its &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; wackiness and its unending stream of dumb plot devices that ultimately end up in Danny Glover stating how &quot;TV is evil&quot;. However, it&apos;s far from a good movie if taken seriously. I can only suggest you rent this film if you&apos;re smashed and/or in for a laugh with some friends.",

They both have to come to terms with their fears. Clay is forced to face up to the fact that he is running away from himself and that he has to reassess his life. Gabriel learns to face the fact that his mother is to marry again and that he will have a stepfather, whom he comes to accept by the end of the film. The empathy between Dean Cain and Kristen de la Osa was the cornerstone of the story. They say never act with children but Dean was totally at ease with Kristen. Both turned in outstanding performances. The Puerto Rican scenery was another bonus, to this film which is suitable for all ages. Do not miss it, it is a must for all Dean Cain fans. The only downside of this film, to me, was the fact that we have wait quarter of an hour before Dean Cain appears but his appearance with worth waiting for.",

      "reviewBody": "Amended version. Aleksander Ford&apos;s life story is more interesting than his films (I&apos;ve seen three.) He was Jewish, became a Marxist in his youth, directed his first film when he was 21 and was one of Poland&apos;s leading directors throughout the 30s. Escaping to the Soviet Union when the Nazis invaded he became head of the Polish People&apos;s Army film crew, and when the Soviets &quot;liberated&quot; Poland he became the leading director there. He was head of Film Polski, able to censor colleagues&apos; efforts, and even denounced one colleague to the NKVD, leading to the man&apos;s arrest and torture and the end of his career in features. Ford was also professor of the National Film School in Lodz, where his pupils included Wadja and Polanski. Then things went wrong. His proteges outshone him, starting with Wajda&apos;s great war trilogy, and in 1968 the party he&apos;s served so slavishly expelled him.....for being Jewish (Gomulka&apos;s anti-Semitic purge.) He want into exile and finally committed suicide in, of all places, Florida. Before his fall he&apos;d been entrusted with two big-budget nationalist films, &quot;Young Chopin&quot; (1952) and &quot;Knights of the Teutonic Order&quot;, also known as &quot;Black Cross&quot; (1960.) The latter is way too long, and I gave up long before the end. Both film are unlikely to appeal to non-Polish viewers, as the host of historical characters will be unknown to them, and both are frankly dull. &quot;First Day of Freedom&quot;, the last film he made before his fall, is more accessible and interesting. It&apos;s set in 1945, like many films, but the basic premise (released Polish POWs arrive in an abandoned German town, where they meet a German doctor and his daughters) is an unusual one, and although the stage origins are plain it held my interest and has a strong ending. It also benefits from two strong leads, Tadeusz Lomnicki and Beata Tyszkiewicz, who will be known to film buffs for their work in films made by later, better and less conformist Polish directors. If the above hasn&apos;t put you off, these three films are all available on DVD with English subtitles, from companies I&apos;m not allowed to mention!",

      "reviewBody": "As much as I admire Trish VanDevere, this 1980 movie-of-the-week just doesn&apos;t cut it. A recently divorced woman moves into her late aunt&apos;s old house in the woods, only to be haunted by eerie figures and an old black hearse that appears to want to kill her. As she tries to figure out what&apos;s what, the lonely woman meets several locals, including a less-than-friendly general store proprietor, a hulking, horny sheriff, a nasty real estate agent and a guy her age who seems too good to be true. This low-budget effort, slightly reminiscent of a ghost flick VanDevere shot the same year with husband George C. Scott, apparently started out as a slasher flick but was turned into a haunted house/witchcraft thriller. A muddled plot and sloppy editing doesn&apos;t help. For genre fans only.",

      "reviewBody": "The band of the nasty Mexican named Porfirio Carranza (Fernando Sancho) and his bandits trespass the frontier and occupy a mansion . Our hero named Logan (Lang Jeffries who married Rhonda Fleming) is a bounty hunter who wears a leopard poncho and riding on a mule . He returns his ranch and seeks vengeance against Carranza&apos;s hoodlums who kill , mistreat countrymen and lash a young (Sancho Gracia). Logan confronts underlings and it is narrated by means of three flashbacks in which take place three showdowns against the mestizo Aldo Sambrell , the dreary gunfighter dressed in black played by Carlo Gaddi and the elegant Ruben Rojo who double-crosses his chief with the Eurobabe Femi Benussi . Meanwhile Carranza hanging villagers and putting a poster of warning in Spanish language saying : Â¨ SI ALARGAS LAS OREJAS PUEDES ALARGAR EL CUELLOÂ¨ . Logan has a special date for his bloody vendetta , April 17, 1867 , when takes place a sun eclipse .\n\nIt is an exciting but uneven western with breathtaking gun-play between the weird protagonist Lang Jeffries against the heartless Fernando Sancho and his hoodlums . Lang is fine , he ravages the screen , shoots , kills , hit and run . In the film premiere attained bit success ; however , being nowadays best valued and I think it turns out to be a decent Spaghetti-Chorizo Western . Aldo Sambrell and Carlo Gaddi as two cruelly baddie roles are terrific , they bear hysterical and mocking aspect , subsequently they would play similar characters . The film packs violence , shootouts , high body-count and being fast-moving and quite entertaining . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em ups or stunts every few minutes . Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors , dirty and rocky landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine set on the manor . The musician Angelo Francesco Lavagnino composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted ; it is full of strange sounds and haunting musical background . Striking cinematography by Mario Pacheco who reflects a colorful eclipse and barrens exteriors from Almeria . Outdoor sequences filmed at Spanish places located on Colmenar Viejo , and of course , Almeria . The movie gets the usual Western issues , such as avenger antiheroes , violent facing off , quick zooms , exaggerated baddies , soundtrack with Morricone influence , among them . There appears as notorious secondaries the regulars in Spanish/Italian Western , such as : Aldo Sambrell (Sergio Leone&apos;s usual) , Angel Alvarez (Django) , Ruben Rojo , Sancho Gracia (800 bullets) and a future prestigious actress , Marisa Paredes (AlmodÃ³var customary) . Special mention for Fernando Sancho in his ordinary role as fatty Mexican bandit . This motion picture produced by Sergio Newman was professionally directed by Jose Luis Merino and Eugenio Martin or Gene Martin . Jose Luis Merino made some Westerns (More dollars for the MacGregor , Kitosch the man who came from the north) and horror movies (Terror of the living dead , Scream of the demon lover) . And Eugenio Martin is a terror movies expert (Hypnosis , A candle for the devil , The fourth Mrs Anderson and the classic Horror express) and Spaghetti Western (Pancho Villa , The ugly ones , Bad man&apos;s river ). Rating : Acceptable and passable Spaghetti Western , well worth watching .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Rose&quot; -which they say was inspired by Joplin&apos;s life- has stood the test of time quite well;the main reason is Bette Middler&apos;s sensational performance .She has not still yet found another part as rewarding as Rose .Full of strong scenes and of extraordinary renditions (the title track and &quot;when a man loves a woman&quot; particularly),it grabs you till the last picture (a light which goes out).The scene in the gay nightclub where another Rose,&quot;Diana Ross&quot; and &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; join the singer for a song is almost scary.So is that scene when a respectable country singer -Rose covered one of his songs - treats the poor girl like dirt ,this man must be a saint or else he is a hypocrite:could you imagine ,say,Kris Kristofferson blaming Janis Joplin for covering &quot;Me and Bobby McGee &quot; ,a tune she took to number one ? With fine support from Alan Bates as the evil manager and Frederick Forrest as the big hearted deserter,&quot;the rose&quot; still remains one of the best film about the cruel thankless world of rock.It avoids the mistakes of movies dealing with true stars (Ray Manzarek did not think much of &quot;the Doors&quot; )."

      "reviewBody": "Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.\n\nMost of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.\n\nRe stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.\n\nFor me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.\n\nGiven that theme, the movie&apos;s style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.\n\nBe careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.\n\nBut still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.\n\nSure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.\n\nTo me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.\n\nBut that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.\n\nPlus the drones looked really really cool.\n\nRe copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.\n\nI think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews.",

The film had to end some way and this one lands with a loud thud.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; is truly an actor&apos;s movie, and it is one of those rare films where every single actor is perfect.  \n\nPaul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are both brilliant as Brick and Maggie Pollitt, respectively.  Not very often is there a screen couple that have the same chemistry together that they do.\n\nNewman, however, steals the show.  If you watch &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; for nothing else, watch it for his performance.  One of the greatest actors of all time, Newman showcases how powerful an actor he can be.  This is not to say the supporting cast isn&apos;t excellent.  Burl Ives is superb in a supporting role as Big Daddy, a man who&apos;s greatest concern is having his legacy live on after him.  The sequence with Ives and Newman in the basement of the house remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.\n\n&quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; is a very appropriate title.  It is a searing, wonderfully acted film that I will not soon forget.  I recommend those who haven&apos;t seen it yet to rent it as soon as they get a chance.  A true classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Thoughts and comments on &quot;Prince of Space&quot;:\n\n~This movie tends to put me in mind of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series.  Both feature heros in silly costumes fighting villians in even sillier costumes, cheesy dialogue, half-baked schemes for world domination, and some very unconvincing secret identities.  The difference is that &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; a) is in easier to take half-hour instalments, b) has better dubbing and c) has the additional attraction of pondering just how the heroine gets her hair to do that pom-pom thing.  All we can ponder in &quot;Prince of Space&quot; is the aliens&apos; lack of dance belt technology, the less said of which the better.\n\n~Regarding those aliens, the beak-nosed men of the planet Krankor.  A scientist-type fellow tells us they&apos;ve come to Earth because they want a new rocket fuel he (the scientist) has developed.  A reporter points out, rather logically, that the Krankorites (Krankorians?  Krankish?) have already developed deep-space travel; why do they need our technology?  The scientist helpfully explains that the Krankian fuel industry is well behind our own. How they manage space travel at all with second-rate fuel is anyone&apos;s guess.\n\n~Then again, the Krankor mothership makes about four round trips to Earth in the course of the film.  Maybe if they conserved gas, they wouldn&apos;t need our help.\n\n~Both the Prince of Space (our, he-hem, &quot;hero&quot;) and Phantom of Krankor (the leader of the aliens) seem to be wearing one of those vinyl capes you can get at Wal-Mart for five bucks.  Both men also seem to be competing for the title of the World&apos;s Dumbest Laugh.  Krankor&apos;s &quot;Penguin from the old Batman series with asthma&quot; imitation probably wins, but PoS&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m saying &apos;ha, ha, ha!&apos; because that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s written in the script&quot; is a noble effort.\n\n~Speaking of voices, someone in the dubbing studio wasn&apos;t paying attention to pronunciation.  The main scientist&apos;s name is pronounced at various times Makken, Macon, Marken, and Mackie.\n\n~Much has been made of PoS&apos; constant reminders to the Krankies that their weapons won&apos;t work against him.  What gets me, though, is the point at which the Prince declares, &quot;Your weapons are useless, let&apos;s try bare hands now!&quot; Since the Kranks are perfectly happy firing their ineffective weapons, why challenge them to a fistfight?  Not that it matters, as their melee skills are just as bad as their range weaponry.\n\n~One of the kidnapped scientists bears a remarkable resemblance to Arthur Sullivan, except in one scene where the spirit gum has clearly worn off on one of his sideburns.\n\nI realize that I have now, of course, put far more thought into &quot;Prince of Space&quot; than anybody in the cast or crew ever did.  I know; it worries me too."

      "reviewBody": "Based upon a novel by Charles Spaak this could be seen as a variation on the theme of &apos;Lysistrata&apos; by Aristophanes, in which the women of Athens and Sparta deny their partners any sex until peace has been restored.\n\nIn Jacques Feyder&apos;s masterpiece from the Golden Age of French cinema the women of a Flemish town decide to bestow their favours on the occupying Spanish soldiers so as to avoid bloodshed. It must be said that once they have set eyes on their swarthy conquerers they do not require much persuasion and set about their task with relish.\n\nIt was this aspect in particular that caused so much outrage in certain quarters as it was seen to deride heroic resistance and to favour collaboration. Once war had broken out Goebbels had the film banned whilst the director and his actress wife Francoise Rosay were obliged to leave France to avoid the unwelcome attentions of the Gestapo.\n\nFeyder responded to criticism by saying that his intention was to celebrate the glories of his country&apos;s art from the Sixteenth and Seventeenth centuries. He has certainly succeeded in this as he and his team have us enabled to step into the world of Hals and Vermeer.\n\nUnder the supervision of legendary art director Georges WahkÃ©vitch an entire town was meticulously constructed in a Paris suburb, using cement, real steel and plaster instead of the usual papier machÃ© and cardboard. This, together with the cinematography of Harry Stradling, costume design of Georges K. Benda and luscious score by Louis Beydts all combine to give us a film that is in itself a work of art.\n\nIt would be well nigh impossible to assemble a cast of this quality now. The role of the Burgermaster&apos;s wife is probably the magnificent Francoise Rosay&apos;s most iconic. She is complemented by AndrÃ© Alerme&apos;s pompous and pusillanimous husband and the highly civilised Spanish nobleman of Jean Murat. In an early role Louis Jouvet effortlessly steals his scenes as a worldly monk. Every character is beautifully drawn and special mention must be made of Alfred Adam as the butcher and Lyne Clevers as the fish-wife.\n\nFollowing the rather sombre &apos;Pension Mimosas&apos;, Feyder felt the need to do something lighter and this mock-heroic farce is indisputably his greatest achievement. He once described himself as &apos;an artisan working in an industry.&apos; In this he was being unduly modest.",

      "reviewBody": "The Women in Prison genre was once saturated by the sleazy films of the likes of Jess Franco and Joe D&apos;Amato; but has all but died out since then and all we are left is the residue; which includes Shadow: Dead Riot. The film is something of a coming together of the aforementioned Women in Prison genre and the zombie genre; although by only giving fleeting glimpses of both, it fails to really nail down either one, and what we are left is a rather silly mess; although it is a sporadically entertaining mess. The film begins with execution of a prison inmate who goes by the name of Shadow. Shadow is apparently a mass murderer with voodoo powers (and just to give you an idea of the overall quality of the film; he&apos;s played by Tony Todd in a ridiculous wig!). Anyway, Shadow is killed and his death triggers some sort of curse on the prison. Years later; the prison has become a woman&apos;s prison and is welcoming a new arrival in the form of a chick called Solitaire. Solitaire apparently has some link with Shadow and her arrival triggers his second coming...\n\nThe film is obviously very low rent and anyone going into it is liable to know that; so it would be a bit pointless to say that the acting is atrociously wooden and ridiculous. My main reason for seeing this film was undoubtedly the presence of soft porn star Misty Mundae. She&apos;s bad in this film even by her own low acting standards; and her role is made even more disappointing by the fact that she&apos;s not in it for long. The only other name on the cast list likely to be recognised by horror fans belongs to the aforementioned Tony Todd...who picks up his pay cheque. The plot is always silly and ridiculous; but there are a couple of good ideas in there that keep things interesting. There are plenty of coincidences and plot holes too...so, as is often the case with films like this, it&apos;s best to turn your brain off before the film starts. The central plot involving the new prison inmates is actually one of the less interesting parts of the film, however, which brings it down. All in all, this is a decent way to kill ninety minutes and while film critics won&apos;t be impressed; if you like low budget trash, you might like this.",

It&apos;s a different thing to know it, give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it, but here, you get the feeling the screenwriters don&apos;t know it, characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows! (Remember &quot;Cube&quot;? Even that film knew more about itself.) \n\nI&apos;ve consumed a lot of 80&apos;s horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films. But a lot of important things are missing. We really know nothing about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines over and over again. The story isn&apos;t really developing - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is OK in this type of horror films, but there&apos;s not much to act in the script. We don&apos;t care about the characters. There&apos;s nothing to remember about them. There&apos;s not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no thrills, no chills.\n\nYou only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre. They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters don&apos;t really contribute anything for the story.\n\nI honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment. Oh yeah, film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended. Too bad really.",

      "reviewBody": "This is just another confirmation that Cassavetes, along with Dreyer and Tarkovsky, is one of the very small number of geniuses in film, whose every film is an extension of their genius -- some more mature than others, but impossible to be &quot;bad&quot;; they are beyond terms like &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; -- they are the great art works of the century.\n\nThis film isn&apos;t about a &quot;crazy&quot; lady; it&apos;s not about putting a woman in an institution; and it&apos;s not about people talking about your crazy wife, though all of this happens in the film. Those are merely the events that take place over the course of the film; what it&apos;s really about is our misunderstanding, our experience as an audience. Just like the characters, we misunderstand Mable&apos;s childlike actions. What Cassavetes does is turn *us* into children -- it&apos;s as if we&apos;re experiencing things for the first time all over again, because it&apos;s a totally new experience, the same with watching a movie like &quot;Andrei Rublev.&quot; That is an amazing thing to pass onto an audience. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve never been bored watching a Cassavetes film -- something is always happening, things are always changing. The reality of what we&apos;re seeing is always undergoing augmentation, so we can never get fully situated.\n\nIt&apos;s never unrelenting gloom the way many so-called realistic films are (and this film goes far beyond mere &quot;realism&quot;); it&apos;s devastating watching it, watching Mable ask people if they want spaghetti one by one. But it&apos;s loving when Nick jokes about someone hugging her too long. It&apos;s communal during a scene at a dinnertable where Mable takes a pride in feeding &quot;her boys.&quot; But each scene goes through a transformation as it happens. When Mable goes home with another man, he makes it clear that he&apos;s not to be used, but also that she shouldn&apos;t punish herself. It&apos;s not a screamy moment with a woman hiding in the bathroom; his avuncular twang is disarming.\n\nThere&apos;s a complete lack of self-consciousness in the film, and I mean that in terms of the characters (during Mable&apos;s key freak out scene, Rowlands does, I think, go too far) -- that&apos;s why the kids are s terrific in the film. When a boy says, &quot;It&apos;s the best I can do, mom,&quot; it&apos;s an incredible moment because it&apos;s managed to be included without being offensive, mugging for the camera with cuteness. The film has such a strange relationship with kids -- they&apos;re like little people. And if that sounds odd, you&apos;ll understand when you see the film. The characters are constantly changing their minds; they&apos;re so aware of themselves that they&apos;re unaware -- Mable doesn&apos;t realize she&apos;s giving off a sexual aura (despite the fact that Rowlands can at times look like a blond beach babe). As with Julianne Moore in &quot;Safe,&quot; we don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with her. She&apos;s a frenetic, guideless woman trying to do the guiding.\n\nThe way Cassavetes sets up the film, with ominous piano music that comes in when Falk is trying to speak, blinded by frustration; or setting the film inside this house with gigantic rooms, makes everything feel larger and emptier at the same time. It&apos;s like the scariness of the echo of something you&apos;d rather not hear. Someone said that they wouldn&apos;t want a single frame of &quot;2001&quot; to be cut, lest the experience be changed. I think that applies more aptly to Cassavetes&apos; films, because he never treads over the same thing twice, even when he&apos;s doing exactly the same thing he&apos;s just done. It&apos;s always something new. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "For those whose taste in movies runs to films of social significance, you cannot go wrong with The Stars Look Down, a film from the United Kingdom about the coal mining industry in the days before the post World War II Labour Government nationalized the industry. Such a step would never have been contemplated in the mainstream political circles in the USA. The film makes a compelling case for it.\n\nThis film was a breakout success for Carol Reed who up to that time had been limited to what we call B picture features and what over the other side of the pond call quota quickies. It was produced by an independent studio called Grafton films and released here by the short lived Grand National Studios. Reed was contracted to Gainsborough Pictures and he was able to get fellow contractees Michael Redgrave, Margaret Lockwood, and Emlyn Williams for this production.\n\nI don&apos;t think that Michael Redgrave was ever more idealistic on the screen than he was in The Stars Look Down. He plays a working class stiff who earns a scholarship to the university and he intends to use that education for the benefit of the miner class from where he comes. But this idealist is very human and he makes the wrong choice in a life partner in the form of pretty, but shallow Margaret Lockwood who sees him as a meal ticket to get ahead herself.\n\nThe guy who Lockwood was going with is Emlyn Williams who would be called a cad and a bounder over there. He&apos;s also a miner&apos;s kid, but his method of escape isn&apos;t exactly condoned in polite society, he becomes a bookmaker. Eventually he joins with management. One great thing about The Stars Look Down is we see where all these three characters came from and the values imparted to them.\n\nRedgrave has two marvelous scenes that really stand out. The first is when he&apos;s in class and making an eloquent case in class for the government ownership of the coal mines. The second is before the Board of Trade arguing that the mine his father and others in his district is not safe because where they want to mine is holding back the sea itself. His own personal problems prevent the Board from listening to him. In both Redgrave personifies youthful idealism and impatience. In the end it&apos;s shown he has good reason to be impatient.\n\nThe film was shot on location at an actual colliery in Cumberland and the scenes depicting the mine disaster which is the climax of the film are frighteningly real and hold up well today. The film stands comparison to How Green Was My Valley which was a film on the same subject, but done in the poetical style of John Ford and done over here. \n\nThe Stars Look Down will still move the viewers and the problems of industrial safety are just as real today as they were when The Stars Look Down came out.",

      "name": "Forlani&apos;s best performance, but not the most well written story",
      "reviewBody": "This movie has been released on DVD under the title &quot;Gone Dark&quot;. I&apos;m not sure why the title was changed, it doesn&apos;t help the story much. Basically the story is as follows: Forlani plays an undercover cop who has infiltrated a New York drug gang. To get closer to the main drug kingpin and gain his trust she becomes his girlfriend, and in the process she becomes addicted to heroin. To make matters even more complicated she is also involved with the kingpin&apos;s &quot;right hand man&quot; Denny, who happens to live in the same building as May, played by Lauren Bacall. \n\nDenny and May connect in one way only: May constantly gets Denny&apos;s mail in her box and vice versa. When we first meet May she is exchanging mail w/Denny as he and Monica make their way to his apartment. Monica sees that May always gets Denny&apos;s mail by mistake. \n\nWhen Denny turns up dead, the police come knocking on May&apos;s door, asking questions about Denny, and giving the assumption that it was a suicide. May has no answers for them, but when they leave she immediately checks her mail for the day. She finds she has a package that was addressed to Denny. A package that includes a gun and a tape. May doesn&apos;t know it but the tape contains incriminating information that Denny recorded about Monica, information that could blow Monica&apos;s cover and put her in danger of going to jail herself, if she doesn&apos;t get the package before her bosses do. Thus begins the game of Monica feeling out May for info on the package. \n\nMonica knows May has been getting Denny&apos;s mail and if she can just get into May&apos;s apartment to look around she might find the information before it is turned over to the police. Monica eventually gets into the apartment and she finds the envelope that was addressed to Denny, but it is empty and May has hidden the contents, now desperate, Monica takes May hostage and refuses to release her until she gives up the contents of the package. May&apos;s life now depends on outlasting a strung out Monica who needs a &quot;fix&quot; in the worst way and needs the contents of that package asap. \n\nIt&apos;s an interesting story, but the film is told in reverse flashbacks, so pay attention, or you could get confused real quick. I saw a DVD screener of this movie and found myself repeating a scene just to figure out where the storyline was. That&apos;s a good sign you are going to get frustrated with the continuity of the story. I had a few problems with this story that are annoying as well. I never understood why Bacall&apos;s character does what she does. She knows her neighbor is dead. She knows the police are suspicious but they don&apos;t say why. She also knows she has a piece of his mail that she should turn over to the police. Not only does she not do this, but she opens the package and if the contents are not enough to scare her off, she decides to hide the items as well, as if she knows Monica is going to come looking for them. I mean Bacall&apos;s character is an old woman fighting to keep her independence and stay out of a nursing home, did she decide she was bored and wanted some action at this stage of her life? I suppose if May had not involved herself then there would have been no need for her in the story. But come on, common sense would tell anyone that an old lady who really has no way to defend herself should know better. There is also a guy who is completely unconvincing as May&apos;s physical therapist. He looks like someone who would rip her off in a minute. I won&apos;t spoil who he turns out to be at the end. \n\nDenny, played with conviction by Henry Czerny, has his own agenda. He helps his boss set up Monica, at the same time he plays both sides of the fence because Monica discovers he is also turning states evidence for the police. And it appears that Monica is horribly used by everyone around her: the drug dealer she is trying to bust, by Denny who falsely acts like he wants to help her get clean of the drugs, and worst of all by the police who fail to realize that she is in way too deep trying to bust this drug dealer to begin with. In fact, that&apos;s just what this movie should have been titled, &quot;In too Deep&quot;. Because this is exactly where the lead character winds up. Not to spoil anything, but as a viewer I was left disgusted that certain people don&apos;t get what they deserve, and Monica gets something she definitely did not deserve. You&apos;ll have to watch the film to find out who gets what.\n\nAs for the performances here, Lauren Bacall was the first billed of this film understandably so, since she is the bigger star. But the lead character is Forlani, and she clearly offers the most depth to her character than anyone else. I love Lauren Bacall but her portrayal of May was flat and unaffecting, she never really acts as if she is scared or truly believes that Monica is desperate enough to kill her. She is too emotionless and acts as if she could care less. I know her character is trying to outlast Forlani&apos;s but she struck me as bland and not concerned enough about her situation. \n\nIt must have been a dream come true for Forlani to work with a legend, but Forlani clearly delivers the better performance. Forlani is a master with an American accent, in this film it is also a New York accent. She conveys the hopelessness that she eventually faces as she sinks further and further into drugs while trying not to blow her cover. She shows us the pain of a desperate junkie and the futile efforts she makes to save herself.\n\nThis is a different role for Forlani, one where she gets to shine as a lead and show off her acting chops. This is an actress that certainly deserves more recognition and should be offered roles with more substance like this one. \n\nI&apos;m not sure why this film did not garner more attention at least on cable if not in the theaters, but it is now out on DVD and can be found on Ebay or Amazon.com. I would not be so drastic as to rate it 2.5 out of ten, it&apos;s not that bad. I would give it a respectable 7 out of 10, it&apos;s worth the effort just for Forlani&apos;s performance alone. And without spoiling the ending to this film, let me just say if you are in someone&apos;s apartment, and you know that if you go downstairs two people are waiting to kill you, but you need to get out of this building, and you&apos;re a cop with a gun ( w/a clip that probably has more than 6 bullets), why not go downstairs and see if you can&apos;t shoot your way out of it? I mean the worst that is going to happen is you are going to get killed anyway, but you might take some of the bad guys with you. The best thing? You might surprise them, especially if they don&apos;t know you&apos;re armed in the first place, then you kill them, take one of the cars, and take the hell off! But as previously stated it&apos;s not the most will written story.",

      "reviewBody": "Remake from classical movie titled Scarface (1934) , in fact , De Palma&apos;s Scarface is dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino reportedly stated that Tony was one of his favorites of all the characters he&apos;s played) but the world will remember him by another name , Scarface , being a fictional character . In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed . As Tony and his faithful friend Manny (John Travolta was considered for the role of Manny Ribera but was to Steven Bauer who is the only actual Cuban in the main cast and subsequently married Melanie Griffith) arrive in the U.S. and beginning working small time jobs importing and exporting cocaine. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez (during filming F. Murray Abraham was notified that he had won the part of Antonio Salieri in Amadeus) to do business to a group of Colombians. When the issue goes awry , Tony and Manny leave with the money and flee rapidly . Soon after , Tony meets with drug ringleader Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia , outstanding as a rival gangster) and falls for his boss&apos;s girl , Elvira (Michelle Pffeifer , Kay Lenz, Glenn Close , Kelly McGillis and Kristy McNichol both reportedly wanted the role , but De Palma turned them down). Later on , Tony reunites with his mother and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).\n\nThis exciting film packs thrills , chills , noisy action violence and results to be pretty entertaining , in spite of its long runtime , as it runs nearly three hours . It&apos;s one of the most violent , gruesome , thrilling intriguing gangster move ever made . Al Pacino , in the title role , is firs-rate as the Cuban gangster and receives magnificent support from Steven Bauer , Robert Loggia, Mark Margolis , Harris Yulin and early deceased Paul Shenar gives a bravura performance as a Colombian kingpin . Interesting screenplay by Oliver Stone who wrote this film while fighting a cocaine addiction . The original idea was to make this film a remake of Scarface, which took place in Chicago, but this proved to be impossible due to budget constraints. There was a huge controversy in the city of Miami during the making of the film over whether the producers should be allowed to shoot in the city. The Miami Tourist Board decided not to allow filming, as they were afraid the movie would discourage tourism to Miami, particularly as it showed Miami&apos;s latest Cuban immigrants as gangsters and drug dealers. A majority of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California standing in for Miami, Florida. This was done because production would have been endangered by protest from angry Cuban-Americans over the film&apos;s reported subject matter. Streets and buildings used for shooting were redressed by the art directors to have the &apos;feel&apos; of Miami. The movie displays a colorful cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman John A Alonzo . Furthermore , it has a commercial musical score composed by synthesizer by usual of the 8os , Giorgo Moroder. The motion picture was very well directed by Brian De Palma who liked the script so much that he dropped out of directing Flashdance to direct this film. Ranked #10 on the American Film Institute&apos;s list of the 10 greatest films in the genre &quot;Gangster&quot;. Scarface, the version starring Paul Muni, was ranked #6 in June 2008",

      "reviewBody": "The main problem with this one, is clearly the script. The story is about two young man (and their aid, a teenage girl), who are living for their passion: their own pirate radio station! What rebels they are! They even set up the whole station in a van, so they couldn&apos;t get calibrated by the authority. For they are pirates! They have to be! They do rebellious things, like playing music... and... maybe thats all they do. Sometimes they speak some words, but as good boys, mostly they don&apos;t want to disturb us listening to their favorite bands. Well, ONE band: &quot;Jazz+Az&quot;. \n\nJazz+Az was an extremely over-hyped, therefore quite popular Hungarian pop band in those days. They were: LÃ¡szlÃ³ DÃ©s (a jazz saxophonist, and one of the most popular song composers of that time), PÃ©ter Geszti (showman, rapper, actor, advertisement manager, and songwriter, head of the lighthearted, yet very big hit, hip-hop band of the early 90&apos;s called &quot;RapÃ¼lÅ‘k&quot;), and three choir-girls. Anything but a band, a REAL pirate would listen to. That was the time of rise for many Hungarian alternative music groups, so there&apos;s NO WAY, that the heads of a pirate station would listen to Jazz+Az. \n\nIn fact, this movie is not much more, than a really long music video for this group. The treatment for this film must&apos;ve looked like this:\n\nblablalbalblalba, Then Jazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba, ThenJazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba, Then Jazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba, Then Jazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba, Then Jazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba, Then Jazz+Az plays a song, blablalbalblalba. ...\n\nThe story itself would be interesting, but it&apos;s been really messed up. Many scenes are totally out of place, and the better ones are cut short because we need more time for another Jazz+Az performance. After some time, Pipi (Attila KirÃ¡ly) leaves his his good friend to do commercial radio, where he can get get his own show, and play some more tracks of Jazz+Az. What a conflict! Okay, forget the story.\n\nAttila KirÃ¡ly&apos;s performance is really quite strong, for this VERY bad movie. He really worked with full heart on this one. Other people? Forget them. They do their weakest. They don&apos;t even try, and I don&apos;t blame them.\n\nIf you LOVE Jazz+Az, than grab this one at once, if not, don&apos;t bother.\n\nUpdate: I was just reading back my old comments here on IMDb, and ran into this one... How memorable could a movie be, if in TEN YEARS it has only one comment, which states it&apos;s totally forgettable? :)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Glory&quot; is a modern film classic that highlights a little-known chapter of the Civil War.\n\nI recently purchased the DVD, and was just as moved (if not more so) as the first time I saw it.\n\nBroderick, Freeman, and Washington, along with a stellar cast play it faultlessly. I still remember the brouhaha over the casting of Matthew Broderick as Shaw, and I see that even now some IMDb posters single him out for fault in &quot;Glory.&quot; Sorry, but I disagree. One should remember that the real Col. Shaw was a young man in his mid-20s - hardly a grizzled old veteran - despite his high rank. Broderick actually does bear a resemblance to Shaw, and shouldn&apos;t be criticized for his boyish looks. I felt every nuance of the burden he carried, and thought Broderick did a wonderful job.\n\nDenzel Washington&apos;s powerful acting may never again have a showcase like it did in &quot;Glory.&quot; His beauty, rage, and pride scream in every frame. His Oscar for this break-out role was highly deserved. Trip&apos;s character is really the distillation of what this film is all about: the black man&apos;s heart-rending battle for worth, recognition, and dignity. As far as I&apos;m concerned no one BUT Washington could have played Trip. Thank God for Denzel!\n\nMorgan Freeman is the film&apos;s human core. His quiet compassion and leadership keeps the soldiers focused. His one angry confrontation with Trip proves he has the goods to back up a field promotion to Sergeant Major.\n\nFreeman (an appropriate reminder of where surnames come from) is the father figure the regiment desperately needs in a time of death and crisis. The men look to him for his calming wisdom and reasonable, fair demeanor.\n\nFilms like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; raised the technical bar for battle scenes.\n\nThe fighting scenes in &quot;Glory&quot; are, unfortunately, it&apos;s weakest element. The staging and choreography are mediocre at best. And other than a scene where the 54th Massachusetts is given a hero&apos;s flanking onto the battlefield beaches of South Carolina, these shots don&apos;t emotionally engage the viewer. Still, in the end, &quot;Glory&quot; isn&apos;t about big, noisy battles. It&apos;s about the transcendence of the human spirit in the face of bigotry, bad treatment, and almost certain death. It&apos;s about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.\n\n&quot;Glory&quot; is, indeed, glorious.",

      "reviewBody": "In German-speaking countries, the director Hans Werner GEISSENDÃ–RFER is best known as the inventor of the ARD television series LINDENSTRASSE, which was discontinued in 2020 after a total of 35 years of running. GEISSENDÃ–RFER has also made successful films and was nominated for an ACADEMY AWARD in 1979 for DIE GLÃ„SERNE ZELLE.\n\nAfter a few years in prison, the architect Philipp Braun (BAMBI AWARD winner Helmut GRIEM) is released. He finds it very difficult to connect professionally and privately. His wife (Brigitte FOSSEY) is now having an affair with Philipp&apos;s lawyer (Dieter LASER), on whom the innocently convicted man still depends. It is only with his help that he finds a new job with Director Goller (GÃ¼nter STRACK). Philipp Braun is still eager to punish the truly guilty and is becoming more and more obsessed with this. There&apos;s actually a murder happening...\n\nAn ice-cold psychological thriller from West Germany: That doesn&apos;t happen very often in German-language cinema. GEISSENDÃ–RFER relocates the novel by Patricia HIGHSMITH (1921-1995), published in 1964, to Frankfurt am Main. And that fits perfectly. The banking metropolis is the German-speaking city with a large number of high-rise buildings. So there are lots of job opportunities for an architect! And lots of opportunities for fraud and botched construction! The twin towers of Deutsche Bank were being built at the end of the 1970s, which also fits in perfectly with the story being told. Wavering between relationship drama and psychological thriller, the audience doesn&apos;t know what will happen next. Helmut GRIEM (1932-2004), who is also known from the musical &quot;CABARET&quot; and the mini-series &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, is convincing as a driven man who fights for his shattered life with all means possible.\n\nWalter KOHUT and ACADEMY AWARD nominee Bernhard WICKI (&quot;Die BrÃ¼cke&quot;) can also be seen in other roles.",

      "reviewBody": "I first became friends with Rita when I was 22 and the same age as she is in this only film of hers I had never seen till last night. On that night she and Hermes Pan (master choreographer)were slumming to show her what a coffee house was like, and my roommate who knew Hermes invited them to the hippie like house in an alley way in West Hollywood we shared.We both were in love with the Goddess and did black magic (amateur)to see that Hermes would bring her and it worked.Rita was 38 an still beautiful,a gypsy who drank our cheap wine,and we talked and laughed till dawn. From that day forward,we spent three or four nights a week at her home on Hartford and she often burnt dinner for us and we drank Dom Perignon and we danced and laughed and she told stories and her Brooklyn accent would come out (I hear it a lot in ANGELS) Rita always insisted she could act and this film showed her talent and some of her incredible allure which was emerging.I think she did BLOOD AND SAND the next year where she was outrageously sensual and cruel.She was great in that.Paulene Kael disliked her because she was dubbed by Anita Ellis in most films even though Rita had a decent voice. I found this Hecht film to be far ahead of its time with terrific casting and dialogue which sounded like Mankiewicz in a way,and a touch of Damon Runyon with sophistication.It is an odd, and terrific film and my Rita was really good and I watched her and she &quot;listened&quot; to other actors like a seasoned performer.She still is magical and her presence on film still excites."

      "reviewBody": "** out of (****)\n\nChances are, your feelings toward the film &quot;Twilight&quot; will match your feelings for &quot;New Moon&quot;. Mine sure did. This film basically did nothing for its predecessor, which is a shame since the trailer looked somewhat decent. I thought that maybe an above average Twilight flick would make its way, but I guess that&apos;s too much to ask these days. The characters are surprisingly more stale than before, although this movie is a little more interesting. For everything that is in this movie that was better than Twilight, there is also the opposite. However, the special effects improved slightly and fortunately we get more action than romance. Still, this movie is basically neither better nor worse than &quot;Twilight&quot;. You can take that as a complement or a negative, and you know which side you&apos;re on. \n\n&quot;New Moon&quot; revolves around Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattison). Edward leaves Bella in the forest and now Bella is all alone. However, she meets Jacob (Lautner) and gradually develops a crush on him. Although, Edward returns and Jacob has a secret: he&apos;s a werewolf.\n\nI think it&apos;s kind of humiliating that a director gets a better script, yet makes a film that&apos;s on par with Twilight. I mean how could this have not been good? You have werewolves vs. vampires. That sounds cool already and imagine the type of execution that Scorsese can make *faints*. Folks, if you think this latest installment is impossible to have worse acting and dialogue, then you are dead wrong. Yes, it might seem improbable, but the performances and dialogue have gone from beyond awful to officially the worst I&apos;ve seen. Moreover, I thought the first hour was way too boring and a chore to sit through. \n\nNow, there are some redeeming qualities. The technical aspects have improved. Not by much, but a sufficient amount. Moreover, the last hour is actually watchable. The action here is also not too shabby. Also, I thought that the story was slightly more interesting. \n\n&quot;New Moon&quot; is basically on par with &quot;Twilight&quot;, but that isn&apos;t a complement. Both films boast decent technical aspects and interesting stories, but also boast terrible performances with an awful script. &quot;New Moon&quot; is neither a bad nor good film and compared with its predecessor, it matches its film quality. This weekend, I&apos;ll seek out &quot;Eclipse&quot; and see if that film can break the mediocrity streak. Hey, David Slade is directing. If the third installment is even just the slightest better than &quot;New Moon&quot;, I&apos;ll be satisfied. Until then, this is my review of &quot;New Moon&quot;.",

      "name": "Weeper drama about the famous kid , Joselito , who shows efficiently  his singing skills",
      "reviewBody": "Joselito lives at an Extremadura village with his grandfather (Anibal Vela) . Joselito help a rascal Sacristan (Mariano AzaÃ±a) , and the latter profits from him when the kid sings in Communions , Baptisms and weddings . There , then appears his exiled mother (Lina Canalejas) who escaped leaving her illegitimate child . The village priest (Mario Berriatua) hosts the mother at his home . Later on , the grandfather reconciles his daughter . But there appears her husband (Luis Induni) and problems emerge . Later on , Joselito is sent to Monastery of Guadalupe as a singer boy . \n\nThis is a sensitive story proceeded in simplicity and delicacy by Antonio Del Amo . In fact , Joselito was introduced to the movie business in 1956 by this filmmaker , who directed him in this first feature, El PequeÃ±o RuiseÃ±or (1957) (&quot;The Little Nightingale&quot;), where he earned his famous nickname . He was widely known in Spain when he became a widely successful child star , following to Â¨El RuiseÃ±or De Las CumbresÂ¨ , Â¨Saeta Del RuiseÃ±orÂ¨ and Â¨El PequeÃ±o CoronelÂ¨. The main role &quot;Joselito&quot; is played by the same in a phenomenal manner , can be said that he is perfectly adequate to his measure . He was a milestone in Spanish &quot;child prodigies&quot; under Franco along with Marisol , Pili and Mili and especially Pablito Calvo who starred the hits Â¨The BaitÂ¨ , Â¨Mi Tio JacintoÂ¨ and Â¨Marcelino Bread and WineÂ¨ . And the producers trying to keep them as little kids for as long as possible . Due to false advertising by the studios that made their movies, and which wanted to make him appear younger than they really were , an obsession that haunted them through the whole of their careers . \n\nÂ¨El PequeÃ±o RuiseÃ±orÂ¨ is a joyful as well as sad Spanish musical/weeper/drama movie , professionally realized in Neorealism style . This an enjoyable and feeling movie full of mirth , drama , humor touches and agreeable message . At the same time the film gives us an ample panorama about village life , its pity and goodness ; furthermore, showing the villagers , men at work , priests , weddings , parties and various situations happen in a small town . The scenarios in which develops the deeds are perfectly designed . Musical score responds appropriately to the ambient , originating a careful atmosphere . Evocative and luminous cinematography by Cesar Fraile , though a perfect remastering is necessary . There appears notorious secondary actors , such as Mariano AzaÃ±a , Mario BerriatÃºa , Luis Induni ,Jose Prada , all of them acting to perfection .\n\nOf course , Joselito steals the show as the singer boy . Spanish film studios were looking for a new child star to follow the steps of Pablito Calvo, and make popular and populist folkloric movies and they found Joselito . After the international success of El PequeÃ±o RuiseÃ±or , and following successful films such as Â¨La Saeta Del RuiseÃ±orÂ¨ , Â¨Bello RecuerdoÂ¨ , Â¨Los Dos GolfillosÂ¨, which were big box-office hits in Spain during Franco&apos;s dictatorship he became Spain&apos;s most famous child actor , outstanding his highly expressive face and eyes , enormous eyes and innocent, angelical face . In his films he often sings Flamenco Cante , Saetas , Soleadas and other Folkloric songs . After several movies and records, and already a big star as a singer and an actor in Europe, the next move was trying to triumph in America, so Joselito went to Mexico where he filmed various projects, starting by Â¨El Caballo BlancoÂ¨ , Â¨Aventuras de Joselito en AmÃ©ricaÂ¨ (1960), which paired him with Mexican child star &apos;CesÃ¡reo Quezadas Pulgarcito to grant local box-office . His success even reached around the world , in fact he was discovered as a singer by Luis Mariano, who got him to perform in France, pretending he was 9 at the moment of his debut, when he actually was 13 . However, life was not too glamorous for Joselito, as he was treated almost as a sideshow act by his managers, not allowing him to become an ordinary teenager , and even locking him in his room between rehearsals so he couldn&apos;t meet girls . He was forced to keep his childlike image up to 1969 (when he was in his mid-twenties) in Â¨Loca JuventudÂ¨ , Â¨Falso HerederoÂ¨ and when he appeared in his last film , Â¨Prisionero En La CiudadÂ¨ (1969). But, as his voice had long broken, he was not successful anymore . Retired from acting at early age to become a drifter , even working as a mercenary . Disappearing from public life until it was discovered much later that he had become a heroin addict and even worked as a mercenary in Africa . An attempt of a comeback as an adult proved unsuccessful, as the tastes of the audience had changed, and his voice didn&apos;t resemble the one he had as a kid, so Joselito definitely retired from show business to his home in Utiel (Valencia), where he, now clean and sober, lives a quiet life far from movie and recording studios. Nowadays , he has reappeared doing brief TV interventions and cinema such as Â¨TorrenteÂ¨ and Â¨Spanish movieÂ¨ . \n\nThe filmmaker Antonio Del Amo succeeds in this picture , obtaining a great achievement , managing perfectly to the performers and taking advantage of them , giving the best of his acting . The picture touched the hearts of numerous Spanish spectators by the time . Rating : Acceptable and passable for its worthwhile mingle of drama , music , comedy , sentimentalism and good feeling .",

      "reviewBody": "I came to &quot;Bedazzled&quot; with some trepidation, fearing an inconsistent, incoherent, over-indulgent sixties romp but was pleased at how well structured and directed it was. Seasoned Hollywood practicioner Stanley Donen taking on Britain&apos;s Anarchic Duo Pete and Dud looked from the outside a risky proposition but Donen does a fine job of guiding Cook&apos;s barbed, witty and funny screenplay into an enjoyable film entertainment.\n\nCleverly adapting the Faustian legend to modern day London it takes swipes at the convention of marriage, pop stardom, morality, religion (of course) and sex (also, of course) along the way. Framed by the device of the lovelorn Moore character&apos;s Stanley Moon&apos;s seven wishes, all to help him gain the heart of the remote Eleanor Bron character who works with him at the same greasy-spoon cafe, as granted by Cook&apos;s very chummy but always-one-step-ahead-of-him personification of the Devil, resplendent in his red socks, the film cleverly falls into a series of sketches like their TV series, taking in along the way personifications of the seven deadly sins for good (or bad) measure.\n\nMost prominent amongst the latter of course as Lillian Lust is the new sex-bomb of the time, Miss Raquel Welch, who gets to flaunt her ample charms in a state of extreme undress in her barely (no pun intended) seven minute part. It being the swinging 60&apos;s and all, the sexism exhibited to females is pretty blatant and gratuitous which some today may find objectionable. Whilst I could have done without this cheap-thrill titillation, I found the rest of the film to be sharp, witty and amusing. Cook as the writer naturally gives himself the best lines, in particular his pop star spoof where he invents Neil Tennant twenty years in advance or when he topically sinks the Torrey Canyon oil tanker which was one of the main news stories in the U.K. that year, although the most memorable scene has to be Moore as a nun bouncing on a trampoline with a bunch of bopping Sisters behind him.\n\nThe chemistry between Cook and Moore is obvious but there&apos;s little sign of the spontaneous improvisation which sometimes prevailed in their TV shows (&quot;Greta, Greta!&quot;) but it&apos;s no bad thing here as it keeps their performances sharp and to the point.\n\nIt&apos;s a pity there wasn&apos;t a follow-up to this film or indeed any other film collaboration between the two which is a shame because not only did I enjoy this outing but also I&apos;m sure they could have repeated the success they enjoyed here (see what I did there!).",

      "reviewBody": "From the producers of Underworld, this movie looks like a cheap cousin to the popular wolves versus vampires movie starring Kate Beckinsale. Based on a book by Annette Curtis Klause, and directed by Katja von Garnier, it&apos;s difficult not to draw comparisons because of the subject material and similar themes, this time though doing without the vampires, and sets the spotlight firmly on a group of hunted werewolves called the Loups-Garoux. Sexy sounding, but essentially a useless name for useless beings.\n\nThe group of Loups-Garoux proudly stands by their tradition of being able to transform into wolves at will (and that is their only power mind you), and because of their abilities and lust for blood, they are hunted down by Men with their guns and silver bullets (who and what else). In order to survive persecution, they go underground and keep their identities secret, only to come out during the night for frequent partying at rave clubs (and to pick up chicks), as well as attending strange rituals such as gathering in the woods to partake in hunter-prey chases with wounded men as victims.\n\nIn essence, they&apos;re a bunch of self-preserving cowards who hunt in packs, believing whole- heartedly that unity is strength. As mentioned, they got unimpressive abilities which probably forces them to do so, not by choice - only remarkable agility and the preference to scale walls and run along rooftops. Led by an uninspiring, cowardly leader Gabriel (Kylie Minogue&apos;s ex Olivier Martinez), he holds on to the unexplained hokey prophecy as well as the tradition of the leader of the pack to handpick a wolf-maiden to bed every 7 years. No wonder he&apos;s holding onto power without the necessity to do much to further their cause (which is?), and sets his sights on marrying Vivian (Agnes Bruckner).\n\nVivian however, being the headstrong ingÃ©nue, falls for a plain human, graphic novelist Aiden (Hugh Dancy), and this is where references to Underworld come into full swing. The reluctance in the formation of a forbidden relationship from the girl with secrets, the revenge killings and the hunting down of Aiden, and with Vivian protecting her love, all reeks with familiarity. While Underworld had a rich backstory created for its characters and beings, Blood and Chocolate failed to have anything interesting in either wolf or man to engage the audience.\n\nAnd the execution here is painfully boring. No special effects, not even the baring of fangs, save for coloured contact lenses. It&apos;s relatively low-budgeted, and the transformation of man to beast, is so cheap, even a 10 year old kid with a no-frills video editing software will be able to achieve. Fights are confined to chases between wolves and man, and the usual scruffy fisticuffs. Don&apos;t forget the loopholes galore too after transformation, which is seldom seen on screen as it&apos;ll pose more questions.\n\nThe only redeeming grace however, is the on-location filming in the streets of Bucharest, a beautiful romantic place, totally ideal for a romanticized tale of man-beasts. The soundtrack too had a tinge of Hindi(?!) music influences, which I totally enjoyed, but too bad, the film had been intrinsically destroyed by a lack of a strong storyline, plagued with non charismatic and weak villains with zero diabolical plans, with preference to hang around and do nothing, save for showing off their pitiful skills (which I suspect is because of the lack of budget).\n\nWith a strange title, Blood and Chocolate correctly named itself - a weird and silly mix which doesn&apos;t go down well at all. Only watch it on disc if you&apos;ve got time to spare.",

      "reviewBody": "Years ago, in the town of Harmony, a horrible mining accident occurred, due in part to the negligence of young Tom Hannigar. Five men were found dead and one, Harry Warden, in a coma. It soon came to light that Harry Warden killed those men to conserve his own air supply. On valentine&apos;s day, Harry mysteriously awakens from his coma and goes on a killing spree and ultimately met his end at the hands of the town sheriff, But not before confronting the main characters Axel(Kerr Smith), Sarah(Jamie King) and her boyfriend Tom Hannigar(Jensen Ackles) who still harbors the guilt of causing the accident in the first place. Years pass, teenagers become adults and have families. Suddenly, mysterious killings start to happen again with a very familiar M.O; killed by a man in a mining outfit, similar to Harry Warden&apos;s. Axel and Sarah are now married but there is trouble brewing in paradise. To complicate matters, Tom Hannigar returned to Harmony and where he goes, the mysterious killings follow.\n\nIs some deranged copycat killer out to make a name for himself by repeating the tragedy from 10 years ago? Or has Harry Warden come back from the grave to exact his revenge on Tom Hannigar and everyone close to him? \n\nFor the first time, i surprise even myself by saying that i liked the story. Or at least i was mildly hooked by it. Usually stories in such slasher horror remakes are bland and shoved aside in order to focus more on silly teenage shenanigans and gruesome killings. The story of My Bloody Valentine plays with the &quot;mystery&quot; element very well, throwing many red herrings and misleading little clues as to the identity of the killer. Literally everyone is a suspect and this film keeps you guessing up until the final reveal. There is even a small(though weak, but passable) attempt at a tragic love triangle between the 3 main characters which ties in rather well with the whole &quot;valentine&quot; theme of the movie. \n\nThe characters are at least more bearable than the usual slasher movie fare and easier to get into, emotionally. The acting may be a little stiff at times but i did not expect much good acting from horror genre movies. \n\nA mystery story would only work one time around(once you know the ending, the mystery element kinda ends there), so is it worth watching this movie again on DVD or blu ray??? I give it a resounding yes thanks to.......you guessed it, the 3D gimmick.\n\nIt has been said many times over that the 3D gimmick coupled with some fresh new ways to kill off characters is the highlight of this movie. I never knew one could get so creative with a pickaxe and shovel. The gore itself is not gratuitous but the kills are shockingly gruesome and some of them rather unique.(my favorite is when the killer shoved a shovel into a girl&apos;s mouth and cleaved her face in half). Really must hand it to director Patrick Lussier(also directed Dracula 2000) for his clear straightforward directing style which keeps the usual frantic cuts to a minimum and allows the violence to be played out in its full gory.....i mean glory. \n\nOf course, what would a slasher film be without some mandatory nudity? Thankfully, the nudity is played more for laughs than to titillate here as a dumb blond runs around a motel and car park, completely buck naked in the middle of the night, trying to confront her boyfriend and then trying to escape the killer.\n\nIn retrospect, My Bloody Valentine actually plays out like an extremely violent episode of Scooby Doo complete with surprise ending and unmasking. There were some issues with the overall &quot;feel&quot; of the non-3D portions of the film which felt cheap and at times looked no better than a made-for-TV miniseries. Slasher genre fans are sure to love this and casual movie viewer can easily immerse themselves in the well plotted mystery and suspense. \n\nMy Bloody Valentine is a surprisingly fresh take on the slasher genre. It takes familiar elements and adds a new twist to it. This movie among other recent slasher remakes is like a breath of fresh air after spending hours in a gas mask. Definitely one of the better ones in the market. Maybe there is hope for the slasher genre yet.",

      "reviewBody": "I really liked A Goofy Movie, it is not my favourite Disney movie, but it was charming, funny and touching with some great music and a sweet story. An Extremely Goofy Movie does have its moments, but while A Goofy Movie is very good in my book, this is just so-so.\n\nThe voice acting is very well done though, both Bill Farmer and Jason Marsden capture Goofy and Max perfectly. Plus Goofy provides the most amusing moments, but he isn&apos;t as funny admittedly here. The animation is good enough, it is colourful and at least tolerable to look at. The film also moves at a good pace, while the soundtrack while not as catchy or as touching is worth the listen.\n\nHowever, An Extremely Goofy Movie lacks the heart and magic of A Goofy Movie. The film is too short I think, so some relationships and the story and script are not as well thought out this time around. Goofy and Max&apos;s relationship here is very awkward and sometimes uncomfortable to watch, I actually felt sorry for Goofy more than I did for Max which didn&apos;t happen in A Goofy Movie, then I cared for them both. The absence of Roxann is notable too, that was a pivotal point of A Goofy Movie and what made it so heart-warming and realistic. While I liked Goofy, I actually felt somewhat indifferent towards Max. He is not as easy to relate to and he was a bit of a bore. Also there were numerous points in the movie where I got really frustrated with him.\n\nThe other characters I cared little for either. They are either underdeveloped or fall into the stereotypical category. The story is a let down here, it is predictable and rather ordinary with a number of disconnected moments. And like others have said, this movie feels very contradictory in comparison, not just with Roxann but I don&apos;t think I ever saw Max behave the way he did here. The writing and humour are also not as strong. The humour does have its amusing moments, such as Max&apos;s shocked reaction in one scene and a few parts to do with Goofy, but it is not enough. When it does happen, it is never more than amusing, and at worst some parts come across as rather mean-spirited.\n\nAll in all, a bland and disappointing follow-up to a very enjoyable film. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

It was rather refreshing also to see him get into situations like this. Plus, the charm and beauty of Martha Hyer was always a pleasure to watch. There is a scene where he falls in the water trying to save her. Simon Templar would not put himself in such a way like that. Also when he fights off the bad guys you&apos;ll notice the sequences seem not so much as a spy-guy karate-chop image but he still ends up being the hero. There was a vulnerable side of him I enjoyed. I would also like to see this movie on video. It was on cable a couple of days ago."

      "reviewBody": "Tense. Engrossing. Gripping from start to finish. All words to describe a conversation with Johnny Betts. But they also adequately describe Bruce Willis&apos; latest movie Hostage. The movie could also be referred to as Redemption because that&apos;s definitely what you&apos;ll see this as if you have been disappointed with Bruce&apos;s recent efforts.\n\nHowever, I would recommend that you not go into the movie expecting a Die Hard clone. Hostage sacrifices heavy action and humor for a darker, more character-driven tale, and it works. THIS is how a thriller should be! Things start off on an intense note as we see a grizzled-looking Bruce Willis attempting to negotiate with a psycho who has locked himself and his family in their house. He&apos;s got a gun, and he&apos;s clearly not right in the head. I will not reveal what happens, but flash forward a year later and having burnt himself out in the negotiation business, Willis is now a police chief in a smaller town. You think he&apos;ll be called on to use his negotiation skills again? If you say &quot;no&quot; then please let me slap you upon the cheek.\n\nThe thrills only intensify from there once the trailer park trio takes Kevin Pollack&apos;s family hostage. I really like the fact that we have two sets of bad guys here. There are the white collar criminals who remain faceless, yet ruthless in their desire to get what they want. Then there are the blue collar boys who make a stupid mistake and get in way over their heads.\n\nI also appreciate the fact that the blue collar bad boys aren&apos;t one-dimensional. Jonathan Tucker plays the older brother (Dennis Kelly), and he does a great job of making his character somewhat sympathetic. He&apos;s a small-time wannabe tough guy who gets himself in a very bad situation that only escalates as the movie progresses. As the situation worsens, we see that Dennis regrets what he&apos;s done. He obviously wants to be anywhere else at the moment. He&apos;s scared, but he continues to try to talk tough. He&apos;s reaping the consequences of falling in with the likes of Mars.\n\nMars, portrayed by the show-stealing Ben Foster, is a long-haired, black clothes-wearing troublemaker. His back story is completely a mystery at the beginning, but we deliberately begin to see that he may not be quite as sympathetic as the others. Is he pure evil? Cold-blooded? Misunderstood? Regretful? Revealing anything would be a disservice to your viewing enjoyment, so I&apos;m not saying anymore except that the character is very well-developed.\n\nI know it&apos;s only March, but other than Million Dollar Baby, Hostage is the best movie I&apos;ve seen this year. If you want a fun, suspenseful night at the movies then ignore the critics whining and moaning about clichÃ©s and improbabilities and go check out Hostage. I love the irony in the fact that half of the negative reviews on Rottentomatoes complain about the clichÃ©s in the movie. Wow, at least THAT complaint isn&apos;t clichÃ© or anything. Try a little originality yourself.\n\nSome of these critics like to go to Wal-Mart before a movie like this and purchase the biggest, most industrial strength Nitpicker they can find. You didn&apos;t know that was an actual tool? Oh yes. They&apos;re owned by every single uptight critic who white-knuckle clenches his Movie Snobbery PhD degree at all action and thriller movies. Don&apos;t listen to &apos;em. Hostage is a movie for movie fans, not movie elitists.\n\nTHE GIST Are you in the mood for a dark, intense, edge-of-your seat thriller? Then Hostage will most certainly entertain. If you&apos;re the type of moviegoer who only knows how to complain about clichÃ©s and coincidences then I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do the same here. I recommend loosening up and enjoying life a little.\n\nRating: 4.5 (out of 5)",

      "reviewBody": "A Lonely Place to Die is the fourth feature from British Director Julian Gilbey. His last film was the acclaimed Rise of the Footsoldier way back in 2007. This film marks a very different change of pace for the director and what he delivers here is a striped back bare bones Horror survival thriller. For the most part ALPTD works. Its 1hr and 40 min running time rattles along at a fairly lively pace. It&apos;s the films third act coupled with its confused tone that eventually drags it down.\n\nMellissa George plays one of a group of five friends that go climbing in the Scottish highlands. Early on they discover a small girl buried in a box underground. They decide to free the girl and go for help. Little do they realize that the Kidnappers are in hot pursuit! ALPTD opens with a nerve rattling climbing sequence, from here it builds pretty effortlessly with a number of nail biting senses has a game of cat and mouse is played out in the Scottish wilderness. Little is actually learned about the cast but the film moves at such a pace that this isn&apos;t really an issue. Deaths come almost from nowhere and this is one of the films strengths. The fact that is fair game on any of the cast members really adds to the suspense. Mellissa George is the only real stand out from the cast and she is excellent here making the most of here thinly conceived character. She is easily able to portray both venerable and tough and this up there with Triangle has her best performance. The cinematography is amazing with shots of the mountains and scenery really adding to the isolation of their surroundings. Some of the hand-held style camera work adopted during the chase sequences adds an extra bit of flare which really lifts them above the average.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame that the film was not able to maintain the tension and suspense throughout its whole running time. The third acts arrives has the setting shifts to a local town during a Wicker man style festival. The departure from the wilderness sees the pacing almost ground to a complete halt. The direction of the film also changes. Before this there the film had more of a horror feel to it. The change in setting and the introduction of several new characters moves the film very much into the ransom thriller area. This change in tone is to serve and makes the film feel almost like two separate films in one. The third acts slow down also exposes the problems with the script. Poorly written characters being chased through the woods in a horror film is one thing, being asked to care about poorly written characters during a hostage thriller is a different story altogether. Without anyone to care about a feeling of indifference takes over. Has it stands A Lonely Place to Die is a fairly entertaining if standard film that is worth a watch. There are elements there that could have made it a lot more memorable.",

The only thing I dislike on it is that you can see how old this film is yet - the pictures are just 80s style.

      "reviewBody": "Ever since Cronenberg started making &quot;straight&quot; movies without (too many) splatter elements, something in his oeuvre had been lacking. &quot;Spider&quot; was beautifully photographed but a complete and utter bore. The much praised &quot;A History Of Violence&quot; had a great cast and a solid premise, but turned out to be just as boring and on top of that far-fetched and superficial. &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; finds Cronenberg finally coming to terms with his new &quot;realistic&quot; approach to movie making.\n\nIt&apos;s a little wonder that there haven&apos;t been too many serious movies about the Russian Mafia, yet, so having a movie that takes place in these circles is fascinating all by itself. Cronenberg sets the story up slowly, but nicely. He never falls into the trap of slowing things down too much as he did with his previous two movies. Cronenberg also avoids getting too close to the style of the genre&apos;s Big Kahuna, Martin Scorsese. This is a completely original effort, which sets it apart from 2007&apos;s snorefest &quot;American Gangster&quot;, that didn&apos;t contribute anything new to the gangster genre at all.\n\nThe cast is, of course, very helpful. Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassell look threatening, cold-blooded and emotional all at the same time. You really forget the actors and start looking at them as the characters they embody. Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays the gangster boss wasn&apos;t quite as convincing. During the movie we hear all those cruel and crazy things he&apos;s done, but when we see him on screen we can&apos;t really imagine that he&apos;s capable of all that. The weakest link in the cast, however, is Naomi Watts, who plays the same way she always does and comes across as pretty one-dimensional. She has deservedly gotten a lot of praise for &quot;Mullholland Dr.&quot; but failed to present a comparably great performance ever since. She&apos;s just good enough not to ruin the intensity of this movie.\n\n&quot;Eastern Promises&quot; is aesthetic, explicit and thrilling. There are some scenes you won&apos;t forget for weeks to come (the sauna fight, the opening sequence). In short, what we have here is a modern classic. One of last year&apos;s finest and possibly the best movie David Cronenberg has made so far.",

      "reviewBody": "Right from the beginning of the movie, it is obvious the viewer has discovered something especially heartbreaking and emotionally beautiful. The natural environments, which are vividly colorful, and heighten the impact of the scenes occurring there, contrast with the dull bleakness of the school and hospital rooms the film is primarily centered around. Over the course of the feature, selfishness is an important theme discussed, both visually and through dialogue. Takuma (Masaki Okada) discovers as a young boy that he won&apos;t live to see the age of twenty with his current heart-condition, this shocking truth additionally hurting Mayu (Mao Inoue), his closest companion and paramour, who he promises to marry when they are older. Despite the revelation that Takuma&apos;s health may restrict him from such a commitment, Mayu&apos;s unwavering affection is brilliantly portrayed, though at the same time, Takuma is concerned for the future, and the agony his inevitable passing will bring if she remains close to him.\n\nTakuma&apos;s narration assists the audience in comprehending how dear Mayu is to him, and contextualizes the reasons behind why he may eventually choose to leave her. However, despite their characters sharing considerable proximity over the course of the feature, I wondered if the leads were totally aware of each others feelings, and though these are presented visually, this could have been heightened verbally, there being one scene in particular where the leads argue as to whether they unanimously understand one another. It should be noted moreover, for the most part, the dialogue is entertaining and mature, fitting perfectly with the story.\n\nAt the same time, Kou (Yoshihiko Hosoda) is unmoved by the fear of being selfish, his arrogantly inconsiderate character, though well portrayed, nefariously affecting the mood of the film, his infatuation with Mayu jeopardizing the relationship between the leads. Though there is reason for his character&apos;s repetitive appearance, other individuals in the film with less screen time deserved greater attention. This is especially true for Dr. Takahito (Toru Nakamura), who is an entertaining, yet sympathetic figure, his professional devotion and critical evaluation of himself being well delivered, while the relationship between he and his daughter Mayu potentially needed further attention to accentuate their father-daughter bond. The passing of Mayu&apos;s mother before the story begins is barely touched upon, which could have proved a sub-plot capable of heightening Mayu&apos;s desire to never be without Takuma. \n\nMoreover, Teru (Natsuki Harada), who, like Takuma, suffers a rapidly declining heart condition, is a character that he is able to relate towards due to their similar circumstances, her role deserving further attention to heighten their prior knowledge of each other (which is only briefly discussed), while additionally fleshing her character out further. Tetta Sugimoto and Yoko Moriguchi as Takuma&apos;s father and mother admirably portray parents stricken by grief, who only want the best care for their child, the acting by the cast being potentially one of the film&apos;s most brilliant qualities. Though humor is, on occasion, used, a scene where Mayu addresses the entire year level and confesses her love for Takuma being especially comedic, the profound realism exhibited by the melodramatic seriousness of the plot makes the feature feel all the more believable, none of the scenes appearing forced or out of place.\n\nDespite the film containing a romantic narrative, the theme of death is strongly discussed, especially by Takuma, the film addressing the thought-provoking notion on whether death is more difficult than life, or if it&apos;s in fact the other way round. Furthermore, the luxury of hope is well included in the story, and despite the ending undoubtedly provoking a teary-eyed response, the film concludes in a manner that efficaciously, beautifully and romantically, closes this particularly touching feature.",

Director Winner, who is most famous for his violent 1974 cult classic &quot;Death Wish&quot;, is certainly one of the masters of uncompromising revenge cinema and &quot;Chato&apos;s Land&quot;, Winners first collaboration with Bronson, is one of the movies which have rightly earned him this reputation.\n\nWhen half-breed Apache Pardon Chato (Bronson) shoots a racist Sheriff in self defense in a Saloon, local men form a posse to catch him, in order to hang him as soon as possible. The posse is lead by former Confederate Captain Quincy Whitmore, who is more keen on the manhunt just for the good old times than out of hate towards Chato. The sadistic Hooker brothers who have also joined the posse, however, hate Indians of any kind, and they don&apos;t have the slightest scruples of doing anything to make the fugitive pay for defending himself. As the posse members get deeper and deeper into the desert of Indian territory, however, they have to find out that they might have underestimated their opponent. This is Chato&apos;s land, and in Chato&apos;s land the hunters can quickly become the hunted...\n\nThe acting in &quot;Chato&apos;s Land&quot; is great, Charles Bronson, who hardly says a word fits perfectly into his role. Jack Palance is superb in his role of Capt. Quincy Whitmore, and I couldn&apos;t imagine anybody else but Bronson and Palance to play the leading parts in this. Simon Oakland and Richard Johnson are also great in their ugly roles of Jubal Hooker and his psychopathic little brother Earl, and the cast furthermore contains Richard Basehart. The film is very well photographed in the Spanish AlmerÃ­a, certainly the best location for European Westerns.\n\n&quot;Chato&apos;s Land&quot; is a brutal, tough-minded and great Western, which should not be missed by anybody who likes revenge movies. The performances are excellent, and the movie is stunning, raw and atmospheric from the beginning to the end. A must-see for Charles Bronson fans, Chato&apos;s Land is a great film. Highly recommended.",

This movie gives an insight into the middle years of HÃ¶lderlin&apos;s life. His unfulfilled and forbidden love for a rich merchant&apos;s wife, his struggle for poetic and political truth. The Napoleonic Wars form the background for this scenery. The film takes its time and develops its story slowly and carefully. Excerpts from HÃ¶lderlin&apos;s works and contemporary classical music are skilfully incorporated again and again. The actors are terrific, especially Ulrich MÃ¼he as HÃ¶lderlin, the poet that lived the second half of his live in mental illness. A recommendation!",

The story traces the life of the famed &apos;Boy General&quot; from his turbulent days at West Point to his final fight at the Little Big Horn.  Great liberties are taken with facts here, and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates. But this one is done on such a grand scale, the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in Hollywood.  Down beat ending and all, this is great fun!",

However, in the last 45 minutes or so, the plot becomes convoluted, and the film becomes less enjoyable. The musical numbers are good, though, with beautiful costumes and some impressive choreography. Overall, it&apos;s a solidly good film throughout most of it, and is worth watching despite the mishmash toward the end.",

In addition the movie poster was as ugly as the trailer, so nobody gave it a try. And yet this comedy turned out to be a big surprise to me. It really is funny from the beginning to its ending.The dialogues are well written, witty and always amusing. it&apos;s got a supermarket scene to die for, during which a snobbish and practicing woman is faced with the making of a saucy music video... The actors seem to have had great fun making the film, and they easily communicate their humour. Really pity it was such a flop.",

It&apos;s a simple, yet gripping, story, beautifully and creatively filmed. The people come across as thoroughly real people (in spite of the fact, or because, several of the actors are not professionals), yet the story is presented in such a way that each element, abstracted and beautifully caught by the camera, is isolated from whatever else is happening. It is filmed in an Africa language (and occasionally in French) so most viewers have to depend on subtitles, which appear at times to be abstracts of what has actually been said. Because the subtitles are short, they are readable and tend to reinforce the simplicity and directness of the story. It is a film with a message, educational but also a feast for the eyes.",

Katrine is kind of a klutz. She is always breaking things. When she breaks the mirror in the bathroom of Room 205, the ghost is released.\n\nSuspicion is thrown on her after some deaths: Lena (Mira Wanting),Lucas (Jon Lange), and Sanne (Julie Ã˜lgaard); and she joins with another outcast, Rolf (Mikkel Arendt) in a plan to capture the ghost.\n\nGood FX and tension, with lots of screams.

While this makes you wonder why they even bother calling the movies Bloodfist, it also means, on the plus side, that this has nothing to do with the 4, rather lame, movies that preceded it.\n\nHere Wilson stars as a man who wakes up from a near fatal shooting, suffering from amnesia, when a hooker named Candy pretends to be his wife and checks him out of hospital. It then becomes clear that whoever he is, he is a wanted man, as Chinese black market goons and NSA agents are all pursuing him, in a plot involving some &apos;lost&apos; plutonium missile cores.\n\nGiving away much of the plot would be a damn shame, because this is easily one of the best written Direct-to-video action movies I&apos;ve ever seen, and it&apos;s finally a flick Wilson can be proud of. He gets several chances to display his kick-boxing prowess, and the late Steve James shows up in a different, but well performed role.\n\nIf you like low budget action movies, I would greatly recommend giving this a chance, it may well be Wilson&apos;s best movie, and it&apos;s got a more exciting plot than most recent Hollywood attempts at an action flick.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite appreciating horror very much (with a lot of classic ones out there, such as &apos;Halloween&apos;, &apos;Nightmare on Elm Street&apos;, &apos;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos;, &apos;Night of the Living Dead&apos; and &apos;The Exorcist&apos;, plus the best of Hammer House of Horror), even if not my favourite genre, it took me a while to get round to watching the &apos;Hellraiser&apos; franchise. Due to having so much to watch and review, and the list keeps getting longer and longer.\n\nThe film that started the franchise off is not only for me by far the best of the &apos;Hellraiser&apos; films it also for me, and quite a few others it seems, is one of the stronger horror films of the 80s, though not quite of all time. What is meant by being by far the best of the &apos;Hellraiser&apos; films is that it is the only one to be above very good, the nine sequels were very variable (leaning towards the disappointing) and the latter films particularly are suggestive of the franchise having run its course.\n\nFrom personal opinion, while a bit of a disappointment &apos;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&apos; is still watchable and one of the better sequels in the series. Would say actually it is second best after &apos;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&apos;.\n\nQuite a fair few good things here in &apos;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&apos;. The production were fine, do prefer the nightmarishly Gothic look of the first two films but the film looks very stylish and atmosphere with visual effects that aren&apos;t overused or abused and actually a little more polished than &apos;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&apos;. The theme song is quite memorable, while there are some imaginative and disturbing kills and Pinhead&apos;s scene in the church is one of the best in the series, hair-raising and wickedly funny.\n\nDid like the effort to give development to Pinhead and his story is interesting, regardless of whether it fitted within the rest of the film or not. Doug Bradley is genuinely intimidating and Terry Farrell does a decent job.\n\nIt is hard however to ignore the drawbacks. &apos;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&apos; lacks the creepiness and ambition of the previous two films, there is a lot of silliness and camp humour and it does undermine any creepiness or suspense and it just feels completely different tonally compared to its predecessors. The dialogue is toe-curling this time and didn&apos;t really see any need for some of the gore, which didn&apos;t unnerve that much and came over as cheap and gratuitous instead.\n\nAlso thought the story, while slightly more coherent than parts of &apos;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&apos;, made little sense and was muddled. The rest of the acting is laughable and the Cebonites are nowhere near as creepy or mysterious. Worst of all is the ridiculously over-the-top and far-fetched ending, that was even more of an incomprehensible parody as the one in the previous film.\n\nOverall, watched and one of the better &apos;Hellraiser&apos; sequels but could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Plot Summary : A former mental patient inherits the old house of a man who had killed his wife (Jean Marsh) and children and died nut . As he (Robert Hardy) lives in the mansion , but the insane spirit (also Robert Hardy playing a double role) of its previous owner seems to overcome him with a need to repeat the murders . Meanwhile, a scheming couple of brothers (Joan Collins , Christopher Lee) and the manor administrator (Herbert Lom) plot to rob a hidden cache of stolen money from its rightful owner . The only problem is that the house they plan to hide it in is haunted . There is more than death waiting for you in Dark Places.\n\nThis is a thrilling film including horror elements taken from Edgar Allan Poe and with plenty of chills , familiar drama , suspense and grisly killings . Filmed in low-budget though starred by an all-star-cast ; it&apos;s acceptable but no memorable picture and generally chilly clutch . Director Don Sharp has got other horror films for which has achieved a certain cult following . Good acting by Robert Hardy as a man who masquerading as a hospital administrator inherits a ruined mansion and nice support cast , such as Joan Collins as intriguing as well as seductive woman , Christopher Lee as astute brother ,he worked six times for director Don Sharp , Herbert Lom as a mean business attendant , Jane Marsh as wife and Jane Birkin as a young lover . Average cinematography , being necessary a right remastering because of the film copy is worn-out . Atmospheric and frightening musical score . \n\nThe motion picture was professionally adapted and directed by Don Sharp , though with no originality . He was born on the island of Tasmania off of Australia, and began his show-business career there as an actor. After World War II he traveled to England and continued his acting carer . He became a filmmaker in the mid-1950s and turned out some low- and medium-budget musicals, such as the Tommy Steele vehicle Â¨It&apos;s All HappeningÂ¨ (1963). In the mid-1960s he was hired by horror specialist Hammer Films and turned out some well-received thrillers, including Â¨Kiss of the vampireÂ¨ (1963), his first for Hammer , this one along with Â¨WitchcraftÂ¨ and Â¨PsychomaniaÂ¨ are the best-regarded . He worked on a few films as second-unit director, most notably Â¨The Fast LadyÂ¨(1962) and Â¨Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to ParisÂ¨ (1965), before returning to directing again, and turned out a string of thrillers such as Â¨CallanÂ¨, Â¨HennessyÂ¨, and his version of Â¨The thirty nine stepsÂ¨ , although much inferior to Hitchcock ; in addition , horror films and comedies . Towards the end of his career he worked in television on mini-series .",

The result is an acceptable, if occasionally disappointing, film.\n\nOne episode sees Christian De Sica&apos;s plastic surgeon against colleague (and ex wife) Sabrina Ferilli, while their new spouses try to keep things calm; another one has Massimo Boldi calmly enjoying a relationship with a woman 30 years his junior, only to criticize his daughter for having a similar affair with a 60-year old American (Danny De Vito); the third protagonist is Anna Maria Barbera, who has won some competition: she gets to spend the Christmas holidays with her idol, Ronn Moss. And all this takes place on the same location, Gstaad, Switzerland.\n\nNow, I have to say I enjoy these kinds of attempts to make a 20-year old franchise (which ended with 2005&apos;s Natale a Miami) more appealing and fun. In this case the swearing has been (partially) toned down, and a few &quot;usual suspects&quot; have been left at home and replaced with more &quot;sofisticated&quot; people. The problem is, the movie doesn&apos;t always work. More specifically, the Barbera part of the movie: Ronn Moss isn&apos;t particularly memorable, and his co-star&apos;s performance is basically a big-screen impression of her famous TV character Sconsolata.\n\nOn the other hand, though, I quite enjoyed the other two stories, particularly Massimo Boldi and Danny De Vito interacting (with the only unpleasant detail of De Vito being dubbed), and the former spoofing John Travolta in an amusing disco scene. And there&apos;s of course the one sequence that had even the most cynical grinning: the embarrassing meeting between De Sica and Boldi, the latter having just accidentally OD&apos;d on his US friend&apos;s Viagra.\n\nSo, not an Italian comedy classic, like Benigni or Verdone&apos;s movies, but still worth a try...",

This challenge has certainly been lost here. The compressed version seems rather like a teaser for the original TV series than like a coherent stand-alone movie. In fact, the story is broken off into too many parts within 90 minutes. Furthermore, the new scenes which are supposed to glue the old footage together fail their purpose. They seem misplaced as they make use of digital effects and introduce a different, more modern language. I cannot understand why they did not stick to the original style. I would favour a complete remake of the series with new actors over this compilation.",

      "reviewBody": "A slow, rich movie. Though it lags in places, the three lead performances are indelibly written in my memory. And the great jazz soundtrack and warm colors made this movie go down like a glass of bourbon.\n\nEmbodying the archetypal difficult genius, Emmet Ray is an almost cartoonishly dislikable guy. But Sean Penn keeps him just this side of sympathetic; we loathe his actions, we curse his self-destructiveness, and yet we&apos;re compelled to keep watching in the increasingly futile hope he&apos;ll turn himself around. His last scenes are heartrending.\n\nAs Hattie, Samantha Morton strikes a perfect, almost Chaplinesque, balance of comedy and tragedy. The line separating the two is razor-thin; she dances gracefully upon it. I could say more, but perhaps appropriately, it&apos;s difficult to find words that capture the beauty of her silent performance. Half the joy is in watching her reactions naturally unfold anyway.\n\nLike Penn, Uma Thurman portrays a pretty unlikeable character. Her Blanche is overly intellectual, questions incessantly and is in some ways just as emotionally alienated as Emmett. Though her character is grating at first (particularly in contrast to Morton), Thurman does not shrink from the less flattering aspects of her character. It&apos;s a brave performance in a thankless role.\n\nWoody Allen has constructed a thoughtful meditation on the nature of artistry. Not on celebrity -- we all know how that film turned out -- but on the rights and responsibilities of the true artist. Emmett, Hattie and Blanche represent the axis of artists, fans and critics respectively. As their relationships play out -- naturally, inexorably and poignantly -- the viewer gets a rare treat: a film that plucks at the mind and at the heart as gracefully as Emmett picking his guitar strings.",

But the other pros in the cast more than made up for this handicap--especially HARVEY KORMAN, CLORIS LEACHMAN, MADELINE KAHN and HOWARD MORRIS.\n\nCloris Leachman is hilarious as Nurse Diesel (practically repeating her formidable character in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN) and Madeline Kahn is equally funny as the blonde femme fatale who finds herself in one ditzy situation after another as she tries to reach her father inside the asylum--here called &quot;Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous.&quot; Nothing subtle here. The gags are touch and go, some funny, some painfully unfunny--so it&apos;s strictly a mixed bag.\n\nBut if you know MEL BROOKS and his kind of satire, this has enough gags to keep you satisfied.

Though not brilliant and lacking a lot of the audicity of the Hammer films, as well as the eerie spookiness of the lastets supernatural hits - THE OTHERS and SIXTH SENSE, Long Time Dead does manage a few tense moments - nothing overly scarey mind you but I didn&apos;t hate it.\n\nThe trouble is it is trying to follow an American formula - a group of teenagers fooling around with the supernatural unleash something terrible and most of them die as a result. \n\nIt also has the now mandatory - &quot;it&apos;s not really over&quot; ending.\n\nThat said it is okay and fans thirsty for a bit of spooky old fashioned horror/supernatural/teenage thriller will probably enjoy it.\n\n Just as an aside I recommend viewers who did enjoy this or who are interested in the Demon DJIN which features in this film would enjoy WishMaster - the Wes Craven film. It is far more bloody and violent but the Djin is also much more developed."

      "reviewBody": "The early German cinema was marked by two schools of film-making â€“ Expressionist Horror and Chamber Dramas, known as &quot;Kammerspiel&quot; â€“ which, given the heightened sense of reality at their centre (and also because a number of the great directors to emerge during this time proved adept at both styles), may be thought to converge. This whole approach does lend itself naturally to a psychological probing into situations and characters; however, while the former is a most invigorating commodity (its deliberate artificiality borne out in the acting, sets and cinematography) and has been very influential over the years, the results can be tough sledding indeed â€“ unless it is deployed in the service of an engaging narrative â€“ where the latter is concerned! Incidentally, while F.W. Murnau&apos;s THE LAST LAUGH (1924) received much prominence for its visual dynamic in telling a story without the benefit of intertitles, the film under review does the exact same thing (except for Werner Krauss&apos; singular uttering of &quot;I am a murderer!&quot; towards the end)! Still, as suggested by my lowly rating (despite its presence on the &quot;Wonders in the Dark&quot; all-time top 3000 movies poll), the ensuing artistic quality is hardly comparable to that masterpiece â€“ indeed, so over-the-top does this become (in the &apos;favourable&apos; words of critic Jean- Andre&apos; Fieschi, the characters here are like &quot;somnambulists on the brink of madness&quot;) that it feels almost like a parody &quot;Kammerspiel&quot; effort!\n\nThe plot revolves around the family of middle-aged train-station attendant Werner Krauss; he receives a note that a railway inspector is to arrive and even reside in his home. Krauss has a young daughter â€“ with whom the official is immediately taken, ending up seducing her while daddy is away on his night-shift diligently checking the tracks. Yet, his wife is sleeping in her room and, sensing that something is wrong, wakes up to catch him in the act: this is one of the most exaggerated sequences, as she contorts with torment at just what might be going on behind closed doorsÂ…until she can stand it no longer and breaks it down with an axe! The partly-undressed girl is understandably grief-stricken at this, but the man is quite non-plussed; the old woman goes out to look for her husband but succumbs to the freezing temperature and dies in the snow right in front of a shrine! It gets sillier, as Krauss returns home, goes to sleep and out to work again the next morning none the wiser: one would think he ought to deign his family of a word; again, an unintentionally hilarious scene has him staring at length at his unmade bed, as if wondering just how his wife would go about it! Anyway, the tragedy that has struck his family eventually dawns on him (he even finds the corpse of his &apos;old lady&apos;) â€“ and, doing the right thing, turns his full wrath upon the inspector and strangles him (why the latter stays on at Krauss&apos; home, as if nothing had happened, is anybody&apos;s guess!). Their lives shattered, the father breaks down on the job and confesses to his &apos;crime&apos;, while the girl is shown climbing on the roof of the station as a train is pulling inÂ…",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m always a bit worried when I&apos;m about to express my love towards this movie by the genius director David Lynch... I figure it&apos;s the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you&apos;re completely nuts :) \n\nBut what the heck, they&apos;re a lot of nutballs on this website, so I can speak my mind freely. Indeed, I love this movie...although &apos;love&apos; may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie &apos;fascinates&apos; me is a much better saying. Usually, a movie is something in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film, you can only hope that you&apos;ll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises, the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it. Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions, you don&apos;t know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you&apos;ll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that&apos;s a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !\n\nEraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre. In fact, I would go so far to say you can&apos;t call yourself a cult-freak if you haven&apos;t seen it yet.\n\nDavid Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on. Eraserhead isn&apos;t his best film at all ( certainly not when it comes to storyline ) but it&apos;s his most deep and personal tale. 25 years old and still the &quot;weirdest&quot; film ever. That&apos;s an achievement, certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or, at least, they try to be...)\n\nI want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one, but it&apos;s for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not recommended if you&apos;re depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down, I think. The tagline of this movie - &quot;In heaven, everything looks fine&quot; - could become a stimulus, I&apos;m afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet harmless &quot;baby&quot; ( I really don&apos;t know how I should call it, actually )is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.\n\nYou must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production. But it worked...hell, even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed. Based on this film, he decided to let Lynch direct &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; a few years later. By that, David&apos;s career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally, his highlights were the 80&apos;s with terrific movies like &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot; ( very underrated, in my opinion) and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; at the end of the decade. And let&apos;s not forget the best TV-series ever made: &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.\n\nPlease, watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or less ) and yelled &quot;What the f*** is this ???&quot;. Real shame, if you ask me. It&apos;s an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really don&apos;t see the magic of it, at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character. I&apos;m thinking of doing the same thing with mine...",

      "reviewBody": "Netflix has most of Mike Leigh&apos;s earlier films, including his early BBC films, available for on-demand streaming, so I thought I&apos;d check out his debut feature, being a fan.\n\nThe absence of artifice in Leigh&apos;s films is always very refreshing. You never get the Hollywood &quot;sheen&quot; on the story. Even when he uses Names, the performances never seem like performances, but rather a scene you would most likely walk in on if you opened the front door of any house at random.\n\nThat lack of artifice is particularly glaring in Bleak Moments and one can&apos;t help but wonder if this was part of what Leigh was trying to get across: the conversations appear to be shot in first-take improvisational style and if things happen, they do, and if they don&apos;t, they don&apos;t. He isn&apos;t going to force an unnatural performance and you shouldn&apos;t expect one, either.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot going on in these pregnant pauses, however, and many shadings of self-consciousness to sift through before you glimpse the tortured soul behind each character. It is a subtle and classy trick, as other have pointed out, that the least self-conscious and therefore joyous character is developmentally-disabled Hilda.\n\nOccasionally Leigh will show-off a bit, and to good effect, particularly in the fast cut group of headshots prior to Sylvia and Peter&apos;s date, but for the most part he plays it cool and just lets us bask in the glow of some great, naturalistic acting.",

It hasn&apos;t changed my mind about what I think about football but I was still captivated by those interviewed and why they feel how they do about the game and their club. This is a quality documentary, the fans we follow give true insight that is rarely explored but includes players, owners, managers to give a variety of perspectives. The direction and handling of the narrative is skillful in this directors hand to a quality we see from leaders in the field like Kevin McDonald. Regardless of whether you like, love or don&apos;t care about the game of football I highly recommend viewing this; it&apos;s what a documentary should be, a document of a time, place and events that people can view decades from now and see how things were even if the subject has a limited appeal or audience.",

While Kelly is selling it to the Union Army, Colonel Rossiter of the Rebels is planning to steal it, and he needs an expert cattleman to do it.\n\nSlow moving at times and even talky, Alvarez Kelly is a vastly underrated western that depicts the futility of war, but not in outward fashion. It&apos;s still a large scale western, unusual, well-mounted and hugely diverting largely due to the well-etched characters, particularly in William Holden and Richard Widmark; their confrontations is one of the highlights of this Edward Dymtryck directed film and compensates somewhat for the lack of action, though the finale features a vigorous stampede and blowing up of bridges (what&apos;s with William Holden and bridges). I have seen this film on BBC2 in my youth and I have found it a nice western. Love the title song.",

      "reviewBody": "I love this movie. It has beautiful Tyrolian mountain landscapes filmed in lovely, late-50s color that German Heimatfilms are so well-known for.\n\nPoor Walburga (Wally - pronounced Volley - not like Beaver&apos;s brother Wally); her heartless father wants her to marry the ambitious, creepy, cruel and possessive foreman Vinzenz. She, however, is in love with the jovial hunter Baerenjosef. When she refuses her father&apos;s demand that she marry Vinzenz, her father banishes her to their high alpine summer cabin near the glacier - where she must endure a harsh winter without any human companionship - but not alone.\n\nShe has a vulture to keep her company. She rescues and cares for a juvenile vulture who is (IRONICALLY) helpless because her hunter has killed its mother. The two become inseparable - and she earns her disparaging nickname - die Geierwally (the Vulture-wally).\n\nDuring a later visit to her father&apos;s farm, she hits Vinzenz in the head with a stick to protect an elderly servant from a beating at the hands of Vinzenz. Her father wants her locked in a barn - and, in an effort to avoid capture, ends up setting fire to the barn. She then runs away and finds asylum at the home of two bachelor mountain guide brothers.\n\nWhen the bachelor mountain guide brothers become jealous of one another&apos;s apparent affection for Wally, Wally moves out of their home into their high alpine summer cabin - where her hunter Baerenjosef stumbles across her path once again.\n\nBut this time, he is not alone. He is with a woman!!! Wally, who has lived alone and in exile for her love of the hunter is furiously jealous that he would be with this beautiful young woman who OBVIOUSLY must be a rival for her affections. Of course, Wally does not ask who she is and makes no attempt to find out. She merely ASSUMES and makes an . . . , well you know the story. It also does not help that the Vulture recognizes the hunter as the man who shot his mother.\n\nIt takes several more misunderstandings, revenge humiliations, the death of her father, a murder attempt and a mountain rescue to resolve the tangled mess - but in the end, Wally and Baerenjosef finally profess their love for one another and live happily ever after.\n\nThe only loser in all of this is the Vulture - who, unwilling to share the one he loves, flies off alone. The End.\n\nBut really, despite the over-the-top melodrama (or maybe because of it) - this is a wonderful movie that holds up after multiple viewings.",

The plot is thin, predictable, and boring. At the North American premier that I attended in Toronto, more than a few people walked out. There is no dialogue in this film so it is played as a slapstick &quot;silent&quot; film with a modern (and actually quite good) soundtrack. I could not help but be embarrassed for Mr. Zane, who was in the audience, while one gag after another fell flat. The film isn&apos;t even bad in a fun or campy way.  It is dull and uninteresting. Not much more can be said."

      "reviewBody": "Great and certainly the best opening to a Jason film we are given a FRANKENSTEIN-like beginning from writer/director Tom McLoughlin. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) and his buddy Allen Dawes (Ron Palillo) go to the Crystal Lake Cemetery or rather the Lake Forest Green Cemetery being renamed to erase any memory of Jason Vorhees. There Jason is brought back to life, but now he is much stronger as he is like a zombie. Tommy then goes to Sheriff Garris (David Kagen) who puts him in the slammer believing what he is hearing from the boy doesn&apos;t make any sense.\n\nNo give or lulls in the action. In my opinion McLoughlin knew what the Jason fans wanted. My favourite Tommy Jarvis is Corey Feldman, but Matthews does a fine job as the older, more troubled Jarvis. They did sort of throw away certain elements of part V with Tommy like his need for meds and seeing Jason everywhere. In the end though you have to be ready to smirk at the story. Very meta, McLoughlin added more humour than any other Jason, and filled with some good laughs.\n\nSince Jason (this time played by C.J. Graham) is back there are lots of kills and much more senseless murders. Unfortunately, it also adds to much more senseless sequels as this is the Jason going forward. The lumbering, never running, very big, but also not near as scary Jason.\n\nIf you felt dissatisfied with part V, I would say tune into this part as Jason is back and it is a really good return. One of the better entries in the series. Alice Cooper has 3 songs in the soundtrack including the title song &quot;He&apos;s Back (The Man Behind the Mask)&quot;. Also starring Jennifer Cooke and Tony Goldwyn.",

      "reviewBody": "After watching the Terence Rattigan DVD collection (with most of the adaptations being from the 70s and 80s) when staying with family friends last year, Rattigan very quickly became one of my favourite playwrights and he still is. His dialogue is so intelligent, witty and meaty, his characterisation so dynamic, complex and real and the storytelling so beautifully constructed.\n\n&apos;The Winslow Boy&apos; is along with &apos;The Browning Version&apos; and &apos;Separate Tables&apos; one of Rattigan&apos;s best, containing all of the above and also showing his gift of giving his principal characters an emotional and psychological complexity in a real life situation (if not quite as much as &apos;The Browning Version&apos;). Was even more blown away by this 1948 film than with the wonderful 1951 adaptation of &apos;The Browning Version&apos;, only because it doesn&apos;t have anything that rings false compared with &apos;The Browning Version&apos;s&apos; contrived optimism at the end.\n\nNot only is, again from personal opinion, this 1948 film is the definitive version of &apos;The Winslow Boy&apos;, though it also has the excellent 1976 BBC adaptation with Alan Badel and Eric Porter and the version with Jeremy Northam (which needs to be re-watched but remember it having a lot of good merits) to compete with, but it is also one of the best adaptations of any of Rattigan&apos;s plays.\n\nRattigan&apos;s involvement himself with the screenplay has a lot to do with it. It is an incredibly faithful adaptation to the play, practically unscarred and largely untouched, remarkable for a work so text-bound. Fidelity doesn&apos;t always come as a good thing when adapted, if too faithful the essence of the work can be lost, here it&apos;s the fidelity that makes &apos;The Winslow Boy&apos; so impressive. Is it talky? Yes it is. That is not the fault of the film. The play is talky. Rattigan in general is talky, but the dialogue itself and the themes that Rattigan touches upon are so amazing that to me this is a rare case of talky not being a bad thing. Rattigan manages to maintain the essence exactly of his own work while also opening up the action and extending it, which immediately gives a more cinematic feel and immediately avoids the potential issue of being too stagy.\n\nAnthony Asquith directs as assuredly as ever, never undermining the intricacies of the events and the complex character dynamic and sharpening up the legal and social dramas and Rattigan&apos;s class and hypocrisy insights. &apos;The Winslow Boy&apos; is a beautiful looking film, lovingly shot with sumptuous settings and costuming.\n\nFrom start to finish, even when dialogue heavy, the story is riveting, with a much tighter pace than the BBC version, and so much is told and done and in a way where one doesn&apos;t miss any of it. The highlight in the play has always been the interrogation scene between Morton and Ronnie, that&apos;s the case here in this film as well, some of the cleverest dialogue delivered with nail-biting tension and wit. The characterisation and character dynamic is spot on, where one feels sorry for the right people, amused by the right people, inspired by the right people and grow to hate the right people. The main conflict is so easy to root for (done with real intelligence and meat and one really wants justice done as much as the characters do), and Catherine sums up Morton perfectly in describing him as a cold fish that you grow to admire.\n\nYou need good acting to complement all this. The acting is more than good all round, especially Robert Donat whose Morton is even more unforgettable than Alan Badel&apos;s and a brilliant performance in its own right (one of his best). More than up to his level are a moving Cedric Hardwicke, a charming and witty Margaret Leighton and Neil North&apos;s relatable Ronnie. It was easy to sympathise too with Basil Radford and learn to dislike Frank Lawton in John&apos;s eventual treatment of Catherine later on. Wilfred Hyde White makes a distinguished appearance as well.\n\nOne expecting a climactic courtroom scene without knowing the play will be disappointed that one finds out the verdict a different way, but that&apos;s also how the play ends and it rings just as true this way.\n\nIn summary, fantastic film and just as great an example of Rattigan at his best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

First you have to get past the dialect, and the faster the lines are delivered, the more challenging this becomes. However, if the laughs are there they will come through loud and clear. Unfortunately this is not the case with &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;. This totally predictable and uninspired effort, fails on several levels. The punchlines are telegraphed well in advance. The script is in many places more mean spirited than funny. Do yourself a favor. If you want to see a wonderful, dark, British comedy, seek out &quot;Car Trouble&quot; and skip this one. - MERK",

The Heimat sentiments are kept in check, and the cast includes my favourite daughter-type of the 50&apos;s: charming Angelika Meissner, who keeps asking whether it is true that &quot;in Amerika&quot; women already marry at 15.\n\nThe film is also interesting for is preoccupation and fascination with all things modern (American)  within the traditional German Heimat. There is an American nephew visiting the Rheinland only to marry a fresh, young German girl; toned down jazz music is played by a band that is also invited to the traditional feast; one of the females is an abstract painter and her work is made fun off, but when the old hotel must be saved she is one of the main agents in this. These are just a few examples of what may be considered an attempt at  synthesis of tradition and progress or even the &quot;message&quot; that German Heimat traditions could only be saved if modern conceptions were adapted into it.",

On the other hand this is a great movie to relax to after a hard days work with a couple of beer cans!! Expect hard action (lucy liu can kick some serious butt!!), explosions, car chases, hot women and more fire power than rambo and commando put together. Don&apos;t mind the storyline too much (I didn&apos;t) just sit back, relax and enjoy the action sequences!!"

It&apos;s a drama, following a ditzy and frivolous mother who tries to build herself a new life after 10 years of prison, in hopes of getting her daughter back. Celine Bonier really shows how great of an actress she is, playing that mother full of sweet innocence, who only wants to do good while all of her life crumbles around her. You can&apos;t help but feel sad for her, no matter what terrible thing she has done in the past, and the movie does a great job at keeping a little mystery as to what is the real truth until the ending. Some points remain obscure in regards to the relation between the protagonist and some of the secondary characters, but the movie obviously focuses on the mother/daughter relation, keeping the other characters in background for story continuity. It&apos;s an excellent movie regardless, with convincing characters, a realistic tone and an unfolding great in emotions.",

The &quot;rickshaw&quot; driver performs an awesome parody of De Niro&apos;s famous &quot;You lookin&apos; at me?&quot; scene from Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Scorsese&apos;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Only during the end-titles do you fully realize what fun was had by all, and how talented some of this cast is.\n\nThe only way to hate this movie is to indulge the mean-heartedness of some blackened corner of your soul.",

The slow build of suspense works well in this movie, the characters are great (acting too), and the storyline is original. And the ending? Let&apos;s just say--I didn&apos;t see that coming.\n\nI was tempted to be let down by the ending--but what I loved about the ending is that it still evoked questions inside of me. I had to go back and connect the dots throughout the movie to get a new understanding of it. After the ending, you see the movie from an entirely different perspective--which makes it quite powerful. Also, what do you make of the ending? While some people will view the ending and say &quot;No--the end definitely means this&quot;--I think that the ending can be interpreted many different ways.\n\nThe question is--what do you believe? \n\nWhen the siren sounds...don&apos;t go outside.",

Soon he cleverly figures out a way to get into a house via an upstairs window, and it becomes apparent that he knows the three people who are engaged in a disagreement in the kitchen below. We&apos;re not sure what he&apos;s up to, and as it&apos;s best you don&apos;t know a lot about the plot before watching this one, I won&apos;t say more. \n\nThe story is taut and well-told by director LÃ¡szlÃ³ Benedek, who wisely avoids extraneous detail, and there are moments of real tension. It&apos;s dark, but Benedek exercises restraint, which I liked, but which may turn off viewers seeking more explicit thrills. Trevor Howard, who you may recognize from Brief Encounter (1945) and The Third Man (1949), is strong as a detective, and the rest of the cast are all good as well. I liked the way we eventually see how von Sydow is able to do what he does, though you&apos;ll have to suspend disbelief a bit. Clever ending too.",

While obviously made on a shoestring budget with unknown actors, this film has does some good points. The house itself is a neat setting with loads of strange pieces of artwork and gothic furniture. The storyline  has echoes of other ghost tales, but the plot twists towards the end add some surprises to the story. The actors are not Academy Award contenders, but do an adequate job with the limited roles given to them; the young woman who plays Sheila probably gives the best performance and is quite pretty as well. However, there are also a lot of faults with this film, as the sound is particularly bad in places, there are weird sidelines to the plot that are incomprehensible, and the story as a whole seems implausible from start to finish. Having said that, this may appeal to some viewers who enjoy ghost stories or like to watch obscure films from the past."

      "reviewBody": "I am an avowed fan of horror films but I must confess that films with haunted houses are so common that it gradually became uninteresting. Still, there&apos;s nothing like giving new material a chance. That&apos;s what I did here. And I was reasonably satisfied: its a film that knows how to build atmosphere and tension and a pleasant mystery, even if its not capable of frightening.\n\nEverything takes place in the swamps of the suburbs of the mysterious old New Orleans. In an old colonial house lives an elderly couple who hires Caroline, a nurse and elderly caregiver who goes to that house at the hand of the family notary in order to care for Ben, the family patriarch, very weakened by a stroke that left him disabled. But it doesn&apos;t take long for the young woman to discover that the house hides many ancient secrets and some of these secrets can really be a threat.\n\nAs a pure horror film its weak... but it has a satisfactory cast and a tense atmosphere that, coupled with a decent script, with the inclusion of witchcraft and vodoo themes (it&apos;s New Orleans, how could we not think in this?) helps the plot and serves as glue to everything we have here. I felt that the character Caroline is not developed properly and is poorly presented to the public, since we don&apos;t know much about her and that makes her a figure more than a character that we can feel and that touches us. Even so, it is a functional film that delivers more or less what it promises, despite not being able to scare or go beyond tension and some occasional chills.\n\nThe cast has several names of some weight. Peter Sarsgaard is the most resonant name, but he is guarded by a character who doesn&apos;t appear that much but guarantees him a minimum of presence. Kate Hudson is elegant and beautiful, and knows how to play her role, but does not seem to feel her character as she should, in some scenes that seem less well worked or well Gena Rowlands, in turn, is extraordinary and makes a character truly colossal.\n\nTechnically, I would like to highlight the quality of cinematography and the work of filming and editing, which gave the film a very important visual beauty to build the environment that the film requires. The scenes and landscapes of the swamps and the city are excellent and were used in the best way. The effects are minimal, but they fulfill their role, the sets and costumes, as well as the Swedish landscapes (with or without snow) increase the visual beauty of the whole set. The soundtrack does its job well.",

      "reviewBody": "I generally like Rudolph&apos;s work, even when it borders on the pretentious, but this one plain reeks of it, to the point where I was shaking my head at the screen, not believing what I was hearing and seeing during most of the film&apos;s running time. The premise is interesting and somewhat perverse ~ the men hire two stenogs to transcribe every stupid word they utter; one of them is played by the always-good Robin Tunney, who&apos;s sexually evolved a bit, having at least 3 conquests under her belt, and the other is the squirmy, virginal Neve Campbell, who&apos;s never been worse. A ridiculous part, no question, but someone with some panache - I kept picturing Geraldine Chaplin when she was younger - might have at least brought some fun and believability to the proceedings.\n\nGood cast, and good performances, otherwise (considering the material). Nick Nolte&apos;s a hoot, raving about his sexual encounters with a particularly attractive donkey, whom he&apos;d enjoyed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he tells us, in his drunken stupor, and on Wednesdays there was a goat he&apos;d set his sights on but said goat was too fast and he never could catch him. Him. That&apos;s right. His character professes to be an equal-opportunity bestiality master, who is married to Tuesday Weld, who talks with a ridiculous sort of German accent part of the time and sounds like she&apos;s from the Bronx for the rest.\n\nAlan Cumming, who is always fun to watch, is fun here as well, relieving himself of his shirt every chance he gets and posing like a Greek god around the room these clowns are supposedly &apos;investigating&apos; sex in.\n\nBy the end, it means absolutely nothing, of course, except that you wasted a little time hoping for some clever titillation at the very least and some possible insight on the subject. There&apos;s more insight to be had in any Will Ferrell movie, folks, and that&apos;s a harsh indictment.",

Chicago bus drivers Algy (Bud Abbott) and Wellington (Lou Costello) end up on a yacht with Tommy Layton (Robert Paige) and Joan Marshall (Virginia Bruce) that&apos;s participating in a trans-Pacific race. They go off course and end up on a mysterious tropical island with a tribe of natives who fear a haunted cave. Also featuring Lionel Atwill, Leif Erickson, Samuel S. Hinds, Nan Wynn, Marie McDonald, Janet Warren, Eddie Acuff, Sig Arno, Charles Lane, and William Demarest.\n\nOne knows what to expect from an Abbott &amp; Costello movie, and this one delivers more of the same. After their run of successful military service comedies, this started a new run of parodies of different genre conventions, and this was meant to emulate the hit Road movies with Hope &amp; Crosby over at Paramount. It was a good call by the producers, as this ended up being one of the biggest hits of 1942. It&apos;s silly, with occasional chuckles here and there, but mainly Costello yelling a lot and doing slapstick. There are a few musical numbers, and a lot of &quot;island&quot; girls in skimpy outfits.",

They loved the kissing scene at the end. It is a feel good movie without violence, cuss words, or adult issues. It was fun to see Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, Natalie Maines, and George Strait take on simple, but fun roles. I think the movie is worth watching at least once, even if you don&apos;t buy it.

Really tests the limits by telling a story without a main actor, without a script, without a location. Achieves a certain level of film making bordering on genius or dilettante. What has been done here deserves notice by anyone who has interest in any aspect of film and creative process.\n\nIts a fantastic experience and very much worth watching. Personally I found it interesting that the melange of actors/actresses/scenes spanning almost every conceivable situation, did not include such luminaries as, for example; Michael Caine and Christopher Walken, while still including multiple shots of actors such as Ethan Hawke.\n\nRegardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the premier viewing and relished every minute of what was produced by the writer and director in this instance.",

I wholeheartedly agree with the comments about how it goes from fun to serious almost seamlessly, but one part has been overlooked. The visit to Audrey&apos;s mother, Peaches, is almost abrupt in its quietude (&quot;Don&apos;t call me Lulu, call me Audrey&quot; changes everything), and it makes you wonder how Audrey became as free-spirited as she is. Peaches is no dummy, either... she reads right through Charlie with an air of a woman resigned to never really knowing her daughter. This little visit is the bridge between the fun and scary, the surreal and frighteningly real, and asks more questions than it answers... which works perfectly.",

Nick and Nora take on the murder case at the request of the girlfriend (Jayne Meadows) of the prime murder suspect. The jilted murder victim&apos;s girlfriend (Gloria Grahame) also gets bumped off as well. The movie has some scenes with the son of the Thin Man (played by Dean Stockwell). Keenan Wynn costars as one of the band members (though he is never considered to be a prime suspect). There is still a good chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy in this movie. There are less good one liners that you often heard from the earlier movies in the series though. Asta also has a few good scenes in this movie. William Powell and Myrna Loy appear a bit more tired in this last movie of the series. But I guess that is to be expected as one gets older anyway.",

The time machine in &quot;Back To The Future&quot; was heavily-modfied De Lorean, but in this movie, it is a washing machine from Hitachi!\n\nThe movie has values as a modern history study of Japanese culture, in 1990.

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s the same pre-credit sequence that has kick-started dozens of films over the last few decades: a happy and loving couple are gunned down for apparently no reason in brutal fashion â€“ although in this case they take the next step and include the two young cute children in the massacre to increase the stakes.\n\nNow the rest of the film will be about who is the most p*ssed off and desperate for revenge.\n\nThat guy is Mr Costello, the French father of the critically injured mother, her two children and husband all not surviving the killing. I should point out here that at times the language switches between Chinese, French (with subtitles) and English. The film takes place in Macau but while the Hubby was Asian, the wife â€“ and Costello&apos;s daughter â€“ was French. I don&apos;t know why I found this interesting but I did, but it doesn&apos;t drag you out of the story.\n\nIn true vigilante fashion Mr Costello eschews the traditional law and order approach to finding the killers, after a chance encounter at a crime scene Costello declines the opportunity to bring a killer to justice and instead tracks down the accused to enlist him and his team to help find his daughter&apos;s family&apos;s killers. An odd form of ambulance chasing indeed! The new trio of bad guys agree to hop on board after Costello promises them cash and the restaurant he owns. They start using their contacts and trade secrets to get swift results, during the process it becomes evident that the 65ish Costello has skillz of his own â€“ even if they haven&apos;t been utilised for quite a while.\n\nSo why doesn&apos;t he track them down himself? Well aside from his lack of inside Macau knowledge Costello&apos;s advanced age has caused memory issues in a similar vein to that of the lead character in Memento â€“ he too takes photos and scrawls on them for reminders, meaning he can be a little ineffective once he has a &quot;turn&quot;.\n\nThe plot is reasonably formulaic with only subtle variations on the usual sequence of events â€“ a major shootout is delayed by the arrival of several of the combatant&apos;s kids. Vengeance has a couple of nifty battles where various minions are picked off with clean kills while the main characters are lightly wounded with bloody clothes being the only lasting sign, until near the very end of the film where the Reservoir Dogs rule â€“ that of &quot;most/all must die&quot; kicks in.\n\nFinal Rating â€“ 7 / 10. Take a pinch of SPL, add the core elements of Taken and a dash of Memento and you have a pretty good umÂ… ahhhÂ… Vengeance film. I guess they nailed the title.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Francesco Rosi has &apos;freely&apos; adapted &apos;A Year on a High Plateau&apos; by Emilio Lussu in which the author relates his experience of the horrors of trench warfare as an infantry officer.\n\nThere is no doubting the technical excellence of this film. The muted tones and sweeping camerawork of Pasqualino de Santis together with the ominous score of Piero Piccioni are riveting and Signor Rosi has beautifully choreographed the scenes of mass slaughter. The question is of course does the film engage our emotions? In my case I&apos;m afraid not. There are too many scenes where the director is trying to make a point and is simply laying it on with a trowel.\n\nThe author himself, a highly principled and respected politician, was still alive when the film was released and was no doubt surprised at the fate of his character in the final scene! He thought that although some episodes were faithfully re-enacted the film&apos;s spirit was far removed from that of his original.\n\nHe is portrayed here as Sassu by Mark Frechette in one of two Italian films he made following his debut in Antonioni&apos;s &apos;Zabriskie Point&apos;. His is a sincere and understated performance and it is a great pity that this actor was such a troubled soul who was to meet a bizarre end while serving a prison sentence for robbery!\n\nThe character of mad General Leone, based upon General Giacinto Ferrero, is played by veteran Alain Cuny. This role is a gift to any self-respecting character actor and his performance is utterly mesmerising. It comes as no surprise that Mr. Frechette is dubbed but it does seem strange that Monsieur Cuny is also dubbed considering he had been appearing in Italian films since the early 1950&apos;s. This does not however detract from his magnificently menacing portrayal. The &apos;socialist&apos; element here and knowing Signor Rosi&apos;s work, there has to be one, is personified by the Ottolenghi of Gian Maria Volonte whose far-Left leanings have been well documented.\n\nUpon its release this film met with a great deal of resistance from the military authorities. It has this in common of course with &apos;Paths of Glory&apos; with which it has inevitably been compared. It must be said that although made on a smaller budget and in black-and-white, Stanley Kubrick&apos;s film packs a bigger punch as does the underrated &apos;Westfront&apos; of G. W. Pabst.\n\nWhatever its merits Francesco Rosi&apos;s film lacks the subtlety of those two films but still serves as a grim reminder that whichever way you look at it, war is hell.",

      "reviewBody": "You know you&apos;re in for a ride with this picture from the opening moments. Roehler drops us smack in the middle of a blowout argument between a young couple whose sex life is on the skids. The fight is at that fever pitch where the woman is crying almost convulsively, and where each of them is beginning to lose their grip on saying sensible things and are on the verge of cheap shots and unhelpful attempts at humor. The scene is tangible and familiar to anyone who&apos;s ever grappled with a fraying relationship, and, with a shocking abruptness, we&apos;re immediately in the reality of Robert and Marie.\n\nFor 95 minutes that reality never wanes, and in fact expands to involve Robert&apos;s deathly ill father and Marie&apos;s previous attempts at suicide. There are a lot of movies about messed-up middle class couples. What makes &quot;Angst&quot; special is that, as messed-up as they are, Robert and Marie&apos;s reality is not uniformly bleak. There are moments of delirious joy between them, and we have to take them at their word that these are moments that only occur when they are with each other. And like any of us, they have to figure out if they can live with the devil&apos;s bargain: take the joy, and deal with the enormous fears that come with it.\n\nMarie Baeumer&apos;s a complex and deeply honest performance. She has what Martin Scorsese calls the ability to wage full wars on her face (although he was talking about classic, male movie stars when he said it). Her slightest expression shows the depth of both her affection and her contempt for Robert. For his part, Andre Hennicke plays Robert brilliantly. He&apos;s as panicked over his own impulsive behavior as he is lovestruck for Marie.\n\nIn the Q&amp;A at the AFI Fest, Roehler described his shooting process as being more theatrical than cinematic, which would go some length in explaining how he got such fantastic work from his actors, but he doesn&apos;t give himself enough credit. He has a magnificent cinematic sense, one that had me thinking of Kieslowski and Tarkovsky throughout (and not just because of a blatant reference to &quot;Solaris&quot;). It is one of the most psychologically intelligent films I&apos;ve seen in a good long time, but it&apos;s also just a damn good movie.\n\nOne which, by the way does not have an American distributor, which is a goddamned crime! Of course, the suits are probably terrified by the level of nudity, both male and female, in the picture, and a few very graphic sexual moments. There&apos;s no question it&apos;s an NC-17 picture, but it would also get killer reviews and do serious art house business. The fact that a film like this has any trouble at all finding distribution in this country is all the evidence needed to indicate how culturally ass-backwards we have become.",

When the bank-robbing-action is at it&apos;s best, the suspense and high-quality filming really is unique. At the final scene the shoot-out is grotesqly well done and can only be compared to early John Woo-Hong Kong flicks... Nothing made in the US can compare to this truly adorable movie. Maybe KILLING ZOE may compare in violence, but not in acting...\n\nThe scene when Yann and his girlfriend is talking with sign-language only is one of the best scenes in this movie - even though it has no action, no words and only a humming noice... \n\nNice movie that should be seen only by those who can stand grim action that looks real. It&apos;s a hard movie to watch for some people, but it has great qualities, very nice filming and spectacular direction and editing! Watch out for some nice laughs as well... if you have that sick dark kind of humor, that is... :-)\n\n9 out of 10!",

Pablo Berger is the director and this is only his second film, but the work is of a mature creator, mastering the subject, with a deep understanding of the time the plot happens, with a strong hand in directing his actors, while leaving them enough space for creativity.\n\nThe plot happens in 1973, a moment before the fascist dictatorship in Spain fell, and Spain re-joined the family of democratic nations. A not so young couple anticipates in a way the cultural and economic revolution all Spain will go soon, by acting and producing porno movies for the Scandinavian market under the pretext of &apos;researching reproduction morals in different countries&apos;. The film tells a lot about the process of transition between dictatorship and democracy and its moral risks, about the contrast between tradition and liberal morals, about the relation between pornography and art. All is done in good taste, even the soft core porno scenes are justified for a change. The actors are wonderful, they create empathy with the viewer, and they are credible as characters. \n\n9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",

      "reviewBody": "Growing up in Germany, I watched lots of fairy tales. For some reason, the Eastern European ones often seemed much more lovely, imaginable and likeable than some of the rather stiff German adaptations.\n\nI do not know whether this is based on a Grimm fairy tale, or an original story, but it is very endearing nevertheless. An ageing king has 3 daughters, each of which is about to marry a prince. On the occassion of his birthday, he wants to give his entire kingdom to the daughter (and her future husband) who loves him the most. His two older daughter love him like gold and diamonds and other valuable stuff. His youngest daughter tells him she loves him like the salt of the earth, which enrages him so much that he banishes her, even though she explains that she needs salt to live, whereas gold is useless. Her husband-to-be, the prince of salt from the Netherworld, is taken away by his own father, the king of salt, and turned into a salt statue in a fit of rage, for being foolish enough to love an earth girl. And as the two kings meet, the salt king curses the other, turning all salt into gold forevermore... Of course, the young princess needs to go on a quest and rescue her lover, and her kingdom, where everyone is soon falling ill because of the lack of salt.\n\nThis movie is my second favourite fairy tale. It is enchanting and loveable. Almost up to the standards of &quot;three hazelnuts for cinderella&quot; - the best of the fairy tales produced by the same cast."

      "reviewBody": "Dinosaur from the Deep (1993) \n\n1/2 (out of 4) \n\nProfesseur Nolan (Jean Rollin) leads a group of scientists on a time travel experiment, which leaves them on a small island where soon they&apos;re fighting for their lives as they come under attack by a deadly dinosaur.\n\nDINOSAUR FROM THE DEEP comes from director N.G. Mount and it&apos;s certainly one of the worst films of its type. I think the film enters a level of badness to where the viewer can get some mild entertainment just out of seeing and wondering how much worse it&apos;s going to get. I&apos;d be shocked if the budget was over a couple thousand dollars as everything about this picture has a very cheap feel to it.\n\nThis here includes the dinosaur scenes, which are extremely bad and especially for 1993. These effects might have passed in the silent era but even those low-budget Roger Corman pictures of the early 80s featured better effects. Obviously you&apos;re not expecting the quality of JURASSIC PARK here but these effects are so awful that the ones seen in CARNOSAUR appear to be ground-breaking. Another major problem with this film is the fact that the special effects are just as bad. Just check out the scene where a man has his eye ripped out.\n\nThe one interesting thing about the picture is that it does feature French director Rollin in the lead role. If you&apos;ve seen his films like THE LIVING DEAD GIRL and THE RAPE OF THE VAMPIRE then you might be interested seeing him in front of the camera. This too adds some minor entertainment but there&apos;s no question that DINOSAUR FROM THE DEEP is at the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to these type of monster movies."

Besides the wild interpretation of the ending and what was going throughout the movie, you cannot escape very effective visual way of playing on contrasts of everything: names - Bianca (Italian for white) with the char-black hair, clothing and furniture - all either ivory white or pitch black, and even that famous giant glass flute - full of very dark (almost black) chocolate - appears in the pristine white surrounding. \n\nThe moral stance on the murders going on on the eventual background leaves no doubt of only choice between darkness and light, good or evil, and with dialogs - from what I vaguely remember - mostly non-existent - just cops questioning and radio or TV hosts talking. \n\nAfter watching this film, my wife and could not stop talking about all those symbols and each of them meant and who did what to whom. At that time there was no internet, IMDb and I never met anybody else (and my life stretches across 3 continents and very many movie-loving friends) who ever seen this movie so we could discuss the details. \n\nI would gladly see it again. Looking back - I think it was way ahead of its time in its visual expressiveness and spooky plot but as Dennis Miller use to say: &quot;this of course is just my opinion and I can be wrong.&quot;",

So the demons are rather zombies, but they don&apos;t eat their victims - they just split their skulls with axes and/or gouge out their eyes with hooks (ah yeah, and once they also use a pitchfork).\n\nVery similar (concerning production values and gore scenes; and in a way also concerning the story) to Lenzi&apos;s made for cable cheapo &apos;Le Porte dell&apos;Inferno&apos; two years earlier.

Not so good as &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot;, that is more on the relationship of a white girl with a nice black guy. This movie tells the passion of a girl on dancing with her best friend, the love relationship with and her boyfriend. Tells the difficulties of a sick person against the will of going through with her life, her passion of DANCING and her objective to succeed with the auditions at Juliard :-) This is a good movie to watch on TV on a cold winter day with your family. The actors are nice and the two girls are giving a good performance. It&apos;s maybe not the best film of that genre, but still this is a one to watch !",

The basic premise of the work is the life of dreamy Andre, the elder of two brothers of a gorgeous mother. There is some intense symbolism at work here, the figure of the mother portrayed against the fascination of Andre for the moon itself. The brothers, identical in appearance, so different in personality both brilliantly played by Robert. One knows he is destined to be forever the dreamer, with some small triumphs ( a booking by a Russian for a lecture in Moscow, missed by Andre&apos;s absentmindedness, a winning of a video contest put on by SETI ). Meanwhile, Andre&apos;s real life is outlined in stunning detail, his deadend job in a call centre, his life surrounded by his dead mother&apos;s belongings, his ex-girlfriend, now living in a wealthy suburb. His interior life sustains him and the ending is uplifting and sad at the same time. 8 out of 10. Unusual and riveting.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Amandla! A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony&quot; is a documentary that is riveting and educational, uplifting and heartbreaking. The contrasts are all laid bare in this project, making it a worthwhile film to watch.\n\nThe focal point of the documentary is the role music played in the lives of South Africans as they endured and overcame the Apartheid movement. Director Leon Hirsch interviews a number of singers, composers, DJs and freedom fighters, young and old. He follows the history of Apartheid by tracing the music that came out of the struggle and what happened to those who created it.\n\nI think what grabbed me was how much of a role music plays in great periods of change. It was also a driving force of African-Americans in the U.S. who were fighting segregation during the 60s. The spirituals that buoyed them share a similar history to those songs sung in South Africa.\n\nThe music chosen was a wonderful collection I want to hear again. I also enjoyed seeing the laughter of many of the singers as they looked at old photographs, remembering younger days.\n\nI also liked that Hirsch interviewed a white freedom fighter who was sent to Pretoria prison for several years. His interviews with the white Afrikkaners who formerly worked as riot police and jailers are chilling but necessary.\n\n My hope is that more Americans will see this film so they fully realize the scope of Apartheid in South Africa and what a triumph it was to see it overturned. Was it really 1994 when black South Africans were finally allowed to vote? It breaks my heart.\n\nAs a teenager in the 80s, I knew hardly anything about Apartheid. This film did a good job in changing that."

Activists such as Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Nelson Mandela were exchanging their prison cells for their countries&apos; Presidential Palaces, and it seemed that Burma (I will not call it &quot;Myanmar&quot;), which had been governed by a repressive military junta since 1962, would be the next democratic success story. Opposition to the regime was led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the beautiful and charismatic daughter of a national hero who enjoyed the devoted support of most of her compatriots. It seemed inevitable that &quot;people power&quot; would sweep away the junta, just as it had swept away the Marcos regime in the Philippines and the Communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd yet this did not happen; the Burmese regime succeeded in maintaining its iron grip on power. Perhaps the reason was that, unlike many other tyrannies, it lacked any recognisable ideology beyond an Orwellian vision of &quot;a boot stamping on a human face, forever&quot;. Communism collapsed when it became clear that it could not perform its ostensible ideological function, the protection of the economic interests of the working man. This in turn provoked the collapse of right-wing dictatorships like Pinochet&apos;s in Chile or Suharto&apos;s in Indonesia, which had justified their existence by claiming to defend their countries against Communism. Apartheid collapsed when it became clear that the economic interests of black and white South Africans were so closely intertwined as to make nonsense of the idea of &quot;separate development&quot;. Than Shwe&apos;s junta, lacking any ideology which could be discredited in this way, could resist the forces of change for as long as it could maintain the loyalty of its troops and its own will to power.\n\n&quot;The Lady&quot; depicts the life of Suu Kyi, known as &quot;the lady&quot; to her followers. It is not a complete biography, as it shows little of her early life, apart from the assassination of her father Aung San when she was three years old. The main action begins in 1988, when she was in her mid-forties and returned to Burma to visit her ailing mother, having previously been living in England with her husband Michael Aris, an Oxford professor. Her visit coincided with an uprising against military rule, which was followed by a brief period of liberalisation. She was persuaded to lead the country&apos;s nascent pro-democracy movement, and her party, the National League for Democracy, won a convincing majority in the 1990 parliamentary election. The military, however, refused to recognise the result and reimposed martial law. Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest and all political campaigning was forbidden. The junta seemed quite unmoved by international condemnation; even the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Suu Kyi in 1993 could not persuade them to release her.\n\nThe film was directed by Luc Besson, who was perhaps not the ideal director, as he had previously best been known for making action movies such as &quot;Nikita&quot;. He had made a previous biography of a national political heroine, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, but even there the action scenes are the best thing about the film. It is perhaps therefore unsurprising that &quot;The Lady&quot; is rather slow and ponderous and shows signs of having been made by a director unused to this style of film-making. Visually, however, the film is often attractive, with effective contrasts between the green, tropical lushness of South-East Asia- these scenes were shot in Thailand rather than Burma itself- and the grey stone of Oxford, a city often seen in the snow.\n\nTo be fair to Besson, he appears to have been deeply committed to this film, and it is possible that without his commitment it might never have been made. He was fortunate in having a leading lady, Michelle Yeoh, who was just as committed as he was; indeed, it was she who persuaded him to take on the project. Yeoh here gets to show, as she did in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, that she is more than just a Bond Girl, more than just a kung-fu action heroine. She has the advantage of bearing a striking resemblance to the woman she is portraying.\n\nYeoh described the film as &quot;an incredible love story&quot;, and the element most emphasised in the film is the relationship between Suu Kyi and her husband, from whom she was separated for many years. She would have been free at any time to leave Burma and rejoin him and their two sons in England, but always refused to do so, knowing that if she ever left the country she would never be permitted to return. David Thewlis as Aris is perhaps even better than Yeoh, playing him as an unworldly academic and devoted family man who nevertheless selflessly insists that his wife remain in Burma, knowing that if she leaves the country this will be a great blow to the pro-democracy movement. His premature death from cancer, possibly brought on or exacerbated by the stress of his situation, is the film&apos;s most tragic moment.\n\nSuu Kyi&apos;s house arrest has now been lifted and Burma is now ruled by a civilian government, although it remains to be seen whether it will evolve into a genuine democracy; the elections in 2010 were widely denounced as neither free nor fair, and the new government as a mere front for a continuing military dictatorship. The expulsion of Michelle Yeoh from the country last year would suggest that the authorities are still very touchy about criticism. The film, however, performs the valuable service of reminding the world of the problems of a country which was for too long one of the last bastions of tyranny. I certainly preferred it to &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, the other recent biopic of a major female political figure. 7/10",

Beau Bridges leads a bunch of bad teens, Tommy Kirk (of Disney comedy fame) is the leader of some good teens, and you are the befuddled audience trying to believe what is transpiring on the screen.\n\nNatch: the idiotic bad teens get a hold of the goo, and turn into colossal idiotic bad teens who take over a small town somewhere. Apparently, the presence of 30 foot hostile giants does not interest anyone outside of the town, so the townsfolk are left to fend for themselves. Of course, nobody in the town except the good teens bother to do anything about it.\n\nOnce the giants appear, the action is limited, probably due to a lack of budget for special effects. The growth sequence is about all they really focused on, where they --oh, never mind. It&apos;s the highlight of the film, though, trust me. Progressively cheaper and cheaper effects parade their way through the story after that. My favorite is the scene where they try to &quot;tie up&quot; a giant Beau Bridges. You see two plastic poles (supposed to be his legs) being roped by the good teens. They then try to fasten the ropes with hot rods orbiting the &quot;surprised&quot; victim. Every once in a while, they show Beau making spasmodic and confused expressions in slow motion. By the way, whenever they show a character in slow-mo, you know it&apos;s one of the giants.\n\nThe movie knows it&apos;s idiotic, and makes no effort to conceal it. Good for a laugh at how absurd it is.",

He&apos;s trainable as a hunting dog and they&apos;re going to prove it. All this to the amusement of parents Earl Holliman and Patricia Crowley for Whittaker and Beah Richards, Spell&apos;s widowed mom.\n\nI did like the chemistry between the boys in the film, they come across as real and genuine.\n\nRounding out the cast are Lew Ayres, the sportsman for whom Holliman trains hunting dogs, Mantan Moreland as a snoopy butler, Clifton James as a mean neighbor.\n\nCannot forget Godfrey Cambridge though as a hustling gas station owner who is forever got a cigar in his mouth and is quite a character. You have to see how he hustles Lew Ayres and how he wheedles free meals from Beah Richards.\n\nThe Biscuit Eater is a nice family film in the Disney tradition.",

However, Maggie was sort of dating the boss&apos;s son, Ted Barclay, (Chad Everett) who wanted to score with Maggie but she preferred to stay a virgin which made Ted rather angry, but he really loved her so he told his father Maggie would be great for this assignment as a fashion buyer in Paris, France. Maggie was in for a big surprise when she arrived in Paris because she ran into Louis Jourdan,(Marc Fontaine) who was a ladies man and a famous fashion designer of women&apos;s clothing who started to get very interested in Maggie in more ways than one. There is plenty of dancing by Ann Margaret and even a few songs are sung. Richard Crenna, (Herb Stone) gave an outstanding performance and he looked so young in this picture I could hardly recognize him.",

Excellent costumes, shooting in ladakh is difficult task , really great efforts from the whole crew. I really feel this movie deserves better promotion world wide. I just came to know about this movie through the news that the lead pair got married.\n\nI really wonder why there is no publicity for such a great movie. fate of this movie quite similar to that of ladakh - unseen and untouched beauty",

Zeenat Aman was stupendous. Mumtaz was good but the real highlighter of this film is the music of the legendary Rahul Dev Burman.........I mean WOW!! Funny thing I read about other reviews is that no one mentioned the song &quot;phoolon ka taaron ka sabka kehna hain&quot; I understand &quot;Dumm Maaro Dumm&quot; was phenomenal, why was it still is even today but the other songs were very good too.\n\nActing was above average, certain aspects are too melodramatic but then again keeping in mind the 1970s of India it was good, great job by cinematographer and rest of the support staffs.\n\nI give my ratings out of 10:\n\nActing - 6 Story - 8.5 Screenplay - 8.5 Direction - 8 Music Dept. - 10 (since 100 out of 10 was not possible) Other Aspects - 6\n\nOverall - 7.83 out of 10 so I round it of to 8 out of 10",

      "name": "Magnificent, emotionally wrenching early film by the great Satyajit Ray",
      "reviewBody": "This film, called TEEN KANYA in Bengali and TWO DAUGHTERS in English, was made six years after Ray&apos;s first film, PATHER PANCHALI (1955), which was the first of the famous APU TRILOGY. Having finished that trilogy as well as another of his haunting masterpieces, THE MUSIC ROOM, Ray turned his attention to two wonderful short stories by Rabindranath Tagore, so that this film is therefore a diptych, composed of two separate films of those two stories. The first of them is entitled THE POSTMASTER, and most of it is filmed in and around a small hut inhabited by a young man who has just become a village postmaster. Along with the hut and the job, he has acquired a servant named Ratan who is a 10 year-old orphan girl who never knew her mother and father. The previous postmaster beat her and treated her badly, but the new one is very kind, and she becomes attached to him. This is the first time she has ever allowed herself to feel anything for anyone, in her harsh young life. The story is one of the saddest and most heart-breaking ever filmed. The intensity of the acting by the young girl, played by Chandana Banerjee, is one of the most powerful child screen performances in the history of world cinema. This young girl only made one other film, KAA, in 1966, and after that, nothing is recorded of her life or her fate. She was able to convey so much with her eyes without speaking, that it was like cinematic telepathy. The ending of this film is unforgettable, and will haunt any sensitive person always. The second film is not a sad story but an odd and amusing one. It concerns a girl in her late teens who is a wildly eccentric tomboy. She and her family live in a shack by the river bank, having lost their home and all their possessions in one of the many floods which continually afflict Bengal (the stories are set in Bengal). She likes to run wild and free, swing from the trees, play with the boys, run and hide in the forest, and always goes barefoot. She is brilliantly played by the young actress Aparna Sen, whose first adult part it was (she had appeared in one film previously as a child). She went on to become one of India&apos;s most famous serious film actresses, and has appeared in 62 films, including others by Satyajit Ray such as DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FOREST (1970) and THE MIDDLEMAN (1976). She also appeared in James Ivory&apos;s THE GURU (1969) with Michael York and Rita Tushingham, as well as James Ivory&apos;s BOMBAY TALKIE (1970) with Felicity Kendal. In this film, Sen evokes the mystery and the animal energy of the wild young creature in an unforgettable portrayal of a girl in rebellion at becoming a woman and a wife and thus forfeiting her freedom. These days the film should be adopted by feminists as a manifesto statement. Satyajit Ray was notable for making many films sympathetic to women, girls, and children, and he had a rare understanding of the vagaries of feminine psychology. His films are often as much psychology lessons as they are high art. And he had the ability to get his actors and actresses to give of their best, and then more besides. Certainly, Ray&apos;s films are some of the most emotionally moving and psychologically profound works of cinema ever made. But in addition to that, they are technical masterpieces as well. For this film, Ray was director, producer, writer, and composer of the music. Ray was certainly one of the three great Bengali geniuses of the 20th century, another being Rabindranath Tagore himself, and the third being unquestionably Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, the scientist who collaborated with Albert Einstein, and after whom Bose-Einstein Condensates are named. (But if you have never heard of Bose-Einstein Condensates, you are forgiven, as they are highly technical, and even most physicists have never heard of them.)",

      "reviewBody": "11 AM is a very well constructed movie, with an intriguing story line that draws you in very quickly and the cast and production crew were more than up to the task of executing this script to perfection. I watched this movie on the tiny screen of a KLM airline on my way to Amsterdam from Dubai, surrounded by crying and kicking kids and a large snoring man, but I was blind to my surrounding for an hour and a half.\n\nThe movie tells the tale of a research team in an underwater Russian nuclear fusion reactor trying to create a black hole with which to travel in time. After 3 years and one small success the project is set to be scrapped, but the lead researcher schedules one final test run to travel 24 hours in to the future. When he arrives in the future with his (rather cute) assistant, they see the lab is on fire and the crew is no where in sight. While they scurry to collect evidence of their time travel and return to the past someone tries to kill one of them and the assistant is left behind (or is she?). Back in the present the story follows a series of seeming mysteries such as why was the lab on fire? what happens in the next 24 hours? Why is the CCTV footage corrupted? The crew have 24 hours to figure out what happened and stop it.\n\nIf you&apos;re read or seen scifi on time travel you will guess what happens next. Despite having guessed the biggest &quot;twist&quot; in the tale, I enjoyed the movie because of its sharp acting, noir style atmosphere and enthralling story line. This movie follows well in the foot steps of Oldboy (ok maybe not THAT good), I saw the devil and Memories of murder and should have had more exposure in the west.",

      "reviewBody": "An unusual Elvis Presley vehical which actually gives him the opportunity to act.  Elvis was a talented actor who was put in crap for most of his career. The Hollywood system always put him in films where he sings without doing much else.  Its only when he worked with talented directors such as Michael Curtiz and Don Siegal that his abilities as an actor were fully used. King Creole(1958) is such a film where he is given the chance to act and he passes with flying colors.  King Creole(1958) and the western, Charro(1968) are my two favorite Elvis Presley films because of their dark tone and the excellent acting performances by Elvis.  One of the better directed Elvis films by veteran filmmaker and Casablanca(1942) director, Michael Curtiz. One of the people who wrote the story was Michael V. Gazzo, who would later play an important role in The Godfather Part 2(1974).  Walter Matthaw is terrific in one of his pre Odd Couple and comedic roles.  A musical Noir done during the final year of the genre before becoming extinct."

      "reviewBody": "The film tells about Burton family formed by the father (John MacIntire), his second Indian wife (Dolores del Rio) and two sons , one (Steve Forrest) of the first wife and another (Elvis Presley) results to be a half-breed . The latter will have to choose sides when the battles between white men and Kiowas (Rodolfo Acosta) go on the warpath . Burton family splits loyalties , the confrontation will be violent and lethal . \n\nIt&apos;s an interesting western with an exceptional interpretation by Elvis Presley who only sings two songs at the beginning of the film . He&apos;s a mestizo who along with his mother will be excluded for both races . Originally planned as a vehicle for Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift ; however , the picture is considered to be Presley&apos;s best western and along with Â¨King CreoleÂ¨ (directed by Michael Curtiz) and Â¨Jailhouse rockÂ¨ (by Richard Thorpe) his greatest movies . Andy Warhol&apos;s famous diptych of Elvis Presley as a cowboy came from a shot in this movie . Steve Forrest (Dana Andrews&apos;s brother) as his kind brother is very fine . Dolores del Rio as his affectionate mum and Rodolfo Acosta as Kiowa chief , repeat well their usual Indians roles . Barbara Eden as a wonderful youngster who helps protagonists is enjoyable and enticing , though Barbara Steele walked off the picture after an argument with director Don Siegel , she then was replaced by Eden . Besides , in the secondary cast appears Richard Jaeckel (Dirty dozen) , L.Q.Jones (Peckimpah&apos;s habitual) and Karl Swenson . Glittering and shimmer cinematography is perfectly reflected on spectacular outdoors and colorful interiors by cameraman Charles Clarke . Lively as well as atmospheric musical score by Cryl Mockridge . The motion picture was professionally directed by Donald Siegel (Dirty Harry) . The flick will appeal to Elvis Presley fans and Western genre enthusiasts.",

I gave away all of them as gifts except for one copy. One of them was given as a white elephant gift at a family Xmas get together, simply because I knew it was a really low budget movie, but it made me laugh every time I watched it. It&apos;s in a clamshell box - very cool.......if you haven&apos;t seen it - you are missing out! I loved seeing him run around in his underpants......and the props used in the house were cheap and gaudy. When I first saw this movie, I had no idea who Ed Wood was - it wasn&apos;t until years later that I read more about him and saw other movies. I am going to hunt up my copy of this movie right now and watch it again. I only wish I had it on DVD instead of VHS.",

      "reviewBody": "In 16th century Scotland, immortals fought against each other, in a quest for the prize of being the one remaining at the end of the centuries of fighting. Conner Macleod (Christophe Lambert) is trained in the art of sword fighting by Ramirez (Sean Connery) in hope that one day one of them will fight and defeat the Kurgen (Clancy Brown) The story is set over 4 centuries and stretches from the highlands of Scotland to the streets of New York.\n\nFirstly the cinematography in the highlands captures the breath taking scenery beautifully, the story is captivating fantasy, with dialogue and direction to suit the theme, and the cast all perform well enough to entice you into the story and hold your attention, without ever really excelling. Finally the soundtrack is provided by Queen, and it genuinely adds to the emotional feel of the film in quite dramatic style.\n\nHighlander is a very good movie, that has its flaws; but in fantasy, does it really matter? However the sequels are far too contradictory and contrived to be given the same forgiveness. This film really is the only one; and its stands alone without the need for its inferior sequels.\n\n7/10",

And even kids don&apos;t spare their critics nowadays. But when Jolly Roger was on television in Indonesia this week, (June 28th, 2004), I found myself enjoying a good deal of fun together with a bunch of other grown up guys. Now is a dubbed film something I hate, I rather had heard the original voices, but hey, it IS for kids, so I had to do with the bad translation. But in general it was fun to watch this movie, with some surprising funny characters, like the angels watching the earth. I have always enjoyed watching kids movies from Scandinavia. They always tend to listen to the kids rather than the adults who always have an opinion what kids like. Maybe that&apos;s why I like the awards given at Cinekid (see IMDb awards) where the kids choose their favorite and often that&apos;s not what the adults would choose! I would say, this film is not that bad at all, inventive in the way it portrayed the characters, and I am looking forward to more of this. Luckely, the Indonesian television is using this 3 weeks &apos;summerholiday&apos; to give the kids here a little bit of Scandinavian fun, and I wouldn&apos;t miss it for the world!",

David Sutcliffe looks a bit young to be a father of teens. The later part kind of gets corny but it&apos;s a good movie for families with just sons and no daughters to watch (or daughters who don&apos;t help their moms).

      "reviewBody": "Not your average World War II documentary, &apos;The True Glory&apos; avoids static interviews or impersonal narration, instead presenting collated archive footage from the final few months of the war, played out against real war veterans verbally relating their experiences. While some of the stock footage shown feels awfully familiar, there are several excellent, unusual shots throughout, most notably one where the camera is positioned at the wheels of the plane and a sequence where passers-by on the street walk up to the camera from all different directions. The nighttime footage is remarkable too. Not all of the verbal recounts resonate with a lot of flag-waving dialogue, however, several lines linger long in the mind (&quot;I&apos;m not squeamish... but I&apos;m human&quot;) and the documentary refreshingly includes recounts from an extensive variety of personnel. Sure, most of the interviewees are soldiers, but we also get the perspective of an army hospital nurse, a war reporter and the list goes on. The documentary also curiously mentions the prospect of World War III some time in (then) foreseeable future with a reminder that war really can be a horrible thing. Indeed, while the film sometimes feels like the Allies patting themselves on the back for a successful victory, &apos;The True Glory&apos; does not shy away from depicting how grueling war is and it deserves some credit for that.",

The entire trip was something fully unexpected from the barrage of F-bombs that makes up the first five minutes to the alluded to (but nonetheless unexpected) cameo of Shania Twain. It&apos;s near impossible to explain what the film is actually about in this space, so you&apos;ll have to settle for this: The always hilarious Lily Tomlin and the wonderful Dustin Hoffman play a couple of &quot;existential detectives&quot; hired by Jason Schwartzman (in perhaps his best role) to investigate a series of &quot;coincidences&quot; involved a very tall African man. Schwartzman is the head of an environmentalist group trying to make a deal with the Huckabees department store to save a marsh (Jude Law plays the Huckabees exec and Naomi Watts his wife--a Huckabees commercial model). Mark Wahlberg shows one of his best performances thus far as a fireman who has also hired the &quot;existential duo&quot; for help with the Big Questions. Jon Brion provides yet another truly original score (not as eccentric and beautiful as Eternal Sunshine, but definitely more involved than Punch Drunk Love). In short, this film is a masterpiece for everyone involved.",

One of the great things about this film is that it&apos;s made Shakespeare accessible to many more folks who might not have even bothered otherwise. Zefferili does for Shakespeare what Emeril does for cuisine--makes it entertaining while keeping all the quality. And what a fun production--great costumes, a young Michael York, lots of sexy repartee. A good choice for a snowy night when you&apos;d rather stay in. It keeps you pretty entertained throughout, simplifies some of the plot intricacies. One drawback is that Miss Taylor appears to be a little long in the tooth to be playing a young, never-married, girl.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know how much in this film was self-aware and how much was going on on the back of the director. Of other experiences i&apos;ve had with this filmmaker&apos;s work, i never saw anything that might make me believe i&apos;d see anything as clever as what we have in this film. However, this film is a good experience, a piece which was cleverly allowed to breath to the rhythm of the female performances.\n\nThe casting of the 5 leading female characters is the first great thing about this. All of them are more or less attached to a certain cultural (european) background, and in the world of film, each one became linked to a certain type of character. That is used in the writing of this film, and i would say each role was written bearing in mind specifically each of the ladies we see here. For each role there might be 1 or 2 other acceptable actress options, but no more.\n\nThe second good thing is how acting types are allowed to play freely. Each woman dominates her scene, and bends the other (male) characters to her own breath, to her own acting rhythm and style, as much as Maura&apos;s character bends Joaquim d&apos;Almeida to her lifestyle. The story plays accordingly, since all these women are, or fight for being, masters of their own life. So there&apos;s a folding of women trying to live free lives into women&apos;s different acting styles, allowed to run wild. This i think was not intentional, but it certainly works.\n\nAnother great thing, that proves my last paragraph, are the scenes in which several of these women interact and, remarkably, the one in which the 5 of them, and only them, act together in Maura&apos;s home, and actually make a film together! I appreciated the self-reference of the thing. These scenes, specially this at Maura&apos;s house, are great because it&apos;s in the Lumet or Altman tradition of capturing the breath of each actress&apos;s performance. They are allowed to breath and each performance is thrown at each other, so the richness of the scene is in how we compare them.\n\nI&apos;d say the general mood intended for the film was fully based on AlmodÃ³var&apos;s film world, thus the Carmen Maura connection. This would be, i think, intentional, and the director looked for it. But he messed that up, and it&apos;s good he did, because if he&apos;d insisted to hard on that, he might have wiped out the other great eventually non intentional stuff. But the writing is great, self-aware and fully supportive to the actresses. That&apos;s why we have two writing devices that enfold the acting nature of this film:-one of the characters is herself a performer, so she is acting an actor. Her performances are vital points for two dramatic developments in the film (her daughter watching her have sex on stage, and her jealousy towards her friend). -Carmen Maura films her friends, making confessions to the camera. So they are ostensibly framed, and placed speaking to the camera, and thus to us. Great devices.\n\nLisbon is just a postcard here.\n\nMy opinion: 4/5, you should watch this"

      "reviewBody": "If you were around in summer 1989 then you&apos;ll remember that Batmania was EV-ER-Y-WHERE! You couldn&apos;t look anywhere without seeing the Bat Logo in some incarnation. The film was a mega-hit. People were queueing up around the block for hours (the literal meaning of a blockbuster). I remember being in a car, driving up Lothian Road in Edinburgh and seeing a long line of people queuing at the box office of the Cannon Cinema (as it was then) and being jealous that I wasn&apos;t old enough to see it. My lot of movies that summer was restricted to Ghostbusters II and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, both of which I saw in Florida. Batman had a 12-rating in the UK, and was upped to 15 for video. This &quot;grown up&quot; rating gave it an alluring mystique as was always the case with such movies to my hungry, impressionable mind.\n\nThe marketing team at Warner succeeded in immersing the public consciousness with the big-screen coming of the Dark Knight. Up until this point the Batman series from the 1960s is how the vast majority of the audience regarded the Batman character and universe. Tim Burton corrected all of that by giving us a dark, sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman (who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored). The original material is respected (to a degree), and the characters are deep instead of just campy. Burton also retained a lot of the noir elements that have been present in the old Batman serials and many of the comic books.\n\nMichael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion. He&apos;s a rich, socio-phobic megalomaniac who has more money than sense and is often bumbling and clumsy, very different from Adam West&apos;s turtleneck playboy. As Batman he&apos;s silent and imposing, the polar opposite of Christian Bale&apos;s overplayed attempt, which I don&apos;t think anyone was really impressed by. Batman needs a counterbalance and I believe that Heath Ledger helped up Bale by accident\n\nJack Nicholson is a &quot;good&quot; Joker too, not quite as iconic as Ledger&apos;s take on the character, but still a role that has defined his career. I like that they acknowledge his intelligence and gave him a new edge by making him artistically gifted, but not much is done with it when it should have been a heavier driving force behind his insanity.\n\nAnton Furst&apos;s Oscar-winning design of Gotham City is, to me, THE aesthetic that all other attempts failed to match. The smoke-blackened, cramped, and claustrophobic buildings look and create a very oppressive atmosphere, like a New York City that has not had planning permission for 200 years. The matte paintings are gorgeous and create pure escapism in a way that green screen digital mattes just cannot replicate.\n\nIt may not be as mature as Nolan&apos;s work but it has an edge that no other recent comic-book movie has. It&apos;s just a shame that the late-80s writer strike happened just a few days after Sam Hamm submitted his script to Warner. He was unable to make further drafts and rewrite scenes so Burton had some British writers make changes to the script (it was shot at Pinewood) which involved making Jack Napier/Joker the killer of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Sam Hamm was against this, as well as every single Batman fan on planet Earth. If there is one major, and valid, fault that audiences rightfully complain about then this major change to the established lore is it.\n\nRightfully a classic, and, aside from some weak writing, it&apos;s better than ALL of today&apos;s comic-book movies (please just make them stop!). If Batman had failed, then the sub-genre would be written-off forever. It&apos;s just a shame that Warner squandered this lightning in a bottle after two movies.",

Having emerged in the opening shot from behind an umbrella like the stranger in the dream sequence at the start of &apos;Wild Strawberries&apos;, Cederlund thereafter saunters in and out of the action - sometimes in a haze of cigar smoke like Leon Ames as Mr.Candle in &apos;Yolanda and the Thief&apos; - occasionally breeching the fourth wall to comment urbanely on the action.",

With most sequels you walk in expecting an extension of the first, all the things that worked in the first film delivered in the second.  Seldom does the sequel collect the audacity to march off in a different direction.\n\nThis one bravely does and creates and entirely different film, a much darker one spun cleanly from the first.\n\nApologies to all the nay sayers but this is dead solid perfect.\n\nA cult niche and maybe a lesson on how to do sequels ... get creative people on board to use the engine of unexpected popularity, or expected popularity, for inventive film making.\n\nI&apos;ll own this one and the original.\n\nCool."

I personally enjoyed this one, because it supported the thought that one should not blindly follow what their parents want for them, and that it&apos;s OK to be original. Sure he a little overacted with the headaches, but how does one exactly portray a severe headache? It also adds to the comedy aspect. Shahrukh Khan is a wonderful dancer (although he denies it), and it shows in this one almost as good as it did in DDLJ. Another aspect it has is the different sports(activities) that the female lead character is put on par with SRK&apos;s character, if not better, because she knows what she wants to do when she&apos;s finished college. And her idea&apos;s original(not what daddy says). This is a real reality in our world today. It&apos;s not as funny as DDLJ or serious as Kal Ho Naa Ho. But the artist did a great job(SRK) for the part given.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re sick of the current trend of having movies use a mostly teal color palette with orange for the explosions, then this is the movie for you. Ingmar Bergman and his cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, use a palette of red, red, red, red, and red as a backdrop for their story of three sisters in circa-1900 Sweden. Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is dying of cancer, and her two sisters Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann) come to comfort her in her final days. Not that they&apos;re much comfort, since the whole family is dysfunctional for reasons that are never clearly delineated. And they all have bizarre sexual hangups.\n\nI&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be in the minority, but I found that when it comes to dysfunctional families, this movie pales in comparison to Bergman&apos;s later Autumn Sonata. There, the characters are real people and it&apos;s easy to identify with them. Here, they seem like little more than ciphers standing in for basic human emotions. It doesn&apos;t help that the film is grindingly tedious when it isn&apos;t being gratuitously creepy (in the creepy old uncle way, not in the horror movie way). What was the point of the &quot;dream&quot; sequence toward the end, anyways? 5/10 for the story, 9/10 for the cinematography, which won Nykvist an Oscar - it&apos;s not just the overwhelming use of red that makes the cinematography interesting. Since I think story is worth more than cinematography, at least to me, I give it a six, mainly because it is Bergman and I want to cut him some slack.",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s try to write this review in style. I do not argue whether &quot;Sons of Great Bear&quot; (1966) by DEFA is great Movie or not. It&apos;s first in row from Gojko Mitic&apos;s franchise in Indian Films based mostly on writings by Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich. You can check in Wikipedia who that woman is. Despite some inconsistencies, she was true German from a beaten generation after the fall of Third Reich in Germany. I wouldn&apos;t buy talks that she was Communist because such was reality in those Cold War times. If you don&apos;t put your signature under collaborative statement you wouldn&apos;t be allowed to travel abroad. Thus you remain peasant and ignorant, period. I myself lived through those times and never was Communist.\n\nSecond thing about the Movie. Since I doubt whether Americans or other English speaking people have watched Gojko Mitic&apos;s films and I will reiterate again. Very successful spaghetti western with typical German stamina. The hero is Winnetou type undefeatable macho, imaging the noble but dyeing Indian heathen. In the final scene in battle of honor Tokei-Ihto kills his enemy Red Fox (the white, Fred Clark) then liquidates about 20 adversaries with single pistol and escapes. This is typical Karl May scenario and Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich was his staunch student. The chief Tokei-Ihto or &quot;Stone Horn&quot; is imaginary taken from Indian painting by George Catlin. But other Sioux chiefs like Tashunka Witko (Crazy Horse) and Tatanka Yotanka (Sitting Bull) are real personages. They were massacred in Nebraska during Wounded Knee Incident (1890). Sioux tribe was put in Black Hill reservation and a branch D(L)akota lead by Tokei-Ihto fled to Canada (unreliable sources).\n\nNow let&apos;s go to the book trilogy by Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich. I wouldn&apos;t even imagine say that this was unworthy effort. She studied history and anthropology for 20 years plus before &quot;Die Sohne der Grossen Barin&quot; appeared in 1951. Courtesy to success of the book she wrote two prequels - &quot;Harka, der Sohn des Hauptlings&quot; (1962) and &quot;Top und Harry&quot; (1963) which treat earlier periods of life for Harka / Tokei-Ihto. But &quot;Sons of Great Bear&quot; is finale and could be read alone. In such order they appeared in Bulgarian, a bulk of 1500 pp. and favorite novels for youths. I am not aware whether this great trilogy, rival to Winnetou adventures, is published in English. Probably not, which is a loss.\n\nSee, folks, the Indians from Winnetou and Tokei-Ihto series bear German hearts and if you don&apos;t understand the undying German spirit you are in great trouble. I talk this to Nationalists all around the world now-a-day. Don&apos;t throw Globalization in the garbage bin. Otherwise, you risk standing in position like Jack Nicholson yelling - &quot;You can&apos;t handle the truth&quot; - in Few Good Men. See You ...",

      "reviewBody": "Suzuki Tomoko, along with ten plus classmates, has been sentenced to spend their summer vacation confined within their school and listen to her dull teacher Ozawa-sensei drone on and on about math equations that she, her classmates, and Ozawa-sensei himself could give a flip about. Therefore she envies the members of the school&apos;s brass band who gets to travel with the baseball team. However, on this particular hot summer day the band&apos;s bus leaves before the caterer arrives with the band&apos;s lunches. Because the caterer has another delivery, Tomoko, along with the other girls in the class decide to deliver the lunches. While on the train they eat one of the lunches and subsequently fall asleep missing their stop. After suffering such setbacks as jumping into rice paddies to avoid an oncoming train and having to wash their socks, the girls finally deliver the lunches to the brass band and their conductor. However, Nakamura Yuta, a boy Tomoko constantly bickers with, does not receive a lunch because his was consumed on the train ride. However, it seems an angel of mercy was looking over Nakamura when the other members of the brass band suffer a major bought of food poisoning.\n\nNakamura, being the only member of the brass band who is healthy, is given the task to put together another band for a major baseball game. However, only three girls show up to volunteer: two punk rock girls who play guitar and bass respectively and Sekiguchi Kaori, a sweet, nerdy girl who can play the recorder. However, knowing that Tomoko ate one of the lunches, he spotted a grain of cooked rice on her chin at the baseball game, Nakamura orders Tomoko and her summer school classmates to join the brass band. However, there number only totals sixteen, which is too small a number for a brass band. Yet, after a few events, Nakamura decides instead to start Big Swing Band.\n\nInstead of playing music at first, Nakamura makes the girls exercise to build up their strength and lung capacity for a long performance. The girls eventually begin to enjoy playing their instruments, but right before the big game the brass bands members regain their strength and perform instead of the girls. However, seeds of love for music have been planted in the hearts of the saxophonist Tomoko, the trumpeter Saito Yoshie, the trombonist Sekiguchi, and the drummer Tanaka Naomi and while the other girls quit in order to hang out with some boys, this little group, with Nakamura in tow, sets forth to start their own jazz band.\n\nBefore actually watching this film, my only knowledge concerning it was that it was directed by the director of Waterboys, but having yet to watch that film this left me with little information for what to expect. However, I received the experience of watching a very enjoyable film that was without violence, unless you count snowball fights and Naomi&apos;s butt cracking the head of a wild boar when the girls go matsutake hunting, without angst, without hormonal frustration, etc. The young actresses have a wonderful chemistry and seem like actual friends instead of actresses. Also, the personalities of Tomoko, Nakamura, Yoshie, Sekiguchi, and Naomi are very well fleshed out and each one of them has their own personal quirks: Yoshie&apos;s falls for every cute boy she sees, the mild Sekiguchi excels at whatever she does but is ignored by those around her, and the deadpan Naomi has a wonderful dry sense of humor. Combine all of this with a truly outstanding performance at the end of the film, the girls later on went to perform in New York and Los Angeles, make for a very nice film watching experience.",

The guy who runs around and screams all the time is hilarious. The dialog is cheesy. It has a decent story to it. Its just a fun movie. The visuals will keep you glued by themselves. This is a very low budget movie, but just remember , if you go to watch it, have no expectations. This movie will make you say &quot; What the F&quot; more than make you think. There is also a nice shot at Matrix movies too. Pretty cool movie and I in no way expected the movie to end the way it did. I wonder if there is more to come?",

      "reviewBody": "In this age of remakes and plundering classics to create mega mall blockbusters, here is one film that not only deserves major adventure status all on it&apos;s exciting and superb own, it is ripe for a &apos;re-imagining&apos; as perhaps an Indiana Jones film. NORTHWEST FRONTIER is a train chase movie, something movie audiences love. Always a thrilling and spectacular way to offer a microcosm of a society and analyze it through the behavior of the characters as they weave their way through trouble. Read other comments for the story. With a stellar cast, a panavision location of the Indian desert and mountains, visually thrilling &apos;rattly old train in peril&apos; stunts, some startling political dramas, ambush and shootouts, punch-ups on a speeding carriage and a truly terrifying upsetting &apos;walk&apos; through the aftermath of a massacre...etc this is the one adventure film of the past 50 years that is both British to its bootstraps and a big screen audience pleaser. It is a crime that the DVD release is NOT in panavision (what is wrong with these DVD companies?) ...almost as much a social crime that NORTHWEST FRONTIER is not a famous classic of International cinema. If it is on TV anytime of the day or night, watch it and be as thrilled as anyone like me who champions it. Sometimes listed as FLAME OF India, it was directed by J Lee Thompson who later made the visually thrilling chase adventure BITE THE BULLET in 1975 (also with great train scenes) ...if NORTHWEST FRONTIER was made in 2006 exactly the same as it appears already, it would gross $100 million and be a big fat hit. If you ever get to see the wonderful Republic film from 1953 called FAIR WIND TO JAVA it too is a unappreciated adventure spectacular, also a source of &apos;Indiana Jones&quot; antics and a seagoing companion piece to this great train chase.",

In early-20th Century Mexico an American school teacher (Jane Fonda) is kidnapped by a desperado (Jimmy Smits) and his rebellious gang. The titled character (Gregory Peck) is slowly dying of an illness and tries to get himself killed by Smits on numerous occasions as he also tries to get Fonda to safety. Strangely a bond develops between Smits and Peck just as Fonda becomes Smits&apos; lover and then surprisingly Fonda learns who Peck really is and falls in love with him as well (and also tries to fulfill his dying wish). &quot;Old Gringo&quot; is a lot of smoke and sand that tries to become the &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; of its time, but falls completely. The big-name performers cannot make it through a story that drags along and never gets to a suitable pay-off. The direction is disastrous too and we are left with a huh? movie that really means nothing at all. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "Quickie Review:\n\nLike the title of this review says, Rio 2 is basically an animated version of Meet the Parents (2000). Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) with a family of three kids, venture into the Amazon to find a flock of their own kind. Blu faces his father-in-law for the first time and must now prove his worth to him and the flock. Hollywood is filled with movies that repeat a general formula or idea. Even with a predictable story, Rio 2 does enough to keep your attention with beautiful animation and some memorable characters. Kids especially will have a lot of fun, but the adults are not left behind.\n\nFull Review:\n\nRio 2 starts with Blu and Jewel living in the Blue Macaw reserve with their three kids. Blu and the kids feel completely at home living side by side with the humans, while Jewel longs to live out in the wild with her family. They soon find out that they are not the last of their kind, and there might be a whole flock in the Amazon. This provides the perfect opportunity for the family to reconnect with their roots. Once they arrive and find the flock, Jewel is reunited with her long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia). Blu must now prove to Eduardo that he is worthy of his respect and blessing, while preventing Roberto (Bruno Mars) from reigniting an old flame with Jewel. In the meantime, Nigel (Jemaine Clement) along with his new obsessed companion frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth), seeks revenge following the events of the previous movie.\n\nThe plot in itself is nothing special or unique. Here&apos;s a quick challenge for you: just by reading the synopsis, think what the beginning, the middle, the climax, and the end of this movie is going to beÂ… Done? Well then, I don&apos;t know exactly who you are but I&apos;m 99% sure you got it right. So yes the movie is predictable, and does fall into the trap of the many father-in-law subplot clichÃ©s. Still the movie is charming enough to not put you to sleep. It is clear that the movie is mostly targeted for the kids but there is still some humor for us adults, or the parents, or the baby sitter to enjoy.\n\nMost of the cast have returned from the original, and they all play their parts well. However the stand outs for me has to be Nigel and newcomer Gabi. Every time they are on screen they put a smile on my face. Nigel is this over the top diva, who wants all the attention on himself because he truly believes he deserves it (well, I won&apos;t argue against it!). Gabi on the other hand is a poisonous frog that is deeply and helplessly in love with Nigel (think the popular &quot;overly obsessed girlfriend&quot; meme). She is also probably one of the cutest animated characters yet. These two play many of the scenes that the adults will enjoy as they dramatize popular songs and hilariously re-enact Shakespearean scenes from Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet.\n\nIn essence this movie serves the purpose of being entertaining. Rio 2 is a beautifully made animated movie with a satisfactory plot. There is nothing wrong with Rio 2, but there&apos;s not much great about it either. Kids will love this movie, and adults will not feel like they wasted their time.",

      "reviewBody": "Pierre Richard (&quot;Distracted&quot;, &quot;The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe&quot;, &quot;La Chevre &quot;) is a French comedy actor who was very successful in the 1970&apos;s and 1980&apos;s. Disregarded by most critics for being &quot;commercial&quot;, he has been rehabilitated lately, and it is only fair. For Pierre Richard, far from being just &quot;commercial&quot;, has managed to impose a character of his own creation, which is not so common, that of a naive daydreamer, kind-hearted but always blundering and overwhelmed by events, a man everyone identifies with but in whose place nobody would like to be in real life. Copying no one, copied by no one, Pierre Richard is an authentic comic genius, now luckily fully recognized. So when it was announced that our Gallic absent-minded one would fly to Canada, the idea sounded nothing less than attractive. But would the graft take ? Now, judging by the result I am afraid the answer is no, it has not! The pitch was promising, though: Pierre Martin, a Paris quantum physics professor, unexpectedly inherits an inn amid the snows of a small village in Quebec. Against all odds, he decides to go there and operate the establishment. What he does not know is that Michel, the mayor of Sainte-Simone-du-Nord, has an eye on the inn... Unfortunately, due to Robert MÃ©nard&apos;s uninspired, heavy-handed direction, the lack of subtlety of Guy Bonnier&apos;s script and the way some of the actors outrageously overplay their scenes, all combines to make unfunny a comedy which could (and should) have snatched laughter. Pierre Richard is his usual moonstruck clown self, in other words he is at once spontaneous, charming and droll, but what can he do when the others lay it on thick with a trowel and keep on pulling faces? For another reason, Sylvie Testud proves unable, despite all her talent, to defend her character (Pierre&apos;s daughter) properly. Ill-defined and one- dimensional, always playing on the same note (disapproval and annoyance), the role of Catherine Martin will never be a highlight in her filmography). When all is said and done, &quot;Le bonheur de Pierre&quot; both fails as a comedy and as an offbeat vehicle for Pierre Richard. A missed opportunity indeed. But if you are still willing to see our Pierrot transplanted into a foreign environment, you can fall back on Nana Dzohordzhadze &quot;A Chef in Love&quot;. It is much better.",

Though out of his league as the usual grade B actor, Woods succeeds here in the part of the first husband, who walks out on Russell after 10 years of marriage, 4 children and a life of hard times.\n\nThe film is definitely a slice of Americana and the idea of hard work and accomplishment. It also very well deals with adversity just as things are going so well. Isn&apos;t that so true of life itself? That&apos;s why the film succeeds and is quite memorable.",

The mood of the film is rather depressing. Life for Ramona is rather hard and the environment in which she lives is far from cheering.  Ramona herself is becoming a rather dull and uninteresting person. The clattering of noisy trains with windows flashing past punctuate the various scenes.  I wondered at first what these scenes had to do with the story, but later all is revealed. Ramona&apos;s dream of finding a husband and having a baby seems to be fulfilled when she suddenly becomes pregnant.  Her former dismal life now starts to glow with happiness as Andrzej weaves his magic spell.  But all is not well as a series of disappointments overtake them.  The central figure in this film is Ramona (Sophie Rous), a very unhappy girl indeed with little future until her sister suggests she do something really outrageous.  Following her sister&apos;s advice she gets into deeper trouble.  The lead role is admirably played with numerous scenes being quite heart-rending e.g the loss of her baby, the death of her little caged bird and final mental breakdown. You&apos;ll probably need a glass of vodka after viewing this one.",

This certainly qualifies for that.\n\nWhat makes this film different from others is the combination of fictional and real people playing the two main characters: Harvey and Joyce Pekar. For most of the film, Paul Giamatti portrays Pekar - the main focus of the film, and Hope Davis plays his wife, Joyce. However, interspersed in the film are comments from the real Harvey and Joyce. Strange!!! \n\nThe only thing stranger that the film structure is the story of these actual people. You wouldn&apos;t think that two dull introverts like this could be made to look so interesting, but they are. What a testimony to the job the filmmakers did here....and the actors. Giamatti was amazing.\n\nAfter seeing this movie, I was inspired to go out and obtain several of Harvey Pekar&apos;s comic books. Whew! I should have stuck with just the movie. The comics stink!!

The graboids are back, and this time in Mexico! The plot is fairly similar to the first except for some .. minor changes. Fred Ward (RIP) returns along with Michael Gross who both give stellar performances and really help make this film what it is. Giving us more than a few great scenes/quotes. Chris Gartin and Helen Shaver also giving fun supporting performances. The chemistry between all 4 really blossoms by the time the credits roll. Another tremors movie where the cast is very likable and worth our time. Fun opening scene, reasonable pace, and an amazing sequence when they&apos;re out hunting in the fields at night. The late 90&apos;s cgi monsters are kind of dated by today&apos;s standards but it&apos;s passable. I can still respect the vision but sometimes it looks like Walking With Dinosaurs or something. Another syfy channel classic, Tremors II is a solid 6 and a pretty fun watch.",

      "reviewBody": "This DVD was a bit of surprise from Alpha Video. They release many old, public domain films, but I had never heard of this one. For 6 dollars you get this and the 1922 Headless Horseman film. All I can say is &quot;No Brainer&quot; for fans of silent horror/SF.\n\nIt was to supposedly originally run a little over an hour, but only 26 minutes of this previously lost Italian film are here. A narrative overview is given at the beginning to let viewers understand the overall plot to make up for the missing. It&apos;s a big help as a lot of the gaps are scattered throughout, and this pulp story wouldn&apos;t make much sense otherwise. The Mechanical Man is a lot of fun, though and the film feels pretty complete, which is a minor miracle.\n\nThe plot involves an evil woman who steals a robot from a scientist. She programs it to destroy to serve her wishes. A young man tries to save his girlfriend with help from the scientist who invented the mechanical man. In the end he sends out a second mechanical man to dispose of the original. It has a Feuillade-like pace to it. \n\nOne interesting thing about Alpha is they seem to afford opportunities to up and coming composers. The score is very satisfying and brings some modern ideas to the antique film. Their work on last year&apos;s &quot;Student of Prague&quot; (1913) is equally good. In my opinion, Alpha does not have to do this at the low prices they ask for their films. No, their films are not re-mastered or restored, but they show that they care about fans by going the extra mile. The new English inter-titles are designed in an appropriate style. A fun surprise for silent film fans.",

It is a shame the people who promoted this so much seem to have missed an opportunity (hopefully the DVD is more successful).Of course release dates and all come into play ;and Caviezel&apos;s current fame cuts both ways . But it seems even golfers have ignored this film judging by the poor Box Office.Definitely in the same league as Seabiscuit ; with outstanding performances by all three playing Bobby Jones as well as a wonderful supporting cast . It is a very moving story when told with all the warts and problems to see.",

      "reviewBody": "French writer/director Louis Feuillade found his niche creating movie serials when he successfully brought to the screen two very popular movie series, 1913 &quot;Fantomas&quot; and 1915 &quot;Les Vampires.&quot; Some do-gooder critics, though, howled at his two productions, complaining his so-called heroes were in fact criminals committing evil acts.\n\nFeuillade took their harsh critiques personally, and set out towards a different path in his next serial. The release of the 12-part series &quot;Judex,&quot; beginning in December 1916, set the tone for a new hero in movies, one partly based on the main character in Alexandre Dumas&apos; 1844 novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot;\n\nJudex (latin for &quot;Judge&quot;) is a son of a wealthy family whose father was financially ruined by a ruthless, corrupt banker, who sucked the wealth out of many other unsuspecting people. Judex exacts revenge by faking the banker&apos;s death and kidnapping him into his elaborate cave lair. The banker&apos;s beautiful daughter, previously oblivious to her father&apos;s shenanigans, renounces his fortune when she finds out the unethical practices he committed. Judex has romantic eyes for the daughter, but the banker&apos;s governess/mistress, played by actress Musidora (Irma Vep in &quot;Les Vampires&quot;), had her own devious plans of getting his fortune, only to be foiled by the events engineered by Judex. She suspects the banker is alive and gets her criminal gang in motion to find out where he is.\n\nThrough the mostly 30-minute episodes where intrigue, romance, and the righteous over evil battle take place, &quot;Judex&quot; was a big hit in war-torn European theaters during World War One. After the war, Feuillade directed a sequel serial, &quot;Judex&apos;s New Mission&quot; in 1918.\n\nThe 1930 radio show character &quot;The Shadow&quot; and the 1939 introduction of &quot;Batman&quot; in the comics have direct linkages to Judex, making the French serial the first movie to have a superhero as its main character. In fact, the French comic book &quot;Hurrah!&quot; published a series beginning in 1940 on Judex, which simply was a French translation of the American comic strip, The Shadow.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an American/Spanish movie adaptation of the classic Victorian ghost story &quot;The Turn of the Screw.&quot; I would urge anyone to seek out the wonderful &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961) version instead of this poor effort. Sadie Frost plays a young governess hired by a rather creepy uncle (Harvey Keitel), referred to as The Master, to care for his orphaned nephew Miles and niece Flora, two young children that live in a large old Spanish villa. The house is haunted by two former employees. The film started off quite disturbingly by featuring the real life bizarre Victorian practice of posing a dressed corpse next to family members in order to be photographed. I watched this on Talking Pictures TV (UK), they rated it 18 but apart from one brief scene of nudity and the suggestion of incest between Miles and his sister I found the film to be rather limp. The scenes showing the two ghosts - one male, one female - were poorly staged and not in the least bit scary. I didn&apos;t think much of Sadie Frost&apos;s performance, I was pleasantly surprised when she briefly stripped off naked in front of a long mirror though. As far Harvey Keitel, he is only in the film for a few minutes at the start. Look out for the crew member wearing denim jeans next to a horse, he&apos;s even looking at the camera! One of the few positives for me was the filming location at the Raixa Estate on the Spanish island of Mallorca, an impressive old house with nice palm fringed gardens. Despite a fairly promising the start the film soon goes downhill and ends disappointingly. There have been several film and TV adaptations of this story, this being the worst that I have seen to date. Watch The Innocents (1961) instead!",

      "reviewBody": "Initially I found the &apos;play&apos; set-up gimmicky and disconcerting, however I soon forgot all about the framing and became fixated on the picture itself. There are no special effects nor camera tricks and make-up is kept to a bare minimum, which allows us to focus purely on the story and the quality of the acting; both of which are exemplary. Nicole Kidman is amazing as usual bringing a wonderful vulnerability and frailty to her character which conceals an underlying ruthlessness and brutality. Ample support comes from co-stars Betthany and Chloe Sevigny and in truth the whole cast is frighteningly convincing.\n\nThe story is simple, a young woman who it appears is on the run from the mob seeks refuge in a small town known as Dogville. The residents who are initially wary of her soon warm to her and welcome her into their midst. This however, comes with a price she must do small favours in return for refuge. Inevitably greed, desire and mistrust take over the residents which corrupts them and has devastating consequences for all involved. \n\nThe dramatic shift in the mentality of the townspeople is so well handled and expertly crafted by Von Trier, that it makes the emotional payoff which one receives at the end of this film even greater. It is utterly compelling and has universal themes. Ultimately, this is a film which may serve as a cautionary tale for all self-proclaimed &apos;civilised&apos; societies and as a treatise upon karmic retribution."

The advantage of low budget indy films is that the viewer has to make some deductive leaps himself.\n\nI, for one, spent some time in the movie working out exactly what was going on. Was she dead? What was the relationship to the killer? Why was the mother so creepy? But the ending, when it came, was still a surprise.",

This is exactly what makes this film great. It would have been only possible to make such a &quot;gem&quot; of a film during the existence of USSR. Especially, since this is an adaptation of Soviet Union&apos;s &quot;domestic&quot; science fiction writers, the Strugatsky brothers. I am just discovering the great works of Russian and Soviet science fiction (incidentally at the same time as the &quot;American&quot; Isaac Asimov). Years after I have enjoyed &quot;Star Trek: The next Generation&quot; TV-series. Although &quot;Star Trek:TNG&quot; raises similar questions through &quot;The Prime Directive&quot;, &quot;Trudno Byt&apos; Bogom&quot; is a full-length film and allows a deeper analysis of the question. But the book is certainly deeper.",

      "reviewBody": "OK so this movie isn&apos;t the greatest, but it&apos;s still far from uninteresting. The only real connection it has to Luigi Cozzi&apos;s superior STAR CRASH is the use of certain special effects shots. They appear to use some of the same models &amp; spacecraft, which would of course be cheaper than building new ones for this film, or better yet just recycle the same footage. Nobody will notice.\n\nMost movies are about two or three things. First there is the story or plot -- this time out two mis-matched intergalactic lovers land on a planet populated by castoffs from &quot;Buck Rogers In The 25th Century&quot; and discover sex. This includes an eye-opening scene where the film&apos;s heroine/lead actress goes for a naked swim in some sort of erotic oasis. I say &quot;eye opening&quot; not just because she is a delightful little morsel, but because the content of the scene is so at odds with the form that the movie takes: It looks to have been made for kids, but has tits. Huh.\n\nAnd that is the second thing that this movie is about: Mixing low octane erotics with Star Wars inspired (or maybe FLASH GORDON would be more likely considering Don Powell&apos;s Parliament/Funkadelic Space Tyrant costume: wow!!) juvenalia. It&apos;s an exploitation film taking on the appearance of a science fiction adventure to lure in the kids, plus some bared flesh -- kept to a minimum, just a tad beyond the tease level -- to keep their parents occupied. The film is also equal opportunity in parading about a little space strumpet for the guys to ogle as well as an astronomical Adonis for the ladies to swoon over. Or vice versa: you never can tell about some people these days.\n\nThe third thing this movie appears to be about is how the European cult genre film craze -- dating back to the Gladiator movies that much of the film resembles -- had pretty much worn itself out by 1981. The Italians always were the most imitative of the Euro filmmakers and by the time STAR CRASH 2 was made they were imitating their own forms. Like FLASH GORDON and YOR, HUNTER FROM THE FUTURE this is essentially an updated Peplum saga with laser guns instead of javelins, and illustrates how by 1981 Italian B cinema was finally forced to find it&apos;s own voice after stuff like this stopped working at the box office.\n\nThe Italians went from Peplums to Gothic horror to spy thrillers to Spaghetti Westerns to war movies to Gothic horror to crime thrillers to car racing movies to Star Wars ripoffs and then back to the horror genre again for the 3rd wave of Fulci, Argento, Lamberto Bava and Joe D&apos;amato. STAR CRASH 2 was directed by the occasionally brilliant Bitto Albertini, who participated in all of those prior genres and was on the tail-end of his career, and while this certainly isn&apos;t his best film his name is the big draw here: Bert Albertino movies are rather hard to come by, but unlike his ZAMBO or THREE SUPERMEN films there isn&apos;t much to recommend this one, aside from the kitschy 80&apos;s sci fi production design and the sex.\n\nI happen to like kitschy 80&apos;s sci fi production design and sex so I got a kick out of this one. You certainly won&apos;t find the likes of it made today, and for fans of the Alfonso Brescia Star Wars ripoff school of film-making this movie will be a welcomed addition. Anyone else be forewarned though: There be Italians in disco robes dancing in this movie, and unless you are used to stuff like that you will probably find it to be somewhat silly, and maybe even a little on the erotic side. Welcome to Italian cult genre film-making, we hope you enjoy your flight.\n\n5/10",

But then again, as I remember, she said she hated directing herself. Alex was great, Gary was wonderful, Stacie and Kiami took over the screen, and everybody else really took control of the movie. Although this is December, for the rest of this month, if you live on the West Coast, you can see it on Starz Movie Channel. Then you can check her website to read more about this movie. I don&apos;t know about anybody else, but I give this movie about 9 1/2 to 10 stars."

But, despite this, believe it or not, he will remain one of the best French actor ever, with of course Jean Gabin. Delon will always be for me LE SAMOURAI, LE CERCLE ROUGE, PLEIN SOLEIL. But, after the late seventies, he was not the same anymore, and this junk, which I talk about now, is the best example. Predictable, boring. Forget it."

In any case, he lives with his mother, who is slowly spiraling into despair and misery after her husband suddenly disappeared without a trace. \n\nDesperate to find meaning and purpose after her world has been blown apart, the mother joins an evangelical group not entirely unlike the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses, and begins going from door to door, distributing pamphlets and dragging Tamotsu along with her. Tamotsu is bright and, except for a few early scenes in which he engages in bullying (&quot;ijime&quot;, a chronic problem in Japan), remarkably gentle and good-natured. But his mother&apos;s missionary zeal begins to take a toll on him and on their relationship.\n\nAnother member of the religious group has a daughter, Kanon, several years older than Tamotsu, obviously not biologically Japanese (but with impeccable Japanese language skills) and also not as innocent, but who begins to pull Tamotsu in a wholly different direction.\n\nWe thought this film excellent in nearly all respects. It is quite believable, the performances are uniformly compelling, the dilemmas presented are natural and uncontrived. Some reviews I read criticized it as too &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;grim&quot; in nature. That is fair, I guess; much of the story is essentially the reactions of people to a woman who is slowly but inexorably veering toward insanity. But it is not relentlessly dark; there are lighter moments, right up till the end.\n\nHighly recommended."

All in all, this analysis is actually very entertaining and informative. \n\nThe only parts of this documentary that I found lacking was a piece on the fans and the popularity of the sport world wide. PBA fans run the gauntlet among society and it would have been interesting to see a cross section of these fans. It would also have been interesting to show some of the international PBA regulars that compete on tour (they did show a brief piece on England&apos;s Stuart Williams but should have included Ameletto Monacelli or Mika Kouvunemi).\n\nAgain, this does not detract from this documentary. In fact, since there is such a lack of quality material available on this topic it is easy to see what was left out :)This is a good film and I recommend it without hesitation.",

      "reviewBody": "As I think of the many dimensions documentaries have taken recently, from the ersatz &apos;Fahrenheit&apos; to the authentic &apos;Metallica,&apos; I am pleased to report the biopic remains whole, with Irwin Winkler&apos;s (&apos;Life as a House&apos;) &apos;De-Lovely,&apos; the life in song about Cole Porter and his wife, Linda.\n\nI say &apos;in song&apos; because barely a moment in not accompanied by Porter&apos;s music so recognizable I can cite &apos;Night and Day,&apos; &apos;In the Still of the Night,&apos; &apos;Anything Goes,&apos; &apos;Let&apos;s Misbehave,&apos; and &apos;True Love&apos; without research help or the least provocation. Kevin Kline plays Porter with 1920&apos;s tuxedoed charm embracing the true love of his life, Linda, and the many men who helped him fulfill his need to love everything. Kline&apos;s refusal to lip-synch or take singing lessons effectively evokes the voice-challenged Porter and the passionate melancholy of a composer who lived for love.\n\nThe difference between this version and the 1946 Cary Grant &apos;Night and Day&apos; is in the hidden homosexuality of the latter and the overt acceptance in the former. Winkler recreates the moment when Linda acknowledges, accepts, and romanticizes Porter&apos;s alternative life. About men she affirms, &apos;You like them more than I do. Nothing is cruel if it fulfills your promise.&apos; This is fine writing by Jay Cocks (&apos;Age of Innocence&apos;) and is her love expressed on a plane only Plato could fully appreciate. \n\nThus Linda defines a story about love as music, a story attempted in &apos;Evita&apos; and &apos;Frida&apos; but never so well expressed as in &apos;De-Lovely.&apos; Although &apos;Frida&apos; parallels Frida Kahlo&apos;s artful life in her paintings, &apos;De-Lovely&apos; so arranges Porter&apos;s music as to suggest each piece was written for that moment in his life. Judd&apos;s portrayal relies on her porcelain beauty, wry smile, and serene wisdom in the service of an unconditional love that cost Linda in embarrassment, extorted money, and time away from Porter.\n\nSongs interpreted by Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, and Diana Krall, among others, bring the film into the present with the &apos;timeless&apos; effect without compromising flawless period depiction of the Jazz Age and Tin Pan Alley. In the end this biopic helped me understand the rewarding and demanding life of Cole Porter, gave me over two hours of glorious song and dance, and made me see again the allure of true love that transcends sex and ego. &apos;De-Lovely&apos; is &apos;music from a farther room,&apos; as Eliot&apos;s Prufrock would have heard it."

Simply put, it examines the effect on two girls, best friends in high school, when one has a crush from afar on a boy, and the other actually starts talking to him. The writing is delicate, the performances completely natural and real. Even the look of the movie -- echoing Wong Kar-Wai&apos;s elegantly composed, florescent-lit romances -- is stylish without being over-stylized. The narrative is never forced, and yet the ground covered encompasses the awkwardness of a first kiss, the vagaries of sexual orientation, the safety of fantasy over reality, and the nature of friendship -- both the kinds that just happen and those that come about because they&apos;ve been earned. Finally, the last minute of this movie made a mess of me, I haven&apos;t gushed so hard since &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;",

The dialog is cheesy, acting hits bottom and the plot is ridiculous and predictable.\n\nNia has this silly smiling expression in each and every scene which is very annoying.I hope she sticks to acting that she knows best. Its a fact that not all actors can be directors. Many of them need coaching to achieve a decent performance and Vardalos is definitely one of them. Probably the worst film of the year ...\n\nAvoid Avoid Avoid!!!",

His first few lines are delivered in a deep clear &quot;radio announcer&quot; pure English baritone, the rest of the film is in a poorly faked accent. What exactly would be the reason for this?

Keoma&apos;s return is welcomed by his aged father but resented by his three half-brothers, not least because, against their father&apos;s wishes, they are now in the employment of the corrupt Caldwell. Intent on restoring justice to the town, Keoma finds himself up against Caldwell&apos;s horde of gangsters and his own flesh and blood in a deadly and ultimately tragic conflict.\r\n\r\nDirected with breathtaking visual style and flair by Enzo G. Castellari, KEOMA is a unique, innovative and uncommonly original entry in the Spaghetti Western genre. Featuring powerful performances from a superb cast that also includes Woody Strode (The Quick And The Dead; Once Upon A Time In The West; Spartacus), William Berger (Love Letters Of A Portuguese Nun) and Donald O&apos;Brien (The Name Of The Rose), KEOMA ranks alongside &quot;Django&quot; as one of Franco Nero&apos;s finest films.\r\n\r\nKEOMA is released on DVD by Argent Films. Special Features include exclusive introduction by acclaimed filmmaker Alex Cox, brand new extensive interview with director Enzo G. Castellari, theatrical trailers, plus &quot;Western Trail&quot; Ã‚â€“ trailers for Argent&apos;s forthcoming spaghetti western releases.",

Bronson plays an Arizona lieutenant who is after a drug lord (Rod Steiger), responsible for the death of a fellow cop. The FBI butts in, telling him that if he wants to help out he can persuade Steiger&apos;s mistress, (Jill Ireland, doing a good Dolly Parton) to give testimony to the DAs. Bronson travels to Switzerland to retrieve her. Lots of boring shots of him taking trains, planes and automobiles to do this. Steiger does a great job playing a stuttering mafiosa don and the film boasts many excellent character actors (Henry Silva, Paul Koslo, Val Avery, Strother Martin, Bradford Dillman, etc.) A few good action scenes, but in the end, we needed more bullets and less love...",

Philippe Lioret has done an amazing job of capturing the lives of the Bretons and their reluctance to accept outsiders into their proud history. \n\nAn interesting piece of information is that the film was shot entirely on location and no models where used for any of the lighthouse scenes. This knowledge enhances the dramatic visuals as it is unbelievable that they were there filming in some of the situations shown. \n\nGrÃ©gori DerangÃ¨re (Antoine) does a stellar performance of the outsider and his struggle to find himself and acceptance, ultimately challenging the friendship of the one who has.\n\nI thoroughly recommend it and truly hope that more people will see it even though it is not an English film.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Europa Europa&quot; (original title &quot;Hitler Youth Soloman&quot;) is the story of a Jewish boy who is separated from his family and ends up assuming different identities (including, yes, a Nazi) to stay alive. What makes this film different from all the Holocaust movies I&apos;ve seen is that it shows the perspective of the other side. This is NOT done in a sympathetic way but in a way that simply shows what was going on amongst the brainwashed youth and how ordinary humans were coerced into doing the most inhuman things.\n\nOur protagonist Soloman (Marco Hofschneider) is played with a wide-eyed innocence, almost like an objective observer, as he navigates the Nazi heirarchy inadvertently making friends wherever he goes. Thus the interesting spin is that the Nazis are shown with more personality than the stone-faced butchers we&apos;ve come to expect from Holocaust flicks. In fact there is very little Jewish persecution and violence shown since most of the story is set behind the ranks where Soloman is fed the same propaganda and brotherhood that the Hitler youth were fed.\n\nThe brutality is clear, and as Soloman rises through the ranks he starts to peel away the truth that, no, Jews are not simply being &quot;relocated to Madagascar&quot;. In addition he falls for a girl (Julie Delpy) who is a rabid anti-Semite. So the film ends up posing a very interesting point that&apos;s applicable to all our lives, regardless of the WW2 context: What do we do if it turns out that our friends &amp; adoptive family turn out to be vile monsters?\n\nI highly recommend this movie even if you&apos;re not interested in war flicks. It&apos;s more like a coming of age story but set in the most horrifying chapter of human history.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me get this out of the way: I&apos;m a big Woody Allen fan. And this flick is absolutely and utterly his. From the black and white to the ambience and, of course, the dialog, it all screams Woody Allen as loud as it can. As most of his movies, Woody is not simply playing a character, nor simply being himself. It is a mix, a blend between a real man and a made up persona. And, as always, the line is weirdly blurry, making it so, at times, you&apos;re watching a documentary. The plot itself is not the central point of the story and, at times, it is hard to understand exactly what it is leading to. No, the focus of the story is the characters. Characters like Isaac, Yale and the city. Specially the city. It is an homage to a now distant past of history, viewed from the lens of a troubled mix of a real and fictional man. It is hard to defend most of Isaac&apos;s actions. And it is way harder to get mad at them. It is a movie about imperfection, ego, society, intellectuals and love. And it is great. A great movie to be rewatched as many times as you can.",

You can&apos;t take your eyes off any of the characters, which are richly developed and complex - for the first two-thirds of the movie.\n\nThen the characters become two dimensional, and I ceased to care as much what happens to them - not because of the acting, but because of the plot. Characters with which we identify act in ways that are incongruous and we lose connection with them.\n\nAt that point, the plot remains interesting, but it&apos;s almost as if we were dwelling inside the story and now we&apos;ve been pushed out. We still want to know what happens next, but now we&apos;re distracted by the distance between us and the characters. But maybe that&apos;s the whole point - that people act in ways we don&apos;t expect given the situations they face.\n\nIt&apos;s a good movie and I&apos;d recommend a viewing. As I said the acting is excellent and the plot is very solid - what you think is one thing may actually be another - but there aren&apos;t any holes. Just the opposite.\n\nIt&apos;s just that the first part (the love triangle) is so engaging that some of the plot twists that follow are annoying.\n\nI would still recommend this film. Don&apos;t listen to critics anyway - obviously people really loved this film 100% - you might also.",

Other indoor scenes at various mansions, etc are equally brilliant. As for the music, what more can be said other than that Lanza&apos;s voice was at its&apos; peak as he sang so many of the worlds&apos; best known and beloved arias. The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso. There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events. For example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth. There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These web sites can be located by using any good search engine. There are also several books available concerning his life history. But, the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten, and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy, I know that I sure did.",

      "name": "An engaging and symbolic love story/drama based on the book by the Nobel Prize winner Gunter Grass",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Wrozby Kumaka&quot; (The Call of the Toad) is an adaptation of the book &quot;Unkenrufe&quot; by the German Nobel Prize winner Gunter Grass. Although the film received lukewarm reviews and has a relatively low rating, I personally enjoyed it and believe it is worth viewing. The story is about the late love of the German writer Alexander Reschke (Matthias Habich) and the Polish conservator of monuments Aleksandra Piatkowska (Krystyna Janda). They have both been widowed and find out that they have a lot in common. The film is set in Gdansk, just after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. I have always respected Gunter Grass and read several books by him. It looks to me that Alexander Reschke is an &quot;alter ego&quot; of the writer himself, which makes the story even more interesting. &quot;The Call of the Toad&quot; has also another dimension, which is reconciliation between Poles and Germans. I liked the warm atmosphere of the film and the excellent performances of Krystyna Janda and Matthias Habich. The movie is also not devoid of some subtle humor. And finally, about the symbolic second dimension of the film. Gunter Grass was always a great advocate of reconciliation between the Poles and the Germans, and I can name a couple of similar, famous people on the Polish side, like Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, Andrzej Szczypiorski, Krzysztof Penderecki, or Krzysztof Zanussi. &quot;The Call of the Toad&quot; has often been criticized for its weak ending. This is true if you take the literal love story side, but I think that the ending has a deep meaning in its symbolic side. To me the great German writer is saying this: I am showing you only the snapshot of Poland just after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. The reconciliation is already accomplished, and my story is over. Now it is the task for the younger generation to build the friendship between our nations. And I feel that I also played a tiny part in the sequel to &quot;The Call of the Toad&quot;, because from 2002 to 2007 I was a single Polish co-worker in a German IT company. So we solved some tasks together, sometimes went out to eat or celebrate, and discussed books and movies, without our nationalities being the slightest issue. And there are probably thousands of stories like mine. The biggest setback to good Polish/German relations were the years 2015-2023, when Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his PIS party were in power. But it was also a setback to the progress of Poland in building a Western democracy and an open, civic society. For all its patriotic and nationalist,bombastic, meaningless slogans, its campaign of hatred against the Germans, EU parliament and other EU institutions, immigrants, Moslems, and gays, PIS was consistent in one aspect of its actions: Victor Orban in Hungary was copying the solutions of Vladimir Putin in Russia, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski was copying the Hungarian solutions in Poland. It was a clear path back to the East and the communist past, which was fortunately stopped. Adam Michnik, an icon of the Polish democratic movement and presently editor in chief of the influential newspaper &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; once said this about Jaroslaw Kaczynski: he can spit into the river, but he cannot turn back its flow. So if we lost several years and are now back in 2015 or even earlier, the friendship between Poland and Germany will flow again, because we are neighbors who are bound together by geography, our political systems, economy, and culture.",

Our heroine, Veronica, is a demon born in Hell and raised by God fearing parents to punish sinners until they repent. As she comes of age she wonders why people are only punished after they die, she wants to know why the wicked are not punished before they can do more evil, thus lessening the sins upon their souls and reducing the pain and suffering of others. Veronica slips out of Hell and ascends to the mortal realm only to find it is literally brimming with sinners of the worst kind. Upon learning that sins are not only ignored but often encouraged in the mortal realm she sets out to set people back on the straight and narrow, with appropriately gory results.",

      "reviewBody": "When I watch Blood Alley it does make me wonder that if all these people are so dead set on leaving Communist China than who was it that supported Chairman Mao. My answer is a lot of people who wished they hadn&apos;t.\n\nWhen Blood Alley came out in 1955 the Chinese Communist takeover was in 1949 and we in this country, rightly or wrongly, were not recognizing them. Maybe the policy was bad, didn&apos;t mean the Chinese Communists were any good. \n\nAnyway the film is about a sea captain who gets freed from jail in the People&apos;s Republic by a village who have hit upon a plan to take themselves to Hong Kong and freedom bag and baggage. The idea is to steal an old river steamboat and have Captain John Wayne pilot the craft down the Formosa straits, or Blood Alley as its called. Lauren Bacall who is the daughter of a medical missionary is along for the ride.\n\nToo bad that the Duke and Betty could not get a better film though they sure did do a winner later on in The Shootist. Nevertheless in her memoirs she spoke with great affection for Wayne and how much she enjoyed working with him.\n\nOne other interesting thing has always struck me. John Wayne did three films with William Wellman and this was the least of them. The other two, The High and the Mighty and Island in the Sky are classics containing two of the Duke&apos;s best performances. But for whatever reason the Wayne family estate withheld them until last year it rendered discussion about Wayne&apos;s acting abilities totally off base. This one which is just a routine action adventure film despite the right wing political message.\n\nIn addition Wayne is miscast, but in fairness he was pinch hitting for the originally cast Robert Mitchum. Back in those days Wayne and his Batjac production company did produce films with other people in them. One they did produce was Track of the Cat that starred Mitchum and was directed by Bill Wellman. Wellman also directed Mitchum in his breakthrough role in The Story of GI Joe. But Wellman and Mitchum came to a parting of the ways just before the film was to start shooting and Mitchum got canned. \n\nThat left producer Wayne in a bind and after reportedly offering the role to Humphrey Bogart and Gregory Peck, he did it himself with no changes in the script to accommodate his less cynical screen persona.\n\nIn fact according to Lee Server&apos;s biography of Mitchum, Wayne was to go on his honeymoon with wife number 3, Pilar. It was postponed and Pilar Wayne would not allow the Mitchums in the Wayne home for the time she was married to the Duke, though Mitchum and Wayne were friends. They could be friends, but Mitchum was forbidden to enter her home.\n\nSuch occidentals as Paul Fix and Mike Mazurki were cast as Chinese in this film as was Berry Kroeger. It could never happen that way again, though Mazurki in fact did have some Oriental blood in his background.\n\nAs for Communist China or Red China if you prefer, you never hear it referred to in that way any more. That&apos;s because the second Mao Tse tung couldn&apos;t fog a mirror the Chinese set about becoming good capitalist oligarchs. They pay lip service to the 1949 revolution, but that&apos;s about all.\n\nGood for them.",

On a stormy night he gets stuck in a library, and ends up animated with several book friends. He meets Fantasy (Whoopie Goldberg), Adventure (Patrick Stewart) and Horror (Frank Welker), and he goes through many famous books. The plot is very slim, and kind of just jumps around from book to book, but it actually works very well. This also has a great musical score and it manages to make the movie sad at times. Unlike many animated films, you actually come to like the characters by the end, and that&apos;s hard to do.\n\n&quot;The Pagemaster&quot; is a very underrated, good animated movie that will appeal to kids and will amuse adults.\n\nMy rating: *** out of ****. 70 mins. Rated G",

      "reviewBody": "Series note: Although this film is something of a train wreck, it would be even worse if one didn&apos;t watch the original Starship Troopers (1997) first. The first film is excellent, and will help you figure out what is supposed to be going on in this film.\n\nA group of Starship Troopers becomes stranded while engaged in warfare on a &quot;bug planet&quot;. They make it to a mostly abandoned makeshift fort and succeed in holding the enemy at bay outside, only to discover that they may have enemies just as lethal amongst themselves.\n\nPhil Tippet may be a genius with visual effects in other films, but in his first turn as a director, he&apos;s made a mess of Starship Troopers 2. Admittedly, it&apos;s not a complete loss. I actually ended up giving the film a 5 out of 10, even though that is a rating I usually reserve only for &quot;so bad they&apos;re good&quot; films. No, Starship Troopers isn&apos;t really good, but at times it threatened to get a 3 out of 10, while the closer it got to the finish line, the more it started seeming like a 7 out of 10 to me. I decided to average it. Keep in mind that in my rating system, a 6 is equivalent to the grade of D.\n\nOddly, I thought that the script was almost worth a C (or a 7) throughout the film. The biggest problem script-wise, aside from the fact that the tone of this film is completely different than the first (a fact that will turn off many viewers, but for which I wouldn&apos;t subtract any points in itself), was that the dialogue is overburdened with pseudo-militaristic gobbledy-gook and there are far too many characters to keep track of and care about. Towards the end, when the film turned more into a horror film than its previous contentment with being a war flick (this one is never really sci-fi), I thought the ideas were actually very good. I&apos;m a huge horror fan, and the horror material worked for me. There was a nice amount of gore and decent suspense.\n\nBut those are the positives. Let&apos;s get to what the film does wrong. The biggest problems are the cinematography, lighting, and production design. For some reason, the opening scene of the film, which we could say goes on for maybe 40 minutes (far too long), is almost exclusively close-ups. We routinely have a screenful of someone&apos;s nose, mouth, or some other body part. Close-ups aren&apos;t bad in general, but when that&apos;s all a viewer sees for 40 minutes, and in the midst of what&apos;s supposed to be a grand-scale war with hundreds or thousands of combatants, it&apos;s awful. Everything is also too dark, and when it isn&apos;t dark, it&apos;s usually too bright, in that Tippet has a light or two pointing directly at the camera. And during fight scenes, we only get to see troopers face-on. We hardly ever see what they&apos;re shooting at.\n\nNow, being generous, we might say that the point of all the above is to convey the claustrophobia and chaos of war. But that&apos;s being far too generous. The original Starship Troopers conveyed the chaos of war very nicely. In Starship Troopers 2, Tippet is really trying to cover up the fact that they had no budget to build sets, acquire props, hire many cast members, pay for cgi-rendered environments or even matte paintings. There are some cgi-rendered bug aliens (and maybe a couple small things done with mechanicals) and there is one set, but that&apos;s about it. Most of the film is poorly lit and backlit so that we can&apos;t see that the actors are on a mostly empty soundstage. The close-ups are an attempt to distract our attention from the small, low-budget scale of things. All of these aspects fail miserably. At least until halfway through the film, when we begin to see some cinematography and lighting on the single set that we could call &quot;almost competent&quot;.\n\nEven though I wouldn&apos;t subtract points for the difference in tone, it is quite a shock if you start watching Starship Troopers 2 expecting anything even remotely resembling the first film. The first film is a clever satire on society and militaristic thinking via its depiction of a future, war-hungry culture. We see clever commentaries on behavioral norms in our culture via different norms depicted in the film. We see funny things that are very similar to our present culture, but that are underscored by their temporal alienation. The first film is an ingenious, fast paced, epic scaled sci-fi/war/horror extravaganza.\n\nThis film on the other hand is just about as pedestrian as you can get. Even though the horror material is good once it finally arrives, it isn&apos;t exactly groundbreaking. There is no satire here, no cleverness, it&apos;s not fast paced, and it&apos;s the complete opposite of epic scaled. Even the tongue-in-cheek military/war advertisements shown on a computer-like screen from the first film fall flat here because they&apos;re presented more like television commercials with no window dressing or explanation for context.\n\nStarship Troopers 2 isn&apos;t a complete failure, but I can&apos;t recommend it beyond its curiosity value, or for die-hard horror fans who are slightly masochistic and don&apos;t mind sitting through the war material to get to something more interesting. If a Starship Troopers 3 is ever made, more than likely you&apos;ll be able to skip this entry. As things stand now, 2 is not at all necessary to the story. This is more like an obscure footnote to the first film, about some long lost troop that no one really cares about. Only the new kind of &quot;monster&quot; may be of any interest.",

      "reviewBody": "Meg Loughlin&apos;s parents are dead, causing her and her sister to live with their aunt Ruth. Ruth is not like the other parents: she allows the neighborhood children to smoke and drink, and has an intense dislike for Meg -- for no real reason. After telling the police about mistreatment, Meg&apos;s punishment becomes more and more severe.\n\nFirst, let me say that Blythe Auffarth (who plays Meg Loughlin) is an amazing actress. Some of the scenes in this film are truly awful -- not acted awful, mind you, but are just visually repellent. Most actresses would say no to the torture, rape and beatings contained in this film. And you cannot blame them. But Auffarth accepts the role and does an amazing job of being the normal &quot;girl next door&quot;.\n\nWhile watching this film, I told myself I had finally found the spiritual successor to &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; and my opinion remains the same. Like &quot;Last House&quot;, this film is scary because of its realism. The events could actually happen to the victim, it&apos;s not just a psycho with an ax (which, while possible, is more fantasy than anything). Perhaps this film even trumps &quot;Last House&quot; in a way because the events really did happen, and actually happened worse than depicted here. The real girl, for example, also had to consume human waste, which is not shown here.\n\nMaking the film even more powerful is that we are shown the events from the point of view of the neighbor boy, who has a crush on Meg (despite being a few years younger). We watch them meet, become friends and then as events spin more and more out of control we see how completely helpless the boy is. While the boy is only mildly harmed in the film, it&apos;s an emotional roller coaster to be put in his shoes knowing everything that is happening and having nothing available to remedy it. The suffering he feels vicariously, we also feel vicariously. It&apos;s a pain train.\n\nI cannot recommend this film for the squeamish. I was very uneasy watching it, making this film a member of a very exclusive list (with such others as &quot;Kids&quot;). Even those who enjoy seeing a film of slaughter (and sometimes I do) will be shocked in some way by this one. It&apos;s not your Jason or Freddy film, it&apos;s your sister or girlfriend really being kidnapped and there&apos;s nothing you can do about it. And yes, this really did happen and it can happen again.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s common knowledge that actor and game show host Ben Stein was a speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, but does anyone know if he was a good speechwriter? Judging from his new documentary, Expelled, which argues that the discussion of intelligent design is barred from academia, Stein couldn&apos;t hold an argument with a mute clown. The film jumps all over the place with its ideas, setting up and knocking down the most obvious of strawmen and making leaps of logic, making him about as coherent as a schizophrenic homeless man. And, man, is he obnoxious about it. Imagine Michael Moore with a megaphone, pressed against your ear. Stein questions his allies with faux disbelief, and his foes with raging cynicism. The film begins with a montage of professors, academics and journalists who claim to have been fired for their belief in intelligent design. What evidence does Stein have? Their word, and that&apos;s all he needs to believe them. To make it look more official in the film, there have been documents typed up giving reasons, but these are pretty clearly unofficial documents, not the actual pink slips, and we&apos;re only shown selected, highlighted words from them anyway, so there&apos;s no way to judge for ourselves. The I.D. proponents claim vehemently that their purpose is not to insert religion into scientific discussions, but Stein harps on the atheism of his enemies, and even goes so far as to point out the word &quot;Creator&quot; in the preamble of the Constitution. In other segments, Stein interviews evolutionary biologists, asks them leading questions and gives each of them a total of about 20 seconds of screen time to answer while Stein sits there widening his eyes at them in fake disbelief. Not once does he bring together an I.D. supporter and an accredited scientist and have them discuss the subject at any length. The only scientist who gets any more than a moment of screen time is the infamous Richard Dawkins. Yeah, we all know he is kind of a jerk. Purportedly the filmmakers had to cut his interview to pieces to make him look worse, or so Dawkins claims. You have to believe him, considering how much the rest of the film cheats. To add insult to injury, Stein comes to the conclusion that Charles Darwin and those who uphold his theories are the reason the Holocaust happened. He&apos;s quite far off by this point, if you couldn&apos;t tell. His original premise is that I.D. proponents had been expelled from academia. That may be true. If he had asked one of the evolutionary scientists why that was and let him answer without interrupting, they would have basically concluded that I.D. is not worth discussing because it does not provide an argument. Expelled itself provides no real argument, either, and should definitely be expelled from the ranks of cinema. There is no competition for the worst movie of 2008.",

Cuba Gooding does what does best, plays around acting like an idiot. But in this scenery it works, he is kind of girly. Just don&apos;t expect to much of it, and it&apos;s quite enjoyable. When I went to see it didn&apos;t have any expectations, and ended of feeling good about myself (im not gay by the way, although it might sound like it). The swedish swimsuit team was a bit much though. It might have been funnier if they actually spoken swedish. But to summarize, it&apos;s a good movie to rent with your buddies!"

Unfortunately, I am an animal-lover and was not prepared to see the treatment of the kitten in this movie in the middle of the film. SOS takes normally the cat in his arms and a few minutes later he got rid of the cat unceremoniously (on the floor). Just after, the kitten is playing with something on the floor and suddenly dies instantly. After that, SOS put the cat in a briefcase ! I was shocked and I thought the cat was only asleep.

      "reviewBody": "The movie is entertaining, but due to reasons, other than the performances of its stellar cast: Angela Bassett has just a few and dull moments on the screen. Marlon Brando is helpless with the trite role assigned to him. Though De Niro plays the lead role in this flick, even his performance is limited by the action-oriented role, he plays. The starry-cast fails; but the suspense, the gizmos, and of course, Edward Norton save the day.\n\n Edward Norton is full of life, zest, and enthusiasm. The dual role played be him, as a retarded housekeeper and as an adept thief, is pretty convincing and smartly enacted. The gadgets seem like con-jobs, but are however, pretty well-done and detailed. The computer-hacking part and the part about stealing the codes regarding the security system are overdone, and seem factitious and fatuous. The hacker-geek with a baneful mother is a lot more baneful than his squalling mother herself. Amidst of the many imperfections in the movie, it builds up steadily and interestingly to a well-written and well-directed climax. More than anything else, it is the climax of the movie, which makes it complete as an entertaining thriller.\n\nWith the kind of the star-cast it has, the movie is deceptive: It doesn&apos;t have substance, it doesn&apos;t have style, and it lacks maturity. If watched with keeping the brain aside to rest, it is thrilling and entertaining, and can be savored at best. Along with its healthful entertaining value, the score itself, of THE SCORE, by Howard Shore is good music for the ears.\n\n7/10",

It makes no sense, this incredible film deserves its place there.\n\nOutstanding from start to finish, In the heat of the night is a terrific mystery, an intelligent whodunnit, with some remarkable characters, but so much more, it highlights the social situation of the time.\n\nWhat I found extraordinary, is the way that Gillespie begins to see the world through Virgil&apos;s eyes, he gets just a glimpse of what life is like from Virgil&apos;s point of view, the pair share some incredible scenes, that scene where chat about marriage and loneliness was phenomenal.\n\nIt is incredible when you think that in 1966, just one year before, The US sent up Lunar Orbiter 1, the first craft to orbit the moon, and yet Society was dogged by the most horrific racism.\n\nPoitier delivers an outstanding performance, Oscar worthy in the eyes of many fans, me included, such an impressive presence. Steiger is equally terrific, the way Gillespie develops is a key factor to this movie&apos;s success.\n\nThe music is just incredible, there&apos;s that exquisite track by Ray Charles, which features prominently, but every featured track is spot on, it&apos;s a soundtrack you&apos;ll want to own.\n\nOne of the greatest movies ever made.\n\n10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "It takes a lot of guts to make a Belgian &quot;policier&quot;. It&apos;s like making an American western without John Wayne, or a French flick without Jean Gabin or Alain Delon.\n\nNew times, new directors, new actors... Director Van Looy found his actors. Not only are they good, they are outstanding. Much will be said about the three main actors: Jan Decleir, Koen De Bauw and Werner De Smedt, but look closely at the supporting roles. Hilde De Baerdemaeker is one of the coming Belgian ladies... read my lips!\n\n The script is based on a book by author Jef Geeraerts but for once the adaptation is better. \n\nThe dialogues are tongue in cheek, and for fans of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; or &quot;Homicide&quot; this movie is a real treat. When the lights come on in the theater you want to look at your TV guide and check when the next episode is due...\n\nThe camera is nervous, it follows the action closely and the music is very well chosen. Also, without being chauvinistic, it&apos;s wonderful to see all the action take place in one of the largest European cities: Antwerp.\n\nOne of the best Belgian movies yet? Yes. A nice build up of characters, situations, drama. It&apos;s not easy, but it has been done.\n\nDirector Van Looy found his real commitment, a police thriller. You can compare this movie with &quot;Memento&quot; (the memory loss) or &quot;Se7en&quot; (the dualism between the two investigators) but better yet to &quot;The Insider&quot;. Watch it: you will find out why.",

      "reviewBody": "For The Asylum Halloween Night is not too bad, they have certainly done much worse. Even with that taken into account, Halloween Night is still not a good movie. There are some things that are done reasonably, some of the daylight scenes are shot nicely, the music is a good mix of jaunty and eerie, Scot Nery does bravely as the one character that we come close to rooting for and there are some gory and imaginative slasher death scenes(honourable mention must go to the hanger death which is just hilarious). There have been worse-looking movies from The Asylum, but the special effects are poorly rendered, the editing is sloppy for much of the movie and some scenes especially the first 10-15 minutes are really amateurishly shot. Chris Vale&apos;s make-up is appropriately hideous considering what happens to him, but he looks too much of a zombie and some have already said. The acting is pretty dire from almost everybody, Nery is the best of the lot but then we have Rebekah Kochan overacts her rather shallow character and Derek Osedach mumbles his way through his lines and not much else. The characters are exceedingly annoying and shallow with non-existent character development, the one exception is Chris Vale but he is not much different from similar characters from similar movies. The dialogue is dumb and just painful to listen to, making something like the worst Disney Channel movie seem like Casablanca comparatively. The story is even more of a problem, that it&apos;s mind-numbingly ridiculous, painfully predictable and deathly dull is one thing but we also have a complete lack of tension, thrills sense of horror/terror(mainly because of the characters&apos; interactions and expressions being so blank) and suspense, situations and interactions are really contrived and implausible, and there is a heavy reliance on drawn-out done-to-death clichÃ©s that are marred even further by being played far too straight. The ending is inept in every way, and if you&apos;re finding it difficult to buy or swallow don&apos;t blame yourself, you won&apos;t be the only one. In conclusion, could have been worse but rather mediocre, not the terrifying story that the cover advertised. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "This film is about a Finnish boy who got sent to Sweden during the Finish-Russian War in 1939.\n\nThe film is very powerful, touching and affecting. There are so many memorable scenes where nothing is said, and yet they convey a thousand words. An example is that Eero&apos;s mother seeing a priest coming to their house. The despair and hopelessness is portrayed so vividly, and yet not one word is said. Maria Lundqvist deserves particular recognition for her acting skills. She plays every emotion very naturally. From the initial rejection and disgust to the eventual love and trust, these emotions are all so natural and real. Another point that deserves mention is that the present days are in black and white while the past is in colour. Such an arrangement is not so usual, and yet suits this film well. The soundtrack is very good, it really captivates and enhances the mood and emotions of the scenes.\n\nThe plot is particularly touching, especially when one is reminded of the fact that 80,000 children had a similar fate during the war. I am glad to have a chance to watch this film, and I urge others to watch this too!"

This &quot;Way of Life&quot; had no cheesy special effects and used no obvious actors. It looked at the death of an old man in a village in Ladakh, has early footage of the Dalai Lama and a (somewhat) recent interview. Perhaps the best bit was the street interview with local citizens who, unlike most Westerners, are very accepting of death and suffering. Ram Dass and others share their ideas for use of the book in the West. I enjoyed the Tibetan Book of the Dead being read at a Western hospice. Again, a bit basic, but a good introductory piece. The Ladakh scenery, homes, etc. were fascinating when the film plodded along.",

      "reviewBody": "Antonioni is one of the sages of cinema, perhaps the wisest of them. His cinema is a stunning edifice; a structure rigid and harmonious as shaped by a visual vocabulary which articulates with few words a place and a time; pattern and blueprint, whereby each film as individual level informs and is informed by the whole; these levels filled with doors to insight and intuition. To all these doors he holds the keys, and in the spaces behind the doors, which are closed to most filmmakers, he moves freely and sees everything. Meditation as stillness of mind, which enables awareness.\n\nNaturally some of these levels are more aptly functional, staircases that lead higher. Il Grido is one of those (and La Notte later).\n\nNonetheless we see here the early sketches of what is to come. We see a man cast adrift after a painful breakup as passing through various lives, affecting them with shortlived passions and vexations. Each of these lives he briefly shares could be a possible new home, a safe harbor where peace and happiness are finally possible. But he moves on, still clinging to a mad hope and frustrated desire that his old affair could resume at any point.\n\nSo this is the fascinating stuff. A man alone, itinerant, ostensibly free to be what he may, but captive of his desires so that he&apos;s nothing at all, except perhaps a painful memory. The downward spiral into squalor and misery is not simply the upkeep of a bad karma, but a reminder of what fuels the restlessnesss. What negativity keeps him going, regret or unfulfillment, will only be encountered ahead of him, it cannot be escaped by running from it.\n\nIn passing through these phases the film perhaps stalls for too long. We understand what is going on, the proverbial journey of an empty, unfulfilled life, but Antonioni wants to shape these lives as lived, meaning we get the mundane details of their routine. The comings and goings and side characters, as vignettes. This is the neorealist baggage ostensibly cinema in the service of revealing/documenting society, which Antonioni is about to shed for his next film, and be free as a creative spirit.\n\nFor the end Antonioni reserves defeaning symbolism, by contrast to the hazy allusions he would favour onwards. The man climbs on the refinery tower, the place and time where he was for once happy in his life and which now seems impossible to attain again, and we don&apos;t even have to guess what happens next."

After seeing it one wonders why anybody should have bothered about this silly movie.\n\nThe film fails because the central character of a lorry driver in search of his friend who cheated him is something, which an actor of Mohanlal caliber can do. The story line is similar to Thazhvaram the film directed by Bharathan and scripted by MT with Lal in the hero&apos;s role.\n\nHere you find Prithivi struggling to do justice to the role. Lohitha Das should have realized that or the hero should have understood that it was too heavy for him. Sadly both did not realize it. \n\nPrithiviraj is Chandrahasan whose money got from gambling was stolen and wife Mira kidnapped. Barely escaping from death he is out on the trail of his friend. Prithiviraj strikes the right poses with long hair and beard etc but fails to emote. Meera has nothing in this film."

      "reviewBody": "First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. In this film, you will not see a single sailing boat. You will not see sailors, ghosts, or anything remotely exciting. It is not the story of the ghost ship, and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I wouldn&apos;t have watched it, because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; legend... I don&apos;t understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film. Then you see Daniel Emilfork (who was Krank in City of Lost Children) for about two seconds, and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. Unfortunately he is very bad in the film. The same thing can be said about Italian actor Nino Manfredi, who was one of Italia&apos;s best actors ever, and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the &quot;wise man&quot; of the film. And boy, does that film need wiseness! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement, yelling, torturing others (in excrement), fornicating (in excrement) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it. It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. Coming from a Dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven&apos;s film, &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;, such a great film. The thought of &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. Unfortunately, and unlike &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;, there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;. The photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is well-done and enticing. This too, stops very early in the film. The music, from Nicola Piovani (of &quot;La vitÃ  e bella&quot; fame) is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung). Throughout the first &quot;act&quot; of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour (!), the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called &quot;the Ship&quot;, in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did I mention?). The main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it&apos;s really cool so let&apos;s live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but he doesn&apos;t really mind because (did I mention?) he&apos;s not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I&apos;ve said it&apos;s really confused who&apos;s who), make the Dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces. Yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on his job, or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the end, a lot of the mentally-challenged new &quot;friends&quot; that the Dutchman made die. The woman he had sex with who was his brother&apos;s wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son. The Dutchman and his son talk. The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don&apos;t have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses.",

In short, a fun slice of very silly Spanish monster madness.\n\nOne can only presume, therefore, that it must have been one hell of a slow day at the office when the BBFC/DPP decided to stick The Werewolf and the Yeti on the Official Nasties list: the film has its unsavoury moments, as do most horror films, but there&apos;s nothing to warrant it being lumped with likes of genuinely disturbing flicks such as Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death and Gestapo&apos;s Last Orgy. Any violence or sadism in The Werewolf and the Yeti is handled in such a camp manner that it&apos;s almost impossible to take offence at.\n\nTake the flaying of sexy young scientist Melody (the gorgeous VerÃ³nica Miriel) by evil bitch Wandessa (Silvia Solar), for example: the effects are so cheap and unrealistic that one cannot help but find the scene amusing, no matter how repulsive the idea. Likewise, the sight of one of the scientists impaled on a wooden stake (ala Cannibal Holocaust) is rendered laughable by the fact that he is not only still alive, but also capable of holding a conversation with our hero.\n\nAlso providing mucho unintentional chuckles: the scene where Naschy kills a pair of semi-naked werewolf/vampire/witch women (but only after having sex with them both, of course); the ridiculous fight between Naschy and dermatologically challenged bandit/warlord Sekkar Khan (Luis Induni); and the rousing finale, in which our hero, transformed into a drooling beast by the full moon, rescues his love Sylvia (Mercedes Molina) from the abominable snowman.\n\nIt&apos;s all utter nonsense, not at all scary and certainly not nasty enough to deserve being banned, but still worth a go if you&apos;re in the mood for a bit of a giggle.",

      "reviewBody": "Mahal (1949) : Breif Review -\n\nA landmark in the Gothic-Horror-Fiction genre for Indian cinema, with complex romance theories that are still untouched. The gothic horror genre was set in mind when I saw the silent German classic, &quot;The Golem&quot; (1920). I never thought that world cinema could use Gothic horrors in such a manner to create a haunting viewing experience. Even Hollywood stayed away from it in the early days, so of course, Indian cinema was supposed to try its hands way later. I am surprised to see that Kamal Amrohi did it in 1949. Okay, one second, How??? Mahal is such an uneven mixture of Indian Gothic, horror, romance, drama and intellectual yet complex theories, it is hard to believe. I haven&apos;t seen such a unique combination in any Indian horror film yet - including every film made till 2022. Having a love story in a horror film is like having water in tea for Bollywood movies. Tell me, have you seen any hits or popular horror films that haven&apos;t got romance? The answer is probably No, I guess. But Mahal is way ahead of all those romantic horror films, despite being made early. Kamal Amrohi has been hailed for making &quot;Pakeezah&quot; (1972), but I believe he did a better job in Mahal, 23 years before the musical classic. This deserves to be hailed at a higher level than Pakeezah. Mahal is a prime example of human horror meeting gothic formulas, including an influential romance based on reincarnation. Rajesh Khanna and Hema Malini&apos;s Mehbooba (1976) was too late to copy it. There are many instances like this because Mahal is a textbook of multiple theories-right from romance to horror to crime to drama to a sad ending. Now you may want to argue with me for calling it a horror movie, as it&apos;s not a ghost horror film like the Ramsay Brothers. So what? Even Biren Nag&apos;s &quot;Bees Saal Baad&quot; was similar. It had &quot;Kahi Deep Jale&quot;, while Mahal had an even better song, &quot; Aayega Aane wala&quot;. Top class stuff. A little lengthy, but needed that time to absorb you as a viewer.\n\nRATING - 7.5/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

It never gets too deep, but still touches a few themes, that might be considered too hot or politically incorrect.\n\nBut that&apos;s were the movie is interesting. When it is not playing it safe, but opts to show us the humans behind the facade. And of course gives us things to talk about. It&apos;s no wonder, that the directors German and Polish! Touching both sides and making it as even as they can. Though of course this could also be considered a weakness. Not having a clear view on things that is. If you want that, you would be wrong here.

      "reviewBody": "I can never understand why &quot;The Devils&quot;, which was such a major film and caused such controversy, never became a cult classic being shown every other week on cable TV.  This film totally annihilates all the trashy &quot;straight-to-video&quot; horror films.  Based on true events in 17th century France, this film is one of the most horrifying tales of man&apos;s intolerance: religious and sexual.\n\nThe tale begins with an outbreak of the plague, which the folk of the middle ages, with typical misunderstanding of the real cause, rat fleas, believed that someone was to blame. Who more convenient a scapegoat than Father Grandier, played by the notorious Oliver Reed an actor who ended his rambunctious life by dropping dead in a bar.  The sexual appeal of Fr. Grandier drives the supposedly celibate clergy into a frenzy of jealousy. A group of nuns, led by a noblewoman who has been forced into the convent due to her physical deformity and therefore, lack of marriageable options, joins in the hysteria which is not satisfied until Fr. Grandier is burned at the stake.\n\nAlthough set in France in the middle ages, a lot of the hysteria can be seen today, in our more enlightened times. Just witness the periodic witch hunts in the United States, such as the furore over the alleged Satanic cults running day care centers, not to mention the reds under the beds hysteria of the 50&apos;s.\n\nThis was one of Ken Russell&apos;s most controversial films, and definitely very 70&apos;s in its style, after all, we had Mick Jagger and Twiggy perfectly cast as decadent French nobility, and it has taken 20+ years to see how right on the mark he was.\n\nAlthough Russell was the hottest thing in cinema for a while, he faded like a discarded fashion as every wannabe copied his style, but without being able to understand what is was that set Ken Russell apart.  Unfortunately Russell did not help his reputation by becoming more and more the icon of bad taste.  Eventually he became a parody and the fickle who had formally worshipped his genius could not disassociate themselves quickly enough.\n\nLike Orson Welles, Ken Russell&apos;s brilliance will not be realized until a new generation discovers his work.  I recommend &quot;The Devils&quot; along with &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; as his best work."

A drifter lands in a situation in the middle of nowhere, pretending to be a long-lost son in order to shack up for a while. But what seems simple gets really complicated for him, as he&apos;s faced with situations that make him get deeper involved than he ever intended. This film never bores and has many great twists and turns, as the viewer tries to determine just who knows what, and what everyone&apos;s motives may be. The cast is just great, and the final moments of the film where it all comes together are incredible. I always felt the photography, direction, and music gave this film a certain &apos;feel&quot; that&apos;s hard to match. It shows the remoteness and desperation of the characters, to whom loneliness is the most dreaded disease. A DVD release would be a godsend.",

It&apos;s quite a shock that movies were actually getting better by 1967, but still, this atrocious experience in crimefighting offers the &quot;BIFF!&quot;s, &quot;WHAM!&quot;s, &quot;SOCK!&quot;s, and &quot;POW!&quot;s in a distorted array of action-packed excitement. A horde of &quot;faceless giants&quot; goes after our demented hero, and nails them down with fists, only to make the movie look terrible. And where did the story go? If this is the kind of originality you&apos;d expect for a movie like SUPERARGO, you&apos;d probably think the actor wearing a red suit would&apos;ve done the same like Popeye The Sailor. But this is a superhero-style movie, and it has a small hint of visual effects. It&apos;s a pity that it&apos;s no better than the famous legends of Batman &amp; Company. Until the final round comes, this flick&apos;s gonna be knocked out cold in a matter of a first few minutes! Give it a shot if you desperately love movies without good taste.",

It is absolutely amazing how similar a court marshal can be out on the &quot;velt&quot; of South Africa, in Washington, D.C., or during a purely uniformed war in which all protagonists are easily identifiable.\n\nThree Australian volunteers for the &quot;Bushvelt Carbineers&quot;, recruited to fight against civilian-clad commandos (reportedly the first use of the term), find themselves charged with murder, and set as an example by the British in order to prevent Germany from entering the war on the side of the Boer (Dutch) inhabitants of South Africa. In one incredulous encounter between a British officer and Lord Kitchener, the officer spouts the British line &quot;they lack our altruism&quot; (referring to German interests in the gold and silver mines of South Africa), to which Lord Kitchener grudgingly responds, &quot;Quite.&quot; A sham trial from start to finish, the Australians are defended by military attorney with experience in &quot;land conveyancing and wills&quot; to which one of those charged, &quot;the latter might come in handy.&quot; The film is replete with irony and tragicomic circumstances, as this &quot;new war for a new century&quot; presages many of the conflicts that would come later in the 20th century, and many of the clear paradoxes and trying aspects of the war against terror--again, in which one side is not uniformed, does not conduct war according to any known &quot;rules&quot; of &quot;civilized warfare&quot; (an oxymoron if ever there was one). It has lost none of its cutting edge in the 25-odd years since its release.",

Just from what I briefly read it seems like this film had some production troubles, so I can&apos;t really fault the movie for what it was. It was an experiment that worked in some places, and didn&apos;t work in others; it&apos;s pretty middling overall.",

And as she says, citing a classic/traditional samba, &quot;o samba Ã¨ a tristeza que balanÃ§a&quot;, that is: samba is sadness that cradles us. //I think in this documentary by Georges Gachot - who already did a marvelous job in portraying Martha Argerich, another remarkable woman for whom music is a passion - is pretty well done. Some might think she appears a bit as &quot;nombrilist&quot; because she talks about herself for almost two hours, while at a certain point she says that what she does with her voice is really the workings of God. She believes in God, and this might sound strange to those who don&apos;t.Still it is a way, IMHO, to step back and be thankful for what she can do and thereafter share with us. //Music is also very well portrayed, and listening is quite pleasant as it isn&apos;t always interrupted, one has the opportunity to let rhythm and harmonies reach beyond the skin level. Thank you!",

      "reviewBody": "In 1984-85, the Dutch documentarist Johan van der Keuken took his camera across the globe, from Amsterdam to New York to Hong Kong, ending in Geneva. The object of his investigation in this film is money, in particular the maniacal drive to accumulate it in the era of Thatcherite/Reaganite neoliberalism. As well as a succession of bankers, traders and executives (including the odiously self-congratulatory British chairman of the Hong Kong Jockey Club), van der Keuken also interviews the victims of economic dispossession, such as the residents of dilapidated dwellings in New York, or illegal Portuguese immigrants in Switzerland (who, ironically, have a son who dreams about the promised land of New York). Flashes of the Third World (which the financiers admit is of no interest to them) appear on flickering TV monitors, indicating its remoteness from the centres of capitalist power, as embodied in the sanitised streets of Geneva.\n\nVan der Keuken&apos;s orientation is clearly that of a sceptical leftist, but his own interventions are kept to a minimum. There is almost no narration, just a few occasional remarks. In the Vertovian documentary tradition, he lets the camera explore its environment, with an attention to aesthetic detail (crowds reflected in polished corporate exteriors; digital displays on the stock market; beggars and children moving along urban pavements; Chinese New Year decorations) that sets this apart from more conventional reportage. In its epic sweep, it is vaguely reminiscent of the more acclaimed &apos;Sans soleil&apos; (1982) by Chris Marker. Less &apos;poetic&apos;, less impressionistic than Marker&apos;s film, &apos;I Love $&apos; is nevertheless, in my opinion, perhaps the greater achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Blue Chips&quot; is a vastly under-rated sports film which deals with the shady dealings of colleges and their players.  Nick Nolte plays a college basketball coach who is so desperate to return to his glory days that he breaks the rules by giving his newest recruits (Shaquille O&apos;Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt Nover) basically anything they and their families want. School alumnus J.T. Walsh is the catalyst to these shady dealings and now the college has a winning team again, but at what price?  &quot;Blue Chips&quot; is another one of William Friedkin&apos;s films that is much deeper than it first appears on the surface.  With the exception of &quot;The French Connection&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, this is his finest film as a director.  His documentary-style makes you feel as if you are in on all the action. Numerous parts are played by real basketball players and coaches, adding a great bit of realism to the story.  &quot;The French Connection&quot; benefited from this style by having real cops in key roles and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; did the same having priests play themselves.  Shaquille O&apos;Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt Nover do surprisingly well with the material.  They are all three-dimensional characters and shine throughout the film.  However with that said, it is Nick Nolte who is the primary factor that makes the film well worth while.  Far from perfect, but still a very good movie.  4 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "Russ Meyer loves breasts, and he&apos;s a filmmaker, but it&apos;s mostly the breast thing. That doesn&apos;t mean that he&apos;s not good at what he does, which is making raucous comedies where there&apos;s a dumb, well-hung klutz (Charles Pitts, in thankfully his only significant point in his career as Clint Ramsey), the dual role of the schizo-girlfriend (SuperAngel) and later her re-incarnation as a gas station attendant (SuperVixen), and the enemy of the film, the diabolical, totally evil Harry Sledge (Charles Napier, a classic part in a long character actor career). Much of this is just silly, very silly, and strange, deranged, illogical, and probably would be seen on the surface as sexist. But looking past the fact that there are a lot of naked women who continually throw themselves at Clint, there is something more to Meyer&apos;s psychology here. It would probably be something of a big point had the film been used in Zizek&apos;s The Pervert&apos;s Guide to Cinema: it&apos;s like a classic farce- yet still a somewhat truthful farce- about male desire.\n\nTake the fact that while Clint is on his &apos;journey&apos;- running from the scene of a crime he didn&apos;t commit, which was the murder and burning down of the dig that SuperAngel was living in- he continually gets into situations where the women present want to desperately ride him till Tuesday...but then there&apos;s always another man. There&apos;s a fascinating push-and-pull (no pun intended...maybe a little) to how the men treat the women in the picture. Until Clint agrees to stay with SuperVixen and take care of the gas station does he finally seem to relax, as before with the guy in the car, the farmer, the motel owner, all had women as their next of kin or significant others that were persona non grata. Behind the hilarity that ensues as Clint gets practically raped in a hayloft by a German girl, or when a mute/deaf black chick tries to get Clint to have his way with her in a desert, there is subtext- desire is defined by property. By the time Clint gets to SuperVixen, and finds out her man ran out on her weeks ago, it&apos;s like they&apos;re suddenly whisked away to the Garden of Eden (rather, in Arizona, as is one of the funniest sections of the flick), as they run around naked in ecstasy. Freud would have a field-day.\n\nBut one must not forget the Harry Sledge character who, like Hopper in Blue Velvet or Bobby Peru in Wild at Heart, is as Zizek described a larger-than-life, absurdist figure of man&apos;s libido. Maybe it was subconscious or not, but there&apos;s a lot to do in Supervixens with the idea of potency, or impotency. Harry can&apos;t get it up, the truth of it, and it becomes a sudden turn to see Harry suddenly stomp SuperAngel (albeit, in one of the most illogical scenes I&apos;ve ever seen in any movie, taunts him for five minutes while locked in a bathroom following a bad sexual experience) and burn the place down as a means of compensation, an inherent lack of drive leading to the demise of anyone around him. While this seems to go overboard in the last twenty minutes of the film, when he returns in and becomes an ultimate terror upon Clint and SuperVixen, there&apos;s probably more one could read into in terms of symbolism than your average Bunuel movie: the dynamite shooting out of a chute, the one stick next to SuperVixen&apos;s most private of private spots, and all raised to the level of delirium.\n\nThe more I thought about it after the movie ended, the more it seemed to make sense, the idea of the ID blown-up in, of all things, a Russ Meyer movie. But this will be moot to most viewers who are just looking for what it there in a Meyer movie- sex and craziness, usually at the same time. As the first of his films I&apos;ve seen, it&apos;s already apparent how equally proficient and tacky he can be: he&apos;s a master at editing, and casts his actors like it&apos;s a slight step above Z-grade porn. Which, of course, adds to its hysterical attitude, as we see one of the worst male actors of the 20th century play off of girls who rarely have a dirty smile off of their faces (save for when they&apos;re taunting Sledge, or getting caught by their daddies or husbands). And because Meyer, in the Mel Brooks sense, rises below vulgarity, his picture works so well even as it shouldn&apos;t. It deserves to be shown in grindhouse theaters and be found in the dirty sections of video stores. That it&apos;s an unlikely classic to be found in either of those places is hard to deny.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting to see that at the point I voted for this film roughly one-third of those who voted gave this movie a 10 -- and yet the votes of the other two-thirds people has held the voting down to an average under 5. Clearly -- to me -- a sign that most people watching this film &quot;just didn&apos;t get it.&quot; \n\nAnd I can&apos;t blame them too much. People unfamiliar with watching movies with a high amount of visual symbolism and with a unique slant might just not know how to appreciate a film like this. Additionally, they may not have had the advantage that I had of being told in advance that nearly everything in the film is DREAM sequence (and most if not all of those dreams being memories of significant experiences in their lives especially as in relation to war, fascism and/or facing possible or even certain death) of the different characters that live in this building in Hungary which is under -- or about to be under -- demolition. This gives this viewer the feeling, &quot;I am now seeing what these people were remembering, feeling and thinking just before they were going to die.&quot; Understanding this in advance perhaps made it much easier for me to appreciate this film without the unnecessary thoughts in my head like, &quot;That&apos;s not realistic. It is supposed to be hot and he is not even sweating!&quot; because in dreams things are not so realistic sometimes -- and even if they are, creative license can easily be allowed for this Hungarian Masterpiece.\n\nThis is a very interesting film with characters of varying ages and varying concerns, some very riveting actors, and it is with English subtitles (which I much preferred to dubbed). People with knowledge of Hungarian history will understand this film the best perhaps, but the montage of peeks into the thoughts and conversations -- all dreams, and memories within dreams -- give glimpses of history that many of us know, or should know, at least a little something about (such as life under Nazi rule -- or simply the interactions between people in varying situations, most of which are times that &quot;test&quot; one&apos;s humanity if you will.\n\nI love the cinematography in this film. This is a feast to the eye visually in much of the film. But be prepared to witness some tragedy. And be prepared to think about things you may have never thought about before -- which is one of the things I love about foreign films. Good foreign films tend to broaden our minds, stimulate us, and also see the commonality of all peoples. While we see things that are, well, foreign, we also see that no matter what nationality, religion or creed, humanity has much more in common with one another than differences. It is truly what matters most that we have in common.\n\nI checked the box for spoilers even though I am not giving away some key things about this movie. I checked it because perhaps for some people saying that these are all dream sequences would be considered a spoiler, not sure! I will say this, that this movie is not about the day that nothing happened. It is about the day that just about every character in this film, for all they know, will be dead tomorrow. They are, to say the least, feeling just a bit stressed.\n\nIn this day and age with info wars, conventional wars and threats of atomic-scope wars and globally powerful multinational corporations dictating to nations as if dictators, I think it is a good time to watch this film. What is that saying? Something like that those who don&apos;t learn their history well, and learn from that history, are doomed to repeat it, again and again. Mankind has repeated war for thousands of years. I hope it is on a learning curve by now.\n\nTry it. You&apos;ll like it. ;)",

The problem was that screenwriter Bolt was done wrong by director Bolt. Especially let down was Bolt&apos;s then wife Sarah Miles.\n\nMiles who when directed by David Lean in Ryan&apos;s Daughter turned in such a spirited performance, was not given the same inspiration for Lady Caroline Lamb. Whatever else Caroline Lamb was she was not dull to be around. Miles does all right, but the rest of the cast just seems to walk through the parts, even the two guys playing the men in her life, Richard Chamberlain as Lord Byron and Jon Finch as William Lamb the future Lord Melbourne and Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n\nI think these guys and the rest of the cast knew this was a vehicle for Miles the minute they walked on set and performed accordingly. Even Sir Laurence Olivier as the Duke of Wellington is strangely lifeless. Of course after seeing Christopher Plummer as the perfect Wellington in Waterloo, I&apos;m kind of spoiled.\n\nIn real life Melbourne was hardly an injured party. He had a couple of other scandals attached to his name that had nothing to do with Lady Caroline. He never let the grass grow under his feet. Byron was notorious all over Europe for bedding everything in skirts within reach. It&apos;s likely he did want to call it a day with Caro, but probably because she was crazier than him. \n\nStill the escapades of George and Caro titillated all of Georgian Great Britain, but they don&apos;t move the audience a bit here.",

However this should be no surprise; this is how action films generally are.\n\nThe fights were not the best I&apos;ve seen, but they&apos;re pretty good; mostly gritty and realistic type fight scenes. I was a bit surprised because I thought this style only became popular much later, when martial arts became a common element in American action films. For example some of &quot;Tiger&quot;&apos;s fights like the one where he choked the guy to kill him as opposed to using some sort of fancy looking kung-fu technique. Because of that to me some of the choreography actually look sort of modern.\n\nAlthough I have to admit I was rooting for Tiger the whole time. Jet Li&apos;s character was too goody-two-shoe.",

That Â– to me Â– is the mark of a well-done film Â– or any work of art, for that matter. \n\nI have never since seen a prodigiously talented performer without wondering what their day-to-day life and relationships must be like.

I sat for the first half hour wondering what any of these actors saw in the script, but I will admit to laughing out loud several times at the painful &quot;family&quot; moments I think people will recognize from their own lives. Diane Keaton deserves a better script for her talents. And when TV actors are trying to transition to film, they should raise the level of their work.",

      "name": "MASK OF MURDER (Arne Mattsson, 1985) **",
      "reviewBody": "Certainly among Swedish director Mattsson&apos;s best-known work is the &quot;Giallo&quot; precursor MANNEQUIN IN RED (1958); with this in mind, the film under review can be seen as his contribution to the then-prevalent (albeit much-maligned) &quot;Slasher&quot; subgenre. While he should be commended for not following much of the established trappings (if anything, the teenagers who usually make up the victims&apos; list barely feature here) and for managing to attract a serviceable cast (Rod Taylor, Valerie Perrine and Christopher Lee, who â€“ as with the recently-viewed ALBINO {1976} â€“ plays the ineffectual Police Chief), the results are still far from memorable and even downright inept at times.\n\nThe main problem with the script is that it tries too hard to lend psychological depth to the narrative when its outcome is fairly obvious and predictable from the start. Cop Taylor discovers wife Perrine is having an affair with his closest colleague at the same time as he is investigating a spate of throat-slashings. But since the murders, following the same modus operandi, resume soon after Taylor&apos;s execution of the serial killer and Taylor himself had been the last to handle the latter&apos;s &apos;kit&apos; (razor and featureless mask â€“ at one point, the latter is amusingly stated that it makes the wearer look like Yul Brynner; if anything, it actually reminded me of the assailant of THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN {1976}!), there is little doubt as to the identity of the second murderer, given the lawman&apos;s state of mind! \n\nThis effectively dilutes the proceedings of both tension and interest, especially since our anti-hero goes on about his Police business regardless, i.e. probing locations and witnesses for possible clues to the killings he is himself clearly responsible for, and even adding further red herrings in the unconnected razor assault on a drug-dealing barber committed by a gangland collector! Alas, all the satirical socio- political points brilliantly made by Elio Petri via an exact same scenario in the Oscar-winning INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION (1970) are completely bypassed here in favour of the lowest common denominator (read gratuitous softcore nudity). That said, we are still spoon-fed the protagonist&apos;s having the cloud of suspicion over himself: he happens to have a similar razor as the murder weapon and one of the people he questions actually says that the current perpetrator has a similar build as hisÂ…and, all the while, the bed-ridden Lee (having been shot by the first slasher before being machine-gunned by an already- unbalanced Taylor) contemplates whether the dead man&apos;s spirit could have found a new &apos;vessel&apos; in order to continue his apparently motiveless killing spree (but which Taylor perversely suggests might be brought on by sexual inadequacy)!\n\nThe snowy backdrop (supposedly Canada but really Uppsala, Sweden â€“ that is to say, Ingmar Bergman&apos;s birthplace!) is undeniably attractive and unusual for this type of fare; however, this is continuously undercut by the kitschy 1980s fashions and settings (including obligatory and awfully-scored disco-bar and strip-joint sequences) and some hilariously overstated moments (notably Taylor and Lee&apos;s reactions at, respectively, his wife&apos;s infidelity â€“ captured from a distance via binoculars â€“ and his friend&apos;s guilt â€“ by the symbolic throat-slashing of &quot;Playboy&quot; centrefolds conveniently stashed in a drawer of his work-desk!).\n\nThe finale, then, emits a false air of cynicism by not only having Taylor frame his duplicitous pal for the murders (he foolishly re-enacts the slaying of a woman witnessed by her young son who, of course, exclaims &quot;That&apos;s him!&quot; upon seeing the masked assailant) but by the fact that he is allowed to get away with it (though assured by his superior that he is on to him)! For the record, Lee would re-unite with Mattsson on the director&apos;s subsequent effort, i.e. THE GIRL (1986), which also happens to be my next entry in the ongoing tribute I am paying to the recently-deceased Horror icon (incidentally, Rod Taylor also passed away earlier this year â€“ so I got to watch MASK OF MURDER for his sake as well)",

This very long (would it ever end?), badly paced and boring film is no exception. Maybe the long production period (almost three years) took its toll, the film is very unsatisfactory with a couple of good scenes but on the whole it is a muddled up endeavour that sometimes simply rambles on from the one scene to the next without any overall power and structure. I could not care a bit about any of the characters. \n\nWicki is not shy of using some strong graphic imagery to really make his point only to achieve complete distance: ah yes another ripped off head. Furthermore he seems to have been afraid not to get the atmosphere of the period across and endlessly we have to watch how good he was trying to achieve this by maybe a 1000 props we all have to see and a rather folklore interpretation of the Jewish Berlin neighbourhood: Wicki should have concentrated on good story telling in stead. The film is not helped much by poor acting.",

      "reviewBody": "Spiral is direct sequel to Japanese cult horror movie Ring and both movies were released simultaneously which underlines the franchise&apos;s experimental, fresh and groundbreaking approach right from the start. While Ring has been met with critical acclaim at home and abroad, Spiral has been met with mixed to negative reviews and has almost been completely ignored abroad. As a matter of fact, an alternative sequel titled Ring 2 was hastily shot and released one year later. Spiral was criticized for its unusual scientific approach to the genre, the introduction of completely new characters and the fact that the lead character of the first film and her son die off the screen and have no significant role in this sequel.\n\nThe movie focuses on suicidal pathologist Ando Mitsuo who examines the body of his deceased colleague Takayama Ryuji. He has mysterious visions while examining the body and finds a cryptic note in his colleague&apos;s stomach. He starts investigating and soon learns about the cursed tape that his colleague watched a week before his demise. Soon enough, his colleague&apos;s ex-wife and son perish in a mysterious automobile accident. Obsessed with the case, Ando Mitsuo contacts the shady boss of the deceased investigative journalist. He also gets in touch with his colleague&apos;s former student and secret lover Takano Mai. The two solitary souls soon develop a sexual bond. They are determined to destroy all existing copies of the cursed tape. However, they soon realize that things might be more complicated than they had initially anticipated.\n\nWhile Spiral wasn&apos;t met with critical acclaim, it&apos;s certainly an underestimated entry in the franchise that innovates instead of repeating patterns of its immediate predecessor. The film finds the right balance between new scientific approaches explaining the cursed tape and supernatural elements that conclude the movie on an otherworldly tone. The idea to develop the quiet student Takano Mai into the professor&apos;s secret lover and sidekick of the pathologist adds much depth to the story. The protagonist is also quite intriguing and turns out to be a haunted soul who attempts to commit suicide in the very first scene of the film which is quite shocking.\n\nSpiral has the same gloomy atmosphere and sluggish pace as the predecessor but differs in all other departments. The scientific explanations are baffling, the suicidal protagonist is rather creepy and the supernatural conclusion seems like an antithesis to the grounded introduction. The movie experiments a lot and not all ideas might end up working out. However, Spiral deserves acclaim and attention as it pushes an already experimental horror franchise even further. The movie is filled with stunning details that justify watching it on multiple occasions. It&apos;s certainly the most creative, daring and intellectual entry in the franchise. Ignore the surprisingly negative comments and revist this forgotten gem of the Ring franchise to make up your own mind about this unusual entry.",

      "reviewBody": "The Wave rides high (pun intended) on the new wave of film makers from Germany. The movie itself is shaped like a proverbial wave, starts gently and slowly gathers momentum and before you know it it turns into a powerhouse. The movie will amuse you, frighten you, disturb you and enthrall you completely.\n\nThe movie takes a lesson in human psychology and shows how it is possible for a person with oratory skills and confidence to start a movement that turns into a revolution with frightening possibilities. It explains a lot about world history and current affairs.\n\nTheme apart, I don&apos;t usually like to discuss any movie&apos;s story but I suppose if you&apos;re here you would&apos;ve read the other reviews and summaries and would know a fair bit already. Putting it mildly, the movie deals with a classroom experiment about autocracy which has interesting positive and negative consequences.\n\nThe direction is sharp and spot on. The director is able to delve deeply into the minds of the various characters and explain their behaviour and position in the society that is created. It is all done realistically. The acting by and large is very good; however a few of the actors displayed a scope for further improvement. However this does not take away much from the movie experience. There are certain similarities with another great German film, Das Experiment, but not many.\n\nI am certainly going to suggest this film to people I know including people who live on a staple of Hollywood blockbusters and like to keep away from festival films. So if you get the opportunity to watch it, please do.",

      "reviewBody": "There have been five attempts at putting H. Rider Haggard&apos;s novel on the silver screen. Some are good, others better, a few in Black and white with new ones in color, but having seen them all, I conclude, this offering called &quot; King Solomon&apos;s Mines &quot; with Paul Robeson is the best. The early cinematic film is stark, grainy and vastly lacking in panoramic scenery. In addition, it&apos;s cast members are a bit cardboard in nature and the story lacks coherent structure. However, for all it&apos;s shortcomings, Paul Robeson carries the film and more than makes up for it&apos;s early novelty. The simple story is bare bones and tells of an Irishman, Patrick O&apos;Brian (Patrick Sinclair) who learns of a fabulous treasure in the African Mountains and sets out for it, leaving his daughter Anna Lee (Kathleen O&apos;Brian) to chase after him. The famous adventurer Allan Quatermain as played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke reluctantly joins her, Cmdr. John Good (Roland Young), Sir Henry Curtis (John Loder) and returning warrior Umbopa who seeks his rightful place as tribal Chief. The movie is a bit slow but expected for early Hollywood. Some dry humor accompanies the interesting tribal conflict and traditional formula. Despite its failings, the story becomes secondary when privileged to hear the impressive, beautiful bass voice of Paul Robeson. That alone makes this film a Classic. Wonderfully preserved for all audiences. Recommended. ****",

The something, well, it is this slightly morbid, self-conscious and a little mischievous attitude of Austrian actors and directors. There is a saying &quot;The Austrian has a close personal relationship with his pimples&quot;, which must sound quite amusing outside of Austria.\n\nWhile all this adds a certain charm to local productions, c(r)ook fails to deliver it, and that is mainly because of it&apos;s German cast, which -as usual- fails completely to trade on anything that is not German. Moritz Bleibtreu is a welcome change of pace, but all the other Germans, were they really necessary? There is even a cheesy voice-over to camouflage Duringer&apos;s Viennese accent for the German audience, which is so completely annoying that it almost made us quit the movie and leave. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Amusing and fun adventure with Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix fighting Romans in Britain. This was the fourth live-action version of the popular AstÃ©rix &amp; ObÃ©lix comic books . The diminutive Asterix (Edouard Baer who in &apos;Asterix and Cleopatra&apos; played a role called Otis) and his rather larger companion Obelix (Gerard Depardieu) , warriors of the last village in Gaul still free after the Roman invasion, set out on a mission to deliver a barrel of their druid&apos;s famous magic potion to help Asterix&apos;s cousin in Britain fight off the invading Roman army . The year is approximately 50 B. C, Britain is entirely occupied by the Romans commanded by Julius Caesar . Well, not entirely..One small village of indomitable Bretons still holds out against the invaders . And the life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps. Similarly happens on Gaul, where a small village located in Armorica live our friends, the intelligent hero Asterix, the menhir delivery and addicted to wild boar Obelix, the venerable Panoramix with his potion which gives the drinker incredible energy, the majestic,hot-tempered, brave chief of the tribe Abraracourcix... There come a Asterix&apos;s cousin asking for help against Romans. As always the perilous mission is immediately trusted to shrewd and cunning Asterix . Obelix, ready to drop everything and go off on a new adventure with Asterix and this time accompanied by Goudurix (Vincent Lacoste) and Jolitorax (Guillaume Gallienne de la ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise) . Asterix and Obelix then cross the channel to help second-cousin face down Julius Caesar (Fabrici Luchini) and invading Romans . As they set out to deliver a barrel plenty of powerful potion getting superhuman strength and brewed by druid Panoramix . His mission transport it for the Britons and vanquish the invaders ; fighting , as always, against the stupid Romans , pirates and a mean Julius Caesar .\n\nThis is a nice adventure with hilarious moments here and there , and has Asterix and his inseparable friend battling , as usual, against silly Romans . Full of customs critical about actual British way of life and modern anachronisms that&apos;s common thing in comic books . The cartoon movie brilliantly captures the outrageous adventures, tongue-in-check, satire , absurd humour from original story with the same title and drawn by Albert Uderzo and writing credits by Rene Goscinny . Based on RenÃ© Goscinny and Albert Uderzo&apos;s &quot;Asterix in Britain&quot; and &quot;Asterix and the Normans&quot;, both published in 1966 . As usual, on the finale the village people celebrating a wild party and eating boars in a gargantuan lunch . Being an European co-production there appears several known French actors such as Catherine Deneuve as Reine Cordelia , Charlotte Lebon as OphÃ©lia , Dany Boon as TÃªtedepiaf , Jean Rochefort as Lucius Fouinus , GÃ©rard Jugnot as Le Capitaine des pirates ; Spanish players such as Tristan Ulloa , Javivi and Italian such as Luca Zingaretti . \n\nJolly and lively musical score by Klaus Badlet with a catching song on the start and the ending . Colorful cinematography filmed on location in Wicklow Town, County Wicklow, Ireland , England, UK , France , Hungary and Malta . The motion picture was professionally directed by Laurent Tirard . This passable fourth entry shot in live acting was preceded by Â¨Asterix vs CaesarÂ¨ directed by Claude Zidi with Christian Clavier , Robert Benigni , Laetitia Casta , Arielle Dombasle , Â¨Asterix and CleopatraÂ¨ by Alain Chabat with Monica Belucci , Jamel Debbouze ,Claude Rich , Marina Fois , GÃ©rard Darmon and Â¨Asterix and the Olympic GamesÂ¨ by Frederic Forrestier with Clovis Cornillac , Santiago Segura, Monica Cruz , Jean Pierre Castaldia and Janel Debouzze . The film appeal like to Asterix and Obelix fans , it&apos;s a funny entertaining for kids and grown-ups and nostalgics",

      "reviewBody": "Well, it&apos;s a weird movie. That Stephen Gyllenhaal seems to LIKE weirdness, really.\n\nThe fact that the film is billed as a comedy should not be considered an indictment. A film is made because someone decided to try to share this particular story with you--NOT because he wanted to add another movie to some given drawer/shelf in a video rental store, nor because he wanted to make things easy for the marketing department.\n\nI know the film wasn&apos;t well-promoted, but looking at the movie itself, I think it&apos;s actually a pretty innovative piece of work.\n\nWhat really makes the film work is the ambiguity and (ok, I admit it) PARANOIA of it.\n\nIf you&apos;ve found yourself wondering what any particular scene adds to this movie, I fear you&apos;ve fallen victim to lack of imagination. The characters never know &quot;who knows what,&quot; and that is the single most essential premise of the movie. The film uses a far stronger perspective of first-person perspective than such bubble-gum fare as the Matrix. When the hapless dope-growers meet the first distributor they&apos;re looking to do business with, they don&apos;t know whether he&apos;s &quot;in on everything.&quot; When BB Thornton talks to Sienna, he has no idea what SHE knows about the situation...and in fact, no matter how you choose to interpret that particular scene, you really ought to acknowledge that perhaps the &quot;reality&quot; (cinematically speaking) is the complete opposite of what you first thought when you watched it. Almost every meaningful dramatic scene in the film is completely ambiguous in possible interpretation. At least up until the climax.\n\nThis is a film that truly does get better with repeated viewings, IF you have the patience for a movie that doesn&apos;t spell everything out for you. If you want a heavy musical score and a didactic moral &quot;point,&quot; stick with Spielberg. He&apos;ll never disappoint. If you want to WONDER what the characters are really up to in a film, check this one out.\n\nThe cast is terrific, the story is novel if not earthshaking, and the polish and presentation are first-rate. It has a few minor editorial flaws--I could&apos;ve done without Lithgow&apos;s late appearance, or some of the &quot;feel-good&quot; moments laced into the script early on, but I certainly don&apos;t think someone else would have done a better job with the concept and script...unless Kubrick or Fassbinder were still alive.\n\n8.5 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "The entertaining film is about a little village in Western Pomeria, Germany, before WW1. It is based on a novel by Ehm Welk, who wrote it in 1937, despite living under occupational ban by the Nazi government. The story gives a fond insight in the way people lived in the &quot;good old days&quot;, when Germany still was a monarchy under Kaiser Wilhelm. However big politics never reach the remote world of the people in this story. Instead they solve their problems with their own rural politics. The picture of an old tripartite society is painted with a whimsical smile and a dash of anarchism, that adds to the lightness of the subject. Although never leaving the layer of a family movie, that can be watched well during the christmas days, the film accomplishes remarkable depth. It&apos;s emotions range from laughter to crying, presented in an unsentimental brash way. The overall acting is superb, which includes about a dozen children. This film is an underestimated jewel. The older it gets, the more it shows what we lost today: emotions based on real life, instead of the shallow sensations of modern media entetainment.",

He immediately hooks up with his brother to enact violent revenge on the criminals who wronged him.\n\nThis Hong Kong martial arts caper is definitely a superior example of the Chopsocky sub-genre. It has a simple plot-line which is used efficiently to allow for a series of kung-fu encounters to flow together. Like others in its genre the action is fast and furious. But this one really benefits from its contemporary early 70&apos;s setting, giving it quite a bit of extra character nowadays. Similarly, it has a somewhat lively funky soundtrack which enlivens events further and I am also pretty sure that it &apos;borrows&apos; a bit of music from a spaghetti western as well. This one, on the whole, was a very successful and dynamic bit of fun. Its story incorporated a good balance of action with melodrama, while its overall 70&apos;s feel is a definite extra asset nowadays. Good fun.",
