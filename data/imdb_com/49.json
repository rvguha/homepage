      "reviewBody": "Jean Vigo&apos;s 1934 work &quot;L&apos;Atalante&quot; has a very timeless quality about it. It is far more visual than much of the early sound films that were released in America or abroad at the time, and really keeps more with the intensely artistic side of much of the best silent works. My eyes were completely transfixed on the screen the entire time, as I enjoyed the brilliant cinematography and took in the realistic, almost tragic, performances of the leads. Being very low on dialogue, or at least pertinent dialogue, and telling a rather simple story, this film may not be for everyone, but I would certainly highly recommend it for anyone who considers film to be an art form. Sadly Vigo dead within months of the film&apos;s release, and could not create any more masterpieces."

      "reviewBody": "In the beginning we are introduced to a genuine old British aristocratic family: the spoiled, lazy Lady Mary, her quirky father and her younger sister. And, of course, Lady Mary is engaged to another aristocratic parasite, Lord Brockelhurst. And, on the &apos;other side of the fence&apos;, are the servants: butler Crichton, who is secretly in love with Lady Mary (although this is of course &apos;impossible&apos;: you can&apos;t break out of your &apos;caste&apos;...), and maid Tweeny who in turn is in love with Crichton. A typical picture of old aristocratic England...\n\n... Until one day, when the blue-blooded clan starts out on a South Sea cruise - and are stranded there on a lonely island; without luxury, without lodgings, even without food. And NOW it shows WHO is able to survive when being put to the test: Crichton with his energy and inventive spirit soon becomes the leader of the &apos;Swiss Family Robinson&apos;, while Lady Mary, completely helpless on her own, must admit that now HE&apos;s the strong man, HE&apos;s the &apos;King&apos; (he even dreams of being the King of Babylon and she his Christian slave...) - and falls in love with him, while Tweeny jealously has to stand by and watch... BUT if they&apos;ll ever be rescued and return to England, will everything be as it was before?? \n\nThis early work of Cecil B. De Mille already shows pretty clearly his vivid fantasy and love for ancient settings and costumes, as well as his belief in old-fashioned morales and institutions. The best part is, of course, when Crichton becomes the &apos;King&apos;, wild and strong, far away at last from his stiff butler image (Thomas Meighan, with his cocksure and almost a little menacing expression, somehow seems to look here like a kind of Rudolph Valentino 10 years older...), and Lady Mary alias Gloria Swanson, in the new surroundings of the wilderness, at last becomes a REAL woman. But - will it last??",

I didn&apos;t like some of the camera angles and chafed at the dance shots often being too close up to really see what the moves were, but the choices in filming undeniably added to both the realism and the energy of the scenes. \n\nAltho based on a true story, one has to wonder how much was added for dramatic effect. Some of the relationships/developments seem just too trite and stereotyped -- and yet the portrayals are enjoyable enough that ultimately you don&apos;t care. After the number of times audience members laughed or exclaimed over scenes or lines in the movie, I was surprised that they didn&apos;t clap at the end -- it&apos;s that kind of movie. It reminded me of both Strictly Ballroom and Stand and Deliver. You won&apos;t be sorry you&apos;ve seen it.",

I saw it in the Grande Auditorium Lumiere, and, sitting next to me was my secretary. When the film ended, we just sat there and wept. If anyone wants to know what it is like to operate a cinema that seeks to present the cinema as an art, this is it - warts &amp; all! Mastroiani is fabulous as the put upon owner of the cinema. Marina Vlady is enigmatic and voluptuous as his wife and cashier. Massimo Troisi is also superb as the obsessive projectionist.\n\nWhat this film is about is the glory of the cinema and the fickleness of the public. \n\nWhen I retired from my cinema, after 35 years, I showed this as my farewell film. We had almost a full house, and there was barely a dry eye in sight.",

But watching the new one I never got rid of the feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new interpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots, drones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war propaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I liked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the human devilment and the lack of respect of life. That&apos;s why Padilha gives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.\n\nBeside that the pictures, the sound, the music is pretty contemporary. You probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to get the flick done. It won&apos;t become iconic, but it&apos;s the right time for the right message in the right movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Review: 2046 (2004) By Ken Lee\n\nSeveral years in the making and highly anticipated, _2046_ (2004) should pacify director Wong Kar Wai&apos;s fans, at least, for its end-of-an-era feel and look. At its core, this is a decidedly (or deceptively) simple movie, in spite of its fractured and non-linear narrative. It tells the tale of an emotionally wrecked man, Chow Mo Wan (played by Tony Leung), a reprised character from Wong&apos;s critically acclaimed earlier oeuver, _In the Mood for Love (2000)_, and the many beautiful women he keeps and fails to keep, in a time-space continuance that is laden with sepia-tinted memories: a monologue, if you will, of Chow&apos;s torrid love affairs, love spats, and the ensuing heartbreaks resulting, no doubt, from the pangs of a failed liaison Chow is trying to escape. It&apos;d appear that the failed relation with Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) in _In the Mood for Love_, who has a &quot;special appearance&quot; in this film, has changed Chow irrevocably, which is key to understanding Chow&apos;s troubled soul. \n\nBut it is not a sequel necessarily, per se, to _In the Mood for Love_. This film can still be watched on its own, though it&apos;d certainly help if you could link moments in _2046_ to the director&apos;s earlier works, for it&apos;s laden with jumbled continuity (take the character of Lulu, for example, first seen in _Days of Being Wild (1991)_), hidden meanings (read: Neo-Godardian) and other fun stuff, sorta an insider&apos;s joke, if you dig such esoteric things. But I digress. And it&apos;s been said that this is a culmination of all the previous filmic experience of director Wong (bordering on narcissism); hence its &quot;end-of-an-era&quot; feel and look is duly appreciated and a point well taken.\n\nIn _2046_, Chow&apos;s isn&apos;t an easily likable character owing to the frailty and the vagaries of his own personal emotions and peccadilloes, but that makes him only human and real, and his character, believable. Take the following exchange:\n\nSu Lizhen (Gong Li) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): Do you know my past?\n\nProfessional gambler Su (she who is of the same name as that of Maggie&apos;s character in _In the Mood for Love_) asked Chow, dissonantly, questioning the latter essentially whether there is a future for the both of them, if he cannot forget his past. And it&apos;s for the same reason, or so we&apos;re led to believe, that Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) is left devastated, as Chow cannot treat her any differently from the scores of other women he&apos;s seeing; hence eliciting the following memorable line from Bai which I&apos;m sure speaks to most of us one way or another:\n\nBai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): You may not like me. But I&apos;ll like you all the same.\n\nWhat fools we are made by love. :)\n\nContrasting Chow as a man who dwells in the past and in need of closure to move on, Tak (Kimura Takuya) isn&apos;t ambiguous when it comes to matters of the heart. \n\nTak (Kimura Takuya) to Wang Jingwen (Faye Wong): I do not know what your answer may be. (I dread to know.) But I need to know.\n\nHere is a man who is not afraid to love and says his love. And he needs to know if his love is unrequited. And in seeking happiness, the message seems to be that there is no other way. Now why does this remind me of all the sorry tales with which we are all-too-familiar with men-who-cannot-commit-or-decide? :) And so the film is thusly replete with impressions of repeated variations of the same theme: the pointlessness of returning to the past. Which is why we have the following line:\n\nBai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): Why can&apos;t it be like before? (The same reason why nobody returns on the 2046 train, in Chow&apos;s sci-fi novel of the same name. Seen in this light, it is also a double-entendre for director Wong: Why can&apos;t this film be like the one before in the form of _In the Mood for Love_? Where does he go from here?)\n\nThose familiar with Wong&apos;s earlier works will notice his signatures throughout: quick cutting, slow motion, fast motion, freeze frames, black and white, tilt shots, color filters, neon-sign lighting, aided ably by three able cinematographers. Production value of _2046_ is expectedly top-notch. Music by Shigeru Umebayashi is haunting and sets the right mood. Zhang Suping (William Chang Suk Ping) does a wonderful job in creating an enrapturing atmosphere set in the late &apos;60s.\n\nHow great it is, in an otherwise desolate world of unease, vulnerability, hopelessness, and pathos, we have directors such as Wong to feast our senses. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Roger (Jon Heder) is a wimpy parking meter attendant for NYC. After losing his uniform to thieves on the job and being dumped from the big brother program, he is despondent. Add to this his unrequited crush on a beautiful neighbor named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett), and you have a man on the proverbial ropes. However, a well-meaning friend gives him information about a secret class in male self-esteem, run by the harsh Dr. P (Billy Bob Thornton). In class and on outings, Dr. P uses tough tactics to turn his unfortunate students into successful men. But, what happens when Dr. P decides to put the moves on Amanda, after a chance meeting? Does Roger have what it takes to thwart Dr P&apos;s efforts and win Amanda for himself? This is a fairly nice but easily disposable film. Thornton is, of course, a natural choice for the scoundrel teacher and he delivers a good-and-slimy performance. Barrett is beautiful and touching as the love interest, adding greatly to the film&apos;s enjoyment. Heder, although a good comic performer, seems all wrong as a romantic lead. But, perhaps it is a bit refreshing for someone without the knockout good looks to go for broke in the love department. Ben Stiller has a fine cameo as a wacko ex-student of Dr. P. The setting in NYC and the costumes are nice. All in all, the film is a satisfying view for a rainy day. But, it doesn&apos;t seem like a movie that will be remembered or talked about five years down the road.",

      "reviewBody": "Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), The (2011)\n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nMartin (Laurence R. Harvey), a deranged man who was sexually abused by his father, lives his life with his abusive mother who blames him for the father being in prison. Martin, a fan of the film THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, finally reaches his breaking point and begins to pick victims so that he can create his own 12-person centipede. When THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE was released in 2009 it hit with a storm of controversy and it appeared that the film gained a cult following even before it was released. I found the movie to be well-made but found most of the so-called &quot;shock value&quot; to just be hype. I thought the film wasn&apos;t nearly as graphic as the filmmakers would like you to believe and the word around the campfire started to build early for this sequel. All sorts of rumors were leaked onto the net about how shocking this film was going to be so does it succeed or was it just more hype? I&apos;d have to say a little bit of both but there&apos;s no question that this here is a much better movie than the first. With that said, if you&apos;re offended by the subject matter or graphic violence then there&apos;s no purpose to see this thing as no matter how well-made it is you&apos;re not going to make it through. The first portion of the film is going to remind people of ERASERHEAD as we spend most of the time getting to know this Martin character. On one hand you can&apos;t help but feel sorry for the guy due to him being raped by his father and abused by everyone in his life but then again you really can&apos;t forgive anything he&apos;s going to do on his quest. I really thought the first hour of the movie did a great job at building a sick atmosphere and a very surreal one without having to use any gore or violence. I think the sickening atmosphere created was exceptionally strong and it&apos;s do to the visual style and the performance by Harvey. Harvey doesn&apos;t get any dialogue so he&apos;s just acting his gestures, his eyes and his body movement but he certainly reminded me of Peter Lorre and delivered that same type of creepy performance that you&apos;d expect to see from Lorre. I&apos;m not sure if Fritz Lang&apos;s M had any impact on the performance or if the director had it in mind but they are quite similar. The supporting players are fit their parts nicely and that includes Ashlynn Yennie, the actress from the first film who plays herself here. Those wanting the gore and violence won&apos;t be disappointed but this here is pretty much saved for the final half hour of the picture. We get some pretty graphic stuff that I won&apos;t spoil here but if you&apos;re familiar with the original film then it&apos;s pretty much the same stuff only much more brutal. I think the smart thing director Tom Six did with this sequel is that he filmed it in B&amp;W. This is the perfect example of why B&amp;W is such a beautiful format and it shows what you can do with it. The shadows, the perfect lighting and just what it adds to the atmosphere. This film would never have worked in color and I&apos;d even say the mostly silent nature of the picture was another very big benefit. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) is bound to have many curious viewers checking it out and if your stomach can handle the content then you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed."

At one point a stagecoach rides right past a modern car! Every single thing about this film screams &apos;cheap and half-arsed&apos;. Plus, this is from the director who would give us nazisploitation films Achtung! The Desert Tigers and The Beast In Heat, so if you&apos;ve watched them (unlikely) you&apos;ll know what to expect here. \n\nDjango arrives in town just as the most terrible bar fight committed to film is taking place at a local taverna. Some big fellow is throwing people around and while the only other customer is sitting at a table playing cards, Django pitches in and helps the guy. I think most people would have let the bad editing, terrible acting and even worse stunt work help them decide that this film was kack and switch it off, but not me. I&apos;m too dumb for that.\n\nDjango is trying to track down the Cortez brothers for reasons known only to himself while the other guy is also trying to track them down to retrieve gold that has been stolen, not ten seconds after this one of the Cortez brothers turns up, only it&apos;s obvious to all that the dude is a lady (even though this is revealed later, no clear explanation is made for why this is happening in the first place). More crap happens and etc\n\nPish poor in every department, from the aforementioned car in the background to it all looking like it was filmed in someone&apos;s back garden, to the crappy editing to characters seemingly changing position between shots, to the deplorable acting of the captive gringo lady, and worst of all the almost complete lack of gunfights for the entire duration of the film, this is about as bad as spaghetti Westerns get. It&apos;s still better than the Beast in Heat though!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Meatball Machine&quot;\n\nHave you ever wanted to see a film based solely on the positives you created in your own head? Completely ignoring any cinematic standards or any reviews written on the film? Because, of course, your going to believe what you want to believe anyway. This way of thinking is very true in my case and for my latest film review for the Japanese shock film &quot;Meatball Machine&quot;\n\n&apos;Meatball Machine&quot; is another film among the ranks of the Tokyo Gore- splatter film genres, with a pinch of Sci-Fi. I was curiously drawn to the film solely on genre, but more specifically because Japanese Effects Director Yoshihiro Nishimura helms the ever so, not so easily forgotten style of excessive blood, mutations of grandeur and everything perverse his big brain can throw at you. In this case the film is a complete success for it&apos;s costumes and effects. I&apos;ve come to the realization that the best way to judge Nishimura&apos;s FX work is to base it strictly on a physiological basis. If you feel a little queasy or your stomach mildly turns, then the film is usually pretty good. If you experience any worse symptoms then the aforementioned, you better settle in and expect a wild ride.\n\nAs for the remainder of the film.... I&apos;ll get to that a bit later...after the jump!\n\n&quot;Meatball Machine&quot; pits a young machine worker &quot;Yoji&quot; ( Issei Takahashi) as a lonely member of society. He&apos;s not great with the ladies and frequents adult theaters only to receive advancements from a transvestite. When a friend attempts to cheer him up and brings him to a brothel to de-virginize him, he walks out before anything happens.\n\nOn a daily basis he longs across a field at the affection of his desire, a young women, a co-worker whom he cannot muster enough courage to share his feelings.\n\nThis sub-plot plays second fiddle to the meat of the story that explodingly connects a bit later in the film.\n\nJapan has become infested with parasitic alien creatures that inhabit and take control of human hosts, and when one of the host bodies are met face to face with another, a fight to the death ensues...oh and the winner rips out the alien parasite and eats it upon victory (yeah. not a real family friendly film). One of the more eventful scenes in the film is when a alien is found by &quot;Yoji&quot; outside the porn theatre. He brings it home and puts it in his closet. When he invites his affection home with him, it rears it&apos;s ugly head, and horrible scorpion tail, that it inserts inside her vagina, spewing the alien parasite inside her to take control of her. I swear, maybe it was just me, but it looked like she actually took pleasure when that elephants trunk stinger penetrated her Hoo Hoo....eww! This sequence sets off a chain of events that is &quot;Meatball Machine&quot;\n\nCo-Directors Yudai Yamaguchi and Jan&apos;ichi Yamamoto create this concoction based on earlier work written, produced and directed by Yamamoto in 1999. Their science experiment Circa 2005 starts very well- with elements of horrific, excessive gore, violence and welcomed extremism. My first thoughts were &quot; I&apos;m in for gory, gory, goodness&quot;.\n\nLike this head split in two!!!!!( Not the best Photo)\n\nOverall the direction was moderately constructed-Costume and Effects were pleasantly expected. The Writing at times, I felt lacked in originality and direction, at times becoming loose, making the pace and energy of the film misplaced. The love story, sub-plot was refreshingly agreeable for sheer ironic purposes. In conclusion the film is a success for any fan of the Japanese bloody madness genre. A little too weird in subject matter for my taste, but it is worth watching....once!\n\nBruceVain",

      "reviewBody": "Jane Campion&apos;s first feature concerns a pair of girls whose friendship is fading away... and works backwards from there. The reverse chronology comes off as gimmicky and adds very little to the film. It does provide a more upbeat note to end on, but I think it would have been better accomplished via more of a flashback structure. But it works well enough, and the film is quite sweet with some genuine moments. I&apos;d like to think the title has a double meaning, referring not only to Kelly and Louise, but also Louise and her mother, a strong relationship that was enjoyable to watch. The production feels a little flat, but there&apos;s a terrific whimsical sequence near the end, and the performances are endearing. A pretty nice movie, although again I could have done without the gimmicky structure.",

      "reviewBody": "The stronger message in the story here, is how easily the Chinese get taken advantage of. As the adage goes, united we stand and divided we fall. It&apos;s very obvious that given the myriad of Chinese, from the Mainlanders with the different dialect groups to the Taiwanese to the Hong Kongers etc, the immigrants here are shown to exhibit solidarity when they are together, sharing whatever little spoils they have as they build their little community. But quick success would mean the opportunity for corruption to creep in, splitting up the unity established, and spawn plenty of infighting to make the community weak again and ripe for the picking by their enemies. Perhaps in not wanting to acknowledge this issue as highlighted in the film, would have resulted in making Violence an excuse for the Chinese censors to drag their feet in awarding a rating, since they put the people on the whole in some negative light.\n\nOne scene too was reminisce of Bruce Lee&apos;s Fist of Fury, where Lee&apos;s character Chen Zhen rips apart a signboard that says &quot;Sick Man of Asia&quot;. Here, lead actor Jackie Chan tears away a sign that says &quot;No Entry to Chinese&quot;, but this is no action movie for the action star we&apos;re so used to see. In fact, if Shinjuku Incident was a typical Jackie Chan film, then we would see him kick everyone&apos;s rear with nary a scratch to himself. Here he drops his superhuman persona, wanting instead to take on a more dramatic, ordinary role as Steelhead, a simple man from Northeastern China who made his way to Tokyo in order to look for his lost love Xiu Xiu (Xu Jinglei).\n\nHe strikes an unlikely friendship with Japanese police inspector Kitano (Naoto Takenaka in a more dramatic role too, as I associate him with madcap characters he plays in zero-to-hero movies), and works his way around the new environment with the help of Daniel Wu&apos;s cowardly Jie, and with the likes of supporting characters played by Chin Kar Lok and Lam Suet. Together with his Chinese buddies, Steelhead embarks on a life of crime after seeing his lady love had already moved on in life, and a crime he committed back home meant his new one should begin in Japan, hence the desire to achieve instant results. It&apos;s almost quite an insult though to the Japanese&apos;s polite society manners that the Chinese sought to exploit for personal gains.\n\nDerek Yee had fused some realism into his previous triad drama Protégé, and here he does the same in bringing on the Japanese crime lords, where their latest election of a new leader brought about unhappiness amongst the ranks. So the illegal immigrants got embroiled in the new turf war, in order to lead it to the second and very hurried act of witnessing how power could corrupt, especially when the person at the top, steelhead, decides to adopt a nepotistic approach in delegating power to friends out of pity, or out of having to repay favours, and didn&apos;t spell the out-of-bound markers clearly. All this just because of his rebound affection for Fan Bingbing&apos;s bar hostess Lily, who&apos;s severely underused here.\n\nSurprisingly the many subplots cooked up for the film, got let down by the relatively fluffy narrative style. It had wanted to deal with multiple themes (like selfishness, unity, betrayal and doing deeds for the greater good at whatever the costs), but found itself introducing them quite haphazardly, jumping from one point to the other sometimes with disregard to time. While action sequences are very sparse and bordering on shock value with in-your-face type violence, the finale whack-fest brought to mind some Johnnie To classical stand off moments, but unfortunately was let down by the tight shots and poor lighting. And lo and behold, the guilty party in ruining the film experience is the trailer which basically spelt everything out in black and white terms, so if you haven&apos;t seen any clips of the film, don&apos;t.\n\nJackie Chan had limited success in taking on a more dramatic role, and a morally ambiguous character who&apos;s prime motivation may have seemed like a mechiavellian one masked by a very simple exterior, and looked clearly uncomfortable in not being able to unleash his usual repertoire of stunts when surrounded by thugs. Deniel Wu however upstaged Chan with ease with his Jie role, despite having to suffer bad hair days throughout the film with a ridiculous perm, and a Joker-esquire makeup in the latter half. And following the Jackie Chan trend, female characters are little to show for, and here both Xu Jinglei and Fan Bingbing&apos;s characters do nothing more than looking good and offer translator services.\n\nShinjuku Incident is a good effort, but nowhere near the ranks of Derek Yee&apos;s better films. This is not to say that this film is no good, but it could have been much better. A pity too that it had to end with a whimper.",

      "reviewBody": "Monga is directed by Niu Chenze from Taiwan in 2010. This film is based on the mid-1980s in Taiwan as a background. The film related to five young teenagers who just out of school and the experiences of entry the gangsterdom (heishehui). The entire film revolves around brotherhood, interests, fight and conspiracy to develop the story plot. The genre of this film is drama. \n\nThe story start in Taiwan that a place called Manga. A young boy, Zhouyiwen or mosquito, he was a timidity and kind boy; he has been bullied by others since he was little. He has not a father. Because of a drumstick, he met a several young people who living the gangster life. Also because of a drumstick he began his gangster life. They set up a group called Prince Gang. They often fight on the street, visits brothel and receive protection fees from others. As result of Li Zhilong&apos;s father, Geta, is a boss of Temple Front, no one can bully them. As the resentment of elder, they involved in that. Conflict and betrayal leads to them killing each other finally.\n\nI want to analyze two character mosquito and Heshang.The lead character, after met his four buddies, and he thought his life has meaningful suddenly. He thought they save his soul and brought a new world for him. In the film, there are have a one scene that is, when they climbed the wall and play truant go to outside, mosquito looked back and without hesitation to jumped the wall. I t seems tell us he wants to say goodbye to his past. This is my favorite place. He just knows the brotherhood is very important to him. He thought His buddies like his brother. Because of them, his life was becoming exciting even leave school he felt not matter. They protected him at school and celebrate his birthday. They help each other, they together do everything. All this, he was deeply moved by them. Compared with them, he is more innocent and kind. He is more like a follower. Just like the lines of film, &quot;the grass flutters in the same direction as the wind blows&quot;. From this movie we can clearly see that mosquito aspires to paternal love. He was very envy Zhilong has a good father, he saw zhilong with his father sang a song together affectionate, he was touched by this scene. He cried, he hopes he was Zhilong and Geta was his father. Actually, in his heart, he has been thought Geta was his father. At the Temple Front, he saw Geta lying in the pool of blood, he was collapsed. After Geta dead, he replaced Zhilong attended the funeral. These evidences reflect mosquito was much respected Geta although his emotion was humble. He fell in love with Xiaoning, a hooker; he thought he could tell everything to Xiaoning. Particularly, he discovered the real gangster life is terrible, and the cruel ways of punish to others lead to him felt fear and thought of her as refuge.\n\nThe other lead character, Heshang, he was clever, he and Zhilong grew up together, , they have exceeded the feelings between brothers. He knew his father&apos;s hand was cut off by Geta, he decided to revenged. At the same time, his heart was extremely contradictory. In the movie, when he found the missing Zhilong, he embraced him tightly, and he recalled the picture that he killed the Geta. He burst into tears loudly. He was much regretted. All the remorse in his mind is vent out in this moment. In the film&apos;s final, he chose to believe mosquito. Like mosquito said &quot;you thought you goof the gangster life, in fact you goof the friendship and brotherhood&quot;. In fact, all of them are not had gangster life, they trust each other and not leave each other. Heshang&apos;s confusion, helplessness, sadness, and contradiction also are represents the other four. In this film, there are two lines repeated several times. &quot;I only heard of brotherhood, never heard of meaning&quot;. And &quot;If you don&apos;t killed them up today, once day you&apos;ll be killed&quot;. I think these two lines are influences them deeply.\n\nIn this movie, there are two key points which are yo-yo and Sakura. They appeared many times in this movie. Heshang gave the new yo-yo to mosquito; mosquito was moved and takes this everywhere. He often plays yo-yo, Heshang was wounded, he sat on one side and holds yo-yo until he fell asleep. Mosquito make a nightmare, when he woke up the yo-yo on his pillow. They sat on the dam, the yo-yo issued weak light. In the end, mosquito use the line wanted to kill Heshang. It can be said, this yo-yo is witness their friendship breakdown. The other thing is Sakura, the combination of Sakura and blood is special point in the film. Progress to the end of the film, Heshang&apos;s blood spatter in the air and becomes the Sakura, this is mosquito always dreamed of seeing.\n\nAll the character describing is based the story line, on that way; the story has already reflected the characters&apos; temperament, experience, emotion. \n\nIn addition, this film has well reflects the characteristics of Taiwan&apos;s local, exaggerated bright clothes, the Taiwan dialect and some lifestyle about Taiwan. Meanwhile, also reflects their idea is not very open and feudal, because they think the gun is evil and not accept the new culture. The film uses slow motion and soft music to balance the fight scenes, especially, five teenagers caused the fighting of all turfs in Monga.\n\nOverall, Monga has a very strong emotional color. This story is sad and dreary, everyone lose their important emotion. They never have gangster life, they just through the brotherhood to burning their life. This is the confusion of puberty and the pressure of real life to give a special significance.",

Obviously, you dont have to see the Police Story movies in order, because they released them all out of order, going something like 3, 4, 1, 2. I recommend seeing them 4, 1, 3, 2. This one is the best and you should check it out right away!"

Apart from the annoying puppet which moves even when the ventriloquist doesn&apos;t have his hand shoved up it&apos;s behind this is an entirely watchable movie thanks to its lilting melodies and it&apos;s core performances. Preity Zinta&apos;s star was on the rise then and she does an amazing job carrying the film on her shoulders looks gorgeous besides. Rekha is stellar and Mahima lovely despite a grossly undercooked part. The men don&apos;t have much to do which is fine (and refreshing) and despite being woefully regressive in parts I thoroughly enjoyed this rewatch. They don&apos;t make actresses like these 3 anymore that&apos;s for sure.",

This consists of jumping up and down, shouting and singing on the edge of an ocean cliff until someone spots a whale.

One South American rain forest tribe promised to commit mass suicide if a large corporation would not get off their backs. They succeeded &quot;with their singing&quot; according to the movie. They sang a song whose words claimed the world would end if ever the song ended. It eventually did, and the earth carried on.\n\nThey are a brutalised little band.

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It&apos;s a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to &quot;go the distance.&quot;  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky&apos;s life really isn&apos;t anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky&apos;s manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****",

This is probably one of the reasons for the low evaluation. It scratches on the borderline to surrealism, and does so very much on purpose. Office and bank buildings, even court rooms and private houses could have been taken directly from Kafka. I do agree, this is NOT hollywoodian, though fits totally to the plot. Which starts by the dismissal of a leading bank employee after some investment money was found to be embezzled one way or another. While going through harrowing (surrealist or maybe futuristic) employment interviews, the bank employee still tries to prove his innocense, and is much helped by his wife. The music also fits to the almost surreal settings and leaves the end basically open.\n\nIf you go for cinematography, close to surreal, and development (and discovery) of characters, this movie could easily grasp you throughout its length.",

This horror film, full of the kind of touches evident in any Stephen King story, is really much better than these reviews would have you believe.\n\nThe premise, of course, is a silly one--that burying dead animals or human beings in a specially cursed Indian sematary will bring them back to life, deadlier than ever in evil intent. But once you get beyond that, there&apos;s enough fright and scares invoked by the script and by the clever direction of Mary Lambert, particularly in sequences involving Clancy Brown. His return from the grave is marked by some really scary and howlingly funny moments that give the film a sense of life it otherwise would have lacked.\n\nShe has also directed her two youthful protagonists, Edward Furlong and Jason McGuire, in such a manner that she gets skillful performances from them. Furlong has a glowing presence that fits the material beautifully and McGuire has a naturalness that is refreshing and real.\n\nAnd the story actually covers a lot of ground, everything from bad parenting to bullying from one&apos;s peers and lots of revenge motifs that lead to some truly harrowing moments. Alas, it&apos;s true that much of the action has a mean-spirited slant but all of it is somewhat softened by touches of real humor.\n\nWorth a look if you enjoyed the first PET SEMATARY."

The animation used in the dream sequences offers a unique approach, reflecting Sakura&apos;s inner conflict and distancing the film from conventional horror tropes through creative experimentation. This use of animation is particularly striking, given that animation for zombie films are quite rare.\n\nThere were moments when I forgot it was an indie film, thanks to its articulate and beautiful cinematography. The film features inventive angles and transitions, such as a scene where mirrors on side streets reveal a man&apos;s illness before cutting to his transformation into a zombie, or the way sheets flap on the roof when Sakura defends herself from the zombies.\n\nThe pacing demands a certain amount of patience, allowing the suspense to build effectively before delivering the horror. While I wouldn&apos;t necessarily call this a scary film, it is an effective one. It&apos;s more of a coming-of-age story, focusing heavily on Sakura&apos;s journey from aspiring dreamer to survivor. This character-driven approach makes it all the more endearing, providing a depth that many horror films lack, while adding a touch of humor and fun along the way without hindering the overall tone and pace of the story.\n\nAn impressive piece of work by an indie team outside of Hollywood. After seeing this, I&apos;m eagerly anticipating the director&apos;s second film, Effigy.",

      "reviewBody": "Detective. A screen adaptation of the stories of the world famous English writer Arthur Conan Doyle about the incredible adventures of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his notorious companion Dr. Watson. As I wrote earlier, I consider the data of the film adaptation, directed by the talented Soviet director Igor Maslennikov, to be the best. No one can ever surpass them. And here&apos;s my short opinion - The Best Sherlock Holmes. I have no desire to disassemble some of the jambs of this picture, but I will mention them separately. But I will mainly focus on the expressive merits of this masterpiece of Soviet cinema. So, here they are: 1. Atmosphere - as in the first picture, here we have Victorian England in full bloom. Familiar costumes, decorations, furnishings, everything conveys the spirit of this famous era, and immerses the viewer into it. The atmosphere is present here from the first to the last shot. It should be said that in the entire series with the atmosphere - complete order! 2. Detective stories - in the first episode (King of Blackmail), our heroes have to face a notorious scoundrel and scoundrel, and do one little business. In the second (Mortal Combat) they will attack the trail of Professor Moriarty - &quot;Napoleon&quot; of the underworld, and finally in the third (Hunt for the Tiger) they will bring this matter to its logical end. And if the investigations in the first film were entertaining and interesting, then the local ones are full of drama and touching moments, perhaps they are the most emotional in the entire series, may the fans and fans forgive me. In some moments I almost even shed a tear. Of course, I knew the plot twists, because I read books, and the script is as close as possible to the original source, for which thanks to the creators. 3. Music - here the composer Vladimir Dashkevich decided to experiment with compositions, which, firstly, strengthened the atmosphere, and secondly, strengthened the emotional connection with the audience, forcing the latter to worry about the characters. This experiment also amplified the dramatic moments to the highest degree. 4. Humor - there is more of it than the first part, and it is much funnier, especially in the first episode, where our heroes do one thing, resulting in a whole heap of comical situations. In the second and third series, there is practically no humor, and rightly so. 5. Famous cast - for this adaptation Igor Maslennikov invited a whole galaxy of wonderful Soviet actors who know their job very well, so you don&apos;t have to worry about acting. Well, yes, the Soviet Moriarty does not really fit into the book image, well, yes, an antenna is clearly visible on the roof of one of the houses, because the shooting took place in Riga, but these are really trifles that do not spoil the overall picture. A little about the main characters: 1. Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson performed by Vasily Livanov, Vitaly Solomin and Rina Zelena - famous residents of house 221 b on Baker Street. The indefatigable Sherlock Holmes, the cheerful Dr. Watson and the unforgettable Mrs. Hudson are involved in new cases where the stakes have increased, and life itself hangs in the balance. Wonderful actors have returned to their roles - and performed them just great! Bravo! 2. Mycroft Holmes performed by Boris Klyuev is Sherlock&apos;s older brother, who works in high government structures. He has no less inquisitive brain than his younger brother. Staten, dressed with a needle, and Boris is perfect for this role in appearance and character. Bravo! 3. Professor Moriarty performed by Viktor Evgrafov is the leader of a criminal gang and a very dangerous opponent of Sherlock, who has an equally sharp mind. Intemperate, secretive, deadly. As I already wrote, the actor was not chosen very well, but I do not pay attention to this. And in the next part, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson will have to reveal the dark secret of the ancient Baskerville family, but more on that next time. As a result, we have an excellent detective story about the confrontation between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty, with a great atmosphere, music and humor, and especially wonderful acting work.",

      "reviewBody": "The only film I&apos;d seen from director Robert Hartford-Davis prior to seeing this sixties flick was the lamentable &apos;Incense for the Damned&apos;, so as you can imagine; I didn&apos;t go into The Black Torment with the highest of hopes. While this film is hardly a great horror masterpiece, or even one of the best British horrors of the sixties; it&apos;s certainly a good film, and a million times better than Incense for the Damned. The film focuses more on its atmosphere, and Hartford-Davis ensures that the themes of murder and insanity are always bubbling on the surface of the movie. The film gets off to a very slow start, and I wasn&apos;t too impressed with it once the first half hour had elapsed. Luckily, things improve later on, and the first half of the movie merely sets up the basics of the story. We follow Sir Richard Fordyce upon his return home to his eerie mansion along with his new wife, Lady Elizabeth. His first wife killed herself at her home, and the memory still haunts the lord of the manor. Furthermore, his servants believe that he has been present at the mansion prior to his return...\n\nHuge mansion houses are a tried and tested location for horror, and the one in this film works well considering the story. The film is all about atmosphere, and the director does a good job of racking up the tension in an effort to ensure that the endings works as it should. The characters are nothing to write home about, and the script doesn&apos;t do a very good job of balancing them with the plot. The mystery comes about through several small threads, and although the climax is easy to guess; it&apos;s fun getting there. The film benefits from several well worked set pieces, many of which involve the ghost of Sir Richard&apos;s first wife. The Gothic themes provide the film with a dark horror atmosphere and are sure to appeal to fans of gloomy horror. The acting is, like the characters, rather drab; and the unknown British cast don&apos;t do much to grab your attention. It&apos;s clear that Hartford-Davis wanted the film to be more like Roger Corman&apos;s The Fall of the House of Usher, as it features ideas such as a long line of family members, and also sees a scene set in a portrait gallery, much like the Vincent Price classic. Overall, it has to be said that The Black Torment is slightly disappointing; but fans of sixties Gothic are likely to find something to like here.",

      "reviewBody": "MGM certainly used a low budget to make PARADISE FOR THREE, and it shows when it comes to the outdoor winter scenes supposedly taking place on ski slopes at an Alpine resort. The use of process photography for all those mountain tops covered with snow is obvious.\n\nNor did they use a top cast but the results are splendid nevertheless.\n\nAn up and coming Robert Young has the star role of a contest winner who is mistakenly thought to be a millionaire by Herman Bing and Sig Rumann when he arrives at his destination at a swank hotel. He immediately attracts the attention of Mary Astor, hard on her luck as far as money is concerned and looking for an easy catch.\n\nBut the fun begins when Frank Morgan decides to check on how the hotel treats the lower class and finds himself mistaken for a mere contest winner without money. The pretty blond Florence Rice plays his daughter who naturally falls in love with penniless Robert Young, who doesn&apos;t know she&apos;s a rich girl until the final reel.\n\nIt&apos;s predictable and silly, with great support from Edna May Oliver as Morgan&apos;s housekeeper of thirty years who joins the group at the hotel to look out for Morgan&apos;s health and keeps an eye on his &quot;woman trouble&quot; with Astor. She makes the most of an amusing role in true Edna May Oliver fashion.\n\nThis is one that&apos;s little known today. To put it in context, it probably played the lower half of bills in the &quot;double feature&quot; days which is why I call it a programmer. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it&apos;s one of those B-films that surprised audiences by being more entertaining than the main feature, which happened occasionally.",

WH&apos;s performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner&apos;s idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of &apos;I will Always Love You&apos; acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn&apos;t want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would &apos;explain&apos; the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don&apos;t know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner&apos;s last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE."

I find Miikes misogynistic treatment of women disturbing, but interesting. He seems to relish every kick and slap.. but then he relishes the violence wreaked on everyone. It just jars (my Western sensibility ?)so much to see Ishimatsu brutalise his &quot;wife&quot;.\n\nLook out for Miike as the assassin who Ishimatsu knocks out and thereby starts his self-destructing rampage ... and what a scene ! As good as the intro of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;\n\nI may try to find Kinji Fukasaku&apos;s 1975 original which was equally controversial on its release....\n\nAll I can say is move over Coppola and Scorsese.. here comes Miike.."

I can say sadly, it was a bad decision...:( \n\nRóbert Dolák-Saly had his funny and lovely poems as usually and Gálvölgyi had one or two real professional and characteristic movements but the film had no other interesting point. The jokes can be find out easily and they do not seem to be original at all. Some sentences are followed by a gap, obviously to leave some time to laugh loudly. But nobody laughed, there was total silence at the audience.\n\nGoing home we were discussing that it was not only waste of money but it was a waste of time too. It would be a waste of time even in case of a fee-free movie.",

A lot of potential, but not completely wasted. The scrip, including dialog, is rather intelligent. And the smartest thing the film&apos;s creators did was cast Brynner, von Sydow, and Smith (who is one of the most underrated bad guys in Hollywood. I wish Tarantino would rediscover him the way he did Travolta, Keaton, Forster--and just about half the main characters of most of his films, in fact). Perhaps, though, the stars&apos; salaries left little money for sets and costumes, which are pathetic. The lighting is about as atmospheric as a dogfood commercial. Sadly, director Clouse&apos;s usual flair for fight scenes is, with the exception of a couple of nice touches here and there, absent.\n\nInterestingly, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; borrows heavily from this film, from the basic storyline (handful of survivors of apocalypse fighting against one another as a handful of them plot escape) right down to the cauterization-with-torch scene and the island-as-escape-from-wordly-chaos theme.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1866, in the spring of Venice, an underground rebel movement against the Austrian occupation in Italy is getting stronger. The married Countess Livia Serpieri (Alida Valli) sees her cousin challenging the Austrian Lieutenant Franz Mahler (Farley Granger) for a duel in the opera and being arrested and sent to the exile for one year. When she meets Mahler, she first hates him but after a night together walking along the streets in Venice, she falls deeply in love for him, becoming his mistress. When the war starts, she moves to her property in the country missing Mahler. When he visits her during a night, she forgets her principles, decency and betrayals her cause with cruel and tragic consequences.\n\nI am one of the greatest worldwide fans of IMDb, but sometimes I am disappointed with the ranking of this site. How can a masterpiece like &quot;Senso&quot; be out of any worldwide serious list of the top 250 best movies? The &quot;red noble&quot; Luchino Visconti is one of the best directors ever and this masterpiece explores a wonderful, cruel and tragic romance in times of the Italian &quot;El Risorgimento&quot;. Each scene in this movie looks like a picture of the XIX Century, full of details. The cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, with a stunning recreation of a period. The story is fantastic, with a gorgeous Alida Valli in the top of her beauty, and Farley Granger splendid as a scum lover. The restored DVD released in Brasil by Versatil distributor is amazing, full of excellent extras. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Senso  Sedução da Carne&quot; (&quot;Senso  Seduction of the Flesh&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven&apos; marked a new beginning for director David Fincher&apos;s career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt&apos; and `Morgan Freeman&apos; who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that&apos;s its all acting.\n\n David Fincher&apos;s masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it&apos;s one that we don&apos;t all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.\n\nBrad Pitt successfully proves to us that he&apos;s not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.\n\nYou wouldn&apos;t expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it&apos;s perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.\n\nDavid Fincher&apos;s timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.\n\nWe can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",

      "reviewBody": "Two women, one Russian and one Spanish, on vacation in Rome meet up with each other and spend a romantic, sexual and truthful night in a hotel room. \n\nThese two actresses are gorgeous to look at and we get to see them full naked. Yippie right? Hold your horses, this isn&apos;t some kind of porno film, despite what you may think...or hope. Room in Rome is about finding something special and having to let it go. These two ladies find something special in each other, they share secrets, lies, laughter and love with each other, all in one night. \n\nThe entire film has these two ladies fully nude, their conversation is broken up by some random acts of sexual aggravation. The sex scenes aren&apos;t really erotic in anyway. The film to me was more of an homage to the beauty of the female body, since there is no plot what so ever. The film feels a little bit like Lost in Translation, if that took place in Rome, with two females, in one room and were always naked. So that&apos;s what you can expect from this movie.\n\nThe film is shot well and is gorgeous to look at. It helps that the two focal points of the film are beautiful ladies that look stunning and natural. Portions of the film are tedious and some people may doze off if they are expecting some kind of sex romp. I would steer clear of this one if that&apos;s what you are looking for. \n\nRoom in Rome is a film that I could have gone on with my life without seeing. I&apos;m not particularly glad I saw it, it didn&apos;t have any kind of profound effect on me or leave me wanting any kind of resolution for the characters. It&apos;s simply a brief look into their lives, where they put everything on hold and enjoy the moment. \n\nRoom in Rome is about many things, finding yourself and exploration are key elements. One of the characters claims to be straight, yet throws herself onto the other many times. Sexual orientation is brought up many times in this film, but it&apos;s more keen on letting the viewer feel the essence of love between one person and another and not have the issue of gender really get in the way. The two leads were great and believable, bearing themselves completely. It shows trust in the film and the director. \n\nThis is a gorgeous film, but it has many problems. One being that it&apos;s extremely tedious. For those wanting more out of the story, I can tell you to look elsewhere. The story and plot here is thin as paper. At times it feels like it&apos;s going nowhere. Hell, I don&apos;t even think it started anywhere. I can say to myself that I will never watch it again, or feel the need to. Maybe the film isn&apos;t my cup of tea. I can see where the filmmaker wanted to go and I truly believe he accomplished it, but not all accomplishments are great.",

Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.",

      "reviewBody": "Art is beautiful, beautiful as the world outside and the world inside. Such is the case with movies, which is has excelled at a purely imaginative and visual level. A concept is born, yes, but what is more important is that it is fleshed out in grand and spectacular form in uniqueness and inspiration. Art is what an individual expresses in pictures and ideas and imagination. If art is to be fully realized in a bold and grand vision, the creator must take many steps to make sure that it is unique and impressive. It must break new ground with originality and ingenuity, a long and quite arduous task, but grants rewarding results. And with that, a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction is felt heartily within the soul of the creator and as well in the viewer.\n\nMovies are an expression and also an art medium, spanning decades from the 18th century and now in the 21st century. But another medium exists, born from distant lands with a different culture and different view on the take of art. In Japan, anime was born. Anime are cartoons or drawings told in Japanese style with deep and compelling story lines. Since then its popularity has exploded with Western audiences and worldwide. Unlike traditional animation, which caters to American audiences, anime is culturally different in that its characters and style is more centered on drama and dialog rather than on pure action and one-liners.\n\n1999. A year that a remarkable science fiction film graced American and world audiences. That film was The Matrix. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the film was a box-office smash hit and became the most successful film in the genre. It was influenced by anime and comic books as well as philosophy. The nature of the film deals with perceptions of reality and the role in discovering the true nature of the &quot;world&quot;. It also spawned two sequels which expanded the storyline of the Matrix, but never explored the Matrix itself; leading to some criticism from moviegoers and critics alike. However, the Animatrix is a cool gem in itself that more than garners interest in the world of the Matrix.\n\nTold in a series of 9 vignettes, the Animatrix is a new take on the Matrix concept as it explores the back stories of the first film and features new exciting tales for fans of the films and anime lovers. As in the case of the other reviews on this site, no details will be revealed. Just like in the original film, you have to see it for yourself.\n\nTo see the Matrix universe in film version is great but to see it expanded in anime form is simply breathtaking. The visuals are so out of this world and engrossing that you can&apos;t help but be immersed in its world. It is truly something to experience and a sight to behold.\n\nA marvelous way to tell a story from a different artistic perspective. Check it out for yourself and appreciate it all over.",

Wayne had to sell some of his property to make this. Despite of the production problems, Wayne turned out a great movie. I&apos;m not sure how accurate it is, but it&apos;s good enough. It was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and that&apos;s good. Why all the bad critisisim? It could have done worse, and Wayne has turned out movies that are terrible compaired to this. The supporting cast was good and the sound effects were great for it&apos;s time. All of the battle sequences are excellent and Dimitri Tiomkin&apos;s music score is good and was nominated for an Academy Award. Give this movie a look, it&apos;s worth it."

      "reviewBody": "Every few years someone thinks it would be a funny idea to have guys running around in girl&apos;s clothing or vice versa. (Occasionally a Wayans brother (or two) think it would be even funnier if they were also a different race as well as a different gender, but that&apos;s another, sadder story.) Nuns on the Run is most definitely a one-note premise milked dry, but it has enough jokes along the way to make it a worthwhile 90 minutes.\n\nBrian (Eric Idle) and Charlie (Robbie Coltrane) are reluctant robbers who lament the old classy days where violence wasn&apos;t necessary. Their boss Case is a hard nut who favours the new ways – guns n stuff – and the boys are dropped in the sh*t when he discovers that they want out.\n\nSo out of desperation the duo decide to &apos;heist the heisters&apos;, keep the ill gotten gains for themselves and zippedy-skidoo off to Brazil for the remainder of their lives.\n\nThings get complicated when 1/ Brian falls for a ditzy waitress named Faith, and 2/ the re-heist goes awry and they must lie low in the nearest safe place.\n\nOf course this is a nunnery, and despite looking like guys with horrible make up and sounding like guys doing women&apos;s voices badly none of the nuns are nun the wiser or something like that.\n\nWhat ensues is obvious and formulaic – but funny nonetheless.\n\nWe get to see these obvious non-nuns teaching impressionable young girls about religion, (and after phys-ed joining them in the showers!), hear confession, and watch ugly Brian ward off the local horny priest and keep his cover a secret from Faith who has managed to show up at the nunnery.\n\nAs the police, the triads and Case&apos;s gang all search for the boys and their stolen cash even the nuns start getting a little suss as to their true identities.\n\nEric Idle and Robbie Coltrane are both very strong comedic actors, though it must be said some of the bit parts were cast in haste, as some of the acting is quite atrocious.\n\nAll that said the banter is light and humorous and there are some genuine laughs at times. It&apos;s hard not to like Nuns on the Run, it isn&apos;t blasphemous or too racy and for the most part realises it is little more than an innocent flick with no delusions of grandeur.\n\nFinal Rating – 6 / 10. Hard to track down now, and admittedly a one-note flick. But a good one.",

In thrall to vicious gangster Case Casey (Robert Patterson), the duo determines that their next job will be their last. \r\nWhen a large amount of money is extracted from a gang of Hong Kong drug dealers and it falls into the laps of Brian and Charlie, the two take off with the loot, with the Chinese Triads, Casey and the police in relentless pursuit.  \r\nBut after their car inevitably runs out of fuel in front of a convent, Brian and Charlie act quickly to disguise themselves as two of the ugliest nuns imaginable. Passing themselves as nuns from a different order awaiting a missionary assignment, the two &apos;men&apos; enjoy their undercover work amongst the youthful co-eds studying at the school.

      "reviewBody": "Avary&apos;s whole point of this movie is simple: the society is numb. And he does it so perfectly that movie-goers looking for intense action or tears or giggles feel just as numb as the players. The director has done an excellent job here. The characters are without feeling. A rape, a suicide, homosexuality and philandering are all homogenous because this particular society (thank God my college years were not like that)is rapt with the self. That&apos;s the whole point. Nobody notices anything because the director wants you to feel the apathy. You may feel bored, but so are all the characters. However, they&apos;re bored enough to do really, really unbelievable things without a flinch or the bat of a lash. Like it or not, the duty of a director is to make you feel what he wants you to feel. Avary is fleet, decisive and deadly with his arrow (a Cupid for me). I don&apos;t see movies because I have nothing else to do. I want to experience a vision that is not mine. A new one. This movie is fast, it&apos;s hot and, like Pulp Fiction in its time, a totally new way to tell a story. I saw it four times and each time, I released the $8.00 freely. Transparently, it&apos;s not everybody&apos;s movie. But, people should see a movie because it&apos;s a movie and not because it&apos;s something comfortable or familiar or a blockbuster Hollywood coup. Life&apos;s a tough lot, often unforgiving and unfair. There are jerks out there, thank God, who make stuff interesting. I applaud the director always who can put that in my face. Avary simply explains how fortuitous most of us are. It&apos;ll be on my DVD shelf, trust."

      "reviewBody": "I was initially just expecting this 2000 &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; animated movie to be a run-of-the-mill archetypical one in the bunch of all the other animated stories. But still, as I hadn&apos;t already seen it, of course I opted to watch it.\n\nAnd color me impressed. Writers Davis Doi, Glenn Leopold and Lance Falk put together one of the better stories and plots that I have seen in the many, many &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; animated movies that I have seen. I was genuinely surprised with the writing and the plot in &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot;. And I have to admit that I was pleasantly entertained throughout the course of the 74 minutes that the animated movie ran for.\n\nThe voice acting in &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot; was good, though it was not the familiar voices of the more recent animated movies. But there were some familiar voices here and there, with the likes of Frank Welker, Mark Hamill and Kevin Michael Richardson.\n\nThe animation and art style in &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot; is good, and it is the familiar style used in the franchise. So that definitely adds to the overall enjoyment of the animated movie.\n\nIf you enjoy &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; animated movies or series, then you definitely have to sit down and watch the 2000 &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot;. It was nice to see a plot that broke the usual formula with the ending.\n\nMy rating of director Jim Stenstrum&apos;s 2000 animated movie &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot; lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

The &quot;head&quot; is just a &quot;symptom&quot; of the &quot;disease&quot;.\n\nThe difference between the &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; mad scientist movies is the other characters. The poor movie will have the mad scientist simply being a god that no one but a hero and heroine can stand up to.\n\nThis film is a &quot;superior&quot; mad scientist film, because there are many characters who react to the lunatic in their own way.

His friends are all from the same drug-dealing environment, and the police are after him, and his drug-provider is a manipulative man, who has his own problems with the &quot;bigger fish&quot; that are above him, which also effects the life of Can.\n\nThe film didn&apos;t really interest me very much, as it didn&apos;t dig deeper into the mindset and everyday lives of the dealers, and only briefly showed some depth to the characters involved. After seeing the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn&apos;s hardcore &quot;Pusher&quot;-trilogy, this German effort seems almost like an ambitious school-project, that just lacked the budget and/or passion to make it better. It&apos;s a shame, because it seems like the makers really had an important message they wanted to convey, but in the end, it didn&apos;t really come through as strong as they probably would have wanted.\n\nOverall, a decent story for a short feature, but stretched into full feature-film length, it just seems prolonged and gets a bit boring after a while. But still worth a watch if you like social-commentary, and some insight into the lives of young drug-dealers.",

Maybe the best moments are Burgess Meredith as Lemmon&apos;s father, delivering crude old man lines with enough raw disregard for everything to sink a ship. &quot;Did you mounter her?&quot; he asks his elderly son. \n\nObviously a hit enough to lead to &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; two years later, also funny but less fresh. And check out the Meredith outtakes on YouTube--just type his name and look for the &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; clip.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an absolute must for anybody interested in Olmi&apos;s work or in the Italian Renaissance. One of the best Italian productions in years.\n\nAs usual, Olmi concentrates on the grey landscapes of his native Padana plains, engulfed in a swirling fog dominating the human figures which move through it, in an atmosphere of timeless melancholiness. As in its masterpiece, &quot;L&apos;albero degli zoccoli&quot;, Olmi successfully tries to paint a picture of the characters&apos; feelings and strivings through the pitfalls of a difficult existence, devoid of any intrinsec meaning.\n\nDo not misunderstand me - this is none of the pacifist crap fashionable amongst trendy critics and intellectuals. Neither it is a convoluted attempt to convey &quot;profound&quot; sociological or psychoanalytical concepts. That&apos;s why it didn&apos;t win the prize it deserved at Cannes. The film is rather an attempt to represent the reality of human loneliness and meaninglessness within a particular historical setting: that of a time when soldiery was still a &quot;mestiere&quot;, a job, a professional choice devoid of the religious overtones which national myths have impressed on it in later times.\n\nThe Generals of both armies are no heroes, but rather human beings endowed with very human needs - Giovanni writes his loving wife to send him underpants, and his far less loving uncle, the Pope, to send him some money to pay his men. These are poor and humiliated men, fighting in the pope&apos;s behalf, and receiving blessings (instead of money) in exchange. Their one solace through religion consists in the act of burning churches and crosses to warm themselves a little - &quot;That&apos;s the Christ of us poor people, he will help us&quot;, they say finding a huge wooden crucifix, and the face of the Christ being burnt is a testimony to their grieves. But the leader of the German Landsknechten, famous von Freundsberg, is also an old man who, for all his vain ferocity, is forced to go back to Germany after his victory because of his old age and illnesses.\n\nThe peasants fleeing through the fog, or hung by the German troopers, are wistful - more than tragic - elements of an unmoving landscape, mute testimony to the eternal cycles of war, of suffering, of pathetic strives to win victories that will be forgotten one day or week or month later, as new puppets will &quot;strut and fret their hours upon the stage, and then will be heard no more&quot; (from the famous monologue of Macbeth).\n\nA masterpiece from Ermanno Olmi. A film worth seeing wherever you live.",

You get a real sense of the wild west slowly being tamed, of it making the uneasy transition from a violent, lawless land to a reasonably civilized place where law and order stand a chance. I liked Randolph Scott&apos;s metaphor for the town, that it&apos;s like a wild animal that keeps getting kicked, and sooner or later it&apos;s going to do more than just snarl and growl miserably; it&apos;s going to bite back. \n\nScott makes a good, twinkle-eyed loner hero and Angela Lansbury is quite attractive as his leggy showgirl love interest, (though she would begin playing mothers of grown children just a few years later) but their romance is rather obligatory and uninspired. Both the villains are effective, Warner Anderson as the unscrupulous (what else?)womanizing businessman and Michael Pate as the sinister gloved gunman (Lewis seems to have a thing about gunman wearing gloves). Anderson&apos;s line deliveries are extremely flat and matter of fact, which just makes him that much more detestable somehow. He&apos;s like a greed machine, no heart, no emotion whatsoever.\n\nAt first glance this may seem like no more than just another passable western, but it&apos;s got some meat on its bones. And Lewis really shines when it comes to building the suspense leading up to the inevitable bar room showdown between the bad guy and the good.",

Bottom line is... great fun to watch, just don&apos;t take it too seriously.",

The only reviews it shows are journalistic slants by people who generally just refuse the information upon first viewing. My opinion is these people are so caught up in their &apos;psychological conditioniong&apos;, they find it difficult to comprehend so much information which totally rejects what they are used to reading and seeing in the commercial news daily. And they often use language which is difficult for the normal person to understand. Its complete intellectual materialism. These people may boast thorough university educations, but there&apos;s no way you can absorb all the information in &apos;ZI&apos; and &apos;ZII&apos; in one viewing. It requires multiple viewings, which are extermely rewarding.\n\nHaving studied film at university, I personally think Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist Addendum are more important than any other form of media ever produced. By that I mean any film or television show created. Peter Joseph is a Messiah of the 21st Century as he has clearly spent a lot of his own personal time to spread the real message of truth to the people. He doesn&apos;t do it for profit or reward, but simply to inform the people. Kudos"

      "reviewBody": "After a shootout at the common security area at the border of the two Koreas, when two soldiers were murdered, Maj. Sophie E. Jean (Yeong-ae Lee) is assigned by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the incident. The smart Major finds lack of consistency in the statements of the survivors, and in spite of being pressed by her superior, she interviews South Koreans Sgt. Lee Soo-hyeok (Byung-hun Lee) and private Nam Sung-shik (Tae-woo Kim), and the North Korean Sgt. Oh Kyeong-pil (Kang-ho Song), disclosing a tragic story of friendship. In the end, peace and Sgt. Oh are preserved hiding the truth in her report.\n\n&quot;Gongdong Gyeongbi Guyeok JSA&quot; is a magnificent and touching antiwar movie. Directed by Chan-wook Park, the director of the cult &quot;Oldboy&quot;, only now this film was released in Brazil, after the success of &quot;Oldboy&quot;. This movie has a fantastic screenplay that keeps the interest in the impressive story until the very last scene. I was moved with the sad story of friendship between brothers in this polemic theme. The Common Security Area, created on 27 July 1953 with the armistice between the two Koreas after three years of war, and their reunification, seem to be a taboo for these peoples and I appreciate the courage of this group of excellent actors and actress in approaching such theme. In the Extras of the DVD, the cast and director give interviews about the story but never give their opinion about the reunification of these nations. The stunning cinematography and camera work are also very beautiful. My vote is nine.\n\nYitle (Brazil): &quot;Zona de Risco&quot; (&quot;Zone of Risk&quot;)",

It&apos;s my opinion that if you didn&apos;t find it amusing, then its most likely more of a cultural difference than a matter of taste. This type of humor is very common in Slovakia and Romania. I&apos;m saying this as a Slovak-American, someone married to a Romanian, and who lived in Romania for five years.\n\nI also agree with the reviewers who point out this is a post-modernist historical fiction. It&apos;s more of a fantasy than either a horror tale or historical biography.\n\nYes, there are some flaws with the point-of-view at the beginning. The first part was disjointed because it kept switching plot lines and character focus, but the second and third parts worked magically. I&apos;m sure it also seemed complex or confusing if you are not familiar with the inner struggles and politics of the Hungarians, Slovaks, and Romanians at that time. But, I find it interesting and even amusing that the conflicts still continue within these reviews about whose version of history is right (or best) -- the Hungarian Catholics, the Lutherans, the Slovaks, the Romanians in Transylvania, etc. That&apos;s basically the point of the movie! We&apos;ll never know the &quot;truth&quot; unless we could have had some spies there writing it all down in a record that also verified the other evidence. Every noble family and religion in that space has always had political power motives in presenting their own versions of history. It gets so crazy and sad at a point that all you can do is make a joke (like the monks) and try to laugh so you don&apos;t go crazy too.",

      "reviewBody": "After a film student from Ohio (Bacon) wins an award for his short movie at the film institute in Los Angeles, he has to carefully traverse the minefield of the system to get his artistic vision made. JT Walsh plays a manipulative producer and Martin Short a dubious agent.\n\n&quot;The Big Picture&quot; (1989) is an amusing look at the moviemaking process in Hollywood. The humor is mostly droll or quirky and viewers not up on the business might not relate to some of it, which could explain why the flick flopped at the box office. I wouldn&apos;t want to blow time &amp; money on seeing it at the theater, but it works well enough for home viewing on a quiet night or whatever.\n\nWinsome Emily Longstreth stands out on the feminine front as the protagonist&apos;s girlfriend, Susan. She was a minor female sensation at the time who worked with the likes of Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Rob Morrow, Molly Ringwald and James Spader, but she left acting entirely by the early 90s, reportedly falling into substance abuse, mental illness, and living in homeless shelters. It&apos;s rumored she died in early 2015, but factual info is hard to find so I can&apos;t verify this.\n\nTeri Hatcher is notable as wannabe starlet Gretchen; it was her movie debut. Meanwhile Jennifer Jason Leigh is on hand as hipster Lydia while Fran Drescher shows up as the producer&apos;s wife, Polo.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.\n\nGRADE: B-",

The cast is wonderfully chosen and you keep having goosebumps all through the movie. Watched it twice in a row. Wonderful. Seeing the title being classified under sci-fi I was not expecting such a love story behind it. The feeling of insecurity throughout the movie and passion. The constant battle between science and religion shown in a beautiful way. The scenery is perfect well chosen locations. Michael Pitt did a wonderful job in showing a constant battle between his emotions and radical thinking. I love writing reviews but this movie left me into a dark abyss where I don&apos;t know what happens next.",

The film is not completely focused on his character (as in Attila flagello di Dio, Viulentemente mia or other glorious titles), but still we can find in it some of his best gags ever: when he flies out of the hotel&apos;s balcony (...svulazzo!) and when he states he is able to mentally communicate with seafood. The story is about many different unlikely characters that find themselves in the same hotel at the same time (classic setting). The movie is really stupid, and I won&apos;t recommend it to anyone who doesn&apos;t know exactly the kind of movie is gonna watch, but as I previously said, if you love the trash Abatantuono, this is a must. Celentano also plays a precious role as the hotel manager: his silent weird looks fit perfectly with his character. In general I think that underground classics of Italian cinema such as Grand Hotel Excelsior are way too much under estimated, considered too the huge number of fans and real lovers they find amongst the best Italian youth. If you like stupid and dumb movies, watch it!",

      "name": "Acceptable Paella/Spaghetti Western by Alfonso Balcazar , being  compellingly co-produced by Spain/Italy",
      "reviewBody": "Passable Tortilla/Spaghetti Western co-produced between Balcázar Producciones Cinematográficas and Doria . The film packs father-son relationship , violence , thrills , crossfire and turns out to be decent . Afonso Balcazar directs the Spanish Jorge Martin and the German Kinski in this tale of revenge and forgiveness about a bounty hunter named Scott (Klaus Kinski , he steals the show as a relentless Pistolero) who sets out in pursuit an outlaw (Jorge Martin , renamed Trinity in some countries) . As Trinity is a gunman who goes back to his little town he leaved years earlier to find that his wife and children have moved away from his bad reputation . In order to make amends Trinity tries to rekindle their love for his spouse (Marina Malfatti) . As Scott looks for the pursued bandit with a reward on his head . Meantime , Slim (Daniel Martin) and his band rob a bank , but there unfortunately appears Arnold McKinley (Luis Induni) and he his blamed for robbing , being detained by the Sheriff (Gaspar Indio Gonzalez) and led to gallows . The bounty hunter Scott tracks Trinity down and forces him to return to his violent ways in order to protect himself and his family . Meanwhile , Trinity attempts to be accepted by his family that he abandoned years earlier . \n\n¨ Il Ritorno Di Clint Il Solitario &quot; stunningly starred by George Martin who goes back as Clint , an ex-gunslinger desperately wanting to be forgiven his previous crimes and misdemeanours . It is an exciting Chorizo or Tortilla western that contains a story full of violence , good dramatic pace and slick direction . This sequel to the popular spaghetti western &quot;Clint the Stranger&quot; was released four years after the success of the first film and essentially uses the same screenplay . Agreeable Butifarra-Spaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation ; it follows the Sergio Leone wake , including close-up , zooms , choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . All in all, this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one. It&apos;s a two country co-production but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product, though here is developed in violent Spaghetti wake . The film packs action , shootouts , drama , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving , being quite entertaining and approaching increasingly Leone Italian style , but keeping some details that make it special in this particular genre . It&apos;s a thrilling western with spectacular scenes and breathtaking confrontation among protagonist George Martin and heartless enemies as Daniel Martin . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with good actors , technicians, production values and pleasing results . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , George or Jorge Martin is good in his usual tough role , here as Trinity , an ex-gunslinger desperately wanting to be forgiven and unfortunately for him , a ruthless bounty hunter is on his trail. Jorge worked much for Alfonso Balcazar&apos;s factory such as ¨Clint the strange¨, ¨The return the Clint¨, ¨Oeste Nevada Joe¨, Thompson 1880¨ , ¨Taste of killing¨, ¨A pistol for Ringo and this ¨The return of Ringo¨ . Nice acting by always great Klaus Kinski who gives his ordinary twisted acting . One major differences in the plot when compared to the first film is the addition of Klaus Kinski as a ruthless bounty hunter . Kinski performed a lot of Spaghettis as A as Z style . In the film appears familiar faces from Tortilla or Spaghetti Western such as Daniel Martin , Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González , Marina Malfatti , Manuel Muñiz Pajarito , Mara Krupp and Luis Induni . Evocative cinematography by Jaume De Casas , but a correct remastering being necessary . Being mostly filmed in a Western village located in ¨Splugues De Llobregat¨ , it resulted to be the location where were shot lots of Western produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J.J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch, Ignacio F. Iquino , Jose Maria Zabalza and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler , he creates a good scenario . Very enjoyable musical score by maestro Ennio Morricone , including catching leitmotif .\n\n¨Ël Retorno De Clint El Solitario¨ or ¨&quot;A Noose Is Waiting for You Trinity&quot; or &quot;The Return of Clint the Stranger&quot; or &quot;There&apos;s a Noose Waiting for You Trinity!&quot; was professionally directed by Alfonso Balcazar , though with no originality ; he managed to make a fluid and passable SW , though sometimes mediocre . Alfonso alongside his brothers Juan Jose Balcazar and Francisco Balcázar produced and directed a lot of Chorizo or Butifarra Western , most of them starred by Jorge Martin or George Martin , Luis Davila , Daniel Martin or Robert Woods ; such as 1972 The return of Clint , 1972 Judas... ¡Toma Monedas! , 1968 Sartana no Perdone or Sonora , 1967 With Death on Your Back, 1966 Dinamita Jim , 1965 Doc , Manos De Plata , 1965 Viva Carrancho , 1965 Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace . Rating : 5&apos;5/10 . Average though some moments acceptable . If you like traditional Spaghetti westerns remains watchable .",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fine example of the giallo genre. It contains everything you would expect from an Italian horror film like this: Interesting characters, convoluted plot, brutal violence and a fair amount of suspense. The plot, too, is great and is worthy of ol&apos; Hitchcock himself. It begins when giallo regular George Hilton catches a killer in the act of disposing a body. George then blackmails the killer into murdering his wife, all of which goes smoothly. However, the twist comes when a couple of freewheeling kids steal the killer&apos;s car with the wife&apos;s body in the trunk. The killer chases the kids to the beach and then the bloody fun starts.\n\nAs mentioned before, the plot and the many twists it takes, makes this giallo entry a standout in the genre. Then there is the great and creepy performance by Michael Antoine as the mysterious killer ( why was this guy only in two movies?). Most gialli have an unidentified, faceless killer with a secret plan as their antagonist but this movie does just the opposite and benefits from it. The only thing that bothered me about this film was the hideously ugly house George Hilton and his wife lived in, which seemed to made entirely out of yellow plastic. Oh well, I can forgive it because, afterall, the movie, like most gialli, was made in the seventies. Overall, a highly recommended giallo that has everything you could want from this type of movie and more."

What is the connection between these two events? Is there one? &quot;Dark Reel&quot; is a surprisingly good film, with a great ensemble cast and featuring the best work I&apos;ve ever seen out of Tiffany Shepis. I love Shepis in pretty much everything she does, but I really think this one goes above and beyond her normal duties. Along with her, there&apos;s also decent performances from Edward Furlong (who is not aging well), Lance Henriksen (also some of his best work in years), Rena Riffel and Tony Todd.\n\nI found the stand-out performance to be from Jake Grace, who plays the onion-loving pirate Rhett Johnson. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m familiar with any of his other work, but I loved him here. More pirate action, more onions, please! The special effects were good -- quite good -- when it comes to the blood and guts. Some of it didn&apos;t look all that real, but some effects -- such as a sword through the back -- were impressive. Everyone really came together on this film.\n\nNot really sure what to say about this one. It&apos;s just really good. I can&apos;t critique it, because there&apos;s not much to critique, just a a solid horror story from beginning to end with plenty of mystery mixed in (good luck guessing the killer -- I changed my mind multiple times). Hopefully we see more things of this quality from this cast and crew. Oh, and &quot;Gnome Killer 2&quot;? Funniest movie I&apos;ve ever seen!",

A certain change of pace for Nielsen, escaping from his Frank Drebin role from The Naked Gun. Here he plays a foul mouthed, sharp P.I.\n\nAlso starring Patrick Warburton, Vanessa Angel and William Forsythe, CAMOUFLAGE is quite a good film. While most direct to video films are over looked, this one should be seen. A good cast and entertaining scenes make it exceptional."

      "reviewBody": "Post-war classic of German film with Götz George and Juliette Mayniel\n\nThis film drama by Wolfgang Staudte (1906-1984), which premiered at the Berlinale in 1960, is one of the unfortunately somewhat forgotten pearls of the German film industry in the Adenauer era. Wolfgang Staudte, who had already made classics such as &quot;Der Untertan&quot; (1951) with Werner Peters, &quot;Rose Bernd&quot; (1957) with BAFTA nominee Maria Schell and &quot;Rosen für den Staatsanwalt / Roses for the Public Prosecutor&quot; (1959) with Walter Giller, joined in 1956 The two other titans of the German film industry, Harald Braun and Helmut Käutner, who worked together in Freie Filmproduktion GmbH to make socially and historically relevant films such as &quot;Kirmes&quot;. The film was shot in the Scharzfels domain, which belongs to the southern Harz village of Barbis (2600 inhabitants / 319m above sea level), which is now part of the beautiful town of Bad Lauterberg. The studio recordings took place in the Real Film Studios in Hamburg-Wandsbek (today: Studio Hamburg).\n\nWhen a skeleton in a Wehrmacht uniform was found during construction work for a fair in an Eifel village in 1959, those involved at the time remembered a terrible event from the war days of 1944. At that time, the young soldier Robert Mertens (Götz George), who no longer saw any point in fighting against the US soldiers who were only 30 kilometers away, deserted. He seeks protection from his parents (Manja Behrens, Hans Mahnke), from the priest (Fritz Schmiedel) and from a fun-loving French prisoner of war (BERLINALE Silver Bear 1960 for Juliette Mayniel). Nobody has enough courage to help him and stand up for him. When his bombed-out sister-in-law Else (Irmgard Kleber), the widow of his fallen brother, shows up, events come to a head again...\n\nThis film is simply worth seeing! The loving and detailed design is confronted with an extremely bitter plot in which none of the protagonists comes off well. The all too supple Georg Hölchert (Wolfgang Reichmann), who was the local group leader of the NSDAP in 1944, will be the mayor of the village in 1959. Very bitter, but unfortunately true!\n\nThe young (and later EUROPEAN FILM AWARD nominee) Götz George (1938-2016) and the enchanting Juliette Mayniel (1936-2023) shine in the main roles, who also starred alongside Steve Reeves in &quot;La guerra di Troia / The Battle for Troy&quot; (1961) and alongside Bud Spencer in &quot;They Called &quot;Plattfuß&quot; (1973) could be seen. Juliette Mayniel is also the mother of the actor Alessandro Gassman, who is known as one of the hopelessly inferior opponents of the extremely strong beating master Jason Statham in one of the Transporter films. In smaller roles are the very young Hansi Jochmann (born 1953, known as the German voice of Jodie Foster) as the baby Erika and Reidar Müller-Elmau (1933-2003 / as the son of Eberhard Müller-Elmau, part of an acting dynasty and known for the first two films about &quot;The Girls from Immenhof&quot;) as the extremely handsome Lieutenant Wandray.\n\nAn important and definitely worth seeing film, which unfortunately turned out to be not so beneficial for Wolfgang Staudte and his colleagues. In the first half of the 1960s, Real-Film and Europa-Filmverleih went bankrupt along with their film production company. The changed audience interest caused the first wave of bankruptcies and thus, in the medium term, the end of the independent German film industry.",

That dream being that a great series never ruined itself like most do in the genre. At least that&apos;s the way I feel about it. RotLD III features a great story driven by great characters and awesome special effects. And of course, brains. Brian Yuzna (Bride of Re-Animator) is the mastermind behind this end to a great trilogy. J. Trevor Edmond stars as a guy who accidentally kills his girlfriend and uses Trioxin to bring her back. Said girlfriend, played by the awesome Mindy Clarke, makes for an unbelievable appearance by the end of the movie. My only problem with the movie is that it&apos;s missing the claustrophobic elements of the first one until the very end, and what an appropriate ending it is. Gore hounds will love this one. Brainsssssssss! \n\nNote for genre buffs: Look for director Anthony Hickox and Brian &quot;Scuz&quot; Peck, who is featured in the entire trilogy, in cameos."

      "reviewBody": "Does he kill her or does he not? The Last Lullaby from first time feature film director Jeffrey Goodman holds you in suspense in the plot-driven film that has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. His casting is brilliant as Tom Sizemore&apos;s intensity and inner conflicts are so realistic that somehow the viewer finds himself pulling for this hit man. Sizemore&apos;s intensity contrasts perfectly with Sasha Alexander&apos;s vulnerability. His character Price has been hired to kill her, but how can you kill someone who has been a victim for so long? Goodman&apos;s treatment of the narrative by Max Alan Collins and Peter Biegen employs a brilliant combination of non-graphic violence against a pastoral, yet frequently menacing backdrop. His gorgeous panoramic shots contrasted with extreme close-ups is unusual in a film with this size budget. His deliberately slow pace enhances the suspense and is a much needed respite from the noisy,frenetic world in which most of us live. His audio is at the proper decibel level, and his choice and use of music is the best that I have witnessed in any recent film.\n\nI predict great things for this talented director.",

But when i eventually went to see it i must say i was a bit disappointed. I don&apos;t say that the movie was bad ,but the fact that i expected much more from it , make me regard it an average movie. The direction was very poor and the editing unacceptable. The adaption seemed to lack in many ways and Jennifer Jason Leigh was unbearable. But seeing Pfeiffer ang Lange together on screen made me forget everything. These two great actresses proved for once more their talent. When you see them together on screen you forget all the disadvantages the movie has and there&apos;s nowhere else you want to be. They both deserved Oscar nominations and Lange probably the award too. Jason Robards though not as good as in some of his previous roles was great too.",

If you don&apos;t, then you won&apos;t.\n\nCristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who is given a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As any thesp who has &apos;trod the boards&apos; will know, Macbeth is a production that carries a curseand Betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically offing the staff at the theatreand poor Betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer (who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them!).\n\nWith the help of a little girl who crawls through her air-conditioning ducts, her director and agent, and a few ravens who have seen the murderer&apos;s face (!!!), Betty discovers the killer&apos;s identity, and the truth about her mysterious past.\n\nLet&apos;s face it... Opera is one crazy film, with its preposterous plot-turns, convoluted death scenes, and an ending that beggars belief. And whilst director Dario Argento has never been one for, shall we say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so daft, and features so many of his trademark stylish touches (all ramped up to the max), that it&apos;s almost as if, with each successive film, he is seeing what he can get away with (at times almost parodying his earlier work).\n\nThis is exactly why I find the film such fun!!!\n\nArgento&apos;s camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and, in one amazing scene, even swooping around the opera house above the audience; the power of Verdi&apos;s music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of Claudio Simonetti&apos;s score, providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals; and several outstanding set-pieces (featuring Sergio Stivaletti&apos;s nauseating gore FX) go to prove that no-one does death better than Argento (check out one character&apos;s stunning demise, in which a bullet passes through a spy-hole in a door in slow motion, and straight into their eye!).\n\n7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",

      "name": "A lesser entry in the Edgar Wallace series",
      "reviewBody": "Edgar Wallace was a popular British author of crime thrillers during the 1920s. Though Wallace himself died in 1932 ( while working on the screenplay for King Kong ) the popularity of his work spawned a number of films based on his novels. Of particular note is a series of German adaptations by Rialto Films, beginning in 1959 and continuing until 1971, that presented the material with a stylish mix of humor and thrills. While this approach led to some very entertaining films, such as DER HEXER, ZIMMER 13, or ROOM 13, is unfortunately one of the poorer entries, being a very predictable and pedestrian affair.\n\nThe disappointment begins almost immediately. While the ominous sounding title suggests some significant mystery, ( What, Where, is Room 13? ) it is very quickly revealed that room 13 is about as mysterious as room 222. Ten minutes into the film we learn that room 13 is simply the number of a room in the Highlow nightclub where gangster Joe Legge is planning his next heist. The film attempts to present this theft, a train robbery, as a minutely planned Mission: Impossible style caper, but in fact the whole business essentially consists of pulling the train onto a siding and unloading it.\n\nOn the side of the angels is Johnny Gray, played by Wallace series regular Joachim Fuchsberger. Gray is supposedly the greatest private detective in London, which would suggest a marked drop in standards since Sherlock Holmes&apos; day. Gray is brought into the affair by Sir Robert Marney. Legge is threatening that unpleasant things will happen to Marney&apos;s daughter, Denise, unless Sir Robert provides some unspecified assistance with his planned robbery, and Gray is hired to protect her. What follows is rather uninspired business with Johnny Gray doing much running around but not much detecting. Often it seems the only progress that Gray actually makes toward solving the case, is when the heavy handed ineptitude of the thieves pushes him toward the solution.\n\nThe only actual mystery in the film, is the hidden identity of a maniac who likes to slice women&apos;s throats with a straight razor. This subplot seems almost like an afterthought, tacked loosely to the main narrative. Actually it isn&apos;t even really much of a mystery, as the film&apos;s complete lack of subtlety makes the identity of the killer blatantly obvious very early in the film.\n\nThe only real bright spot in the entire production is Eddi Aren&apos;t. Aren&apos;t is usually on hand in the Rialto Wallace films to provide comedy relief and in ZIMMER 13, he has his work cut out for him. As Higgins, a brilliant, if somewhat odd, police scientist, who is madly in love with his lab mannequin, Emily, Aren&apos;t is by far the most interesting thing in the movie. Unfortunately, Aren&apos;t alone simply isn&apos;t enough, and in the end ZIMMER 13, with its night club setting and hip private detective, feels very much like a less than inspired episode of PETER GUNN.\n\nFor fans of the Edgar Wallace mystery thrillers, ZIMMER 13 is available on DVD as part of the Edgar Wallace Collection from Tobis Home Entertainment. This impressive series presents pristine copies of all thirty-three of the Rialto Wallace films in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. Happily, the majority of the DVDs releases in this series feature both German and English audio and subtitle options.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was a visual, character driven movie of superior quality, even for Steven Speilberg. Some say that Speilberg has too much the eye of a child, but I tend to disagree. Too many filmmakers today are producing slick, throw away action flicks that at first seem promising but eventually fall into predictable, fluff and special effects laden, thinly plotted, dialogue-poor, characterless movies that are gone before the popcorn. Yes, this film has a lot of great Special Effects (So did Schindler&apos;s List.) Moreover, a lot of great action to keep the story pace from dragging. The idea of a movie is for the actors and directors to show their stuff (Hopefully around some good writing.) This movie did it for me. I have to agree with all those who praised Christian Bale for his performance in this movie. He was brilliant. In addition, I got to see Ben Stiller in an unusual role for him. I thought that John Malcovitch acted perfectly for this film and yes he was a Han Solo/Indiana Jones character, but with even less depth. His role was pivotal only in so far as it affected the boy. We were not as concerned with his character in so much as his shadow was cast on Jim through out the movie. The war was bigger than this little  boy was and it was exquisitely done. Steven Speilberg gives us wonder, mystery, action, adventure and history in everything he does. He&apos;s the consummate filmmaker."

They move gracefully in formation, and yet when predator comes they sharply turn in packs while still staying in formation. How the fish manage to communicate with each other about which way to swim to is quite amazing, but unfortunately the scientific knowledge is not covered by this documentary. In fact, this documentary is all about visuals, and not much content is in it. It&apos;s not educational enough. I would have liked some education on scientific theories on sardines, as it would have been more intellectually challenging for viewers."

      "reviewBody": "A French chef (a great performance by Pierre Richard) goes to Georgia at the turn of the 20th century to look for new tastes. He meets a woman, they fall in love, he opens a restaurant, and then the Russian Revolution spills into the country. This story is told in flashback as a modern-day art dealer preparing a Pirosmani exhibition reads about his family&apos;s past. A CHEF IN LOVE is the only Georgian film ever nominated for an Oscar, and it&apos;s easy to see why. It has sumptuous photography (by one of the best Georgian cinematographers, Giorgi Beridze) and the sort of historical love story they seem to go to pieces over, yet it also plays everything very safely and forces some notion of &quot;exoticism&quot; on itself while sticking to a plot that feels right at home in the Hollywood cookie factory. I liked it more than the other Djordjadze film I&apos;ve seen, 27 MISSING KISSES, but I found something curiously hollow about the presentation. I also thought the flashback structure was pretty useless, except to introduce a dramatic third-act revelation that anyone who has ever seen a movie will be able to predict within the first five minutes of the film. Still, with so much great footage of Georgia and all the wonderful music and food (this movie made me extremely hungry) and the addition of Richard&apos;s great work, I find it difficult to dislike, and I don&apos;t think it should be avoided, especially when it&apos;s probably easier to find in the USA than any other Georgian film."

While America is being invaded by The Enemy, the President appears on television to assure the nation that the US military is exacting vengeance on Russia - for every atom bomb dropped on the US, three are being dropped on Russia! While this sounds comforting, it merely proves the key to Russia&apos;s success, since the Russians have already transported  everything they&apos;ll need to win the war.  By devoting so much energy to attacking the Russians on their own soil, the US fails to defend itself against the invading Russian army. Apparently national &quot;defense&quot; is an alien concept, for a nation accustomed to fighting its wars overseas.",

Many of these children end up languishing in orphanages or foster care for years, when they could have a perfectly happy and healthy homes with the kind of wonderful gay parents portrayed in this movie.  Laws prohibiting gays from adoption, or de facto discrimination against them in the adoption process, are especially shameful in light of the well-established fact that the majority of child abusers are in fact self-identified heterosexuals, unlike the terrific gay moms and dads in this beautiful movie.\n\nSo, see &quot;Daddy and Papa&quot;, and then make sure to support gay adoption rights in your state!"

      "reviewBody": "Top notch nature-on-the-rampage thriller takes its time getting started, but emerges a real grabber. It&apos;s extremely well directed (by John &quot;Bud&quot; Cardos), with lots of great animal action. It&apos;s solidly acted by a sturdy cast led by the almighty William Shatner. It builds to one hell of an intense &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; style climax, intercut with catastrophic scenes in the local town that makes one wonder how the characters can possibly hope to prevail. The onslaught of ferocious tarantulas is awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Shat, at his charismatic best, plays &quot;Rack&quot; Hansen, amiable small town veterinarian who calls in big city entomologist Diane Ashley (70s B movie hottie Tiffany Bolling) when faced with the death of rancher Walter Colby&apos;s (Woody Strode) prize calf. She realizes that the cause of death was injection of spider venom. Soon scores of tarantulas swarm through the desert, attacking humans and other larger life forms basically because the over use of DDT has eliminated the arachnids&apos; normal food supply.\n\nShatner, Bolling, and the always excellent Strode are well supported by Lieux Dressler, David McLean, Natasha Ryan, Altovise Davis, Marcy Lafferty (Shatners&apos; then-wife, playing his sister- in-law), Roy Engel, and Hoke Howell. The movie is nicely photographed by John Arthur Morrill on picturesque Arizona desert locations. The images of numerous extras covered with tarantulas - and webbing as well - is pretty chilling. There&apos;s a touch of &quot;Jaws&quot; in the screenplay by Richard Robinson and Alan Caillou in that the local mayor (Engel) doesn&apos;t want anything to hurt the success of the county fair going on. And the implications of that final shot are spooky.\n\nA very fine movie of its type.\n\nEight out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Beautifully photographed in glorious black and white, the impressive opening scene features a caravan of horses during a vicious snow storm. One man picks up a foal and during a display of Lawrence of Arabia like nobility carries it on his back for the rest of the way. Finally safe in a East Prussian barn, title character Marion enters and strikes up an immediate friendship with the horse carrier shortly before he dies of exhaustion. WWII is nearly at an end and the red army is coming, so together with her mother Vera and her new foal Prusse, Marion flees to Nedersaksen.\n\n Marion draws the attention of three nasty men (one of them even wears a long leather coat) when she goes swimming in a lake with Prusse. The trio of no good doers take the horse away leading to some highly emotional antics from das mädchen. But in true girlie book fashion, Prusse escapes and runs back home. When the villains follow suit, doctor Meining the veterinary comes to the rescue. Now most reviews and synopsis claim this film concerns a mother and daughter both falling in love with the good doctor. That may sound controversial for it&apos;s time, but is only a tiny part of the big picture. From the first to last shot the emphasis is all on horses. Marion shows far more affection for her beloved Prusse than she does for the doctor, and a love triangle is hardly touched upon, or at least in the version I saw broadcast at 10.30 am.\n\nWarning! From here on only sappy junior romance novel clichees follow.\n\nHerr doctor encourages Marion in her horse riding when assisting him at his practice proves too stressful. Meanwhile he is seen wooing her mother, who has become a wash woman. During her first horse race the girl takes a diving. Here follows a very strange German expressionist sequence: Marion is staring into a lake and falls in, is swept along for what seems like miles while Prusse runs after her until she wakes up on shore. Was it all a nightmare? She takes Prusse to a professional race track but immediately objects to the rough handling he receives from the cocky young jockey. As soon as he gets her into the barn however, he sweeps her off her Prusse. Nothing much else happens except more montages of horse races set to mambo music and a syrupy happy end in which everybody wins (except evil men in leather coats).\n\n4 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "The genre known as the &apos;police procedural&apos; has been around since Wilkie Collins in the late nineteenth century and has reached the heights cinematically with Clouzot&apos;s &apos;Quai des Orfevres&apos; and the &apos;High and Low&apos; of Kurosawa.\n\nWe owe a debt of thanks to brilliant screen writer Michel Audiard, himself no stranger to this type of material, for spotting the potential of John Wainwright&apos;s novel &apos;Brainwash&apos; from 1979. Audiard also contributes dialogue to this adaptation, thereby ensuring that the characters have plenty to say!\n\nWainwright, a private and taciturn Yorkshireman who described himself as a &apos;teller of tales and nothing more&apos;, is, alas, pretty well forgotten now. He acknowledged his admiration for Ed McBain&apos;s &apos;87th Precinct&apos; series whilst the authenticity of the interrogation methods in his books stems from his having been a policeman for over twenty years!\n\nOne of the many joys of French cinema is its emphasis on character rather than plot and here Claude Miller has the golden opportunity of directing his four main protagonists in a confined space. The darkness outside and the rain lashing at the windows merely serve to heighten the tensions.\n\nNeedless to say, a film like this only works if one is absorbed by the characters. How could one fail to be when these are played by Lino Ventura and Guy Marchand as &apos;good&apos; cop and &apos;bad&apos; cop respectively, Michel Serrault as the suspect and Romy Schneider as his wife?\n\nThis is film acting of the highest quality in which the psychological penetration and ever-changing dynamics are utterly riveting. Serrault deservedly picked up a César for his portrayal. He has the showier role of course whilst the customary &apos;little is good, less is better&apos; performance by Ventura is mesmerising. Guy Marchand&apos;s depiction of &apos;brawn over brain&apos; is effective. Romy Schneider once again tugs at the heart strings. Her death the following year and the deep sadness that preceded it, makes her performance, in retrospect, even more touching.\n\nThe ending, for some, is a little too &apos;convenient&apos; but is no less powerful for that.\n\nThe critical and commercial success of this piece gave Claude Miller a much-needed boost as his directorial career had been in the doldrums.\n\nTwenty years were to elapse before Hollywood filmed the obligatory remake. The result wasn&apos;t worth the wait!",

Burt Reynolds was at the top of his game here, before he became a world-wide phenomenon, still had to make his way ACTING. Fernando Lamas was suitably evil as the native general/governor trying to commit genocide on the poor, misunderstood, peaceful Indians. And I have to mention the beauty of the late Soledad Miranda. She brightened the screen in the short time she was on it.",

      "name": "18th Century French Classic Effectively Transposed to Immigrant Kids Today",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Games of Love and Chance (L&apos;Esquive)&quot; is an involving experiment in giving classic French comedy of errors relevance to today, in a dramatic demonstration of &quot;Plus ça change, plus c&apos;est la meme chose&quot; -- the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nWriter/director Abdellatif Kechiche juxtaposes the titular 18th century work by Marivaux with junior high kids in a poor, inner city Arab immigrant neighborhood, for an effect that crosses Larry Clark&apos;s &quot;Kids&quot; with &quot;Mad Hot Ballroom.&quot; Like any period farce, the real relationships are dizzyingly circular: A loves B who loves C who is in disguise with D. A threatens C, B changes places with D to pursue his suit and use Marivaux like Cyrano, C can&apos;t make up her mind, friends of B and C misunderstand everyone, and the course of true love doesn&apos;t run smooth. \n\nWhile marred by wincingly heavy-handed intellectualizing on class social criticism by the literature teacher who is directing the kids in the play and a deus ex machina insertion of biased cops, the frank life and death-ness of adolescent romance strongly comes through in comparison to Marivaux&apos;s mannered floweriness, even as these kids communicate amongst each other with four letter obscenities, bluntly crude slang (that may not be too well represented in the English subtitles but I&apos;m sure French subtitlers likewise have trouble with the patois in movies such as &quot;Four Brothers&quot;), heart-tugging looks of longing, painfully hurt tears, and, finally in frustration, physical action.\n\nIt is not clear if &quot;the blonde&quot; as she is referred to in the English subtitles (played by the excellent Sara Forestier, who seems to have been the only member of the cast with some previous experience before the cameras) is also from an immigrant family or Muslim, or if she just picked up use of a couple of Muslim catch phrases in her slang as to whether Kechiche is adding another layer of social commentary. Or she could just be part of the trend in French cinema to fixate on pouty young blonde temptresses, viz. &quot;La Petite Lili,&quot; &quot;À Tout de Suite (Right Now),&quot; &quot;Lila Says (Lila dit ça).&quot; \n\nThis film has a lot of parallels with &quot;Lila Says (Lila dit ça),&quot; not just about sex and social setting, though it dealt with older kids, but also how literature can be an escapist outlet yet also a threat that brings hidden emotions to the fore. \n\nThe grim mise en scene makes wonderful use of a crowded, high rise neighborhood where the kids hang out chilled because they have little privacy at home, some fathers are in jail, their loving mothers try to keep tabs on them, and cell phones are their expensive lifelines.\n\nWhile the film goes on a bit too long as scenes meander, probably because it isn&apos;t clear how much has been scripted and how much the kids are very effectively improvising particulars around a basic story line, their relationships are enthralling, both the romances and the friendships. Each teen actor creates an indelible and different character.\n\n270 years since Marivaux and the human heart hasn&apos;t changed.",

So nothing has changed, with a slight change of story, where for Benji, it&apos;s true love, as falling in love with Momo&apos;s innocently cute Sister, which his best friend forbids, despite him, being the catalyst, for how this eventuated. But Benji&apos;s love is true, an angle I liked. Again we have a repertoire of rock songs, and again, this isn&apos;t a badly made film, where you feel there&apos;s a more serious film, that want to break out, and I really did like this one. Benji&apos;s cousin is a cute hoot. The climax is quite hairy too. Hold on, but check this Popsicle out. 6.5/10."

      "reviewBody": "Christian Kayßler runs a training school for Luftwaffe fliers. Otto Wernicke is in charge of keeping the machines up to snuff. Both are veterans from the Great War, sloughed off by the Treaty of Versailles, and happy to be back in harness. Their reminiscences and flashbacks provide depth to the story and illustrate the virtues they try to foster without bitterness. Their two best pilots are Heinz Welzel and Hermann Braun. Their friendly competition turns angry, and they crash a plane. Even though they come to a rapprochement and are good friends again, Kayßler grounds them. But when an emergency arises during the Air-Navy wargames, can he win without them?\n\nWhat I&apos;ve described is the sort of movie that might have starred Cagney and O&apos;Brien at Warners, or Chester Morris and Robert Young at MGM, with Lewis Stone as the CO, Wallace Beery in the Wernicke role, all nicely written by Frank Weade. It was a standard sort of movie for the air-minded moviegoer, and it&apos;s a pretty good example. Certainly the big kerfuffle when a bomb gets trapped in the aiming mechanism is exciting and well shot.\n\nWere that it, it would be fine. Being a 21st Century American, I was taken aback by the references to the Fuehrer atop Germany, his planes, his materiel. I have issues with the cult of personality wherever it arises -- I&apos;ve seen it in Soviet films of the era, invisible choruses singing about Stalin Great Blue Sky that reminds me of the phrase &quot;G*d&apos;s Good Green Earth&quot;. In the US, no one ever swore by FDR, although there were plenty of people willing to swear at that man in the White House. The apparent belief in the Great Man that seems to afflict about a quarter of my country fills me with concerns for its future.\n\nWell, perhaps I&apos;m just getting old. Meanwhile, back to this movie: although I have seen its like several times before, it&apos;s a well done example of the sort. Certainly worth your time, if only for the action sequences and Wernicke.",

      "reviewBody": "And by pure horror a mean Thai horror - the master and king and ruler of them all horrors! This movie and/or story is for all you horror and suspense fans. It&apos;s also for all you drama fans and family love fans. And, last but not least: No electric special effects, no animations, only some masks.\n\nThe story is pretty simple. A mid-young (over thirty) husband and father of two moves the family from Bangkok to another city in a nice suburban area called Laddaland. The area is, of course, guarded and fenced - a typical artificial &quot;safe&quot; place.\n\nHe is the only employed member of their family with somehow steady job that allowed him this move in a first place (mortgage,wife not employed anymore).\n\nOne day, brutally mutilated body of a young girl is found in one of the houses in the neighborhood, and soon after that, strange things begin to happen and the story slowly begin to unravel. But, the more we go in to the scary minutes and hours of the movie, the more is the story overflown with personal grief, money problems, job loses, anger, personal depression, lack of acknowledgment and LOVE. We start to see that it&apos;s all just one horror story, here and now, and they are the only ones that can say NO to it.\n\nAnd the less they resist the more they are drawn in to the world of depression, sadness and hate.\n\nAll the ghost that are scaring are just the modern alternative to Zombies:&quot;The ghosts of Capitalism!&quot; As I said, this is a movie that uses RAW power to remind us about the current situation in the world is already exactly like in this movie, except without ghosts. If you don&apos;t call beggars and homeless Ghosts....\n\nI highly, highly recommend it! \n\nPS\n\nIt&apos;s more Drama then Horror ;)",

Confusing and directionless plot, strange characters that appear without warning or purpose no logical connection between scenes...its a mess.\n\nI find it difficult to believe that this film ever saw the big screen. The effects were laughably bad. As far as acting...I caught a little schadenfreude off the quiet desperation of some bit players, particularly the announcer from the final scene. I guess Hollywood has its share of heartbreak.\n\nThis film was a disaster, just a disaster. That sad magic mix of bad and boring. I sat down tonight with a whole pile of Howling sequels.

      "reviewBody": "It is hard to believe it was only eight years ago that this, the last of the Lemmon and Matthau (or Matthau and Lemmon) films was made, and within four years both stars would be gone. One only wishes that their last film together had been more of a success. They had done first rate sequels before with GRUMPIER OLD MEN, but that film had been done within two years of GRUMPY OLD MEN, and a natural momentum carried the stars (and supporting casts) to the finish line. That is not the case with THE ODD COUPLE II. It came out thirty years after the original THE ODD COUPLE, and while they are reunited with the play&apos;s creator (Neil Simon) on the screenplay, the momentum - the push - is lacking.\n\nNot that this is a boring film. Far from it. We always wondered how Oscar Madison and Felix Unger would have behaved as elderly men. Of course, Felix looked like he and Gloria were going to settle their differences and return together in the first play/movie. Indeed, in the television series Tony Randall did get back to his wife. But here it is obvious it did not work at all. Both men have remained divorced, and both men remain essential the same: Felix the compulsively organized neatnik and Oscar the incorrigible slob. They also have given each other a wide birth if possible. But they find themselves drawn back into mutual orbit. Oscar&apos;s son is getting married - and to Felix&apos;s daughter. So the pair are headed for the wedding, and that means jointly showing up.\n\nWhat happens is a series of joint misadventures on the way to the wedding, especially involving two rather fun young women that they meet (Christine Baranski and Jean Smart) with their jealous boyfriends. This leads to several, increasingly odd, run-ins with the sheriff of a small town they can&apos;t seem to successfully leave. Indeed, in one case they get a lift out of town in a beautiful white classic Rolls Royce, which moves more slowly than a pair of people on bicycles.\n\nThe situations are all quite amusing. But the unity of the film is not there - it is like a series of skits involving Felix and Oscar, that are vaguely united because the two characters are familiar to us, and they are supposed to get to the wedding. Still the two stars give it their all, and with Baranski, Smart, and the late Bernard Hughes it works well enough as an entertainment. But for me, the wackiness and variety of OUT TO SEA make that film a better final film for the pair.",

Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man&apos;s struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , What is Love? At every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. The supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon&apos;s decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.",

      "reviewBody": "First, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I loved the whole lot of film quotes and cameos of directors, including a couple of Moretti trademark takes (like the painting of the scenes while dancing). Someone could say before seeing it &quot;Hey, here&apos;s another Michael Moore trying to turn some votes from the conservatives...&quot; but this is TOTALLY wrong. Moretti is above all a director, and you can like him or not, but his movie is something completely different. You will continue to enjoy this movie in 20 years, while apart from some history students, I foresee no such a future for Fahrenheit 9/11... Back to &quot;The Caiman&quot;. This is the first movie ever on such a slippery topic like our beloved Prime Minister (oh, yes, FORMER Prime Minister now...). As many readers may know, he was by far the main actor of Italian politics for nearly 15 years now, and no one dared to take a picture of the Italian society, so widely influenced by him and his TVs (good or bad, doesn&apos;t matter here). Why, you may ask? Because it&apos;s too easy to flatter or offend such a controversial guy; Moretti managed to softly skim over the whole thing, trying to take a picture of Italy in these years... Silvio Orlando&apos;s character voted for him, and he never quite criticizes him; the scenes of the would-be movie are soft, never judging, in some cases even childish. As Moretti said, the aim of the movie is not to let the people know the facts about Berlusconi; they are widely known, even by his supporters. But then it comes to an end. And here is no more softness or light. Orlando manages to have the money to shoot only the end of the movie, here Nanni is the actor interpreting the Caiman. He is impressive, bitter, sharp and his grin is something hard to forget. But, still, he is Him; freed from the restraints of physical similarities, it is the same Moretti we&apos;ve seen as Botero in &quot;Il Portaborse&quot;, only Botero now is not so fictitious or unreal. Botero has become the Caiman.",

Gabin bullying stiffs, steam-rolling credulous dumb guys and charming ladies does not get us a long way when he is just a bum to start with. A colourful, bigger-than-life bum if you will, but a bum all the same who does not aim to get anywhere and actually gets us nowhere.\n\nThat is the kind of movie that feels like a scam: you were naive enough to be lured to watch it. Worst of all it stood as a full train of free ammunition for the New Wave types, who did not even need the usual bad faith jeers to mock the total lack of a creative endeavour there.",

      "name": "Comical Paella/Spaghetti/Butifarra Western co-produced by Spain/Italy , being regularly directed by Alfonso Balcazar,",
      "reviewBody": "In the beginning we are then introduced to our stalwart heroes from title role at a Cantina , there arrives Sacramento (Michael Forest) and , subsequently , a hunk man dressed in priest clothes called Jim (Fernando Bilbao or Fred Harrison) , there takes place the first brawls , punches , hits , slaps and kick-asses . Later on , on a train appears two bands attempting to rob a shipment of money from settlers , the first band is formed by Sacramento , Jim , and the Mexican Tequila (Luigi Bonos) and the second one led by an outfit of hoodlums (César Ojinaga , among others) hired by a nasty banker . But the protagonist trio get the robbed money . This crafty banker (Antonio Molino Rojo) then decides that he wants to get his hands on the money also and hires a bunch of bandits headed by Tony (Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González) and rob it back . As Jim and his pals arrive in the small town , they are targeted by a the second outfit of robbers led by the astute banker . After getting away from unethical banker &amp; his gang , they meet and help a group of women settlers led by the beautiful Jenny Mckinley (Malisa Longo) . Along the way, they face off new thieves , double-crosses , tramplers and a lot of twists and turns until an explosive final where is exploded : General supplies , Saloon ,livery stable , wall paper merchandise , dressmaker , General store , and other shops and buildings . \n\nAverage and hilarious tortilla Western in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style in which three drifters carry out several adventures , aboard a train , saloon brawls and resolve a conflict among nasty robbers that want to take an amount of money . All in all , this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one . It&apos;s a two country co-production but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product , though this &quot;Now They Call Him Sacramento&quot; has penchant for hilarious happenings , as if you like comical westerns remains lightly watchable . &quot;I Bandoleros Della Dodicesima Ora&quot; or ¨Le Llamban Calamidad¨ starts off with a colorful opening credits with Sacramento/Michael Forest attempting to tame his horse , it tends to center on the protagonists , likable Michael Forest , brawler Fernando Bilbao and sexy female cast member , Malisa Longo . Mediocre Butifarra Western realized in laughable style with a screenplay written by Giovanni Simonelli and the same filmmaker Alfonso Balcazar , including amusing dialogue , silly situations , plot twists and turns . Italian-Spanish co-production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , action , exaggerated characters , crossfire and lots of shots and fights . The film packs comical elements , tongue-in-cheek , thrills , shootouts , brawls , and results to be quite entertaining . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with ordinary actors , technicians , decent production values and average results . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . It&apos;s an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between starring Michael Forest/Fernando Bilbao and his enemies , adding some thrilling scenes when takes place the small town destruction with plenty of explosions . In fact , ¨Le Llamaban Calamidad¨ can be considered the ¨swan-song¨ of the Paella/Tortilla or Chorizo Western , that&apos;s why the Western town in ¨Spugles De Llobregat¨ where during the 60s and70s had been shot hundreds of Westerns was really destroyed by blowing ups seen in the film , as producer/director Balcazar went to bankrupt and had to sell the terrains . The cast and support cast are passable . As sympathetic acting by starring quartet . Furthermore , there appears ordinary secondaries of Spaghetti/Paella Western , as Spanish players : Antonio Molino Rojo , Manuel Muñiz ¨Pajarito¨, Cesar Ojinaga , among others . \n\nThe picture being regularly photographed by Jaime Deu Casas , though is necessary a fine remastering because the film-copy is washed-out . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga , (Huesca) , similar to Almeria , and a Western village located in ¨Spugles De Llobregat¨ , it resulted to be the location where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J.J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch , Xavier Marchal , Manuel Esteba , Ignacio F. Iquino , and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the Fraga landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and adequate production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler , he creates an acceptable scenario . Anti-climatic musical score by Willy Brezza in Guido and Maurizio De Angelis wake . \n\nThis motion picture was middleingly directed by Alfonso Balcazar , and with no originality ; he managed to make a fluid and filled with punches as well as fighting Western , though mediocre . Alfonso alongside his brothers Juan Jose Balcazar and Francisco Balcázar produced and directed a lot of Chorizo or Butifarra Western , most of them starred by Jorge Martin or George Martin , Luis Davila , Daniel Martin or Robert Woods ; such as 1972 The return of Clint , 1972 Judas... ¡Toma Monedas! , 1968 Sartana no Perdone or Sonora , 1967 With Death on Your Back, 1966 Dinamita Jim , 1965 Doc , Manos De Plata , 1965 Viva Carrancho , 1965 Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace .

      "reviewBody": "We have been conditioned as a culture to believe that happiness lies in an ideal, future state. For example, we think it will all turn out when we finish school, when we get a job, when we get married, when we have children, then when we get divorced, or when we retire. It is always something or someplace more, better, or different but the more things change, the more they seem to remain the same. In Summer, aka The Green Ray, one of Eric Rohmer&apos;s most insightful and charming films, Delphine (Marie Riviere) is a young, intelligent, and good-looking Parisian secretary who has spent her life looking for &quot;Mr Right&quot;. Like many who spend their life &quot;searching&quot;, she is a perfectionist who keeps people away by maintaining impossible standards, then feels inadequate and unloved when things do not work out. She is interesting rather than interested.\n\nWhen vacation time comes, her girlfriend goes to Greece with a boyfriend and she is left alone and feeling rejected. Turning down an offer to visit Ireland with her sister&apos;s family, she decides to take a trip to Cherbourg with a friend and her boyfriend, and does her best to fit in but it only leads to more frustration. After her friends prepare an elaborate dinner she tells them that she doesn&apos;t meat, seafood, or eggs and prefers vegetables like lettuce because they make her feel &quot;light&quot;. She won&apos;t go sailing because it makes her seasick and she refuses a gift of apple blossoms because she thinks it&apos;s wrong to tear such large branches from trees. Rohmer impeccably captures Delphine&apos;s intense loneliness, a feeling of isolation that is even more pronounced when the people around you are doing what they think will make you happy. Near tears, she returns to Paris after only a few days in Cherbourg, then visits the Alps thinking she will go mountain climbing but she stays only one day.\n\nWhen Delphine borrows a friend&apos;s apartment in Biarritz, however, she does settle down long enough to unpack. In Biarritz, the story is pretty much the same, however. Delphine says that she wants to meet people but when the opportunity arises in the form of two young men and Lena (Carita), a young Swedish blond, she runs the other way, although from all indications, leaving seems to be the most sensible option. Lena advises her to play cat and mouse with men. &quot;It&apos;s like a card game&quot;, she says, &quot;you can&apos;t reveal your hand right off&quot;. Delphine uses this piece of advice as another reason for beating herself up. &quot;My hand is empty&quot;, she declares.\n\nDelphine doesn&apos;t seem to believe in much, but, like many lonely people, she looks for signs that things are going to turn out all right. She is fascinated with playing cards and when she finds a green card lying in the street, she knows that green is her color of destiny for this year. While strolling the beach at Biarritz she overhears a conversation about a Jules Verne novel about an atmospheric phenomenon known as the Green Ray and she is mesmerized. According to Verne, just before the sun sets below the horizon, if you can see a burst of green light, it will help allow you gain an insight into your true self.\n\nA synopsis of the plot, however, tells us little about what actually goes on in this mostly improvised film. Like most Rohmer works, what happens in the silences is more revealing than in the conversations. An entire world is written in the gestures, the facial expressions, and the nuances that reveal each character&apos;s personality. Summer is an intimate story of a woman&apos;s loneliness that rings true and brought back a flood of painful memories for me. Delphine, for all her warts, is very human. Somewhere up ahead always looks better than right here. When she can open herself up to the perfection of the moment, however, she becomes directly present to the world and can share its ineffable beauty.",

In this movie many important events happen that push the story forward but i don&apos;t want to give out spoilers.This is an enjoyable movie,good-looking and lighter in dramatic style than the previous 2 parts.",

Don&apos;t expect any answers to that question in The Fury of the Karate Experts, which, being a Santo movie, features very little in the way of karate, the fighting mostly being of the crap Mexican wrestling variety (even more crap than usual, this being the ageing Santo&apos;s cinematic swan-song).\n\nLegendary luchador Santo plays &apos;the faceless one&apos;, who, accompanied by his friend Cliff (Carlos Suárez), parachutes into the jungle home of buxom beauty Queria to attend the wedding of Prince Ching Ka (Steve Cheng) and the mysterious blonde woman known only as &apos;the jungle girl&apos;. However, the ceremony doesn&apos;t go quite as planned when Kungyan (Grace Renat), the evil and equally stacked twin sister of Queria, puts into motion several dastardly plans with the help of her golden masked henchman (Tinieblas), her aim being to take the jungle girl&apos;s magical &apos;star power&apos; for herself.\n\nAbsolute z-grade trash from start to finish, The Fury of the Karate Experts is, by my reckoning, 60% scantily clad Kungyan gyrating her ass and jiggling her boobs to jungle rhythms, 20% bandana-wearing natives playing bongos in the bushes, 15% badly choreographed fighting, and 5% assorted tosh involving an elderly scientist (played by Mexican B-movie director René Cardona) and his daughter, a man/monster with patchy fur, and several killer gorillas (men in cheap and unconvincing ape costumes). Even by Santo standards, this one is bad, but not bad in a good way -- even Renat shaking her impressive assets at the camera becomes boring after a while.",

      "reviewBody": "French films are famous for their depiction of minor incidents which converge at a larger point to make up the most of what happens in the lives of people. This helps viewers to have a better idea of protagonists&apos; lives. French director Claude Sautet chose to base his film on this premise as he films the personal as well as professional lives of a successful yet unhappy man. From a career point of view, actor Michel Piccoli is shown as somebody doing well in life as he is appreciated by everybody around him. However, his personal life is in turmoil as he is unable to decide between his wife and his mistress. As he is about to solve this dilemma, a tragedy unfolds in his life. This is hardly the description of an original story but what makes the film interesting is how it has been shot. Apart from describing in detail minor incidents related to the lives of protagonists, Claude Sautet has used all his imagination to film the accident scene which occupies a large part of this film&apos;s screen space. Finally, once the film is over, some viewers might be tempted to call it the most important moment of the film.",

His wife has died just before the end of the war. His older son lives modestly with his wife in a small apartment. The widower and five of his classmates from middle-school hold regular reunions at a restaurant. They remember their old times and having fun with good food and drink. One of his friends has found a good opportunity for his daughter. She takes care of the housework, drunken father and younger brother. After a few events, the old man recognizes his own selfishness in keeping his daughter at home to look after him, and decides to arrange a marriage for her...\n\nMr. Ozu has made another family drama that touches the soul. He examines topics related to a family, loneliness, alcoholism, marriage, through relationships between parents and children. His emotional space is narrowed to everyday life, in which a thin line separates the joy and the sorrow. He points to the transience of life through a family melodrama.\n\nThe scenery is almost closed and spatially confined, that suggesting a monotonous daily routine. The characterization is excellent.\n\nChishū Ryū as Shūhei Hirayama is a reserved and quiet old man who finds moments of his happiness in having fun, alcohol and beautiful owner of a bar. He skillfully hiding his inner emotion. He has tried to resist the transience of life, of course, to no avail. Shima Iwashita as Michiko Hirayama is his devoted daughter. She is aware of her situation, but unhappy at leaving his father and brother. Keiji Sada (Kōichi Hirayama) and Mariko Okada (Akiko Hirayama) are very entertaining as a quarrelsome couple, which is burdened with a material world. \n\nAnyway, life goes on.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, welcome to another cheerfully inept Bert I. Gordon (B.I.G) Sci-Fi/horror romp, in which the silliness usually triumphs over adequate scripting and where the special effects look cheaper than half a handful of pennies. &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; is a thoroughly shameless cash-in on the success of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, but in this light-headed story there&apos;s no room for building up claustrophobic atmosphere, let alone the preaching of philosophical messages. It&apos;s a fun and charming little movie, but totally lacking depth, credibility and a proper elaboration of the basic premise. John Hoyt stars as a brilliant doll maker slash inventor of shrinking equipment (rather unusual combination, but okay), but he&apos;s very lonely and emotionally frustrated since his beloved wife walked out on him once, several years ago. So now, he uses his magic, invisible ray projecting devise to miniaturize the people he risks losing, like his cute secretary Sally and her fiancé Bob. Mr. Franz keeps his little friends asleep in tubes, but also does his best to entertain them with tiny dance parties, the newest Barbie &amp; Ken outfits and even trips to the &apos;Jekyl &amp; Hyde&apos; marionette-theater. The &apos;attack&apos; referred to in the title is quite inaccurate, as the little folks don&apos;t attack anyone (with the exception of a lifeless Dr. Jekyll marionette) but they do want to escape and regain their normal previous measurements. &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; is a fairly forgettable and poor film, but it&apos;s slightly better and more stylish than most of the things B.I.G accomplished and at least it&apos;s never boring. Hoyt is fine as the pitiable &amp; awkward old toymaker, but the supportive cast is too underdeveloped and bleak. If anything, this is an insignificant but pleasant 50&apos;s gem with some funny highlights, like the marionette-fight and one of the shrunken gals quacking the cheesy theme song &quot;I&apos;m your living Doll&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "When a fortified city is taken from its rightful ruler while he is away he hires mercenaries to help retake it. I promises that they can have twenty four hours to loot as the please but once they are victorious he betrays them; ordering them to disarm and leave any treasure they have found. Soon afterwards the departing mercenaries discover a statue of St Martin and take it as a sign that their leader, also called Martin will make them rich. Not long after this they meet the man who betrayed them and make off with wagons loaded with valuables... and Agnes, the young woman promised to his son Steven. The mercenaries rape her but soon it becomes clear that Martin wants her for himself; especially after she helps him seize a castle which the mercenaries use as their new home. Of course things are far from over and they will have to contend with attacks from opposing forces and an outbreak of the plague!\n\nIf you have seen other films from director Paul Verhoeven you will have an idea of what to expect; violence, sex and nudity. While this means it won&apos;t appeal to everybody it didn&apos;t feel overly gratuitous. The film captures the filth and unpleasantness of the era in a way that might feel familiar to people watching things like &apos;Game of Thrones&apos; now but would have been unusual at a time when things were far more sanitised. Our protagonists are more morally ambiguous than one expect; Martin is far from heroic as he forces himself onto Agnes and later she shows a cunning side as she appears to fall in love with him but doesn&apos;t forget Steven... one feels she will do what it takes to survive in the least unpleasant way possible. Rutger Hauer impresses as Martin and Jennifer Jason Leigh does a solid job as Agnes. The supporting cast are pretty good too. The action scenes are suitably gritty with many characters getting killed in ways that aren&apos;t swift and painless. One or two of these deaths are also quite inventive thanks to Steven&apos;s scientific approach to warfare. Overall one for fans of the genre who don&apos;t like things overly sanitised.",

It is a rip-off of THE STING, to be sure, and if there is one problem, it is that the depicted scams are so complex it may take more than one viewing to completely decipher the plot (and yes, I took the time to do just that). Bud Spencer&apos;s fans have a head start on this film, but you don&apos;t have to be a fan to get into it. Charlston isn&apos;t a classic, but it is a pleasant way to kill 90 minutes, if you can find it. It seems to have done a vanishing act in America in recent years, which is too bad. A good film; a nice little film."

      "reviewBody": "The Lone Defender finds Rin Tin Tin the canine hero of another serial where he unmasks the murderer of his blind prospector master and saves the mine for his daughter. In normal cases the dog would have been shot as well.\n\nBut villain Lee Shumway is a craftier villain than that. He realizes that the dog just might be the only one who can lead the bad guys to the mine and stake a proper claim before the daughter June Marlowe can do it. So a good deal of the elaborate schemes are into capturing Rin Tin Tin. Shumway&apos;s cause isn&apos;t help by the necessary presence of henchman Bob Kortman who did the actual killing of Marlowe&apos;s father. Rinty has a natural positive dislike for this man and the feeling is mutual.\n\nAiding and abetting Marlowe in her pursuit of justice is the mysterious Mexican Walter Miller who has let it get around that he&apos;s the notorious outlaw, the Cactus Kid. Also helping is young Buzz Barton who in real life was a trick rider and starred in a number of westerns for the younger folks at this time.\n\nThe Lone Defender is yet another of these serials which take the plot of what could be a decent B film and stretch it into excruciating lengths. That&apos;s why they only showed them one chapter at a time.",

      "reviewBody": "When I picked up &quot;Una gota de sangre para morir amando&quot; (called &quot;Murder in a Blue World&quot; in English), I think that the box loosely said something about it being a Spanish &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. It turns out that the movie is a total rip-off of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (to the point where they even mention &quot;ACO&quot; in a scene right before a motorcycle gang attacks). The main plot has young nurse Sue Lyon luring men to their dooms...just for the hell of it, apparently. What makes this world so blue?! Aside from the plot, the other Kubrick connection is &quot;Lolita&quot;. There&apos;s of course the ex-nymphet Sue Lyon, but one scene even shows a person holding Vladimir Nabokov&apos;s novel! For the most part, it wouldn&apos;t be fair to compare this movie to any of Kubrick&apos;s movies. It&apos;s an OK way to pass time. The only real downside is that Sue Lyon doesn&apos;t do any full frontal nude scenes (in this sort of movie, she should have). Also starring Chris Mitchum (Robert&apos;s son).",

      "reviewBody": "Unlike many of Hollywood&apos;s reimaginings of fairy tales, this film is actually decent. One can let children watch this in the same manner our grandparents were reading the original stories. It has morals, it is pretty, actors play well and, most of all, it is not condescendingly stupid. Instead, one can actually enjoy this on almost all levels.\n\nIt was funny to see actors Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner play in a film together again (Rents and Spud), but they had no real interaction. Nicholas Hoult was OK as the hero of the story and Stanley Tucci, as usual, a great villain. The one that was rather disappointing was the princess, clearly a role that was not really thought out much more than &quot;cute damsel in distress, ready for the rescue&quot;. Her father wasn&apos;t much either, but at least he had lines. Also, for a movie &quot;made in USA&quot; a great many English actors. Even the story was set in England, as we see in the end.\n\nBottom line: while not the best movie ever, it was certainly an entertaining blockbuster that retained a lot of the feel and plot of the original fairy tale. It also manages to have an insane body count without actually showing any blood. The US rating system is idiotic for sure. Anyway, the movie was fun. I can recommend it for an easy watch.",

When I played the Swedish-language versions (nope, I don&apos;t understand absolutely any Swedish word), I heard they said Madicken instead of Madita, even though the titles said Madita (although I noticed these titles were added up by hand by the Germans). But the cast listing on the credits was unaltered by the Germans, and it said Madicken. So how did it translate as Madita in Germany? Since I don&apos;t understand Swedish, I can&apos;t exactly tell what were they about, and my German is just a beginner&apos;s German, so I might not anyway understand them all until I hone my college German... This one is appropriate for all families, including American ones (since this second movie has no nudity of any kind as it happens with the first one...)",

Internal Affairs is an entertaining and interesting movie, and if you liked Q&amp;A and The French Connection, you will enjoy it!"

Unknown to him, a bunch of German skinheads (with authentic American accents) sneak onto the train.\n\nWhile the above excitement is going on, a parallel story of a beautiful woman with a young daughter, and a white haired stranger hovering around in the background (played by Malcolm McDowell, doing his best to look extremely intense).\n\nI didn&apos;t know what to make of this film. From the cinematography I had assumed that this film was shot in the late 80s (actually 1993 - one year prior to Hugh Grants success in Four Weddings and a Funeral). The plot was non-sensical, the direction was non-existent, and at the end of it I had no idea where the time had gone, or what I had just seen.",

      "reviewBody": "Take two large tablespoons of Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo with a sliver of Bernard Blier, add exotic location, mix with writer Michel Audiard and sprinkle with composer Georges Delerue and you should have a recipe for success. That is certainly the case here as this film of Henri Verneuil became one of the biggest box office hits of 1964 despite generally negative reviews.\n\nMessieurs Ventura and Belmondo had certainly gelled in &apos;Classe toutes Risques&apos; four years earlier and by the time they made this they were riding high in the popularity stakes. Belmondo also scored a hit during the same year with &apos;That Man from Rio&apos;. Bernard Blier, father of director Bertrand, is always good value and with the help of Michel Audiard&apos;s dialogue, effortlessly steals his scenes. The quartet is completed by a plank named Reginald Kernan. The female interest is supplied by Andrea Parisy and Anne-Marie Coffinet who are required to be little more than eye candy.\n\nAfter a rather slow opening with a lot of mucho macho posturing the film gradually builds momentum and although the chase sequences are vaguely reminiscent of &apos;Les Salaires de la Peur&apos;, there is neither the tension nor the subtle characterisation of Clouzot&apos;s film.\n\nThe cinematography in Franscope by Marcel Grignon takes full advantage of the arid, rocky landscape and Verneuil shows his customary slick direction and technical expertise. The film is inclined to meander and is a wee bit long but the charismatic leads keep one watching.\n\nSurprisingly it was entered at Cannes but considering some of the competition that year it was hardly likely to win. The film&apos;s colonial stance and its attitude towards the female of the species is likely to raise a few eyebrows these days but it is what it is: an entertaining period piece. The &apos;brawn over brain&apos; element is of course, timeless!\n\nHenri Verneuil is reported to have said that in this &apos;the trucks are the stars&apos;. That might have been his intention but as far as this viewer is concerned Messieurs Ventura, Belmondo and Blier win on points!",

      "reviewBody": "It is to be regretted that one of Germany&apos;s finest directors, Helmut Kautner, is virtually unknown to non-European audiences despite his having worked wonders with the material at his disposal in two films for Universal in the late 1950&apos;s.\n\nHis post-war work in Germany is variable but he succeeded in giving us some truly excellent films and of the nine he directed between 1939 and 1945 at least two are masterpieces of the genre.\n\nFilm historian Georges Sadoul has referred to &apos;Romance in a Minor Key&apos; as the only film of &apos;real quality&apos; to have emerged during the Nazi years. This may be a slight exaggeration but it is certainly one of the most polished, elegant and heartfelt. Although on the face of it a romantic melodrama it is in fact rather subversive for the time, being inspired by &apos;The Necklace&apos; of Maupassant who happened to be on the Nazi &apos;banned&apos; list. The film&apos;s depiction of infidelity was not at all to Goebbel&apos;s liking which is ironic considering the Propoganda Minister was such a notoriously unfaithful husband.\n\nThe Madeleine of Marianne Hoppe is loved by three men. Her devoted but blinkered husband, a self-obsessed musician and a lecherous banker. All three men and the object of their love are each destined in their way to pay a terrible price........\n\nHerr Lautner&apos;s stunning visual sense is evident here as is his legendary skill with actors. He had previously directed Marianne Hoppe in &apos;Goodbye Francesca&apos; and as Madeleine she is even more luminous. Not a traditional beauty by any means but an exceptional artiste whose acting is &apos;interior&apos; and who brings her own air of mystery. Despite her perceived chumminess with the Nazi elite her career continued unabated after the war as did that of Gustaf Grundgens with whom she had a fruitful working relationship as well as a &apos;lavender marriage&apos;.\n\nThe musician is played by the excellent Ferdinand Marian whose life and career alas were blighted by his portrayal of Oppenheimer the Jew. As the banker Siegfried Breuer is wonderfully seedy and this actor is probably best known to English and indeed American speaking audiences as Popescu in &apos;The Third Man&apos;. Paul Dahlke is superb as the cuckolded husband.\n\nHelmut Kautner is an intriguing figure, a cultured, creative artiste and humanist who navigated the perilous waters of the Third Reich and did his best to rise above what he called the &apos;bourgeois culture industry&apos; of post-war Germany. He belongs to that elite group of directors known as &apos;auteurs&apos; and epitomises the theory that a work of art reflects its creator.",

Vietnamse soldiers, Vietmihn to be exact.\n\nWe get a good look at them in the end once the french have given up but that is just about it.\n\nYou might argue that this aspect of the movie should be true that you are indeed fighting some sort of an &quot;unseen&quot; enemy, but that is simply not true in the case of Dien Bien Phu.\n\nLet me elaborate some what on that point, several forages and attacks were made from the French in futile attempts to roll up and out the enemy (i.e. a lot of close combat and SEEN enemies).\n\nSeveral human wave attacks were launched against the French (most unsuccesfull though).\n\nFinally the Vietmihn managed to dislodge the French soldiers by basically trenching their way to them, foot by foot, yard by yard.\n\nAt some points of the battle is somewhat more resembled a WWI scenario more than jungle combat.\n\nI feel that the movie gave us a fairly good view of the French parts.. but just where the hell did the Viets go?"

We continue to hear, almost daily, about Hitler this, Hitler that, Hitler the other thing ... and he was a freakin&apos; pantywaist compared to the Soviets and Chicoms. It matters, particularly since the so-called intellectual left in the West was complicit, starting with Walter Duranty and his phony reporting for the NYT. It&apos;s a reminder that today&apos;s fathead libs don&apos;t want. I am also quite down on the GOP, so don&apos;t lump me with them. I am a libertarian, actually, and find nothing to respect in either major political party in the U.S. today.

One has no other choice but to love this film, and being a woman... it is a MUST SEE.\n\nWhat happened to writer/director David Leland? It is a shame we don&apos;t see fresh films like this one more often. Recently, &quot;Life is beautiful&quot; (Italy) swept with many awards... well, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is something like &quot;life is not beautiful but one better live it to the edge, being the one and only life we have&quot;.\n\nP.S.

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no excuse for bad writing, bad screenplay, bad sets, bad camera work, and bad directing. Nothing was thought out nor there was no insightful preparation to keep things real. The pacing was horrible and there was no military liaison to ensure that the rank structure or feel of a military presence was kept in tune with what to expect in running a ship, more so a submarine. Being a veteran of the U.S. Submarine Force, I gave this film a chance, but using a surface ship to present the inside of a submarine???...they would have had a better set using the inside of a car garage with PVC pipes taped along the walls. Even the uniforms were wrong, no haircuts, wrong use of rankings. The list goes on and on. The angle with the young, hotshot scientist was such a dumb move and there&apos;s no real linear threat with the time and distance of the approaching asteroid.\n\nMost of the actors in this film are washed up and probably needed the money, so they must have just been going through the motions to complete the film to receive their paychecks. I expected better from two or three of the actors, hopefully to lead and guide other actors towards a better film. But in the end, the whole thing falls apart in the first 15 minutes of the film. I held back from throwing up watching the rest.\n\nStick a fork in the director, his career is done.",

Jingle All The Way original is a movie with it all so when I saw a number 2 I thought I have to see it, after all, how bad can it be with Larry The Cable Guy in it!! I will admit I have enjoyed most of his movies but there is a first for everything. This one was named appropriately, cause it smelled like number 2. The little girl was so close to a clone of the darling in the Miracle on 34th street remake but the cute factor couldn&apos;t save this special movie. Interesting how he drove past a totally wide open lake on his way to go ice fishing, must have been a long drive. The best part of this movie was the end, I don&apos;t mean the ending, rather the credits, yes it&apos;s that bad and as I said, I enjoy goofy movies and low budget creations, this one won&apos;t be a Christmas staple at our house. I was extra generous with the score of 3.",

I suspect that this movie were made in a big rush, since it&apos;s worse than &quot;Bloodsport 2&quot; in many ways. First of all, the story is a little bit too standard. But that is of course not the most important. The fighting in this movie isn&apos;t that good, and it&apos;s just too much of the same styles. The Kumite in this movie has to be the worst Kumite ever arranged. One detail that particularly draw my attention, was one of the fighters sitting on the bench ringside and waiting to fight. On the bench, he didn&apos;t have any hair on his chest at all. But when he was fighting, he suddenly had lots of hair. Things like this confirms that this is a C-movie, and probably really low-budget. What where they thinking?",

That&apos;s right, this is one of those films that young people should go to watch with their friends. However, it is not trashy Hollywood fare, rather the film moves from genre to genre with ease. It covers comedy, slapstick, drama, excruciating torture, gore, erotica and a plot so twisted it sometimes feel like a complete figment of the protagonist&apos;s imagination. Its a simple story of an accomplished author who tries his hand at writing erotic stories as an sport since it was banned in Korea at the time. In the process of writing these stories he uses people for inspiration. And then, there is also the plot where the king and queen get involved (you should get a fair idea where I&apos;m coming from). So all in all, its total entertainment and an lovely film to watch with buddies. However it may not have lasting power and you may not remember it the following day, but you certainly will have fun watching it.\n\nPS: The other person who&apos;s commented on this film has mistakenly identified the queen as the king&apos;s favourite concubine, which is incorrect since the film clearly indicates that the character is the queen&apos;s.",

Here it&apos;s Spielberg - his world of wondrous discovery, magical escapade into comfortable menace, but where everything is wistfully made right again.\n\nSo you probably know by now how this is a pastiche built from other stuff; Close Encounters, The Host, The Goonies. The point-of-view is from the children (who are, perhaps, the only characters worth watching), the monster stalking the perimeters. The military is the faceless inhuman machine of cruel intentions. \n\nWhat Abrams does is perfectly in tune with post-modernist ideas. But whereas the Coens appropriate raw essentials and even whole chunks of preconceived world but build from them their own notion of a universe, Abrams is merely an itinerant garbage collector.\n\nIt&apos;s all so derivative, so uniformly processed, it makes me wonder why anyone would take time out of their lives to make it - assuming one has creative aspirations about the art. Is Close Encounters really that old? So, like the myth of Prometheus; some artists risk to steal the fire that will renew our lives, a dangerous fire, others merely spend their time bound in the confines of earlier discovery."

The second film is longer in plot and duration than the first, but Bay&apos;s lack of seriousness is also unfortunately reinforced in this film. He also makes reference to another of his great film, Bad Boys 2, through a large poster in the film, while in the first he mentioned the Armageddon. The threat of bigger, and more dangerous transformers, and generally all the elements are improved in this film, only overall it is less serious than the first, especially in dialogues and some characters. Better in action, effects, directing, but inferior in dialogues, so it remains at the levels of the first, perhaps a little below, but for different reasons.",

      "reviewBody": "An instant classic from pornochanchada that really makes people laugh with some obvious jokes, oversimplified story and less dangerously exploitative as many flicks from the genre. Here, the shy country Lírio (Nuno Leal Maia) gets the chance to break out to the big city and fall on the beds of many beautiful and excited women when they discover that he&apos;s ridiculously well-endowed.\n\nThe joke has to go with the city of Itu, a known municipality where all local objects are made in a big manner with giant phone booths, gigantic objects that are supposed to be small, so you get the idea of what&apos;s so interesting inside his pants. But the situations get more and more hysterical when the early virgin and clumsy man becomes super addicted to knowing women better and going ahead with their persecutions that leds to ridiculous funny moments (whenever the girls, from all social classes and ages see when his pants drop there&apos;s this dumb shocking noise or the plim plim from Globo that are irresistible to not laugh). And as usual with some of those stories, there&apos;s always the funny gay guy who never has the chance to interact with the male star - but the gay waiter delivers some of the best lines, and the shock he gets with Lírio is priceless.\n\nIt&apos;s a funny movie, the sex-appeal works but it alienates viewers because everytime when the movie shows the girls we get to see them fully in the nude while the huge secret from the film (what makes the title and Lírio being such an appealing man) isn&apos;t shown at all. So, there&apos;s no justice, no balance to the movie. This is the kind of movie where a scene requiring the lead man (or a stunt guy) showing his material should be mandatory - though I know male audiences are its majority of viewers because they all want to see Consuelo Leandro, Esmeralda Barros, Maria Luíza Castelli and other women showing their attributes rather than Nuno, since that kind of movie is a product of the decade; but as for the opposite side it can be a completely letdown. Had it been presented like &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; final sequence than we would understand all the characters shock and amazement with how massive the Man from Itu is.\n\nAs seen just as a comedy that goes a little beyond things I was absolutely delighted with it, thought it was hilarious in nearly all of its scenes; it has a nice past; it never got to become a violent and over-exploitative mess like many pornochanchada of the kind. It flirts with the absurd and the mudane with such fine balance that it&apos;s actually surprising it can be THAT good. For the objection I made one can argue that pornography exists for that...however, it&apos;s not funny or well-acted as this is. Outside of the scenes of sexual nature, &quot;O Homem de Itu&quot; has a lot of qualities that porn can&apos;t cover - such as the scenes with Lírio lost in São Paulo or getting arrested by the police or even the lavish rich ladies party to present the host&apos;s new aquisition...which is him (!). Two enthusiastic thumbs up to this movie and I hope to see it again soon, it&apos;s super funny. 9/10",

Only about a hundred people worldwide are known to have this diagnosis. People with this disorder can feel no pain, and are prone to numerous injuries and accidents that can be disfiguring as well as lethal.\n\nThe film tells the story of Three-year-old Gabby from Minnesota, 7-year-old Miriam from Norway and 10-year-old Jamilah from Germany. Their stories are told with unflinching truthfulness and a deliberate lack of sentimentality. The courage of the girls and their families in spite of their great difficulties is truly uplifting.\n\nThe movie was easy to watch, it seemed to end too soon. It would be nice to see a sequel on how these delightful girls are doing in a few years.",

For those of you who aren&apos;t familiar with either director...think of it as COPS made like an art film. One difference between the two documentarians though, is that Depardon has a more ethical filmaking style, blacking out peoples faces at times, and even offering disclaimers in some of his other films (ie. Delits Flagrant), whereas Wiseman seems not to care about peoples feelings about being filmed, after they&apos;ve given consent. This film is shot magnificently. They shoot from angles that attempt to emulate the gaze of the subject, but still seem to remain unintrusive (as much as a camera can). This type of filming in a documentary quenches both my cinematic and voyeuristic desires. I&apos;m not sure if Depardon did the camera-work or if he directed the cameraman during the filming, but whoever is responsible for the aesthetics behind these shots should be greatly praised, as this film is absolutely beautiful, despite its content- as all Depardon&apos;s films are. I do know he was a renown photographer before he became a filmmaker, so I suppose credit should most likely be given to him. Unfortunately I had no subtitles, but even without subtitles this film is easy to watch, as every shot is beautiful.",

AFter watching this film, I realized there was so much that I didn&apos;t know! So much that I never recognized many things to be problematic! I recommend all young and old with an interest in bees, eating healthy produce, the Earth to watch this film. It was an eye opener for me and it gave me the right kick to do what I can to make this world a better place for our bees and our future kin.

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;80s were the decade of everyone from Nicolas Roeg to Steve Allen transporting historical figures into new realms, so it&apos;s only fitting to see a more arthouse interpretation.\n\nThere are some helpful info-text type screens for each of the historical figures listed, but generally the best bet would be to not care about accuracy for these portrayals. (or some of the cast listings, given what a mess the entry for George Spelvin aka whatever the actor&apos;s real name was aka Langston Hughes is).\n\nThe film mostly avoids questions about time travel paradoxes, aside from some moments (again shown as text, rather than as actual scenes) where we hear of the group reading biographies or watching films about their lives. The most interesting content is the historical figures dealing with old rivalries, or, in several cases, hooking up. If you want to see Sergei Eisenstein convince Langston Hughes to try out safe sex (or the leadup to it, anyway), this is your film.\n\nThere&apos;s also some content about Dorian Gray and who is or isn&apos;t working with the cops, but that isn&apos;t really worth remembering.\n\nThe portions of the film about cottaging, busts, entrapment, and the toll taken on the men who are arrested is varied and effective, ranging from an interview with then-politician Svend Robinson to interviews with men who were busted to truly one-of-a-kind images of Eistenstein (or the actor playing him, anyway) pants around his ankles in a toilet stall.\n\nIf you run into this film anywhere it&apos;s definitely worth watching at least once - you won&apos;t find much out there like it.",

The movie&apos;s strength comes from the intrigue that it portrays.\n\nNeedless to say, now that the censorship laws had eased, they were able to add in some more things. I&apos;ll never forget the sink scene (as I call it). And, as I understand it, Donovan starred in this movie (or was it someone else with the name Donovan Leitch?). Oh well, the point is that they eked out a good movie with this remake.",

      "name": "IDLEWILD - a film for people that love the cinema",
      "reviewBody": "There is a very good reason that films in general are getting significantly worse in every quality. Why? Because in our time, when a film is made that is intelligent or creative in some significant way, it is usually ripped to pieces by critics and the general audience, teaching &apos;Hollywood&apos; a lesson that they take to heart all too well.\n\nIdlewild is a first rate musical, and feast for the eyes. Like &apos;Running Scared (2006)&apos;, the director believes that there is no reason a movie made in the 21st century should not benefit from all the options modern film technology offers (and no, I don&apos;t mean the visual rubbish that assaults the eyes in recent Tony Scott efforts). However, the state-of-the-art methods are used strictly in the service of &apos;old fashioned&apos; film entertainment values, and this seemingly &apos;insults&apos; the &apos;too cool for school&apos; types, for whom enjoyment seems to be the last reason to pay to see a movie.\n\nThe actors are great, the acting is fine, and the production values are top notch. The story is a little clichéd, and as a result, the writer does seem to have cut-n-pasted from various familiar sources. However, this is a very minor criticism in a film that uses music as much as the spoken word to tell a story.\n\nWhile the music is (mostly) contemporary, it was written with the aim of slotting into a (fantasy) period drama, and does so beautifully. While many of the performers may seem to have a &apos;rap&apos; background, if this puts you off seeing Idlewild you are seriously misjudging the creativity and range of their talent.\n\nSome may claim the film is a little &apos;tame&apos;, but a much better description is &apos;inclusive&apos;. In other words, Idlewild really wants to reach and impress a wide audience, and it is a great pity that this doesn&apos;t seem to have happened yet.\n\nIdlewild is a sexy sophisticated &apos;feelgood&apos; musical- a vanity project for OutKast no doubt, but also a wonderful treat for those that value todays&apos;s rarest treasure, a new movie worth making the effort to see.\n\nBy the way Idlewild is NOT &apos;one long music video&apos; (and I&apos;m hard placed to see such comments as &apos;innocent&apos; given the power of this lie to put people off seeing the movie). So forget any fear of &apos;opera&apos; (like Evita where everything is sung) or MTV masquerading as a film. This is a HBO production, like Deadwood or the Sopranos, and that means quality first, especially the quality of the dramatic presentation. However, although Idlewild is an &apos;adult&apos; film (thank heaven- the PG13 sludge is killing me), it lacks the extreme and explicit content of many of HBO&apos;s TV productions, so may be safely viewed by more &apos;sensitive&apos; types.\n\nIf you watch a lot of films, and have no greater pleasure than finding an unexpected gem, give Idlewild a go. It really is &apos;the one that got away&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Fun insane zombie crossed mad doctor style late 80s low-budget horror with hazy atmospheric lighting of illuminating blues and an otherworldly music score sure to drive anyone crazy. Think along the lines of someone banging pots and in doing so, capturing the suffocating madness of the institute. One of those - forget about making sense of it too, as with little thought in its narrative and visuals, it&apos;s hellish abandonment throws everything at you, but the kitchen sink.\n\nAfter a minor quake breaks a seal of a hidden tomb in the cellar of a mental hospital. A surgeon returns from the dead as a demonic figure (who can make his eyes glow red whenever he wants). Still dressed up in his scrubs, and making sure he&apos;s wearing rubber gloves (a hard to break habit I guess?). He goes about continuing his horrific experiments on the physical brain and its connection to the mind on the unknowing staff and patients. While also scarring, and constantly showing himself (even waving) to a new patient that suffers from amnesia and who spends quite lot of time wandering the corridors in a revealing attire (that comes to the forefront in one daft dream sequence), or simply freaking out. You can see why they casted Cheryl Lawson. Her character&apos;s amnesia and hypnosis sittings organized by the head doctor (Jeremy Slater who comes out the best of the lot) are a tool for a predictably contrived plot twist that shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise.\n\nWhat did though was the excessive, delirious third act, as the surgeon&apos;s ghouls come out from a glowing green pit and go on a gory rampage tearing people apart. The special effects (miniature model sets) and makeup do provide some killer goodies at the backend, like open brain surgery and skin melting. Did the latter make sense, not really, but nothing does here.",

      "reviewBody": "I was in college when I first saw THE TRAIN ROBBERS. I was already a die hard John Wayne fan. I followed his later career with great interest. Since due to the political climate of the day one was not the most popular individual on a campus declaring the fact that you liked this star&apos;s work. I didn&apos;t simply declare this fact. I shouted it from the rooftops. I dragged all my friends to see this picture because I felt it both reflected the best of Duke&apos;s earlier work and still stayed consistent with the aging hero he was portraying. Burt Kennedy&apos;s lean and taut script reminded me of the best of his work on the Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher westerns of the fifties. The simple yarn of Ann-Margret hiring John Wayne and his crew of Ben Johnson, Rod Taylor,Christopher George, Jerry Gatlin and Bobby Vinton to recover half a million dollars in stolen gold is very simple in it&apos;s directness. They are are gunmen who just stay on the right side of the law. If they were japanese they could almost be described as landless sellswords or ronin. They exist simply from job to job. The status quo for Lane John Wayne&apos;s character is changed by the presence of the woman. Mrs. Lowe, He finds himself sexually attracted to Mrs. Lane, a woman young enough to be his daughter yet still capable of reminding him of the things he&apos;s lost in his life.Ann-Margret&apos;s character is curious about Lane who won&apos;t or more importantly can&apos;t talk about himself. Ben Johnson&apos;s character Jesse fills in the the necessary exposition but never tells more than he immediately has to. Burt Kennedy also plays with his audience. In BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID George Roy Hill has his leads chased by faceless men that they eventually are able to identify. In THE TRAIN ROBBERS our crew is chased by nameless men we never get to identify, people who remain throughout the film as a constant unknown quantity. This is a situation I don&apos;t recall ever seeing before in an A grade Wayne western. There is a scene toward the end of the film where Mrs. Lowe makes an overture to Lane which he reluctantly rejects. He feels he is too old to have feelings of this nature. The film starts to proceed to what might be considered a predictable conclusion. Burt Kennedy does not oblige. He gives us a surprise ending that totally satisfies on each and every viewing. There are other considerable assets to this project. Dominic Frontiere&apos;s score is a rouser. The opening of the film and the first fifteen minutes contain no score at all. All of a sudden we have an expansive score on the par with Alfred Newman&apos;s HOW THE WEST WAS WON or Jerome Moross&apos;s THE BIG COUNTRY. The only other score Mr. Frontiere ever delivered on a par with this film was Ted Post&apos;s HANG&apos;EM HIGH. The other major contributor to this project was William H Clothier superb cinematography. This was the last of his 17 collaborations with the Duke and no movie ever looked cleaner or sharper. I know this film has many detractors. Everyone is entitled to his opinion but I feel this is on the high end of Duke&apos;s later work. As for Burt Kennedy I feel he delivered a movie even Howard Hawks would have liked to claim as his own."

      "reviewBody": "Jack Smith&apos;s 1963 short Flaming Creatures might be one of the most sexual perverse film ever made.  It has ever amount of sexual deviance that made up the New York underground in the 1960&apos;s- transexuals, S&amp;M, lines such as &quot;do they make a lipstick that doesn&apos;t come off when you s*** c****?&quot;, drug use, and a radically innovative orgy scene that plays more like a Greek tragedy than a work of pornography. On the surface, Flaming Creatures appears to be art at its lowest, but a closer examination of the film proves that Flaming Creatures is not only high art, but a siminal piece of film in the cannon of The New American Cinema.  Filmed on top of Smith&apos;s New York  studio on a basic 16mm camera, Flaming Creatures embodies the true independent spirit of The New American Cinema.  The orgy scene in the film is perhaps the greatest combination of art and film.  The &quot;creatures&quot;, as Smith puts them, engage in a rape-orgy scene of sailors and a transexual.  The orgy plays like a tragic meeting the old America with the freshly  birthed new morality in America.  What is even more remarkable is the &quot;earthquake&quot;, caused Smith&apos;s shaking camera at the end of the orgy.  It as if the world is opening up on Smith&apos;s creatures and swallowing them and all their perversions.  No one can deny that Flaming Creatures is a difficult film to watch- both in its content and deep artistic meanings, but the spirit of the film is the reason it should be preserved for generations to come."

      "name": "Exile of a Russian poet to America (and in America)",
      "reviewBody": "Zagdansky continues his series of portraits of Russian exiles living in America with this empathetic and poignant film of the poet Konstantin Kuzminsky and his wife Emma.\n\nKonstantin and Mouse follows the release of Vasya (2005), a portrait of Vasily Sitnikov the talented, romantic and impoverished painter from the community of Russian émigré artists living in and around New York beginning in the mid 1970s. Zagdansky has now trained his sympathetic but unflinching eye on Kostya and Emma Kuzminsky&apos;s tenuous hold on survival in a ruin of a house on the rail line in the tiny hamlet of Lordville, on the last perch of land on the Delaware River before New York becomes Pennsylvania on the other side.\n\nAmerica has never had a deep poetic tradition, Frost and Cummings, Ginsberg and Whitman aside, particularly in comparison to the deep and almost holy tradition to which ordinary Russians held poetry from before the time of Pushkin to the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Soviet times poetry was the only counter balance to the propaganda and disinformation fed to Russians by the official state media. Poetry was the individual&apos;s only vehicle for expressing even a semblance of truth and honesty. But poets had to be very careful not to run afoul of the official apparatus that espoused, and monitored for, strict Socialist Realism.\n\nAn outsider in every respect, Kuzminsky grew up in St. Petersburg, developed his gift as a non-conformist poet, and was considered an outlaw by all official measures, part Russian Futurist, part Dadaist, part Bohemian. Zagdansky captures these aspects of Kuzminsky&apos;s poetry with the camera trained on his New York and Texas poetry readings (cum &apos;happenings&apos;) and his reflections on poets from Brodsky to Byron. Emma&apos;s evident partnership with and devotion to Kuzminksy is skillfully captured by Zagdansky throughout the film and is an emotional highlight of the documentary. Emma (endearingly called Mouse) is the pillar.\n\nTired of harassment from an overzealous state intent on tightly controlling individual behavior, Kuzminsky and Emma finally fled Russia in 1976 when he was thirty six. The two briefly settled in Austin, TX where Kuzminsky had received an invitation to come teach Russian poetry from the American scholar of Russian Studies, John Bowlt. Emma took on janitorial work. When that contract expired the Kuzminsky&apos;s moved to Brighton Beach, NY and then in 1997 to Lordville, NY. Emma worked as a low paid architectural drafter for eighteen years supporting the couple while Kuzminsky worked on his own poetry and prose as well as what became his magnum opus, published in 1986 in nine volumes, the &apos;Blue Lagoon Anthology of Modern Russian Poetry&apos;. This labor of love that Emma and Konstantin, in equal measure, assembled over many years and hand-published only with great difficulty, as recounted in the film, is the only anthology of its kind containing works from an entire generation of Russian non-conformist poets that would have otherwise been lost to time.\n\nZagdansky trains his camera on Emma and Konstantin in a series of thirty-three intimate vignettes that when completed left me with the poignant feeling of having just seen two lives lived with a ferocious and uncompromising honesty (and an uncompromising love for one another) along with the attendant suffering that both have endured as a result. They are uniquely double exiles, exiles from Russia and exiles from America, isolated and marginalized by language, poverty and poetry, belonging nowhere but to each other and bravely creating their own meaning and a poetical reality that is strangely affecting. Thankfully for non-Russians like this reviewer, Konstantin and Mouse is produced with optional English sub-titles.",

      "name": "Fanaa is like reading a 19th Century English Novel",
      "reviewBody": "Well, if you have had that experience you will know what I am talking about. The character of Zooni is straight out of Bronte sisters&apos; romantic novels. The strong willed, intelligent girl out to meet her prince, the supportive mother, the mysterious and charming lover, the lonely house in the middle of nowhere, the retired colonel as the only family friend who sometimes comes and shares a drink with the father; it&apos;s all there.\n\nFanaa is one of the most intense romantic movies to have come out of Bollywood for a long time. Perhaps, since Silsila. The pairing of two of the best actors of our generation (maybe, perhaps of all time) needed a story just like Fanaa. You need to scratch the surface to reveal the passion of this unique love story. \n\nThe director, Kunal Kohli has exploited the potential of this pairing admirably. Look at the picturisation of the song &apos;Dekho Na&apos;. The camera hardly seems to move away from the two faces. There are innumerable scenes in the film where just these two faces share the screen.It is hard to think of any other actors from the present who would be able to pull off such a form of narration. Ultimately, the film belongs to Zooni and Kajol comes out with her best performance to date. Rehan asks, &quot;KOI KISISE ITNA PYAR KAISE KAR SAKTA HAI?&quot; and it shows in Zooni&apos;s eyes. What a role to make a come back and what a performance to make a comeback! And Aamir never ceases to surprise. He holds his own in a story primarily about Zooni and complements her character brilliantly. His performance is so amazingly understated, and yet so powerful. Rehan is one of the most complex and difficult characters played by Aamir. And it&apos;s all about the characters of Rehan and Zooni, their ideals, their emotions, their dreams and their passion. It&apos;s really like reading a 19th century English novel. It is not easy to narrate a story this way in a mainstream film and this is where the narration stumbles. The scene where Rehan takes Zooni from the train and carries her in his arms looks very cliché and awfully out of place. The tag line &apos;.....TERE ISHQ MEIN MERI JAAN FANAA HO JAYE&apos; is repeated to death in the film. There have been some cinematic liberties taken in the screenplay, like Rehan infiltrating the Indian Army, Zooni fumbling with the radio transmitter and speaking to the right people. The Urdu couplets, although all very good, seem to hold back the flow a bit. Also, the discussion on the political history of Kashmir at the meeting of the Intelligence Heads seems a bit off track. A better place to put that discussion would have been a friendly chat between Rehan and Zulfi (Zooni&apos;s father)over a drink.\n\nBut these are minor skirmishes in a remarkable film. The story remains true to the title of the film and if you have a liking for 19th century English novels, you would simply love this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Filmed in 1935 and released in 1936, CHARLIE CHAN&apos;S SECRET is the 10th film in the Fox series. It is also a film about which I have changed my opinion over several viewings. I originally felt it was among the weaker Chan films starring Warner Oland; today, however, I would describe it as a truly solid entry.\n\nSeveral years earlier Alan Colby, heir to a major fortune, disappeared and was presumed dead--and elderly aunt Alice Lowell (Rosina Lawrence) inherited the estate. Now, however, it seems that Colby may be alive, and although his resurrection will cost her the family fortune Mrs. Lowell dutifully enlists Chan to investigate the matter. But with a great fortune at stake, murder cannot be far behind.\n\nSuch earlier Chan films as THE BLACK CAMEL and CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt introduced an occult edge to the Chan films, and CHARLIE CHAN&apos;S SECRET plays upon this theme to a degree not previously seen in any other Chan film: Mrs. Lowell is a spiritualist who is given to everything from séances to nightly sessions with the Ouija board, and both elements play into the story in a significant way. Although the plot itself is nonsense, the &quot;spooky&quot; elements fill the holes, and the cast--most particularly Rosina Lawrence as Mrs. Lowell and Herbert Mundin as the bumbling butler Baxter--deliver solid and quite often charming performances.\n\nChan films are often accused of being racist, and critics often complain that the actors playing Chan wore &quot;yellowface&quot; make up. The films, however, must be seen within the context of their era. In the 1930s, Hollywood presented most Asian characters as either servile or as Fu Manchu-like entities; Chan was actually just about the only positive Asian character going, and as such the films were tremendously popular with Asian-American audiences of the era.\n\nTrue enough, Chan is inevitably played by an occidental actor, but this was typical of the era, in which star status was considered more important than racial accuracy. Whatever the case, neither Warner Oland or the later Sidney Toler wore significant make-up for the role, and Oland--although a Swede by birth--actually had a strong strain of Asian ancestry in his family tree. But most significantly, while Chan often allows his suspects to dismiss him through their own prejudices, as a character he is always presented in a positive light--and this is particularly true of CHARLIE CHAN&apos;S SECRET, in which Chan is the only Asian character in the film.\n\nWhile I would not rank it along such knock-out Chan films as CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA or CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND, CHARLIE CHAN&apos;S SECRET grows upon you with each viewing. As noted the plot is weak, but the film is long on charm. It is also one of the few Chan films available to the home market. Most Chan fans should enjoy it.\n\nGary F.

      "reviewBody": "When I rented this film around the Christmas season of 1999, I did not know what to expect. The only reason why I rented it was that Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea were in the leading roles (I have a strange and sick obsession with Olivia Hussey and I liked Keir Dullea in 2001). But then when I first watched it that dark and cold Saturday night, I was amazed.\n\nThe film&apos;s style was very dark and mysterious, as well as bizarre. While watching the film, I saw where John Carpenter might have gotten a lot of his filming technique from his 1978 classic, Halloween (one of my personal favorites). It, like Halloween, involves the murders of young women. And in the case of Black Christmas, it&apos;s sorority girls.\n\n What set this apart from Halloween is that the killer is less human than Michael Myers. You saw Michael Myers, but you do not see the killer in Black Christmas. Plus the killer is insane, especially when he rants. His rants make no sense, making his intentions unknown. He just kills, not for revenge like most horror films. But he just kills. I don&apos;t know about you, but that is what makes this film even scarier, aside from the spooky musical score.\n\nThey say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the &quot;scream queen.&quot; Well whoever thinks that obviously has not heard Olivia Hussey&apos;s lungs in action. That woman can SCREAM.\n\nIt&apos;s best if you watch this film alone in a quiet house at night during the Christmas season. I did that the second time I watched it. I tell you the truth, I had a hard time walking downstairs to go to the bathroom I was so scared. And no horror film has ever done that to me since the first time I saw Scream about three years ago.\n\nSome may argue that the characters in the film are not very developed, but that does not matter because most of them die anyway. One of the few characters that stood out in this film was Barb (Margot Kidder). She is a drunk, trash-talking sorority girl who manages offend just about everybody. The woman who played the sorority house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman), also stood out as a trash-talking, drunken woman. Olivia Hussey&apos;s character is a bit snobbish, like any sorority girl, but not to her other sisters. Keir Dullea&apos;s character is high-strung and unpredictable, which adds to the film mysterious style. But as for the rest, there really was no room for them to grow. Besides, like I just stated, most of them get killed off anyway.\n\nThe end really surprised me. I mean, really. No questions asked. It even shocked me, but I&apos;m going to spoil it for anyone. But if you loved John Carpenter&apos;s Halloween, you&apos;ll love this film even more. I guarantee it.",

      "name": "Fun Western Caper with Burt Reynolds, Angie Dickinson and Clint Walker",
      "reviewBody": "After being enlisted by a hot widow (Angie Dickinson), a former war spy (Burt Reynolds), a blacksmith (Ossie Davis) and an inventor (Clint Walker) team-up to salvage a treasure in gold bars from a sunken ship in the Platte River, a treasure the woman&apos;s husband stole. They then have to return the gold bars to the Denver Mint before the phony bars are discovered and the woman&apos;s family name is tarnished. But how will they get all those gold bars into the Mint without anyone noticing?\n\nPeople tend to dub this a Western Comedy, but it&apos;s not in the silly sense of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974) &quot;Texas Across the River&quot; (1966) or &quot;The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox&quot; (1976). It&apos;s more of a Western Caper with amusing flashes, mainly due to Reynold&apos;s fun-loving title character.\n\nThe same plot was later used in John Wayne&apos;s &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; (1973) with Ann-Margret in the Angie Dickinson role, minus the caper in the third act. They&apos;re both worth checking out, but I favor &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; because, to me, the caper in the last act gets kind of tedious, not to mention unbelievable. Nevertheless, &quot;Sam Whiskey&quot; features a great cast with fun-lovin&apos; chemistry and quality Western locations.\n\nIt is presumed that the story takes place circa 1870-75 since it is detailed that Sam was a spy during the Civil War and he appears to be around 30-35 tops. Actually, the earliest the story COULD have taken place would be 1906, which is when the Denver Mint began minting coins, but this would make Whiskey about 65 years old, which he obviously isn&apos;t. Adding to the problem, the Carson City Mint shut down in 1893. So the timeline is all fudged up.\n\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot at Universal City, Burbank and Lake Camanche, Ione, California (with underwater scenes done in Silver Springs, Florida).\n\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

I was impressed with the actors &amp; sets, as the film was on a very low budget. The director played it smart, working well on a storyline that keeps your attention as well as characters you can invest in. There are some shifts in time, and &quot;astral projection&quot; with one of the characters. The film makers keep it simple and the viewer doesn&apos;t get confused at all. I wouldn&apos;t call this a horror flick, as the title would suggest, but more of a drama/thriller with sci-fi undertones. It&apos;s worth a watch, and the run time is only about 70 minutes. There are worse ways to waste that time.",

In order to create the show, &quot;Libi bácsi&quot;, the producer/director utilizes the famous Stanislavsky-method, forcing his bunch of actors (more like meter-readers, sociopaths and grandmothers) to &quot;live&quot; their parts. All this leads to disaster...\n\nSpecial kudos go to the creators for casting Diósi Gábor as the wife (?) of Libi bácsi, who performs excellently without any mannerisms usually seen when a man performs the role of a woman, so none of the usual man-in-drag jokes this time...\n\nFor Hungarian viewers the casting scenes are maybe the best, because they show how Libi bácsi selects his actors, turning down the most famous Hungarian actors (who do unbelievably funny cameos) - of course international viewers won&apos;t see the point, though they may laugh at the routines Libi bácsi prescribes for the wannabe actors.\n\nI hope one day it will be released on DVD, together with the short films the directors had created before Libiomfi, which are also modern classics in their own right.",

      "reviewBody": "Richard Burton plays a priest in Absolution. I know, his real-life persona was very un-priest-like, but that&apos;s why it&apos;s called acting! I mean, Frank Sinatra played a very convincing priest in The Miracle of the Bells, and he was just as un-saintly as Richard Burton in real life. Anyway, Burton gives a great performance as a man of the cloth. He&apos;s conflicted and pained, and when he even hears about a sin, you can see him struggling not to take it as a personal insult. \n\nHe&apos;s a teacher and mentor in a boys&apos; Catholic school, and during one of his lessons, the boys ask about the rules during confession. If someone confesses to a crime, will the priest turn him into the police? Burton answers, almost directly into the camera for the audience&apos;s benefit, that the priest is bound to silence and can&apos;t call the police if he&apos;s told of a crime. Then, surprise! One of his students confesses a murder.\n\nGranted, if this movie had been made today, it would be a lot more gruesome, and probably have a few more twists and turns. But it was made in 1978, and so if you watch it, keep that in mind. There are a couple of violent scenes, but nothing overly graphic. And I thought it was thrilling, with enough twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat. It&apos;s a lot of fun to watch a manipulative, snot-nosed student take Burton to the brink of insanity!",

      "reviewBody": "Mean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich&apos;s 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer, The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer, director Barry Skolnick, along with his roll call of British &quot;faces&quot;, is only aiming for one market.\n\nThat of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.\n\nVery much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich&apos;s superior movie, Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film&apos;s reputation being far from good, the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.\n\nThe problem would seem to lay with the first hour, violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards, and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick, it&apos;s an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can&apos;t quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the &quot;supervising producer&quot; shirt, one can&apos;t help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as &quot;I&quot; say, there&apos;s enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.\n\nLed by the watchable Jones, the cast, outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor, pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet, while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk, a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives, Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili. It&apos;s no piece of work to rank in the higher echelons of British movies - or sports movies in general for that matter. But in spite of its soggy formula and over reliance on the template film it&apos;s working from, it&apos;s very funny at times, and if you like soccer? Well the actual match is well worth the wait. 7/10\n\nFootnote: The Longest Yard/Mean Machine was met with another re- imaging in 2005 with Adam Sandler as the disgraced lead protagonist. Proof positive that it&apos;s either a formula that many can&apos;t resist? Or that it&apos;s one that some feel still hasn&apos;t yet met its potential?",

      "reviewBody": "27th Day, The (1957)\n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nThere were dozens and dozens of science fiction movies released throughout the 1950&apos;s and for everyone like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL you got at least ten &quot;Z&quot; movies like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The movie here seems to be forgotten even by the biggest sci-fi fans. I had personally never heard of the film, which is saying quite a bit because of the amount I read on various message boards. When sci-fi films were mentioned this one here never came up and that&apos;s a shame because it&apos;s a real gem. The film has an alien from a dying planet giving capsules to five people. These capsules have the power to destroy life on Earth, which would give the aliens a place to move. The humans can determine their fate but sure enough there are some bad people who want to use the capsules for their own gain even though they don&apos;t fully understand their power. During the decade people in this country were afraid of aliens from space and anything dealing with the Cold War so this movie combines both and makes a very entertaining movie out of it. There&apos;s really not too much &quot;action&quot; that goes on here and the monsters don&apos;t have four eyes or green bodies. Instead the monsters are pretty much certain humans who want to do bad in the world. The way the film makes this capsules so important and powerful was a nice move but so is the pay off at the end. The very final thing in the movie is a tad bit too preachy but the message is still there. Gene Barry, Valerie French, George Voskovec and Stefan Schnabel add nice performances as well. When people think of sci-fi from the 1950&apos;s it&apos;s doubtful they&apos;ll think of this movie but it&apos;s a real shame because here&apos;s a gem that needs to be rediscovered."

The story is neatly packaged, but so what.\n\nThe thing that comes out of this film is the people playing the characters are real. I don&apos;t mean their performances are necessarily the greatest, but they are real in how they present the material.\n\nThere are too few films out there like this that are specifically intended to be for the Christian community. Nothing wrong with that. Films are allowed to imbue the filmmaker&apos;s belief&apos;s all the time. Funny that is an issue when it comes to Christianity.\n\nEveryone here puts everything they have into this film and it shows. The leads are the better actors, rightfully so, and they bring an air of authenticity to their roles.\n\nFor the most part, the games are shot very well. There are instances when the action looks staged, but for the most part it is nicely done. The locations are all authentic south, as well they should be. Everyone has a real southern accent, not overly done Hollywood take on it. The story is not complex and it doesn&apos;t take a great sleuth to know all will be right in the end. But then again, that is the intended message; through God all things are possible. \n\nI highly recommend this film to any youth director looking to show a film to their youth.",

      "reviewBody": "Er, where&apos;s the demand for the Project Shadowchaser films? I suppose there might be some sort of cult following somewhere, folks that just love to see Frank Zagarino stagger through another film, pretending to be a cyborg or alien or whatever he&apos;s meant to be in these films. Believe it or not, but this is the fourth film in the series, and guess what? It&apos;s crap. But therein lies the fun part.\n\nThe first time I attempted to watch this film I was sent off to sleepy-land on a bed of endless chase sequences and tame, tame action. However, I tried again and found a really bad chase film full of mistakes, chronic acting, a terrible script, and loads of laugh out loud pieces. \n\nIn Africa, 2963 years ago to be precise, a tribe of folks are giving it some moves around a campfire when a spaceship lands and what looks like bunch of Billy Idol clones jump out, watched by some grey aliens. The lead Idol clone (Zagarino) gives half a key to the tribe&apos;s chief, who joins it up with another key. Zagarino then takes the key into some underground complex and activates a machine. Job done, they all jump in the spaceship, which stupidly gets struck by lightening and explodes. \n\nJump forwards to the future, where a couple of archaeologists are digging the area (it&apos;s pretty groovy). The husband is adamant that they will find some great secret about an ancient tribe, but his missus is giving him grief because they&apos;ve got no cash and there&apos;s the middling matter of their son being catatonic in a hospital following a car crash and they can&apos;t pay the locals. Give the guy a break, missus!\n\nOf course, they find half a key, so Zagarino wakes up (somehow caused by an email getting sent!) and burst out of his cave to go get the key. The couple&apos;s boss, Morton, also wants the key and sends his henchman, Silver to get it. Silver is mental though, and just tries to kill the couple even though the wife was willing to give the key to the guy in order to get cash to get her son out of the hospital into somewhere better. Also, Zagarino just runs around the place smashing things to bits rather than explain why he wants the key. Got all that? \n\nSo, the couple are on the run from Silver, the kid&apos;s kidnapped by Morton, Zagarino&apos;s charging through the scenery like Arnie&apos;s PCP addicted brother, and they all end up at the underground lair, where things get a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark. \n\nThis film is superficially a bit tame and boring (it&apos;s by Nu-Image after all), but there&apos;s so much wrong with the film that I couldn&apos;t help but like it. It&apos;s full of mistakes and gaffs (look for the extra at the beginning who burns himself on a torch!), lameness (Silver especially can&apos;t act) and quirkiness (why did we have to see the lead actress stop for a pee break?) that I couldn&apos;t help but enjoy it. Zagarino is so bland he&apos;s like the Pot Noodle of action stars, but this film should give bad movie fans a good laugh. Loved the trick ending too.",

Cate Blanchett is on a genial level playing the double part of the filmstar and her jealous cousin.\n\nJim Jarmusch can&apos;t be beaten. The dialogue seems to be mostly improvised, but the concept is not. Every short chapter here has a meaning and gives us something to think about. The films are in black and white, like coffee and cigarettes and that still is, and will always be, a way of pushing things harder. This is very much comedy and very much serious.",

His wife (Catherine Deneuve) seems quite pleased with it and Marcello seems to accept it all rather easily. In fact, that is an odd thing about the film--the public and media also accept it rather easily--perhaps too easily! And, in light of this, it&apos;s odd that he wasn&apos;t subjected to a huge battery of tests--it&apos;s just accepted! The idea of a pregnant man could have been handled in a wide variety of ways--and the rather matter of fact way it was handled here surprised me. This film was NOT handled as slapstick or as an obvious comedy--more like a mildly amusing film and that is all. That, combined with the VERY anti-climactic ending made for a film that was diverting but not especially satisfying--good as a time-passer but with very little to say about gender roles or inequities or comedy. This is a case where a film has an exceptional director (Jacques Demy) and some exceptional actors were hampered by a rather mundane script despite the novel idea (after all, this film came out before &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; and &quot;Junior&quot;).",

But Ådalen 31 is a more artistic film than those. Based on an incident in which five strikers were shot and killed, the film is lyrical and a visually beautiful film, definitely rising above TV movie-level.\n\nWhile the slow pace, aside from some heated argument scenes, generally works in its favour, at times the film does become dull. It&apos;s not the most powerful pro-labour statement I&apos;ve seen, though according to the closing titles this event catapulted the Social Democrats to political dominance. (See I Am Curious Yellow for how that turned out by the late 1960s- not perfect, but by no means the miserable communist dictatorship alt-righters, Fox News hacks and Republican buffoons paint the Nordic countries as).",

      "reviewBody": "What is most interesting about Body of Lies is that it manages to rise above the predictability and formula that plagues the vast majority of espionage films. It is post-Bourne wrapped up in a more mature Bond plot with a politically conscious edge. Yet it never feels like it is stealing elements of those, more using them as a launch-pad for its own ideas. Though the film itself is sometimes guilty of falling back into safety, it remains consistently exciting and intently engaging even when those moments occur because of how keenly detailed and acted it is. It makes it standout as a cut above many of its contemporaries.\n\nWe follow Roger Ferris, a ground CIA operative who moves throughout the Middle East in an attempt to lure out and capture terrorist Al- Saleem. Of course his practices involve plenty of lies and deceit as he tries to retain the support of the head of the Jordanian Intelligence. Ferris is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who makes an excellent centrepiece for the film. DiCaprio is a great choice for the role, given his superb ability to convey emotion and his delivery making even mundane dialogue seem important. I&apos;m not sure many could have been as appealing as he is here. Ferris grows into a more interesting character as the film progresses. His disillusion with the lies he has to sow and backstabbing from his superiors make for some of the most intriguing moments, whilst providing some welcomed morality that never feels forced.\n\nHis superior Hoffman is played terrifically by Russell Crowe, whose weight gain and distinct accent allow him to become the character. Crowe is at his best playing characters like this. Confident, forcefully honest, almost egotistical, yet understanding the importance of the situation. They&apos;re traits he always nails. Hoffman appears all-knowing, frequently surveying from the air, keeping constant contact with Ferris as he aids him in setting up a fictional terrorist group to smoke out Al-Saleem. He also clashes with the Jordanian head Hani Salaam, who is convincingly played by Mark Strong, a man who only asks that the CIA don&apos;t lie to him, which is something that Ferris finds increasingly difficult to avoid. \n\nThe interactions and differences between these three main characters is definitely the film&apos;s most interesting aspect. All three have distinct personalities that are well developed, conduct their jobs in very different ways and are portrayed by actors who always convince. The scenes that bring them together are always gripping, Ferris meeting Hoffman in Washington to devise a new plan, Hani questioning how Ferris could lie to him, the three of them discussing their mission. They all share a suspicion of one another that is fascinating to see play out.\n\nThere is a romance between Ferris and an Iranian doctor that is nicely played out and expands the characters. It also offers us an interesting look at the perception of a relationship with someone from the West in the Middle East. However, the issue is that it doesn&apos;t really fit in with the tone of the film and ends up becoming a plot device later on in the film which makes it feel rather forced. The action scenes and shootouts are always very fluid and exciting to watch. Notably, there is a weight to them that makes the injuries feel painful, these operatives don&apos;t just bounce back up like in so many spy flicks. There&apos;s a torture scene near the end that is brilliantly intense and really keeps you guessing as to its outcome.\n\nWith Ridley Scott at the helm the film is fantastic to look at and his direction is as smooth as it&apos;s ever been. In fact I don&apos;t think the Middle East has ever looked this vibrant and authentic on screen before. Scott directs the film masterfully. He manages to make the dialogue driven scenes feel just as tense as the action ones. I especially like the use of aerial surveillance, as it gave the film a much wider scope and added to the feeling of always being watched. Scott is saddled with a script that can be jargon heavy, but he&apos;s able to make it understandable and technical without dumbing it down or filling it with dialogue that nobody would comprehend. The funny thing is that this is type of film Scott&apos;s Brother Tony would usually at home doing, so it&apos;s nice to see him try his hand at it and go for a more subtle approach.\n\nDespite its amalgamation of various espionage tropes and some misplaced plot points, Body of Lies is an exceptional genre film. It manages to work as both an exciting action thriller and as a more controlled politically-charged piece. The story is packed with deception and intrigue, just right for this type of film. The main characters are well-rounded and captivating to watch, they guide us through the film and I always wanted to see what their next move was going to be. It is a layered story and it&apos;s impressive just how well it is conveyed. Plenty of praise should go to Scott, his three leading men and script writer William Monahan. They have crafted a film that is well- balanced, a vivid portrait of the CIA in the Middle East and makes a number of potentially clichéd aspects feel fresh again.",

The cop borrows this car from a night club owner and it is the secret star of this movie. It is in all the good shots, it drives over the autobahn, along country lanes, rutted tracks and eventually through an enormous, desert like gravel or sandpit. There the cop drives this beautiful but already completely battered car over the edge into the quarry pond. The girl (who throughout has an intense stare like she is truly insane) is on board, but they both resurface and spend the night together in a shack in the pit. The next day they find a farmer (or is it a hippie commune?) and they pull the car out with a tractor. Then the cop restores it on the farm (or the hippie commune?) to its old glory. Well, it&apos;s a story within a story but the only reason to watch this movie."

The cinematography, sound and set design are excellent, and the acting toned down the over-dramatization that most early &quot;sound&quot; films wallowed in.  Just view DeMille&apos;s &quot;King of Kings,&quot; directed two years earlier, to witness the advancements being made in film at the time.  From the elaborate Deco rooms, to a shanty neighborhood and mine shaft, DeMille puts on quite a show.  My only complaint would be the opening courtroom scene, which definitely does NOT set the scene for the rest of the movie.  I wonder if those &quot;aero wheels&quot; were indeed a trend in Europe at the time; obviously, the sport didn&apos;t catch on."

The music plays an important and inevitable part in the movie and of course the leading included love story between two mentally ill people is dramatic, funny and captivating at the same time.\n\nOf course it&apos;s best to see it in the original czech version! possibly with titles otherwise the main atmosphere and special taste could get lost.\n\nI highly recommend it to everyone! You won&apos;t be disappointed.\n\nThat&apos;s one of the very very few movies I will rate 10/10(if possible it would get 12/10 for the fascinating and really clever placing of the several relationship between people)\n\nA true masterpiece that should never be missed!\n\nThat&apos;s not only a movie by itself, it&apos;s a present for mankind.",

A cute story following the origin of Christmas and it&apos;s traditions, and the start of St Nicholas.\n\nThe plot is simple to follow but not overly obvious, visually is very nice to look at, and the cast cannot be faulted for the most part. Although it&apos;s good to have narration, the arc with Smith and the kids at the beginning and end is unnecessary, mostly because the acting from the kids is very stiff.\n\nNot so child-oriented that there isn&apos;t any deeper messages, but also very little in the way of upsetting scenes. Probably not a film to rewatch every Christmas, but certainly enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "Yesterday Girl follows a 22-year-old woman named Anita, who moves to West Germany in order to find a better life. The film begins with a trial where she is accused of stealing a coat from her coworker. Other than this being a minor petty crime, the judge also asks her superfluous questions about her Jewish heritage. The rest of the film continues to document Anita&apos;s alienation from society, as she switches jobs every so often and has difficulty finding meaningful relationships.\n\nThe film reflects the struggle of German filmmakers from that era to process the past and the intergenerational guilt. In the Oberhausen manifesto, Kluge and other filmmakers expressed their desire to break from the previous cinematic tradition and make something completely new. This can be seen in the style of the film which is quite different from the Heimatfilme of WW2: documentary-like, with quick abrupt cuts, use of a moving camera and a fair amount of montage. Kluge often lets the camera rather than the story itself highlight the coldness of society towards Anita and the restless pace of her lifestyle.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoyed the experimental camera techniques and storytelling in this film, but I found the abrupt cuts to be at times somewhat confusing to the storyline. If the avant-garde style is something you enjoyed and you also happen to be interested in architecture, I would highly recommend checking out Kluge&apos;s short film - Brutality in Stone.",

And I also love Juhi Chawla&apos;s role in the movie. She&apos;s also so sweet in her roles. But I guess it comes natural to her. I adore the songs in this movie. Especially &quot;Papa Kehte Hain&quot; in the beginning at the College dance. Aamir was a great performer! And the chaperones who danced in the film were great too! If anyone who reads this has not seen this movie and happens to love Hindi movies like me, you have got to watch it! You&apos;ll start dancing and singing to the songs and have a blast! Hope you love it as much as me! Bye!",

You don&apos;t need sound to be able to understand what is going through Keatons mind. It&apos;s classic scenes like that that really showcase Keaton&apos;s physical comedy and acting abilities.\n\nThe Navigator was rich with physical gags and facial gestures that Keaton is best known for. He was famous for mechanical comedy, such as using hilarious contraptions to do simple things like grind coffee. It did lack in drama, and it didn&apos;t really allow for Keatons real heart warming side to show up, like in The General.\n\nIt was a great film that was adorable to watch."

Aimee Garcia and Zenzi Williams make a great team and bring some quality acting skills to this simple little movie. All in all, this movie&apos;s target audience should definitely enjoy what they&apos;re given. The storyline is interesting and it&apos;s written well.

It may move slow for people who aren&apos;t too in to romance in general, but both men and women can enjoy the relationship that unfolds between the two main characters, with the political sub-plot and climatic fight scene blending in perfectly, and not overrunning the love story. I would also like to add that while younger audiences can enjoy this movie, the fight scene is a bit gory...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A bela e o Paparazzo&quot; tell us the story of &quot;Joao&quot; (Marco D&apos;Almeida) which is a paparazzo known as &quot;Gabriela&quot; which sells photos of celebrities to the &quot;Fama&quot; magazine (the kind of press that is always looking for news and pictures of those people, even if it&apos;s the most uninteresting thing about them – It&apos;s the &quot;pink press&quot; as we call it here in Portugal). He&apos;s working now on &quot;Mariana&quot; (Soraia Chaves), a famous TV actress, pursuing her and taking shots of her. &quot;Mariana&quot; is famous but she hates all these &quot;pink magazines&quot; and getting her personal life exposed. One day, after she almost hit a taxi, she fights with the taxi driver and &quot;Joao&quot; goes help her. The taxi driver punches &quot;Joao&quot; and puts him bleeding. &quot;Mariana&quot; takes &quot;Joao&quot; to a hospital and a friendship starts rising. She doesn&apos;t know who he is of course \n\nThis film is essentially a romantic comedy about fame, celebrities and the troubles some famous people have because of that kind of press. I didn&apos;t appreciate this new work from Antonio-Pedro Vasconcelos that much! I find the movie very predictable, short (as it doesn&apos;t have too much to tell!) and not as funny as it tries to be. I heard a few times Vanconcelos saying that he likes the American cinema because it&apos;s simple and it wants to tell a story to entertain people (it&apos;s not as deep and/or &quot;academic&quot; as a great part of the European cinema); and in fact we can notice he does such kind of cinema and with a good level of quality. Films like &quot;Os Imortais&quot; or &quot;Call Girl&quot; (both written and directed by him) are good examples of what the Portuguese mainstream cinema should be. But now, with this film, Vasconcelos went on an adventure to a new genre of cinema: the comedy! And the experience, in my point of view was not great! Everything happens so easily, there isn&apos;t a credible explanation for the actions and the motives I know it&apos;s a romantic comedy and everything in this cinematic genre is supposed to be light, colorful and easy to get, but I think in this movie the &quot;light&quot; factor is exaggerated. And it also lacks some intensity. Everything happens too fast and the end appears without notice in a very flat and unsatisfying way The acting is regular from almost all actors; I just don&apos;t like the character of Nuno Markl! I think it&apos;s not as funny as it tries to be! \n\nOn a certain way I expected more from this movie, as I really did enjoy last Antonio-Pedro Vasconcelos&apos; film &quot;Call Girl&quot;. But after watch &quot;A Bela e o Paparazzo&quot; I definitely can&apos;t score it higher than 5/10, as it&apos;s just average!",

I watched the film a day before it was released nationwide, and i was very disappointed at the result. The film plot is hard to believe at times, and only 2 or 3 scenes were of the Karan Johar quality that i used to know out of all the 3hrs and 11 minutes. The film concentrated on Shah Rukh and Rani too much, that after a while i got bored of them. The first half was very slow, and was shot in the familiar setting of Kal Ho Naa Ho. I was very impressed by Abhishek Bachchan, as he really shone in this film as so did Preity Zinta. Amitabh Bachchan was his usual great self and brought a little comedy into the film. Kirron Kehr was also appealing in the film. The second half picked up a little speed but the plot was very slow, and dragged on a little at times. The songs were pictured beautifully and i think the songs were the highlight of the film. Overall, i did not enjoy this film, and i am very disappointed at what should have been a great film to see, considering the cast and budget.",

      "reviewBody": "Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn&apos;t do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! \n\nThe acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.\n\nI have 3 more of Pialat&apos;s films in my &quot;VHS To Watch&quot; pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU&apos;S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m in any particular hurry to check them out now...",

      "reviewBody": "In Ingmar Berman&apos;s film masterpiece Smultronstallet (or Wild Strawberries&apos; B&amp;W, 1957), the protagonist, an elderly professor who is facing death, has to come to face to face with a long life that has failed to answer the important questions. He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.\n\nBergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life&apos;s most important question  that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn&apos;t exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It&apos;s a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss  the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.\n\nIn one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene  only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures loss&apos; on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.\n\nThe imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman&apos;s own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black  ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman&apos;s existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man  as futile as Sisyphus&apos; labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor&apos;s first duty is to ask for forgiveness.&apos;). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.&apos;).\n\nIzak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.\n\nThe film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic  a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?&apos; `Don&apos;t ask me.&apos; I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film&apos;s important question."

What makes this such a joy is its impish sense of humor, irreverence toward the British government, the simply delightful acting of leads McGregor and Blunt (who has never looked so good as she does here), the appealing nature of so many characters, and, perhaps most of all, its unpredictability. The audience enjoyed an awful lot of laugh out loud moments, a few tears, and a bit of excitement and danger. The film had you rooting for its the Sheik and the two lead characters -- and unlike all too many films, you don&apos;t see where it&apos;s going. If you enjoy a whopping good time at the flicks, this is a film you should see on the big screen while you still can.",

      "reviewBody": "Air Bud Entertainment has done it again and created a fun-filled family film with this follow up sequel to Pup Star. I like the movie because the story has a fun adventure and also introduces lots of new characters including the disco dog Shampoo, the perfect pal P.U.P. (Mackenzie Sol) and the &quot;catankerous&quot; Kitty Purry (Madison Pettis). \n\nThe story begins when Roland (Jed Rees) and Bark (George Newbern) kidnap Tiny (Kaitlyn Maher); or should I say dognap. Scrappy (Kaitlyn Maher) is put in Tiny&apos;s place for the Pup Star finals because Bark wants revenge on Tiny. My favorite scene is Shampoo&apos;s disco party! It is hilarious because it is quite unusual to see dogs dancing. Wow! He slides all around and spins on the ground like fidget spinner. My next favorite scene is in Kitty Purry&apos;s cat alley. When Roland enters, his clothes are in perfect condition, but when he comes out, his entire outfit is in shreds. \n\nMy favorite characters are Tiny, Scrappy and Roland. Tiny is so lovable and a great singer. Scrappy is an awesome rapper with lots of attitude. Roland thinks he is pretty smart but he&apos;s really like a dodo bird. It&apos;s so funny that in almost every scene something bad happens to him which made me laugh like a howling husky. I absolutely love the music because it includes rap, pop, country, upbeat and sad songs that draws you in and touches your heart. Kaitlyn Mayer has an amazing and versatile voice. She is able to not only sing pop but rap like nobody&apos;s business. I like the special effects because they make the talking dogs and facial expressions look so real and, by the end of the movie, I believed that dogs can really talk and sing. Can&apos;t they?\n\nI don&apos;t want to give away the ending, but you&apos;ll most likely have tears in your eyes. The heartfelt messages of the film are about sticking together and that families are better together. I recommend this to ages 3 to 13. I rate this film 5 out of 5 Pup Stars. I highly encourage you to see this film! \n\nReviewed by Abigail Zoe L., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",

Where is the balance? Being a modern, educated woman doesn&apos;t necessarily have to mean a career woman.\n\nAstitva chose to take the more direct stand of siding with the female movement. What it did not address is the group of female who are in the middle. The females who are capable of being independent, but are more interested in family and home.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the movie was putting both Sri and  Aniket (Aditi&apos;s son) in the same boat. But I guess they wanted to deal with one simple issue and keep the plot simple.\n\nThe best part of the movie (as far as the making goes) - it was exactly as long as it had to be.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Latitude Zero; here&apos;s the breakdown of my ratings:\n\nStory: 1.25 Direction: 1.25 Pace: 1.25 Acting: 1.25 Enjoyment: 1.25\n\nTOTAL: 6.25 out of 10.00\n\nI don&apos;t know which movie came out first, as both got released in 1969, but the similarities between Latitude Zero and Captain Nemo and the Underwater City are astounding. Though I will admit, I prefer the more fantastical Latitude Zero.\n\nOne reason is the script. The writers give the audience more plot, extra intrigue, and additional science fiction elements. When the story begins, we watch a bathysphere containing two researchers and a journalist get lowered into the ocean to study the Cromwell Current. But an underwater volcano has other plans for our intrepid trio when it erupts and tears the sphere away from its tether. Luckily for the threesome, a high-tech submarine is in the area, and Captain McKenzie dispatches divers to save them. But the waters don&apos;t run calm for our accidental tourists as McKenzie subs them to his submerged Utopian city. Unfortunately, the mad doctor Malic spots the Alpha on his radar and dispatches his attack sub, the Black Shark, to intercept. But thanks to Captain Mckenzie&apos;s and his second in command&apos;s skills, they reach the safely of the city. Once in the metropolis, their eyes behold wonders that stagger their minds. The overabundance of diamonds grabs the greedy attention of reporter Perry Lawton. While the two scientists are interested in the technological advancements that Latitude Zero possesses. Though the question is, will our human-weary Captain give our three explorers the chance to go topside? And, what has Dr Malic got in mind for the good Captain and his underwater haven? The one element of the story that could have been more robust is the individual&apos;s characteristics. For example, the Captain is a stoic and steadfast man whose opinions are tough to change. Yet, his traits aren&apos;t as strong as his ideals; his personality needed to be tough and less of a playful pussycat in his dandy apparel. And the two scientists needed more substance to their personalities. But as an adventure story goes, it&apos;s not too shabby.\n\nWhere Latitude Zero excels over the Hollywood flick is the imaginative use of special effects. Director Ishero Honda has a superb eye for detail, and the SFX interweave beautifully with the live-action sections. There&apos;s a lot of modelling work; this is on par with Gerry Anderson&apos;s Thunderbirds and has a similar style. One scene stood out to me most. When the Captain docks the Alpha, you see the model submarine moored against the harbour wall, and in front of them is a real ambulance and performers. This mixing of two distinct media types was tricky to pull off credibly in the 60s. And though the scene is only a few seconds long, the effect is flawless. The worst creations are the mutated flying bat-people. They&apos;re not scary, not in the slightest - you only want to set them free to fly away. It&apos;s also funny that Malic engineered this Bat-Man and Bat-Woman because Cesar Romero plays Malic - think about it - The Joker Made Bat-Man and Bat-Woman! However, I did love the flying lion. This pussy cat really can bank and dive. I was waiting for him to complete a loop-de-loop or a victory roll. The best came when he landed and began his growling attack. You can tell it&apos;s a bloke in a costume, but the garb is that good, and the bloke&apos;s actions aren&apos;t too terrible that the outrageous scene actually works - I loved it. Honda keeps everything bright and colourful throughout all the onscreen mayhem and inventiveness. For the most part, he uses a standard filming style but will slip in one or two gems, like the montage of the city, we see both genuine and model buildings, and then we zoom out and see we&apos;re looking at a model of the metropolis, as we then pan to our heroes and the Captain. His pacing of the movie keeps the storytelling at an agreeable tempo.\n\nThe actors aren&apos;t the best thing about the movie. In fact, I only chose to watch the picture because Richard Jaeckel and Cesar Romero stared. And these two actors are the best in their portrayals. Romero is ideal as the mad-scientist Malic - and his performance isn&apos;t that reminiscent of The Joker. His insanity is more sedate and a little scarier. And, Jaeckel does a decent job at portraying the reporter Lawton. He adds a smug kindness to his character that works well. Patricia Medina, who plays Malic&apos;s other half, Lucretia, surprised me. She was strong, sexy, and a woman you wouldn&apos;t want to get on the wrong side of - good thing her bo was mad.\n\nEverything considered I would joyfully recommend Latitude Zero to anybody looking for a movie to put a smile on their face. And if you&apos;re a Sci-Fi B-Movie fan and have yet to watch LZ, run and find a copy as this is a film you guys and galls shouldn&apos;t miss.\n\nShoot that darned flying lion, then take a look at my IMDb list - The Final Frontier to see where I ranked Latitude Zero.\n\nTake Care &amp; Stay Well.",

      "reviewBody": "Two twin brothers live in the Aragonese town of Tarazona, the rich Pedro married to Julia (Margot Cottens) and her daughter Pilar (Imma de Santis), and the poor Lucas, married to bossy Mariana (Maria Isbert) who continually ruins his lif and without children, both alone live to go to Madrid and have some parties. Pedro has invented the excuse of a non-existent illegitimate son, which materializes in Jorge (José María Guillén), to get money from his wife and to be able to go to Madrid from time to time to see him, and he advises his brother to do the same, that reason for he invents a daughter with the same condition and materializes her in her friend, the Revista dancer Rosina (Carmen Cervera). The situation becomes complicated when Pilar, Pedro&apos;s daughter, decides to marry Jorge, who appears to be his half-brother, and Lucas meets his fake daughter Rosina when he goes on tour to Zaragoza.\n\nLast of the ten comedies starring Paco Martínez Soria and directed by the prolific Pedro Lazaga, his first great success was ¨The city is not for me (1965). The starting point of ¡Vaya Par de Gémelos! Is the play ¡Guardame el secreto, Lucas! By Dionisio Ramos, and the result is yet another comedy, largely filmed in Paco Martínez Soria&apos;s hometown. There&apos;s an interesting sociological study of the prototype of a successful man and a failed man; showing us not only the versatility of an actor but also the explanation of how the same environment can produce such different people. Filmed during the democratic transition, the film had a great success with the public, proving to be unanimously the best of all the comedies filmed about it. And in fact, the film is quite good and contains sparkling and mischievous dialogues with many strange situations that are acceptably complicated. With special mention for the sparkling and pleasant dialogues that are established between the two brothers sympathetically played by Paco, and technically very well it turned out since both appear arguing in the same image on the screen. Starred by the always sympatheric and enjoyable Paco Martínez Soria. He started playing supporting roles in many films until 1944 when he returned to theatre as an actor and entrepreneur. His name achieved some fame between 1942 and 1944, when he was named director and first actor in the theatre company of Teatro de la Zarzuela. He returned to cinema in the rolesstudd in 1950s. In 1965 he was very successful with the film La ciudad no es para mí (La ciudad no es para mi or The city is not for me) directed by Pedro Lazaga. From that moment on, his screen character as an affectionate country bumpkin, headstrong old man did not cease to appear in films until his death with his friend Pedro Lazaga.\n\nThe motion picture was adequate and professionally directed by Pedro Lazaga. Lazaga directed various film with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria . Pedro was born in Valls , Tarragona , Catalonia , and died on November 30, 1979 in Madrid . He was a prolific director and writer , specially known for Los Chicos del Preu (1967), María Morena (1951), Cuerda De Presos (1956) and Posición Avanzada (1966). Pedro was a craftsman , a notorious director and writer who directed all kind of genres such as Peplum : Siete Espartanos , Wartime: Posicion Avanzada , Torrepartida , La Patrulla ; Drama : Rostro De Asesino , Otro Arbol De Guernica , but especially known for comedies in low budget .\n\nDirector Pedro Lazaga made , during the fifties and early sixties several films , mostly comedies : ¨Muchachas De Azul¨, Ana Dice Si¨. ¨Luna De Verano¨, ¨Los Económicamente Debiles¨ , ¨Trio Damas¨ for screenwriter and producer Jose Luis Dibildos and his ¨Agata Films Productions¨. The best of all them resulted to be ¨Los Tramposos¨. His most known films were with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria , such as : Abuelo Made in Spain , Padre De La Criatura , Alegre Divorciado , Estoy Hecho Un Chaval , Vaya Par Gemelos , El alegre divorciado, among others .",

The symbolism of the wife destroying the eagle&apos;s egg, mirrors the fact that she had got rid of their baby - the whole cause of the friction and distance between the couple. Their relationship is stretched to the limit, the tension between them, combined with the general unsettling atmosphere of being &apos;in the middle of nowhere&apos;. Lots of creepy crawlies, the haunting dugong slowly creeping up the beach, the mysterious arrows leading round and round. I really thought the tension was built up well, when Pete goes to see the family in the camper van, you realise that something is seriously wrong and even though you don&apos;t particularly like the characters I don&apos;t think we actually want them to die. I felt a bit sorry for Peter, he was trying to make an effort to rebuild bridges but she doesn&apos;t care. The film builds to a disorientating, but claustrophobic ending, getting lost and feeling alone. Then the &apos;explosive&apos; ending capped things off nicely. I liked it."

The worm effects are by the great Rick Baker, responsible for the effects in many notable productions such as KING KONG (1976), VIDEODROME(1982) and others.  The main characters are constantly on the lookout for the hungry worms and the backwoods setting adds some chills as the entire environment is unfamiliar to most viewers.  I would highly recommend this one...like I said it&apos;s a strange little flick that has been highly underrated, but i guarantee that if you see it, you&apos;ll probably enjoy it."

      "reviewBody": "Professor Owen Lansing is researching human psychic abilities hidden deep in the mind and he experiments on his young son Cameron. They&apos;re going quite well, until Cameron&apos;s unintentionally uses his powers to conjure up a demon. Lansing tries to put a end to the trouble, but his killed in a horrific &apos;accident&apos;. So Cameron goes to live with his mother and her boyfriend, but the demon also follows and takes up residence in the boy&apos;s closest. Meanwhile, police detective Sam Talliaferro, who has been put onto the case after the unusual death of his mother&apos;s boyfriend. Is having bad dreams that seem to be linked somehow to Cameron. A psychiatrist Dr. Nora Haley is looking over Sam, but she also gets the case of Cameron. She discovers the boy&apos;s secret abilities. Nora and Sam go on to connect that everything is contributed to a demonic presence who has its eyes set on Cameron.\n\nOh, &quot;Cameron&apos;s Closest&quot; is quite an unremarkable low-budget horror film. Well, it&apos;s not completely worthless, even though it&apos;s nowhere near as flavoured and exciting like many of its counterparts within the same decade. This late 80s horror junk was mildly enjoyable in some silly patches and icky make-up effects, but ponderous pacing and muddled plotting makes for mostly a bland outing that keeps us in the dark to what&apos;s going on. There&apos;s potential in the interesting and novel premise of mixing the supernatural with science (which &quot;The Howling&quot; author Gary Barndner adapted his screenplay off his novel), but director Armand Mastroianni&apos;s unevenly fruitless and ham-fisted execution leaves a lot of its brimming concepts unfulfilled and sticks to the gimmicks. Lucky there are some nicely imaginative and downright bizarre deaths handed out by the evil dweller in the closet. The nasty make-up, especially from the zombies and death scenes are well conceived. Even some atmospheric visuals, in the shape of few brooding dream sequences promise something, to only bungle it with unintentional goofiness that destroys any unsettling mood that was there. Like that of special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi&apos;s (think of E.T.) plastically tacky monster creation. Sometimes the FX is questionably dire and overly sugar-coated, just stick around for the lacklustre climax between demon and child. It&apos;s pretty hasty when it wraps it up.\n\nThe material dreams a good concept, but its talky nature, convoluted angles (so many to choose) and senseless inconsistencies engulf the monotonously vague script, which could&apos;ve done with occasional wit. The presentation is well-photographed and production values hold up, but the musical score was flat, lighting hazily dim and editing was terribly hack-eyed. The cast do a fine job, maybe better then the material actually deserved. Scott Curtis gives an appealing turn as Cameron. Cotter Smith is sturdily efficient as detective Sam Talliaferro and Mel Harris impress with a steadfast turn as Dr. Nora Haley. Tab Hunter plays the unfortunate father who cops it in the opening minutes. There&apos;s sound performances by the support cast Kim Lankford, Leigh McCloskey, Chuck McCann and Gary Hudson as the jerk boyfriend.\n\nIt&apos;s saved by over-the-top deaths, some laughably shoddy developments and capable performances. Just like Mastroianni&apos;s other genre efforts; &quot;The Supernaturals&quot; and &quot;He Knows You&apos;re Alone&quot;, it&apos;s watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "If you love the &quot;Guns Of Navarone&quot; as one of the greatest, and more importantly most literate WWII action films of all time, then this &quot;sequel&quot; is really going to cause some painful moments, and I wouldn&apos;t recommend watching the two films back-to-back under any circumstances.   Owing to the fact that it took original &quot;Guns&quot; producer Carl Foreman a decade to get the &quot;Force 10&quot; film project off the ground, Gregory Peck and David Niven were both  Social Security eligible by the time the film was ready to go, and that meant we&apos;d have to see a new cast.  And for the most part, despite the borrowing of footage of the first film&apos;s climax at the beginning you might as well watch this film pretending the first one never happened.   The &quot;Nicolai&quot; connection to the first film is weak and barely explored, and we probably could have done without that plotline altogether.  And whereas &quot;Guns&quot; was deadly serious in tone, filled with some rich character studies and literate exploration of the moral questions that get raised even when fighting a good cause, &quot;Force 10&quot; is really more of an escapist war film, punctuated with moments of light comedy, and with no depth whatsoever in the characters and script.  If one is willing to accept the film on that level, then it can be enjoyed as an entertaining diversion, but no more.   It is interesting to see Harrison Ford in his first post-Star Wars role working alongside the great Robert Shaw in his last film, and Edward Fox appears to emulate most of David Niven&apos;s mannerisms quite well.   Carl Weathers though, was an annoying distraction and the scene where he demanded &quot;answers&quot; while the enemy was approaching was just plain dumb.   \n\nBy it&apos;s very title though, &quot;Force 10&quot; is always going to have the problem of it&apos;s magnificent predecessor hanging over it.  Too bad the sequel possibility wasn&apos;t cashed in on sooner when Peck, Niven and Quinn could have still done their parts (I always hoped they&apos;d lead a new mission to rescue Anthony Quayle!)"

It is not Pulp Fiction but it is still a good performance.  Tim Roth, especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize&apos;s misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won&apos;t regret seeing it.",

It&apos;s basically an alien contact story mixed with an adventure story, with loads of mystery.\n\nThe film is beautiful to look at, and the special effects are pretty good. Sure, some of them give off that &quot;classic Doctor Who&quot; vibe, but the non-gravity stuff is pretty effective, as are some enjoyable hallucination sequences.\n\nSoviet SF (and East European movies of that period) are sometimes thought of as little more than heavy handed propaganda pieces. Sure there&apos;s some ideology here, but even the most ardent anti-communist is unlikely to be bothered by it. &quot;Science is good, countries should help each other&quot;; it&apos;s that kind of stuff. (Even the philosophizing general in the prologue isn&apos;t so bad.)\n\nIn short, Orion&apos;s Loop is smart, atmospheric, it looks great, and it&apos;s a darn good piece of science-fiction.\n\nWell worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Working on a &quot;sense of community,&quot; the two couples in Carnage engage in slowly evolving urban warfare, precipitated by violence in the playground between their two sons. This adaptation from the Broadway play, God of Carnage, is a soberer (by a little) version of Edward Albee&apos;s Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nPenelope (Jody Foster) and Michael (John C. Reilly) host Nancy (Kate Winslet) and Alan (Christof Waltz) in their Brooklyn apartment to iron out difficulties coming from their sons&apos; fight, which resulted in Penelope and Michael&apos;s son&apos;s mangled mouth. What begins civilly escalates to a raw verbal mêlée with all players laying bare their prejudices and weaknesses while the issue of the repentance of Nancy and Alan&apos;s child becomes a vehicle for class and culture clash. As in director Roman Polanski&apos;s Rosemary&apos;s Baby, the action is almost exclusively in the small, one bedroom apartment, resulting in an uncomfortable crowding of bodies and egos. And it doesn&apos;t take long for the individual differences to surface as one is conciliatory, another confrontational, another detached, and another bewildered.\n\nNor does it take long (only an 80 minute production anyway) for alliances to build (and not necessarily in the same couple) with the refrain &quot;Why are we still here?&quot; becoming the battle cry. Yes, it doesn&apos;t turn out well, nor would most confrontations except that the civil veneer usually stays intact for most of us.\n\nBut when writers Yasmina Reza and Polanski allow the characters to speak their minds, albeit helped by Scotch, the drama gets good and the words become socially lethal. What I like best is the language, not elevated but sassy, smart, and colloquial: &quot;Should we wrap this up?&quot; Yes, it is a film to be wrapped, but there is no real end to the social jousting that goes on in our minds if not our mouths, which are sometimes beaten badly as careless children might do in their play."

The acting is so over the top, really wooden and normally flicks with haunted children should be scary but here it&apos;s just laughable. Nevertheless, all imaginable effects are used. Mostly the very cheap ones, scary, sigh, lights and smoke, an annoying score, bad make-up. Really, a must see to believe but that&apos;s the problem, it hasn&apos;t had a proper release and is only available on VHS. It was made in 1990 so for the effects available then this is really a turkey. And each time you think, ahaa the end is coming something new happens. And still I&apos;m glad that I have seen it...",

A car travelling on a Tokyo street runs over an unseen mass.  The motorist gets out and watches, out of thin air, a bloodied dead man appear under the car.   The reporter investigates, and discovers that a local band of criminals is being menaced and taunted by an invisible man. The film has the usual surreal, dreamlike, sometimes humorous, sometimes touching nuances found in the more famous and available Inosira Honda Japanese monster films.  The ending has a fiery end that feels influenced by Warner Brothers&apos; 1949 WHITE HEAT.  I always have fun watching this rare film."

Perhaps the only thing I would save it&apos;s the OST.. and also I have to say that some things are not easy to understand if u don&apos;t know a bit of the ambient where it was actually filmed. I mean, being Spanish helps for that, and of course I guess there is no translation but for the subtitles but.. To sum up, do not waiste your time or money guys. The story is nothing new, this girl discovers the boyfriend cheating on her so she decides to move with her best friend to the big city, where, I have to say, things are not always like they pretend in the film. Actually nothing really happens in there, I mean, there is no exciting story at all . Regarding the actors, the guy is well known in Spain as he is leading a pop band extremely popular with teenagers, and she is a complete unknown-",

      "name": "Impressive story about accidents, regrets and mercy, making up a drama and thriller alike",
      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the Berlinale film festival 2012, where it was part of the official Competition section. In the midwinter season with a continuous (night and day) 100% darkness in Hammerfest, a women runs over someone or something when driving home. Rather than leaving her car and going back to see whether someone needs help, she panics. At home she tells her husband, who returns to the spot in question to investigate. He finds no trace of what could have hit the car.\n\nIt is not until the next day that they hear about a young girl who died due to a hit and run incident at the very same place, but no evidence was found to trace back who caused her fatal injury. From that moment on, events take their inevitable course and each subsequent step makes it more difficult to come forward. Moreover, a confession does not bring the girl back to life.\n\nThis is where my synopsis stops. I want to prevent wasting an ingeniously constructed script, where all ingredients have their proper place. A handful of human elements and sub-plots are thrown in, though not making it overly complex to follow. An example of a human element is that we observe the woman when at work in a hospital, while terminally ill patients are taken care of. A smaller sub-plot is that we see the husband at work in a &quot;gas factory&quot;, where he has a love affair with a colleague.\n\nA more important sub-plot (in light of the title) is that the son takes part in pestering an alleged gay schoolmate. It causes the latter to drop school prematurely. The son regrets his part in the bullying, and he visits the victim at home, in search for some form of &quot;mercy&quot;. The confrontation does not work out as he would have wanted, however.\n\nIs it a drama or a thriller?? Or both?? On one hand it is a drama, because everyone tries to find the best way to cope with the situation, not necessarily the human or moral best thing to do, yet they struggle to find a way out. On the other hand it is also a thriller, because throughout the full 2 hours and 10 minutes you want to know what will happen next.\n\nThe whole story spans from midwinter (100% darkness, night and day) to midsummer (the reverse), all of that located in Hammerfest, offering a colorful but harsh landscape. We knew of its existence but we never had the chance to see it with our own eyes. It forms a perfect location for the drama that we see developing. And there is the even-so perfect combination of human elements, a few sub-plots and a wonderful collection of actors. Finally, I sincerely hope that above text does not give away too much about the thriller elements, since the built-in surprises were also very important for my appreciation of this movie.",

It was a surprisingly good film. The plot did, as anticipated, contain several holes and you couldn&apos;t help thinking &quot;surely that wouldn&apos;t have happened&quot; but after all it was based on a true story.\n\nThe film is based on some unpopular high school students, (Thomas, Costa and JB) who throw a party when one of their parents goes away for the weekend and it quickly escalates out of control. The film is seemingly shot by their friend Dex on a portable camera and some other videos in a documentary style sequence. There is a good balance of dialogue, montages of general party mayhem and Thomas completely stressing out and the films great for watching with a few of the lads.\n\nThe three of us who watched it were laughing consistently throughout the film and many of the characters were very relatable. Overall (despite being extremely far-fetched) the film was relatable, although I was hoping for a bit more development on the morning after the party.\n\nDon&apos;t watch this film if you&apos;re looking for artistic credit, watch it to be entertained. This wouldn&apos;t have been a film I would have picked out myself but after watching it I would recommend it, although not one to watch with the family.",

      "reviewBody": "MAHLER ON THE COUCH ... Viewed at Los Angeles Film Festival, June 27, 2010\n\nPHOTO: How &apos;bout a little buzzmeg, mein schatz ~~ Barbara Romaner and Johannes Silberschneider in Percy Adlon&apos;s &quot;Mahler on the Couch&quot;\n\nThe latest offering from the highly respected elder statesman of German independent filmmaking, Percy Adlon, a glossy, heady, off-beat biopic about the famous turn of the century Viennese composer Gustav Mahler, his tumultuous affair and stormy marriage with Alma Schindler, a woman twenty years younger, and his presumed (but undoubtedly fictitious) couch sessions with Sigmund Freud to sort out his emotional problems when she throws him over, was definitely the class film of the 2010 Los Angeles Film Festival.\n\nThis was a world Premiere scoop leveraged by Newsweek film critic David Ansen (the new artistic director of the fest) and was attended by many of the cast and production team including Percy and his son Felix, who co-directed. The film was shown at the vast theater number one, flagship hall of the Regal Cinemas complex, and was followed by a classy cocktail reception at Trader Vics just down the street.\n\nAs for the movie: Actress Barbara Romaner was salaciously sumptuous in the slightly vampish role of Alma Schindler and Austrian actor Johannes Silberschneider was a very close look-alike of the Historical Gustav Mahler. The scenes with Freud, with a rather comic bookish version of the Big Daddy of Psychoanalysis, were the least convincing and actually play less of a role in the overall picture than Gustav&apos;s relationship with the younger Alma — and her relationships with her various other lovers. Much of the film was shot in Vienna and at the famed Vienna Opera House, which together with Silberschneider&apos;s uncanny resemblance to Mahler lent a feel of authenticity to the whole. Brilliant cinematography set the giant Theater Number One screen aglow, and the lavish production values make this picture look like a huge Hollywood production although it was actually made on a relatively modest budget.\n\nEarly twentieth century Vienna was the cultural crossroads of Europe and many of Mahler&apos;s contemporaries became international cultural icons. Among prominent historical names and personalities featured in the film are the painter and Art Nouveau genius, Gustav Klimt (Played grotesquely a few seasons back by John Malkovich in a horrible forgettable picture entitled &quot;Klimt&quot;), the architect Walter Gropius, and the famous conductor Bruno Walter. \n\nMunich stage actress Barbara Romaner makes a dazzling screen debut as the object of Mahler&apos;s obsession, Alma, and the head turner of the town&apos;s decadent elite. This is as much her film as Mahler&apos;s and she is an actress I would certainly like to see more of. The style of the film is to have many of these persons, including an actress playing the sister of Mahler, talk directly to the camera about Mahler and Alma, in sections set off from the main wide screen story as if this were a talking heads documentary, which it isn&apos;t by any means.\n\nWhat MOTC is, is a highly stylized, imaginative, and decorative dissection of an improbable but actual love affair between a famous composer and a feisty ambitious woman half his age, herself talented, who finally throws the great man over because, two children down the line, she can&apos;t stand living as a footnote to his frenzied work ethic and towering ego any longer. The death of one child acts as the fulcrum for their separation, but we feel all along that Alma has Mahler by the you-know-whats, and needs more solid loving than he can dish out. The relationship with Freud is pictured as cold, formal, and confrontational, but when they end up traveling together on a train toward the end they finally do a male bonding number as Mahler offers Freud his hand and says &quot;You can call me Gustl&quot; (the friendly nickname for Gustav) to which the eminent founder of the science of Head-shrinking replies, &quot;Well, then — just call me Siggy&quot;!\n\nThis is definitely not a movie for the truck drivers out there, but it should cut a nifty arc in proper intellectual and authentic foreign film buff circles, and may even cross over to a more general audience of the kind that likes hot love stories, pomp, and  circumstances.",

      "name": "&apos;Schiller&apos; no thriller; Casper&apos;s ghostly performance",
      "reviewBody": "During the Third Reich of 1933-1945, Germany&apos;s nationalised film industry produced more than 1,100 films. Surprisingly, only about 250 of these were blatantly Nazi propaganda: the vast majority were merely escapist entertainment. But the Nazi leaders who controlled the film industry were clever enough to realise that Hitler&apos;s cause could be furthered with movies which subtly advocated German ideals and nationalist causes ... without explicitly praising Hitler, nor showing swastikas or other Nazi symbolism.\n\n&apos;Friedrich Schiller&apos; is a film which intentionally serves Nazi agenda without being explicitly pro-Nazi. This film purports to tell the story of Schiller, the 18th-century German playwright and blank-verse poet. A contemporary and friend of Goethe, Friedrich Schiller was an important poet in his own right: his &apos;Ode to Joy&apos; was set to music as Beethoven&apos;s Ninth Symphony.\n\n&apos;Friedrich Schiller&apos; was released in 1940 (shortly after Hitler&apos;s early military triumphs) with the subtitle &apos;Der Triumph eines Genies&apos; (Triumph of a Genius). Movie audiences were clearly meant to see parallels between Schiller and Hitler.\n\nIn the title role, this film stars Horst Casper ... a pretty-boy actor whose looks surpass his acting ability. Rather than telling Schiller&apos;s entire life story, the film emphasises his early years when Schiller was a cadet in the Karlsschule (the military academy sponsored by the Duke of Württemberg) and his service in the Duke&apos;s regiment at Stuttgart. During this period, Schiller read law and medicine, and somehow also found time to write his first play!\n\nThe film depicts a real-life incident which occurred in 1781. Whilst Schiller was garrisoned with the Duke&apos;s regiment in Stuttgart, his first play (&apos;The Robbers&apos;) was performed at a theatre in Mannheim. Schiller went AWOL from his regiment to attend a performance of his own play. In the movie, this leads to a stormy confrontation between Schiller and his patron. Heinrich George gives a splendid performance as the Duke, easily out-acting the dull Casper.\n\nUnfortunately, this film tries too hard in its efforts to make 18th-century historical characters fit into Nazi agitprop. Schiller is meant to symbolise the idealistic visionary ubermensch: that rare individual who is innately superior to normal men.\n\nThe production design and the period detail in this film are impressive, and the photography (by the great Fritz Arno Wagner) is superb. The film editing is better than usual for German movies of this period. But it&apos;s all quite dull. I confess that I don&apos;t know enough about Schiller to judge the biographical accuracy of this movie, but there are several scenes in which the facts have clearly been bent to fit Nazi agenda. I&apos;ll rate this movie 4 points out of 10. It has quite a few good points in spite of its Nazi pedigree.",

I can&apos;t deny that it&apos;s part of the reason, but surely the staging and Walter Lassally&apos;s striking black-and-white photography and Irene Papas&apos; smoldering performance help. I won&apos;t give my customary synopsis, because you shouldn&apos;t need it. Nowadays we are no longer familiar with the revenge drama, which fell out of favor after the 16th century, but if you&apos;ve ever seen Hamlet, you know what it is, with its bloodiness that should soothe our own blood lust. Perhaps we need to make them more often these days, with everyone dying at the end. Perhaps it would ease some of the tensions of modern America; our politics all too often seem to be about hurting the right people; perhaps a dramatic version of the Sandy Hook Massacre would make people think twice. Or perhaps it would make them think &quot;Boy, that&apos;s cool!&quot;\n\nSuch deep philosophical questions aside, this one is worth it for the stark beauty of the torchlit night scenes, and the ancient, ruined landscape of modern Greece. Plus a heckuva story and performances.",

      "reviewBody": "INTO THE WHITE, also known as CROSS OF HONOR, is based on fact and in adapting the facts to the screen director Petter Næss along with co-writers Ole Meldgaard and Dave Mango have turned out a film that could easily have been a stage play, restricted for the most part as it is to the confines on one cabin. But then the vast beauty of the Norwegian landscape would have been sacrificed and it is that use of the bleak snow clad solitude that underlines the effects of isolation on the human response and survival under austere conditions.\n\nOn April 27, 1940, while the Germans and the British were struggling to gain control of Norway&apos;s vast natural resource to aid their war efforts two enemy fighter planes were shot down over the tundra of Norway. We meet the German soldiers first - Lieutenant Horst Schopis (Florian Lukas), Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk (Stig Henrik Hoff) and the wounded Unteroffizier Josef Schwartz (David Kross) as they struggle for survival, sleeping in snow caves and finally fining a deserted one room cabin where they settle in without much food and little comforts. Next we meet the British crew of the plane that crashed in the conflict with the Germans - Captain Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and Gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint). The Brits find the German held cabin and join the Germans in a hostile relationship: there is a constant struggle of who is in charge, the Geneva convention rules of prisoners of war etc. But gradually the friction diminishes as the five men cope with finding food, warmth, and the care of Josef&apos;s arm, which has turned gangrenous. The facades of their military personalities fade into the unique personal needs of each and the result is an improbable friendship laced with angst, philosophy, humor, and mutual caring: in the end we are all equals and &apos;enemies&apos; morph into caring friends.\n\nAs the credits role at film&apos;s end we are informed of the fates of each of the five men. The story is solid, touching, humorous at times, and carries a strong message about what war does to men&apos;s minds and It is only when isolated from the &apos;badges of countries&apos; that these unlikely men becomes bonded. A very strong film. \n\nGrady Harp",

To be honest, I got most excited on the very beginning, I really loved it. \n\nThe performances are good, but I disliked and didn&apos;t believe the performance of the man, who should have played the wooden-head general. It seemed to be too overacted. He himself lowered my rating by one. \n\nThis film might not be so interesting for people, who aren&apos;t interested in computers, because, as I mentioned upper, the plot lacks some deeper crisis, but I thing that everyone else will like it, so if you match the upper criterion I can recommend you only one thing: Go and get it!",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a terrible truth of western sensibilities that world events and history outside the direct and immediate sphere of influence usually go entirely unremarked. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only person who, owing to the lack of meaningfully broad education, has upon exploring the films of Werner Herzog learned for the first time of Jean-Bédel Bokassa and his crimes. The story of Bokassa is one that has played out across the world over and over again, especially in places where western imperialism has left countries in ruin, but as the past few years have urgently demonstrated not even the United States is safe from despots. &apos;Echoes from a somber empire&apos; paints a familiar portrait of a figure who was egotistical, narcissistic, hypocritical, and paranoid, not to mention cruel; attitudes and policies characterized by corruption, opulence, and ridiculous personal gratification on one level, all superseded on another by brutal violence, sociopolitical repression, and the codification and enforcement of strict and senseless morality; and among still other matters, denial of wrongdoing that also attempts to deflect blame onto others. It would be very easy for a documentary exploring such a person, and such a time and place, to become a simple recitation of all wrongdoing, with horrid descriptions. Herzog takes another approach, however, and as he does this film stands apart from other that may broach similar subject matter.\n\nIn his pictures both fiction and non-fiction, Herzog excels at examining humanity - good, bad, and everything in between - with the same dispassionate detachment as with which one may capture footage of a leopard mauling an antelope. Here that objectivity is turned to some degree toward showing us the complexities of an individual who was responsible for egregious violations of human rights and loss of life. The difference is that for whatever recounting we get of specific actions, including footage of Bokassa&apos;s lavish and frivolous spending, the majority of &apos;Echoes&apos; is spent giving viewers an impression of his rule through the recollections of lived experiences of those around or under him. In this regard Herzog&apos;s feature is a bit indirect, but that&apos;s just the point: sensational tales of authoritarians&apos; foul deeds tend to overshadow the stories of countless more ordinary people who are affected by those deeds, but who are no less deserving of remembrance. With this in mind, there are only so many people who can be interviewed for a 90 minute documentary, and so much information that can be conveyed therein, so one may reasonably argue that &apos;Echoes&apos; comes up short in not truly giving a complete picture of Bokassa and his rule, and in some sense minimizing what he did or oversaw. Still, the unusual tack of this movie is noteworthy for diverging from what in this genre passes for convention, and in somewhat deemphasizing and skirting around the primary subject to speak of others whose stories would otherwise be lost to time.\n\nHerzog and his crew follow journalist Michael Goldsmith as he, and not the filmmaker, revisits certain key sites, and converses with key persons. Interspersed with this is footage of Bokassa from the hopeless self-absorption and pomposity of his coronation, or from his trials, as well as still photos. We get a clear idea of who Bokassa was, but always &apos;Echoes&apos; is mindful enough not to plainly exhibit the utmost indifference toward humanity that the &quot;emperor&quot; embodied. To that end, I suppose it&apos;s fair to argue that the film treats Bokassa too lightly, but I think the point is made nonetheless. And it&apos;s all capped off with a sad, unforgettable closing shot that seems superficially out of place, yet which in its own unique way serves to accentuate the grotesque madness that enveloped the Central African Republic under the man&apos;s reign. For one reason or another I can certainly appreciate that this movie won&apos;t appeal to all comers, and the topic alone may be worthy of a content warning. However, for anyone in an interest in documentaries or world history generally, or in the works of Werner Herzog specifically, &apos;Echoes from a somber empire&apos; is another finely crafted piece of non-fiction that is well worth checking out if one has the chance.",

      "reviewBody": "The tattoos on the body, the Polaroid snaps, the notes scattered around the house, and the smoking gun evidence? Short term memory loss, happening every 15 minutes. If this doesn&apos;t seem like Christopher Nolan&apos;s masterpiece Memento, then I don&apos;t know what does. Written and directed by A.R. Murugadoss, I don&apos;t see much of a nod of acknowledgement to Nolan&apos;s work, and in almost all literature, it only falls back on the fact that this is a Hindi remake of Murugadoss&apos; own Tamil movie of the same name Ghajini, produced in 2005 (Nolan&apos;s was in 2000), which joins the ranks of films having their titles named after the chief villain.\n\nIn any case this isn&apos;t the first time that we see very obvious similarities in premise and characters being adopted for Bollywood&apos;s own productions, and the shot-in-Singapore Krrish comes to mind as well, as they had the entire setting of John Woo&apos;s Paycheck incorporated into that film. But of course in any version some merits could be found, but I believe some form of acknowledgement would be in order, other than, in this case, a quick flash of a very wordy disclaimer about Ghajini being gleaned from various short stories and material (and another paragraph which I missed given the fine print, and short duration on screen, but I&apos;m pretty sure no mention of Memento).\n\nWell, there are some reasons why I chose to watch this. First up, the music&apos;s by A.R. Rahman, and for all the good publicity he&apos;s getting for his work on Danny Boyle&apos;s Slumdog Millionaire, I just had to experience yet another piece of his musical magic on a film, besides one that I&apos;ve watched much earlier this year in Jodhaa Akbar. One just cannot imagine how his musical talent will be put to good use in a film which looks and feels like Memento, and this being the next best thing. &quot;Guzarish&quot; is a track used in the trailer, and it is currently my new ear worm.\n\nAnother reason is of course, Aamir Khan. Yet another prolific actor with a penchant for perfection, it was interesting to see how his take on the protagonist&apos;s short term memory loss, would rival that of Guy Pearce&apos;s. I&apos;m embarrassed to say I&apos;ve only seen him in action in Lagaan, so this would be yet another opportunity to witness his ability which can be measured against a benchmark. But don&apos;t expect the same though, because Pearce&apos;s version was more of a thinking man who questions and second guesses himself, while Khan&apos;s version was in two parts to serve the story, one as a raging hulk monster who tears through his opponents with savage violence fueled by anger and hatred, coupled with the hurt he experienced and recalled (Hulk producers take note, in case Edward Norton decides against any more sequels, look in the direction of Aamir Khan), while the other as mild-mannered Sanjay Singhania, CEO of a telecommunications company in Mumbai.\n\nYes, Bollywood&apos;s version naturally comes with built-in song and dance, which for once I would have thought looked quite out of place in the movie, if not for A.R. Rahman&apos;s score and music. While half of the movie might be seen as a copy of Memento&apos;s premise and character, the other half served more to allow the audience to share the pain with Sanjay. Nolan&apos;s version had you experience the frustrating condition of the syndrome through its narrative presentation, but this one junks the reverse chronology, and plays it out flat and builds a rich back story for Sanjay, so much so that you&apos;ll root for him as he goes on his rampage of revenge. You&apos;ll find yourself entrenched in the romance between Sanjay and his lady love Kalpana (the stunning Asin, who reprises her role from the 2005 version as well), who&apos;s a model awaiting her big break, and a girl with a genuinely good heart. The plot never fails to give her numerous moments to showcase her good nature, and it&apos;s no surprise why anyone would not fall in love with her instantly. Factor in plenty of lovey-dovey moments of comedy and pursuit (under the guise of a different identity, like Shah Rukh Khan&apos;s Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi) which makes it perfect for a date movie, but with hindsight that you know this love is doomed from the moment it began, which actually makes it quite sad to watch the events unfold since you know what will eventually happen to her.\n\nGhajini doesn&apos;t adopt or try to adopt those very cerebral mind-f* moments from Memento, but as I mentioned plays it out more like a straight forward action thriller, with a handful of inevitable moments of watching our protagonist get taken advantaged of because of his condition. No other structural styles are used besides flashbacks, where the purpose of two characters in the movie are to read the diary of events so that it could be translated visually onto the screen. However you&apos;ll still be kept in the dark for some time as to why the designated thugs of Ghajini (Pradeep Rawat) would want to exact their mettle onto Sanjay and Kalpana, and you&apos;ll be held in suspense for almost 2 hours before the reasons get shown.\n\nI can only imagine the flak that this film might receive because of having to adapt, and not properly acknowledge perhaps that it&apos;s not original material, save for the romantic spin on it. But if you would look past those ramifications and treat this like a re-imagining of Memento in more straight-forward terms, that this would still serve as an entertaining thriller done Bollywood style.",

      "reviewBody": "That is sad because Alfred Hitchcock was/is one of the greatest and most influential directors of all time. None of his films seen(there are still some to go) are truly awful films but he did make some disappointments. And Number Seventeen is one of them, of Hitchcock&apos;s films it is in my bottom 3 along with Juno and the Paycock and Jamaica Inn. But it is a little better than those two, because it actually does feel like Hitchcock, but unfortunately not Hitchcock at his best. The best thing is definitely the climatic train chase sequence, it is very Hitchcockian and is suspenseful, fast-paced and thrilling. The lighting and use of shadows are striking and there is some nice spooky atmosphere going on. Anne Grey is also quite good in her role, the only one of the cast who stands out in a good way. Everybody else in the cast has acting that comes across as stagy and overacted, the character of Ben is very annoying. The editing ranges from erratically jerky to sloppy, making Number Seventeen one of Hitchcock&apos;s least audacious films. There are some of Hitchcock&apos;s touches like the McGuffin and the final twenty minutes, but there is really the sense that his heart was not in it and that he had little interest in the film. The script has the odd bit of black humour, which is more nice rather than funny, but too much of the script is stilted. The story suffers from being convoluted, things being left underdeveloped and under-explained due to the too short length and pacing that is, especially in the first third of the film(the final twenty minutes is really where Number Seventeen really comes to life), as creaky as nearly broken floorboards. Overall, Number Seventeen is far from truly disastrous but a disappointing misfire for the Master of Suspense. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "After hearing Tonke Dragt&apos;s &quot;brief voor de koning&quot; was about to be filmed I really was looking forward to it. &quot;Kruistocht in spuikerbroek&quot; showed a dutch filmmaker can do really well. So when I saw the trailer and read about it, I hasted myself towards the cinema, assuming this would be a great two hours movie.\n\nIn the beginning all was fine, nice locations, beautiful costumes, all looked like it could be part of the book. But then, after ten minutes or so, the audio became very irritating with horrible lip syncing. It looked like afterwards in the audio recording studio the director forgot to show the movie and actors had to read their lines straight from paper  at once, without retries or any rehearsal. And why didn&apos;t any one bother to think about distance?? On film the actors turn their head, walk away, stand one meter from the camera or ten, but the volume is always the same.\n\nI guess I could get used to this, wasn&apos;t it for the horrible stage acting pronunciation. I mean, if an actor is on stage he should speak as clear as possible. But hey, this is cinema, the audio comes from several speakers, speak naturally, do not overdo it! Then there&apos;s the acting, how many shots did it take to make this movie, only one? Was half of all shooting days wasted on rehearsals? With every single scene I was under the impression the director shouted &quot;Great, well done! Next one!&quot; You can sometimes even see main characters without lines looking around like &quot;what am I doing here, or hey, what kind of lens is that cameraman using?&quot; And then the locations, though well chosen, did anyone really bother to recheck them before filming?? Why are electricity cables running on walls in a medieval setting? And was it so hard to cover up twenty century electricity boxes?? After this, I think it was twenty minutes into the movie, everything became very annoying. The night shots taken at day time with dark filters, but with the sunny shadows so clearly visible. The rare good acting of even fewer actors became bad, rapped by bad voice recording.\n\nAnd then, halfway through the movie I became angry, very angry, this was not a movie made to do just to the book or to entertain the audience. It was made so uninspired famous actors had a job and a film crew without any talent could make a full movie.\n\nWas it all bad then? No, the choice of many locations was great, even some actors really tried hard and costume design was great, but what remained was this horrible feeling I completely wasted my time, money and even worse, my good mood. So I left the cinema with an very angry feeling. This movie was an insult, a blasphemy of what good cinema is all about. Besides very few efforts it all looked like the makers wanted to make a very, very quick buck.\n\nBut hey, this is my opinion. I still would say, go see for yourself. But please, rent it, or much better, try to lend it from friends or family or any one who was drunk enough to buy this one, because in all honesty, the idea the creators of this flick receive any more money makes me sick: they should be in the TV business, not the film industry.",

As far as I saw, the plot is inexistent: João de Deus (Max Monteiro) is the manager of the ice-cream shop Paraíso dos Gelados (meaning Paradise of the frozen ones). He is very concerned with cleansing and demands that the girls wash their hands carefully to avoid a health problem. This pretentious film is so lame and boring that I was not able to see it until the end and I have skipped it. My vote is one.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

Violence is violence everywhere.\n\nIf you compare this movie against other great Asian action movie directors, than I think it&apos;s not that special. It&apos;s well done, but it&apos;s ultimately a light movie. A bit like an Asian version of an Hollywood action movie. There are some moments though (the end comes to mind), where the movie does show some signs of self awareness. But overall, it&apos;s a fairly straightforward, over the top gangster movie. If that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, you&apos;ll be pleased, but don&apos;t expect to be blown away by a masterpiece of cinema.",

We get a realistic glimpse into the Japanese homes, the workplace and the local eating place, as well as some Japanese customs (particularly the sumimasen), in this small 1960&apos;s Japanese town.\n\nA Hula Dance teacher is brought to a small mining town to teach Hula to the young girls in hopes that the town will create a Hawaiian tourist attraction in the near future. The young girls are presented with an opportunity to change their fate (and unknowingly, the fate of their town). The majority of the townsfolk are in complete opposition, putting the young girls at serious odds with their families and the society in which the live. \n\nThis story is loaded with dramatic personal interactions between characters. Many of the characters are developing (people becoming better persons). The sensei undergoes a bit of an attitude adjustment, inspired by her dancers. However, it is not until a climactic Hula Show that we realize the true heroine of Hula Girls.\n\nI shall recommend this to all aspiring dancers. This review was based on the Japanese film with English subtitles.",

      "reviewBody": "Arctic Blue is as eccentric and loopy as I&apos;d imagine such unique climate conditions make people behave up there. Indeed, instead of a straight up action adventure, they&apos;ve gone for something a little more meandering and amusing, sort of like Midnight Run under the midnight sun. In a sea of direct to video flicks that Rutger Hauer has done, it&apos;s tough to weed the gems from the turds, but this one is gold, especially if you&apos;re a fan of him, as well as gorgeously photographed scenery. As Ben, he&apos;s not quite hero, not quite antagonist, a wildman of a trapper who functions on instinct and has no use for the rule of law. When an altercation with a park ranger leads to murder at his own hand, Ben is set to be escorted to judgment by a local sheriff (Dylan Walsh). Walsh is green around the ears though, and Ben is determined to escape, aided by his familiarity with the land and climate, as well as his bawdy fellow trappers, who are hot on their trail. what follows is almost genre defying; it&apos;s just this side of adventure, with the slightest hint of buddy comedy and even a few mournful notes to Ben&apos;s backstory that give it that dramatic weight. I love an ambiguous character, one who makes real choices and has capacity for both compassion and viciousness in their spirit, seemingly free from the constriction of conventional plot development. Ben is his own man, and approaches both his environment and his fellow man on his own terms, which granted can lead to trouble, but is an endlessly attractive character trait to have. I think having grown up in such a rugged, untethered corner of the globe, people like Ben run on their own clock, and hum with the delirious atmosphere of such a far removed existence. The entire film has that going for it too, like everyone involved is running off of no sleep and whatever is in the water way up there in the north. A true undiscovered gem of a film, if you can find it anywhere.",

      "reviewBody": "It is a an East-German comedy, and yet it is funny, satiric and ironic. The Germans are not renowned for their sense of humour, and the Germans of the former GDR even less. Therefore this movie is a notable exception which deserves consideration. The satire is a very difficult field, because it is not easy to keep it on that thin line without falling into a spoof or a send-up, but this film manages to square the circle. What most struck me is the light touch of the director and his care of having actors play naturally like it would be in real life. Many funny situations are generated only by hinting at something and without saying it too clearly or roughly. The director is so smart in this sense, and he is so gentle in satirizing the customs of the leading class of the German Democratic Republic that the movie did not run into censorship. And yet, there could be a reason for it. Favouritism is openly practiced and taken for granted in a communist country, where everybody is called &quot;comrade&quot; and egalitarianism should be a pillar of society. If you are a politician or a high-up member of the Party every door is open to you and you are treated with more deference than rich people in capitalistic countries. You are not even obliged to respect the law. If you are just a common citizen, then you have to toe the line, stand in the queue and wait without complaining. The inventiveness of the script also attracted my attention. Starting from a simple cue, the writer finds out many funny situations which are always different and have something to say. I sincerely laughed, and I can hardly believe this if I think that the sense of humour of East-German movies - where any - is rough and can be hardly got by a stranger. Those who lived in GDR will also find in this movie what is called &quot;GDR all day life&quot;. For others like me it is an useful small window on a country and a time I know very little about. Although I already knew that egalitarianism and social justice is one of the many false myths of communism.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s nearly a shot-by-shot remake of the French masterpiece (Le Jouet - 1976). So much for saying I think!\n\nThe comparison isn&apos;t for the sake of the American movie, since that movie didn&apos;t change anything. They kind of translated the French movie to American the way they translated &quot;Le Jouet&quot; into &quot;The Toy&quot; (&quot;The Toy&quot; is what &quot;Le Jouet&quot; means in English!). The only added thing was a storyline about racism which suited (Richard Pryor)&apos;s character, and harmonized with the motif; as if slavery still exists, making the poor as the rich people&apos;s toy.\n\nBut overall nothing could reach to the original&apos;s special pace, or exceptional personality. For example, in (Le Jouet), the rich man&apos;s villa was dark, and the silence worked powerfully more than the talking. Here, forget any of that. Instead, they leaned to weak and cheap tricks like repeating the domino&apos;s fall, showing off the stepmother&apos;s body, and aiming at the adult joking (there was a purposed kick out of hearing the boy says dirty words!).\n\n(Pryor) filled it with his own buffoonery, and some funny lines, however couldn&apos;t capture the serious sense of the story, dealing with the movie as a toy itself. He was a golden star at the moment, so maybe they left him do whatever he wants. Or maybe that&apos;s the taste of his comedy anyway. (Patrick Williams)&apos;s music was very cute, but not up to (Vladimir Cosma)&apos;s tender memorable score of the original. And nothing can imitate (Le Jouet)&apos;s end, which&apos;s one of the most touching and expressing cinematic endings I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nDirector (Richard Donner), with the 2 scriptwriter, lacked the French director (Francis Veber)&apos;s smart touches while he was transforming his own short story into feature film. Yes, (Donner) made it fairly, but it&apos;s still one of his most spiritless movies that lacks the personal touch. He was executing more than creating at this break between the end of the 1970s&apos; (Superman)&apos;s movies, and his movies at the mid-1980s: (Ladyhawke), (The Goonies), and (Lethal Weapon).\n\nHave watched the original or not, this one is good, fresh and solid as an afternoon movie. In fact, its good condition is a proof of the original&apos;s beauty. Though, it&apos;s obvious that (The Toy) couldn&apos;t be as unique as (Le Jouet). I believe this is the habit of Hollywood that loves to &quot;toy&quot; with older movies, or TV shows, making them mostly easier and slighter!"

      "name": "Bad direction, bad dialogue, an unimaginative and over-done look, laughable plot twists and a collection of average actors struggling to stay afloat amide all the nonsense",
      "reviewBody": "It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age, slowly dying out in small, ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods  a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.\n\nBeing a film critic must be a hard job to do at times. Many of the films you watch will not be brilliant, nor will they be terrible  most will be OK and nothing more. Therefore when reviewers get a chance to gush, they generally take it. Likewise, when a bad film does come to the big screen and reviewers get to see it, they often will take great pleasure in putting the boot it  we see it with at least one big budget film each year (2004 was Catwoman). So I usually will try and view a really panned film because I am aware that sometimes the critics are just being unfair  however, most of the time I&apos;ll wait until it comes to TV to make that decision. With Battlefield Earth, I must concede that it is a pretty bad film  but maybe not as bad as the many critics all said, although it would be easy to just keep kicking it in the same way as everyone else does.\n\nThe film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not &apos;the worst film of all time&apos;. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms  something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.\n\nThe film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn&apos;t that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd  like a Klingon but with more bits! Similarly the transport craft and alien sets all feel like somebody has just ripped off other films and then tried to combine them; the end result is the look of a cheap sci-fi that looks like it is a sci-fi film as opposed to a &apos;real&apos; futuristic world. It is hard to describe and maybe I&apos;m doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future&apos;s of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn&apos;t help that the direction was so ham fisted that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it  a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn&apos;t have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.\n\nWith such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled  so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just soobvious and easy  there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material  but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don&apos;t even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.\n\nOverall this is a very poor film and, although I don&apos;t wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn&apos;t find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination  a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the &apos;worst film ever&apos; hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time."

One way to know a classic is how well it dates itself, not just in the vernacular, but philosophically.  How timeless are the themes it portrays and how well could anyone from any time period relate to them? In fact, of The Heartbreak Kid it could be said that a lot of the shock value of a man dumping his bride on their honeymoon will be lost on a generation that would wonder why he would want to married at all.  Well at least the title character believes in firm commitments, as long as it is with the right girl.  The point of the whole movie is the somewhat subtle ending that depicts a man who, despite the odds against him, got the girl of his dreams, but somehow dosn&apos;t find it nearly as satisfying as he would have thought.\n\nThis a terrific piece of script writing, with many memorable lines you love to quote...a sure sign of a very good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "John and Laura Baxter are living in Venice when they meet a pair of elderly sisters, one of whom claims to be psychic. She insists that she sees the spirit of the Baxters&apos; daughter, who recently drowned. Laura is intrigued, but John resists the idea. He, however, seems to have his own psychic flashes, seeing their daughter walk the streets in her red cloak, as well as Laura and the sisters on a funeral gondola...I had big expectations watching this film since it&apos;s hold as cult classic but, by the end, I was bewildered by what I had just watched. Don&apos;t look now is often described as a psychological thriller but, to me, it looks a like a patchwork. Most of the scenes are utterly pointless and add nothing to the story and also there&apos;s a lot of things that don&apos;t add up. The film relies on symbolism, injecting the color red in several scenes as well as other small details, but there isn&apos;t really a connection between all this elements so it ends up being just weird and confusing. Most of the time I found myself looking for a hidden meaning but the film doesn&apos;t have one. The camera work is truly awful with constant zooms that make the film very unpleasant to watch. And then there&apos;s the ear-splitting sound effects, oh my, they certainly got my attention but for the wrong reasons. Aside the beautiful Julie Christie, the acting was average with Donald Sutherland looking very unconvincing. I should stress that not an awful lot happens in this film. It&apos;s a film based on suggestion and imagery. In the end I thought it was extremely dull, pointless and put simply, a bad film. Maybe the film has aged poorly, or, I&apos;m one of those persons who didn&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;, but either way, this was a terrible experience.\n\n3/10"

And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that&apos;s precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.\n\nI watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co.",

Terrible script, lousy acting, amateurish directing, laughable special effects...it&apos;s just an utterly awful movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you&apos;ll realize the whole thing doesn&apos;t make a lick of sense. After spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible. In one of those hideous &quot;villain explains the whole movie&quot; sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can&apos;t be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Oh, and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. I&apos;m sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened. If for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may I suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage.",

However, it&apos;s one that has an amazingly unlikely ending and it has a few loose ends...but on balance it is worth seeing.\n\nWill is a young boy who appears to be about 8 years-old who is very sad and lonely. This is because his family are members of an ultra-religious sect and Will isn&apos;t allowed to do many of the things other kids do. However, oddly, his mother sends him to school with other kids....kids who are NOT from this same religious order. But being an oddball, he&apos;s mostly alone...that is until he meets Lee Carter, the kid who&apos;s been voted most likely to go to prison before he reaches puberty!\n\nSo what do these two boys have in common? Well, they both want to make a movie....a sequel to &quot;Rambo: First Blood&quot;...and making films and hanging with this &apos;bad kid&apos; is a serious breech of the rules for Will. And, what does a weird French foreign exchange student have to do with all this?\n\nThe film has some charming moments and the child actors did a very nice job. But the final portion of the film, while enjoyable, makes no sense and seems more formulaic than intelligently made. Still, it&apos;s a cute little film....and there aren&apos;t too many like it.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s amazing that a film as good as this one came from a small studio like Hal Roach. Sure, they released many of their films through MGM but they were tiny and specialized in short comedies with the likes of Laurel &amp; Hardy, Charley Chase and The Little Rascals--but they were not known for dramas. Well, starting in the late 1930s, the studio tried their hand at such fare and in some cases did some lovely films--and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is the best example of these new dramas.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it&apos;s much like the book and play---but with a few changes to meet the tough Production Code. The language was toned down--with swearing removed. Also, the film made a few minor changes in the play--but not many. What you see is essentially the Steinbeck story--and the studio trusted the source material enough to stick with it. They also should be applauded for picking two relative unknowns to star in the film--Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr..\n\nOverall, the film is a smashing success. The acting is very good, the direction also nice and the film kept me on the edge of my seat. The only negative, and it&apos;s very, very, very minor, is that a few of the scenes looked very much like they were filmed on a set. Still, it&apos;s one of the best films of the year and had it not come out in 1939 (the same year as &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Goodby Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; and many other great films), it might have taken home some Oscars. Well worth seeing and a great example of a film made very well on a relatively small budget.",

      "reviewBody": "Although best known for their Godzilla series, Japan&apos;s Toho Studios made many other sci fi and fantasy films. This was the first of many that would be about aliens from another world invading Earth {that idea would be later incorporated into quite a few Godzilla films}. It&apos;s dated in some respects but still pretty good fun and must have seemed quite impressive at the time of it&apos;s western release. Before that the only major film that dealt with alien invasion on a &quot;full scale,open war&quot; kind of level was The War Of The Worlds, and The Mysterians attempts even more, if not quite succeeding, in the way of spectacle.\n\nThe first half hour is terrific, the characters are briefly introduced, strange things happen and a large bird-like robot goes on the rampage in Godzilla fashion. After this,things go downhill a little bit, too much time is taken up with meetings and the lengthy battle scenes between the aliens and the humans are a bit static and go on a little too long. Nevertherless there is a charming toy-like nature to these scenes, as various futuristic weapons are employed against the invaders.\n\nSpecial effects are occasionally poor {watch out for the awful superimposed explosions} but generally better than most Hollywood sci fi films of the time. Filmed in very garish colour {which particularly highlights the alien&apos;s costumes} and with a tremendous main march theme by Akira Ifikube, the Mysterians has it&apos;s dull bits, but is still worth watching for some childish fun. Toho would perfect the alien invasion idea two years later with the incredible Battle In Outer Space."

      "name": "I Confess To Seeing This Movie In Theaters As a Child . . . Twice",
      "reviewBody": "I just thought I would get that confession out of the way and into the open. Yes, I went to see this in theaters twice when I was 11 years old. I could list to you the excuses I have, such as the fact that my parents paid for my ticket, and there were only six theaters in my local multiplex at the time, and I had already seen &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. I could go on. The truth is that when I first saw a matinée showing of this film with a friend, neither of us thought it was a bad movie. Then I went to see another matinée showing a few days later on a rainy day with my brother and a babysitter, and they both hated the film. Not disliked, mind you, but hated it. \n\nThey weren&apos;t the only ones. In the sixteen years since the film&apos;s release, I have heard nothing but bad things about it. It was released on VHS once, never on DVD, and Roger Ebert&apos;s review (&quot;I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it&quot;) is now more famous than the movie itself.\n\nAs a kid, I knew &quot;North&quot; wasn&apos;t a perfect film. In fact, its major flaw was (and still is) the major cop-out (and frankly lazy) ending that I won&apos;t give away. However, I thought it was enjoyable enough, it had a creative (but highly unrealistic) premise, and I liked (and still like) Elijah Wood. Before seeing the movie again after so many years, I wonder what I missed about it in the first place that other people didn&apos;t. After seeing it as a 27 year old, I wonder how I could have missed these things to begin with.\n\nI think what disappointed people the most about this movie was the fact that it had an all-star cast, a likable lead, an accomplished director (Rob Reiner) who had not directed a bad film before this one, and was based on a book written by Alan Zweibel, one of the original Saturday Night Live writers (who also wrote the screenplay). I haven&apos;t read that book, but the idea of a child leaving his parents is more sad than funny.\n\nWood plays a child named North who is a stellar student, athlete, and actor, yet he is worried that his parents don&apos;t pay enough attention to him simply because they ignore him while arguing one night at the dinner table. His successful legal divorce from his parents causes a contrived media circus resulting in kids having control over their parents. Such a revolution is spearheaded by North&apos;s acquaintance Winchell (Matthew McCurley), a journalist for his school&apos;s newspaper who reminded me then of Stuart Minkus from &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; but now reminds me of Dick Cheney. In an even more contrived circumstance, Winchell becomes head of a major corporation, and plots to kill North when he decides to return to his original parents.\n\nThroughout the film, North goes around the world searching for better parents. He stays with various sets of adoptive parents. They include a couple in Texas (Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire) who dress like cowboys you find at the Ice Capades, Alaskans (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) who send their elderly father (Abe Vigoda) out to sea to die in an archaic ritual that hasn&apos;t been practiced in 150 years, and Hawaiian parents who are all too eager to show North&apos;s rear end on a highway billboard. It makes me sick writing about these jokes, so you can imagine what it&apos;s like to watch it.\n\nSeeing this as a kid, I never took these plot points seriously, perhaps because I never thought about divorcing my parents. Seeing it again as an adult, here&apos;s what I missed that was so bad about the movie: the awful ethnic stereotyping that came in the form of tasteless one-liners and myopic character depictions. The worst came in the form of Kathy Bates putting on a blackface equivalent to play an Eskimo. I cringe now at the terrible joke made by the Hawaiian Governor Ho (Keone Young) about his wife (Lauren Tom) and her inability to procreate: &quot;Hawaii is a lush and fertile land. In fact, there is only one barren spot on all of our islands. Unfortunately, it&apos;s Mrs. Ho.&quot;. If I were Mrs. Ho, I would have kicked him in the balls.\n\nWe&apos;ve all done foolish things as children. My foolish thing was the 12 dollars that went to waste from seeing this movie twice (although they were both matinees, so I saved some money). The important thing is that I know better now, and I reviewed this film recently before writing this review. This rule should apply to every amateur critic on this site: the way you remember movies you saw years ago is not the same as the way these movies actually are.\n\nSiskel &amp; Ebert declared &quot;North&quot; the worst movie of 1994, and looking back, their reasoning was good. Is it the worst movie I&apos;ve ever seen? No. Worse movies came out in 1994 (&quot;It&apos;s Pat: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Exit To Eden&quot; come especially to mind), and any movie written or directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer make &quot;North&quot; look like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and I doubt Ebert would disagree. However, there&apos;s no question that there&apos;s only one barren spot in Rob Reiner&apos;s directing career. Unfortunately, it&apos;s this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "It is quite astonishing what people are capable of when their survival or way of life is threatened. In those moments, they are somehow able to employ a level of courage, perseverance, and high intention that they never knew they had. Such is the case for young Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in Debra Granik&apos;s The Winter&apos;s Bone, winner of the Jury Prize for dramatic competition as well as the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Newcomer Lawrence, a Kentucky native, is completely convincing as the 17-year-old Ree who has endured much in her brief lifetime and has plenty of obstacles yet to overcome. Living in poverty in a small house in the rural Missouri Ozarks, near the Arkansas border, she has to cook, chop wood and do whatever is necessary to care for her twelve-year old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and her six-year old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) as well as look after her mother who is catatonic.\n\nBased on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, The Winter&apos;s Bone depicts how young Ree&apos;s life is changed when the local sheriff informs her that her dad, Jessup, on the run after being arrested for &quot;cooking&quot; methamphetamines, has put the family&apos;s house up as bond and that, unless he is found and convinced to turn himself in, Ree&apos;s family will lose their house. Insisting to the sheriff that she will find him, the young girl begins a search among friends, family members, distant relatives, and the community of small-time crooks, dope dealers, and kingpins that dominate the male-dominated rural society. No one wants to talk and Ree is met with silence, hostility, and even violence. One neighbor tells her that her questioning is, &quot;a real good way to end up et by hogs.&quot; When someone asks her, &quot;Ain&apos;t you got no men folk to do this?&quot; the answer is an emphatic &quot;no.&quot; (at times, the film seems to be challenging Juno for the most quirky one-liners).\n\nRee&apos;s main antagonists are her father&apos;s terrifying older brother Teardrop, played by John Hawkes, and Merab (Dale Dickey), the wife of Thump Milton, one of the local bosses. The performance by Dickey conveys an overbearing sense of intimidation that is both real and frightening. As Ree navigates through this hostile environment, we grow to admire her determination and her willingness to confront danger in order to protect her siblings. Winter&apos;s Bone is a film about poverty and desperation but it never exploits its characters or engages in manipulation or sentimentality. Though it can be hard to watch at times, it is not as some critics have said &quot;poverty porn.&quot; There are lighter moments as well that include authentic Ozark folk music sung by Marideth Sisco and scenes of Ree teaching her brother and sister to spell, count, and perhaps more important for survival, how to shoot a rifle. She also tells her younger brother about the culture in which they live saying &quot;Never ask for what ought to be offered.&quot; \n\nThough I was riveted by the unfolding story, perhaps because of the film&apos;s high degree of stylization, I stopped short of full emotional involvement and was often conscious of the fact that I was watching a movie. Yet The Winter&apos;s Bone is a rich, satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving. Though it is stylized, it has an authenticity derived from using local residents as actors and from the director having immersed herself in the culture for two years before shooting the film. Jennifer Lawrence conveys a stoic and hard-edged individual, yet one with integrity who has somehow avoided getting sucked into the soul destructive way of life that seems to be endemic to the area. In Ree, Granik has created one of the strongest female characters in cinema in memory, one who, by her sheer will, suggests what could be accomplished if all of us could live each day as if our life depended on it.",

I loved the living house with feet, the mushroom man (who reminded me of a character from Fantasia,) and the beautiful Nastenka. This is a Romeo and Juliet story with all of the details borrowed from the Brothers Grimm and Russian fairy tales. I am sure, if I saw this as an adult, it might seem rather disjointed, but as a kid, I loved it. I saw it again a few years after the theatre release, as a Sunday afternoon television movie, and enjoyed it just as much, as an older child. Perhaps kids today would be too sophisticated to enjoy it - but I enjoyed it enough to look it up on IMDb.",

      "reviewBody": "The Spiral Staircase is one of the most eerie and atmospheric films that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The entire movie gives off a sense of malice throughout, and the use of music here is some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie. The film&apos;s plot follows a series of murders, of which all the victims are people with imperfections. Our hero is Helen; a young mute girl that works as a nurse for Mrs Warren, an old lady that lives in a big house. Aside from the old lady, also living in the house are her two sons; Albert and Steven, along with a few other people such as the maid. As the murders are being committed on imperfect women, the old lady becomes concerned for her mute nurse and begs her to leave. When another murder is committed in the house, the danger that the young girl is in becomes more apparent.\n\nThe first thing you will notice about this hidden gem is it&apos;s striking cinematography and lush settings. The film is very Gothic, and that gives it a very foreboding atmosphere. This is without doubt the best things about the film; in a dark thriller such as this, the atmosphere is always important, and as I said; this film has plenty. The film also features a lot of intrigue. As it has many characters that could be suspects, it leaves you guessing. Playing it&apos;s cards very close to it&apos;s chest, we don&apos;t find out who is the murderer until the very last minute. \n\nThe cast of The Spiral Staircase don&apos;t excel individually, but they come together very well as an ensemble. Most of them would never make another notable movie, although the majority have rather large filmographies. Robert Siodmak takes the directors chair, and he should be commended for his work. His use of the camera is excellent; the film features numerous close-ups, and when coupled with the haunting music; it makes for a great eeriness. There is one sequence in particular where the killer is watching his would-be victim from some bushes in the rain, and that with the haunting music in the background is altogether one of the most frightening sequences ever filmed. Cinematic perfection.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful example of Classic Hollywood soap opera with the elegant Kay Francis giving a truly heartfelt performance. Kay appears (not too convincingly at first, but she gets much better as the movie goes along) as a young, naive English girl who becomes impregnated by a titled gentleman (Patrick Knowles). He, being the callow character he is, already has an invalid wife (beautifully played by Freida Inescourt) who cannot bear a child. Kay allows his aristocratic family &quot;adopt&quot; her baby and she runs off to America to forget. Being a classic weeper, she of course does not forget, even though she is married to George Brent (who really is pretty good here). Eventually, a faithful friend (Roland Young who enlivens the proceedings with needed humor) conspire to bring closure to her heartache by bring the real mother and &quot;adopted mother&quot; together for a tearful, yet satisfying, ending. \n\nIt plays a lot better on film than it does in print and I&apos;m sure I am not doing it justice. All I know is that it is joyously irresistible and very moving. Kay Francis received a lot of mixed reviews for her performance at that time, but I think that she is splendid- truly an underrated actress from that period and worthy of watching!",

The girls&apos; families pays a lot of money out for their daughters&apos; travel toward the affluence, but, when the girls come to Italy, they soon find out they will never be cover beauties or salaried people: they are forced to prostitute themselves until they reach, with their work, the amount their families paid. Practically, they become slaves, continuously exposed to rapes, strokes, blackmails.\n\nThen, &quot;The Unknown&quot; moves into the comfortable world of a common North Italy town. An incredibly harsh but marvelous film. At the end, I wondered: how many stories like this happen around us and we just aren&apos;t conscious.",

      "reviewBody": "Eliza Welsh is what one of the characters in &quot;Motherhood&quot; refers to derisively as an &quot;urban mom.&quot; That is to say a young woman who lives in an upscale part of town (in this case, Greenwich Village), has a hoard of New Age-y mom friends who obsess over the ins-and-outs of successful childrearing, and herself hosts a blog dedicated to - what else? - how to survive the rigors of young motherhood without sacrificing one&apos;s identity as a woman, as a wife and as an individual. It&apos;s a battle that Eliza seems to be losing at the moment, but at least she&apos;s giving it the old college try.\n\nWritten and directed by Katherine Dieckmann, this seriocomic tale takes place on the day before Eliza&apos;s oldest child is to turn six. Filled with mixed emotions at the event and saddled with a husband (Anthony Edwards) who seems more focused on his own needs than those of his wife, Eliza struggles with arranging a birthday party, dodging parking tickets, coping with a studio-shoot on her street, looking out for her elderly neighbor, and raising a toddler - all while trying to carve out a little time for herself to write and to do all the things adults (those without children, at least) normally do in the course of their days.\n\nDieckmann&apos;s screenplay is filled with both poignancy and humor as it deftly explores the life of this harried mother. Uma Thurman, in a tour-de-force performance, captures both the manic energy and utter exhaustion of the nonstop merry-go-round that her character finds herself riding on; and she is fully supported by Edwards as her husband, Minnie Driver as her closest girlfriend, and Arjun Fupta (&quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;) as a sexy delivery boy who, for a brief moment at least, allows Eliza to let her hair down a bit and to see the heart of the vibrant, sexy, carefree woman that still beats beneath all the motherly obsessions and concerns.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s ultimately a bit too slight in the drama department for it to rise much above the level of a bemusing curiosity, &quot;Motherhood&quot; still has some valid insights to make about its subject.",

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised by this movie. Pleasantly surprised, but surprised. I bought this for $2 expecting an early, unpolished Jimmy Stewart. However, made after &apos;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&apos;, &apos;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&apos;, &apos;Philadelphia Story&apos; and other Stewart classics, this movie gives us the Jimmy Stewart we all know and love. \n\nIn terms of the rest of the movie, the plot is thin, and doesn&apos;t quite deliver on the comedic mayhem for which this story certainly has the potential. The dialogue isn&apos;t quite as quick and witty as one would like, because this is where Jimmy Stewart shines the brightest in films like &apos;Harvey&apos;, &apos;Philadelphia Story&apos;, and &apos;Destry Rides Again&apos; with his slow drawl and deadpan delivery. \n\nThe musical numbers are generally well integrated with good music, until the Caballero song towards the end which drags on too long and seems to suffer from Busby Berkeley envy. But then again, who doesn&apos;t?\n\nOverall, this is a quality film, especially for devoted fans of Mr. Stewart.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Alive&quot; is the kind of movie that you wouldn&apos;t believe if you didn&apos;t know in advance that it was based on true events. If you didn&apos;t know better, you would say it was all made up by some scenarist with too much of inspiration, looking for a spectacular and sometimes shocking script. But unfortunately enough it all really happened, which makes the movie interesting to watch.\n\nFor those who don&apos;t know the story yet, it is based on what happened to the Uruguayan rugby team during and after their plane crash in the middle of the Andes mountains in 1972. Some of them survive the initial crash, some wounded, others only with some minor scratches. They pray that they will soon be found, but no search team is coming to rescue them. At first they keep themselves alive by eating what they find in the luggage of the passengers, but soon that food is also gone. If they don&apos;t eat, they will all die. And they need to gain strength, because they need to try to get help themselves. There is only one horrible solution: they will have to eat the dead people...\n\nDespite the fact that this may sound horrible to many, I must say that it isn&apos;t as bad as you may think. Of course you&apos;ll see them cut a piece out of the bodies and eat it, but it is done in a watchable way. I&apos;m sure that only the very faint of heart will not be able to watch it. It&apos;s a part of the story, but it is never shown in a too spectacular or sensational way.\n\nAll in all this is a very interesting movie. I asked myself several times: &apos;What would you do if you were in that situation? Would you eat it or not?&apos; I&apos;m not sure, but I guess I would, but that&apos;s not why I tell you this. Just the fact that I was able to think about it in this way shows that it wasn&apos;t too bloody or with too much gore (I really don&apos;t like that). That&apos;s why I reward this movie with a 7.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I ain&apos;t no fan of chop-socky Asian martial arts movies. You could run off a list of any of the 1000 films Jet Li made before going to America and I&apos;d say, &apos;Um...Kiss of the Dragon?&apos; So, that&apos;s how bad my knowledge and devotion is. It was surprising therefore to discover that Arahan is actually a very funny and very exciting movie that zips along loud, fast and funny.\n\nSang-Hwan is a lowly beat cop. He&apos;s clumsy, accident prone and bumbles more than the average bee. He doesn&apos;t believe he has any special powers, but when he makes friends with a group of five old masters, they recognise his potential and recruits him to help preserve the balance of the world from evil...or something. Which is great timing, because an ancient bad guy has come out of a long, long hibernation to seek the key to the ultimate nirvana and spread order over the whole world...or something.\n\nYes, it&apos;s gobbledygook. In fact, it&apos;s alarmingly similar to Bulletproof Monk, only not total crap. There are loads of laughs to be had. Arahan has a great sense of comic timing and the ability to jump from silly gags to serious action in just a few seconds.\n\nWhen it comes to plain old hands-and-feet fighting, Hollywood movies seem to be lacking of late. It&apos;s all CGI and spandex. Eye candy it may be, but it&apos;s good to see something filled with practical fighting effects, despite the final showdown going on a bit.\n\nThe one bad thing that costs it half a star is the nasty Eighties synthesised score. Doesn&apos;t Korea have anything better than those shoddy Yamaha keyboards that I used in music class in high school? Hell, I could do better myself.\n\nYou can criticise the film for being mindless - hey, just because it&apos;s subtitled doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s artsy fartsy - but for two hours of fun, Arahan will do nicely.",

Really, that&apos;s the best thing I can say about this movie. The other actors simply fail to engage or deliver. I must live on a completely different planet to the Cannes Jury - because I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve experienced such stilted acting and badly written conversation since high school. The story is prosaic and predictable, the dialogue is dreadful - but Travers and Knowsley manage to transcend the words so well you actually care about them. But the other actors do not manage the same feat with the badly written repartee. I can&apos;t really blame them, but I was a little embarrassed to watch them. I kept thinking of those kids in school plays who try a bit too hard. I had no interest in the other characters&apos; lives and found myself wanting them to keep quiet. I did want it all to be better, and I expected better - but I guess all NZ films can&apos;t be independent masterpieces. The premise was promising - but I felt I&apos;d seen this story before.",

Didn&apos;t the last days of the Government (trying to manipulate even international media, telling it was ETA already knowing that it was Al-Qaeda) showed clearly what kind of politics ruled for 8 years in Spain??? I like those movies because they are so realistic and maybe &apos;low budget&apos;. But, isn&apos;t reality most of the time rather Low Budget? And although reality is sometimes boring fantasy will never be more exaggerated than reality. Look sharp and you&apos;ll find out.\n\nEveryone who is interested in the actual situation in march 2004 in Spain and the way different directors show and comment on the government politics can take a look at these shorts and build up his own mind.",

It did get a minor Oscar nomination, but I thought both the story and Ingrid were superb.\n\nThe Visit came out in 1964, late for a black and white film and perhaps that helped limit its success. I can see why that might&apos;ve been done for artistic rather than economic reasons, though. It is a character study of two main characters (Ingrid&apos;s and an old flame played by Anthony Quinn, who also co-produced) and many lesser ones, and all of their lights and darks are perhaps magnified by watching in black and white.\n\nAnd it has my favorite of all plot devices, which it uses very well. I&apos;d tell you what, but that might ruin it.\n\nI do recommend this one - and if you have Fox Movie Channel, it&apos;s on again next week (today being 7/9/05). Twice.",

      "name": "Diverting, ingratiating European gay comedy worth seeing, but `La Cage aux Folles&apos; it ain&apos;t.",
      "reviewBody": "What ever happened to the meaning of those steadfast mottos `there&apos;s honor among thieves&apos; and `blood is thicker than water?&quot;  `Das Trio,&apos; an ingratiating German-made comedy (with sub-titles) taunts and tests these age-old theories to ostensible effect.  It&apos;s a deceptively simple, amusing, if less than gut-busting tale of a rootless family of pickpockets who invite turmoil into their lot as a clash of very disparate libidos begins to chip away at the fabric of their operation.  Buoyed by expert performances, it&apos;ll keep a smile on your face at the very least.\n\nZobel is the middle-aged, hands-on leader of this tiny trio of merrie men who steal from the rich and give to themselves.  The two other cohorts are his feisty, independent daughter, Lizzi (from an incidental heterosexual liaison), and his aging, subservient, doleful lover, Karl, who conceals his advancing age with a toupee and prances about in women&apos;s gowns as an inducement to foreplay.  Somehow managing an existence all these years, their mode of operation is hardly original.  I mean, the blind man with the cane routine?  Come on.  How they survived this long, I&apos;ll never know.  As the despondent Karl grows more insecure, dissatisfied and absent-minded, the possibility of a new partner is bandied about by father and daughter.\n\nAn unfortunate accident leaves Zobel and Lizzi no choice but to prevail upon the raw talents of a young Artful Dodger wannabe, an outcast who takes in snakes as pets and writes crappy poems.  It just so happens Rudolf is also a very sexy, shambling young upstart who is only too willing to gratify the father/daughter team in whatever ways it takes to become part of the scheme team.  Complications arise, dissension grows, and most of the film&apos;s intended humor comes about as the teacher becomes enamored by his new thief-in-training, even though the boy has already taken to bedding down the daughter.\n\nGötz George as Zobel plays the roguish, Fagin-like ringleader with customary flair.  One of Germany&apos;s most popular actors, the virile actor gets to play an aging and openly robust gay character here, yet loses little of his own characteristic machismo.  Slightly softening his edges while infusing him with a gentle charm and a wanton sex drive that just so happens to be aimed at men, George provides a strong, believable center for the film.\n\nJeanette Hain gives daughter Lizzi a taut, highly appealing Winona Ryder-like quirkiness, and boyishly handsome Felix Eitner as the new third party fits the enigmatic pretty-boy part to a tee.  His Rudolf is awkward and ambitious, with a dumb-kind-of-smart off-centeredness that sustains your interest.  Christian Redl as Zobel&apos;s long-suffering lover and sycophant nets a great deal of empathy from the viewers as the man desperately tries to come to terms with his decline in importance.\n\nDirector Hermine Huntgeburth succeeds in comfortably sidestepping the negative, unappetizing aspects of her characters.  After all, why should we care about, much less enjoy, the antics of four lowly parasites of society, robbed even of a conscience when it comes to each other?  Even more problematic is the fact that we are not always clued in as to the intent or purpose of some of their hurtful, purely narcissistic actions, leaving the viewer somewhat cold and in a quandary as to who or what to root for. Credit the director and actors for nearly overcoming that big obstacle.\n\nBy the way, don&apos;t let the soft-core, erotic-looking box cover picture with two hands (one female, one male) groping a well-built young man&apos;s posterior clad only in tight underpants mislead you.  It&apos;s an obvious and unworthy ruse to accelerate rental sales.  This is NOT a titillation picture despite the fact there are a number of homosexual and heterosexual clinches throughout.  Behind it, there is actually an intelligent plot abetted by four supremely professional actors who make it all worthwhile.  And it&apos;s all capped off by a fun, wry twist at the end.\n\nAs a renter, &quot;Das Trio&quot; is a real steal!",

The reason for that was the excellent direction by Peter Bezencenet and a great turn by the always watchable Michael Medwin. Considering how well directed this film is, I&apos;m surprised to find that Bezencenet only directed four films, and only one after this film.\n\nAt two hours (including commercials) it did feel a little on the long side. But the locations, the dresses, the sharp suits, hairstyles and the oblique plot makes for worthwhile viewing.",

Considering that director David Fincher&apos;s last film about a serial killer was the gripping but deeply disturbing Se7en, his take on the Zodiac killer almost seemed primed to be an extreme, nail-biting thriller.\n\nInstead what he&apos;s given us is a well argued thesis on the possible identity of the Zodiac. While there are some very intense scenes, Fincher takes a somewhat unexpected approach on the subject. All of the killings take place pretty early on in the movie, with the bulk of the story centering on the actual investigation into the killer by both the cops and a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. In fact, the depictions of the murders are done in a manner that is fairly reverent towards the victims while still conveying the cruelty of them.\n\nSome people may find themselves disappointed by this two and a half hour epic if they go in expecting the usual serial killer fare. But it&apos;s a must see for any fan of Fincher&apos;s work, or anybody who likes a good detective story.",

Sadly, she doesn&apos;t get to perform one of her seductive dance numbers in this one, an unforgiveable omission if there ever was one.  As for the rest of the film, it&apos;s mostly Gordon Mitchell&apos;s show as he&apos;s asked to display his rugged physique in virtually every scene.  Fun kitsch, even though Chelo was wasted."

Jimmy Wang Yu of One Armed Boxer fame) as a rebel during the Manchu occupation of China and Hsiao-Chuang Kuo (billed as Kou Shu Chung) as a leader in the boxer rebellion. Some melodrama involved but mostly a fight film with Kung Fu battles occupying just about the entire second half of it&apos;s 92 min. running time. Plenty of edged weapons fighting, mostly swords, and anyone familiar with Wang Yu&apos;s fighting style will see it on fine display here. His female counterpart Hsiao-Chuang Kuo does an excellent job portraying the stoic proud rebel leader fighting overwhelming odds. She has a casual manner when it comes to execution of her fight scenes, but the choreography is wonderful. I viewed this on a pan and scan VHS under the title Fury of King Boxer, and even with the picture cropped the modest but impressive cinematography shines thru. If you enjoy the genre, especially old school martial arts, this film is for you.",

      "reviewBody": "This watchable flagwaver (made prior to the Pearl Harbor attacks)  actually the first of seven films I&apos;ll be watching to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Tyrone Power&apos;s death  has a cocky American mail flyer itching for action and joining the R.A.F. in England; though his first mission consists in merely spreading anti-Nazi leaflets across Berlin skies, he then hits upon the idea of throwing out the packages outright in order to smash the German searchlights underneath! \n\nWhile stationed in London, he conveniently runs into dancer-cum-nurse Betty Grable (amusingly drawing her attention by affecting a Cockney accent  conveniently filmed from behind, so that the actor could be dubbed!  soon after his arrival) and, despite the girl&apos;s &apos;reluctance&apos;, rekindles their affair from back home. Of course, during the course of the film, she also contrives to perform a couple of brief musical numbers and show off her famous legs a lot. Equally predictable, though, is the romantic complication wherein Power&apos;s British superior (John Sutton) also falls for the heroine, going so far as to propose to her  while amiably pompous/cynical sidekick Reginald Gardiner provides the comedy relief (just as obligatory in films of this era).\n\nEven if the film is nowadays rightly criticized for the unrealistic depiction of war-torn England, the film succeeds well enough at what it set out to do  entertain (via action, drama and laughs), but also instill in home-grown audiences a sense of duty for the war effort in Europe. During aerial sequences, shots of the actors in the studio are skillfully blended via special effects with stock footage of actual battles; still, having Power bloodily shot down at Dunkirk and then making a mockery of his so-called war wounds simply to dupe Grable into submission is a bit much! Director King helmed several of the best vehicles tailored for Fox&apos;s reigning male star of the era but, being essentially lightweight, this isn&apos;t one of them  if still emerging to be &quot;not essential but very enjoyable&quot; (to quote a line spoken by John Sutton in the film in respect to his invitation to walk Grable home) and that&apos;s mainly due to the undeniable Power-Grable chemistry displayed via their comic/romantic banter throughout the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Byambasuren Davaa does a magnificent job as the writer and director of this simple, but monumental work about Mongolia. In my opinion, this, not any of the nominees for 2009 for either category of documentary or mainstream film, was the best film from that year. Urna Chahar-Tugchi gives a once-in-a-lifetime performance as a woman who seeks to reclaim part of her past stolen by the Cultural Revolution. In this sense, the film has some parallels to &quot;The Red Violin&quot; which had been made about ten years earlier.\n\nBut make no mistake; this film is completely unique, and at a hundredth of the budget of The Red Violin, is a master work of art. Urna&apos;s smile can light up an entire valley at times; and her face is the epitome of the Mongol woman in her prime. The hour and a half went by so fast, I thought there was a glitch in the computer, but it just blew by, like the unforgiving winds of the hills of Mongolia. There are so many breathtakingly beautiful scenes within the film that they are too numerous to mention. My favorite is Urna lying in the tall grass as sunrise approaches; too beautiful for words. There are also several scenes of Mongolian cowboys, the finest horsemen in the history of the world. Even the children are expert horsemen. The music is sumptuous; and must be heard to be appreciated. It conveys the sadness of the hills and the eventual decline of the Mongolian Empire. It is clear from this film that all Western American Indians are derived from these hills as well; when Eastern migration of tens of thousands of years in the past went across the short land mass between Asia and Canada. These migrations are well-documented by several prominent anthropologists. Teepees, beating drums while dancing around a fire, and several other unmistakable similarities of the American Indian to these Mongolian hill people will convince you that these anthropologists are on the money. The twenty shades of green will numb your senses of beauty as well. No landscape in the world is as enthralling as the Mongolian hills. Do not miss this film if you love nature, music, and human emotion.",

      "name": "An intense rural drama with great cast  : Vallone , Sevilla, Mistral  , accompanied by an excellent plethora of secondary players",
      "reviewBody": "It is set in rural Spain , in the sunny summer , after staying imprisoned for ten years for a killing , Juan Diaz (Jorge Mistral , who committed suicide himself) out of prison and he meets his sister Andrea (Carmen Sevilla) , she convinces him to take vengeance against the countryman who tipped off the authorities about the man&apos;s whereabouts , which led to his subsequent arrest , both of whom pretend to kill the local Luis El Torcido (Raf Vallone) who they think he is guilty . Meanwhile , the trio is enlisted in a bunch of reapers who go to the Castilian lands to reap under a shimmer sun . Unfortunately , Andrea soon falls in love with the snitch .\n\nThis is nice picture with good production design by Enrique Alarcón , colorful cinematography by Mario Pacheco and decent interpretations . Bardem&apos;s conceptual and political audacity as well as the social critique result to be very evident in this film . Including brief social remarks and social criticism about strikes , unemployment , labouring exploitation , among others . Being first movie from Spain to be nominated for an academy award for &quot;Best Foreign Language Film&quot;. After national and international hit smashes ¨Muerte De Un Ciclista¨ (55) and ¨Calle Mayor¨ (56) , it lets Bardem to write and direct his most ambitious picture , : ¨La Venganza¨ or ¨Vengeance¨ . However , resulting in a good film but inferior than precedent ones . Bardem&apos;s main purport was to develop ¨the national reconciliation¨ issue , supported by the Communist Party , but the Franquist censorship coerces him and Juan Antonio has to change many things , spoiling his aims . As Bardem has to modify the followings : The original title ¨Los Segadores¨ or The harvesters , so that it was similar to Catalan hymn ¨Els Segadors¨ and the first script was set in 1958 , it was changed in 1931 to avoid political intention . This is an Italian/Spanish co-production , though in Italy was delivered on 12-4-1960 . The main cast is formed by a trio of famous actors , giving passable interpretations as Jorge Mistral , Raf Vallone , though mediocre acting by Carmen Sevilla as a sister of an ex con . Support cast is frankly well , including prestigious secondaries such as: Fernando Rey, Manuel Alexandre , Jose Prada , Angel Alvarez , Jose Riesgo , Conchita Bautista , Jose Marco Davo , Xan Das Bolas , Rafael Bardem , among others . Furthermore , some Italian/Franch players as Arnaldo Foa , and Louis Seigner .\n\nWell produced by Manuel J. Goyanes and powerful producer Cesáreo González from Suevia Films . Being professionally directed by Juan Antonio Bardem , though it has some flaws , dated elements and doctrinaire style . Bardem deservedly considered one of the best filmmakers of the Spanish cinema . Bardem was a good filmmaker and older brother of Pilar Bardem and son of notorious actors as Rafael Bardem and Matilde Muñoz Sampedro . Furthermore , he is uncle of Oscarized Javier Bardem , Carlos Bardem , Mónica Bardem and father of Miguel Bardem . Bardem was an outspoken critic of the Franco regime, his political views prevented him from gaining a diploma from the Spanish cinema institute in 1947 . Thereafter, he worked as a critic and finally broke into films as writer/director , being his film debut ¨Esa Pareja Feliz¨ (1951) co-directed by Luis Garcia Berlanga . He , subsequently , made ¨Comicos¨(1953) about stage world , a feeling comedy : ¨Felices Pascuas¨(54) and the too much acclaimed ¨Death of a cyclist¨ or ¨Muerte De un Ciclista¨ (1955), about an adultery and its fateful consequences , which won the 1956 Cannes International Critics Award . Other classic films he wrote or directed are the followings : ¨Bienvenido Mr. Marshall¨ (co-directed by Luis Garcia Berlanga) , ¨Sonatas¨ (59) based on Ramón Del Valle Inclan , a rural drama : ¨La Venganza¨ (57) , ¨Nunca Pasa Nada¨(63) an ambitious portrayal of provincial life that failed in box office , among others . And , of course , ¨Calle Mayor¨ based on ¨Carlos Arniches&apos;s La Señorita Trevelez¨ , it resulted to be the best one , it was voted ninth best Spanish film by professionals and critics in 1996 Spanish cinema centenary and being prized in Festival Of Venice . He had to fight the censorship which didn&apos;t admit the some engaging scenes and obligated a determined ending . During the start of filming , student protests in Madrid, led to the arrest of director Juan Antonio Bardem, a communist, in the city of Palencia and carried out by the Brigada Politica Social . He was jailed for a few days and released on the condition that he could not talk about his personal life or beliefs during interviews related to the film . After Bardem&apos;s jailing and release, he decided to stop early filming in Palencia, and shot the remaining of the movie in other cities . The big hit ¨Los Pianos Mecanicos¨ with an international cast led him to European co-productions such as the Wartime : ¨Ultimo Dia De Guerra¨(68) with George Maharis , the Jules Verne adventure ¨La Isla Misteriosa¨ (72) with Omar Shariff , the Giallos ¨Corrupción De Chris Miller¨ (72) and ¨El Poder Del Deseo¨ (75) with Marisol , Jean Seberg and the Sara Montiel vehicle ¨Varietes¨(70) . With democracy founding , Bardem made again political cinema , such as ¨Siete Dias Enero¨ (78) about Atocha massacre , ¨La Advertencia¨(82) and his final film was ¨Resultado Final¨(97) with Mar Flores . And especially his successful TV adaptation ¨Lorca , La Muerte De Un poeta¨(1987) . ¨La Venganza¨ , rating : Acceptable and passable , essential and indispensable seeing for Spanish cinema fans . Well worth watching .",

      "reviewBody": "In 1923, the Korean teenager Kim Shun-Pei (Takeshi Kitano) moves from Cheju Island, in South Korea, to Osaka, in Japan. Along the years, he becomes a cruel, greedy and violent man and builds a factory of kamaboko, processed seafood products, in his poor Korean-Japanese community exploring his employees. He makes fortune, abuses and destroys the lives of his wife and family, having many mistresses and children and showing no respect to anybody. Later he closes the factory, lending the money with high interests and becoming a loan shark. His hatred behavior remains until his last breath, alone in North Korea.\n\n&quot;Chi to Hone&quot; is an extremely realistic, sad and cruel movie about the life of one of the most hideous characters I have ever see. The impressive story has a fantastic direction, awesome interpretations and Takeshi Kitano is simply stunning. The scenes of rape, fight and brutality are amazingly well choreographed and real. The cinematography and art direction present a reconstitution along decades of Osaka, supported by one of the most beautiful soundtracks of the cinema. I regret only my lack of knowledge of Japanese and Korean histories for a full understanding of some historical moments showed along the years. This masterpiece is absolutely underrated in IMDb. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Consumido Pelo Ódio&quot; (&quot;Consumed by Hate&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "To my previous comments, I should like to add/correct. When I said that Kassagi, who plays &quot;first accomplice&quot; (1er complice), was a &apos;real-life pickpocket who served as the film&apos;s technical consultant&apos; I was not only inaccurate, but the fact that Kassagi was actually a stage magician has some bearing on the film itself, for although the scene in which the pickpockets rip off a series of train passengers is authentic in that it shows how pickpockets operate in terms of teamwork and speed, nevertheless, the moment when Kassagi (?) &apos;neatly replac[es] the lightened wallet [back] in a man&apos;s pocket&apos; is not something a real pickpocket would likely do; it is, however, exactly what a stage magician would do. A real pickpocket has no audience (or so he hopes) whereas a magician wants the audience to see him make a monkey of the hapless &quot;volunteer from the audience.&quot; In this case, Kassagi&apos;s idea (as I am sure it was) provides a brief moment of comic relief in the middle of a movie that is otherwise without a lot of humor. It is a welcome touch and Bresson was wise to keep it in. Now, I also engaged in a fallacy when I said that &apos;American pickpockets traditionally prefer to steal from behind to avoid any chance of a mark seeing their faces.&apos; In reality, American pickpockets take from behind because of necessity: even by 1959 when &apos;Pickpocket&quot; was released, American men more and more carried their wallets in the hip pocket whereas European men, as can be seen in this film, continued to use the inside breast pocket. While the business about seeing the mark&apos;s face is part of the lore of American petty criminals, it is not the cause of the American style of picking pockets, but rather a rationalization after the fact."

      "reviewBody": "In London, the sideshow troupe of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) promises to the audiences a journey to the &quot;Imaginarium&quot;, an imaginary world commanded by the mind of Doctor Parnassus where dreams come true. In the stories that Doctor Parnassus tells to his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), to the midget Percy (Verne Troyer), and his assistant Anton (Andrew Garfield), he claims to have more than one thousand years; however, when he felt in love for a mortal, he made a deal with the devil Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) trading his immortality per youth. As part of the bargain, he promised his son or daughter to Mr. Nick on the sixteenth birthday. Valentina now is almost in the doomed age and Doctor Parnassus bets with Mr. Nick that whoever seduces five souls in the Imaginarium will have Valentina as a prize. Meanwhile the troupe rescues Tony (Heath Ledger) that was hanged on a bridge by the Russians that explains why he had been chased and he joins the group. Tony and Valentina fall in love for each other and the jealous Anton discovers that his competitor is a liar.\n\n&quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; is another original movie with the surrealistic and imaginary world of Terry Gilliam and last work of Heath Ledger that had to be replaced by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell in the &quot;Imaginarium&quot; to complete the missing scenes. Further, the trio of actors has donated their income with this film to Heath Ledger&apos;s daughter to guarantee her financial situation in the future in magnanimous attitudes. The duel between Doctor Parnassus and Mr. Nick together with the vision of the world of fantasy of Terry Gilliam is awesome. For those that liked this movie, I would like to recommend the also surrealistic &quot;O Homem Que Desafiou o Diabo&quot;. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Imaginário Mundo do Doutor Parnassus&quot; (&quot;The Imaginary World of Doctor Parnassus&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In many ways, a genuine oddity. It&apos;s a period film, yet made with a very modern, handheld shakycam style, where you can barely tell what&apos;s happening, as most of the action is missed by the camera whipping past it. Some of the sound is poor, so you have to rely on subtitles, even if you can understand the German. Despite these obstacles, there are some fine performances trying to get out, and it&apos;s a heart-rending story of survival in the face of adversity that makes you very glad that you haven&apos;t had to live through it yourself. Probably worth a look for German language fans and WW2 completists, but a tough proposition for general film watchers."

Work in the lab turns the curious Kinski into a Jekyll and Hyde split personality, with the evil alter ago going on a killing rampage blamed on a pair of tramps--one of whom bears the name Polanski. Whether this is a tribute to the great director or a commentary on 19th century anti-Semitism isn&apos;t made clear, but the film DOES feature an amusing cinema in joke in the early going, when co-star Katia Christine (the Nicole Kidman lookout playing Kinski&apos;s wife) visits her father&apos;s grave, which bears the name Ivan Rassimov! A surprisingly bloodless late period example of Italian Gothic cinema, Le Amanti del Mostro is available on a grey area Shoarma DVD which also features a generous stills gallery of Kinski performances, and the crown jewel: a 1985 German television interview featuring a reticent Kinski and some amusing outtakes from his then current production, Commando Leopard.",

      "reviewBody": "Steven Seagal was so damn Awesome back in his glory days of the 90&apos;s!!! I grew up watching him beat the crap out of street scum &amp; terrorists &amp; always come back to his Classic flicks. No matter what is said about Steven Seagal these days he was a hero to me growing up &amp; i still love his old films &amp; genuinely enjoy most of his now low-budget cheap B-flicks as i still get to see Seagal taking out the trash in today&apos;s world, he&apos;s just gotten older &amp; more rugged &amp; out of shape as he&apos;s only Human!!! Seagal is an Action Legend as much as Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Van Damme are because each had their Glory days of the Box office &amp; they&apos;re all old now.\n\n My favourite Seagal film is his Action Masterpiece Out For Justice (1991) it&apos;s an incredible brutal action Thriller &amp; my 2nd fave is his excellent urban-Voodoo Gang Action Thriller Marked For Death (1990), both superb films from the Awesome 90&apos;s that i constantly watched on video. I loved Seagal during his 90&apos;s Peak &amp; also liked his serial killer Thriller The Glimmer Man (1996) &amp; Hard to Kill (1990) &amp; of course his Under Siege films which brings me to this excellent underrated Sequel, Under Siege 2: Dark Territory!!!\n\nPart 2 brings back Casey Ryback (Seagal) from the Classic first film &amp; sticks him on a train full of Deadly Terrorists who have stolen dangerous technology that can zoom in &amp; hit a target from space, pretty cool &amp; typical 90&apos;s Action Thriller stuff. Seagal is his usual Cool &amp; Calm self until he needs to be deadly &amp; is pretty much like he is in all his films except Out For Justice, anyway he brings all the kick-Ass stuff we wanna see &amp; the film feels like &quot;Die Hard&quot; on a train &amp; that&apos;s fine it&apos;s all good. I actually have always preferred this underrated Sequel over the Classic first film but that&apos;s my opinion. Another great part about this Flick is the Awesome know-the-face selection of Movie Badguys as the terrorists, we have the always great Peter Greene (Zed) from Pulp Fiction &amp; Judgment Night, we have the intense Jonathan Banks from 48 Hrs &amp; Beverley Hills Cop &amp; FreeJack &amp; we have the rugged &amp; icey-Cold scary Everett McGill from Wes Craven&apos;s The People Under The Stairs &amp; Silver Bullet, a great cast of intense &amp; great character actors as Villains!!!\n\nHere Seagal must defeat the Terrorists &amp; save his young Niece (A young Katherine Heigl) &amp; kicks plenty of Ass &amp; has a fantastic fight scene with the big main badguy Marcus Penn (McGill) it&apos;s a bloody &amp; brutal fight. All in all a Slick looking &amp; totally 90&apos;s Cool Action Thriller",

      "reviewBody": "This 1968 color German-made feature was one of the last of the Edgar Wallace series, and like the later films it introduced horror and sex elements. The earlier black-and-white films were staples on american UHF TV in the 60s and 70s, and most are fascinating exercises in style and suspense. The later color films wound up being re-titled and shown on the bottom half of double bills at drive-ins in the early 70s, where I originally saw this one, where it was released by Sam Sherman&apos;s Independent-International Pictures. It&apos;s grotesque, sleazy, and over-the-top, and introduces too many characters, but seeing it again after 25 years I still find it a worthwhile experience and a good way to waste 90 minutes. No one makes &apos;em like the Germans do!"

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve ever wanted to hear what Abe Lincoln sounded like, this is the film you&apos;ll want to see. Lincoln is portrayed by the late Canadian actor Raymond Massey - who, amongst many other roles, is also remembered from HG Welles&apos; Things to Come, the screenplay of which was written by HG Welles himself. Early in Massey&apos;s career, Lincoln&apos;s son, Robert Todd Lincoln, heard him perform and was struck by the similarity between Massey&apos;s speaking voice and that of his father. Since there are no recordings of Lincoln from that era shortly before Edison invented the Gramophone, we have to rely on descriptions of his voice. Some from that time state Lincoln&apos;s voice was high-pitched, and that Massey did not do the voice properly - however, I tend to give more credence to a living witness, Lincoln&apos;s own eldest son who, though he died 14 years prior to this film, still had the opportunity to see Massey on stage and hear his voice. Massey got it right, and this is one wonderful film - too bad I haven&apos;t found it on DVD - the next time it airs on TMC I&apos;ll have to record a DVD of it for myself.",

It is about a family who is traveling in the sea to Europe but is shipwrecked on an island and they are able to build a paradise there but are continuously faced with new challenges. There are plenty of dangerous wild animals, lack of food, and pirates come and a fantastic gun &amp; sword battle erupts near the end of the film which is not too violent for a Disney film but is very exciting. This whole movie is great, it has great scenery, excitement and great color film for a 1960 movie. You must see this! Feel free to email me with any questions or comments."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Qian li zou dan qi&apos; (&apos;Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles&apos;) is a little miracle of a film by the gifted Chinese director Yimou Zhang, an artist highly respected for his films of passion and martial arts captured in richly symbolic fashion and spectacular color. But in this film the director joins in writing a story with Jingzhi Zou that is as intimate as his other films are operatic. It is a simple, touching story told in manner that maintains Zhang&apos;s visual artistry yet goes so far beyond the glorious color to probe universal questions.\n\nGou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) lives by himself in a fishing village since the death of his wife. Apparently he was so devastated by her passing that he left his son Ken-ichi to grow up by himself, an act that Ken-ichi has never forgiven: the two men have had no contact in many years. Takata receives a telephone call from his daughter-in-law Rie (Shinobu Terajima) informing him that Ken-ichi is hospitalized with a grave illness and pleads with Takata to come visit his estranged son. Takata complies, but on arrival at the hospital his son refuses to see him. Rie shares a videotape Ken-ichi made about his obsession with Chinese folk opera, and when Takata plays the tape he sees that his son&apos;s burning desire to tape a performance by Chinese singer Li Jiamin (who plays himself) singing the greatest of his roles - an opera names &apos;Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles&apos; - was thwarted by the singer&apos;s illness at the time, Takata decides to reconcile his paternal distance and travel to Yunnan Province of China to complete his son&apos;s tape and vision.\n\nUpon arrival in China Takata discovers that the singer is in jail and he obtains the translator services of Lingo (Lin Qiu) and Jasmine (Jiang Wen) who ultimately help him to overcome the endless red tape to gain an audience with the singer in his jail. Though Li wants to sing his famous role of Takata to film for his son, Li requests that first he be able to see his illegitimate son Yang Yang (Zhenbo Yang) who has been adopted by a little village called Stone Flower. Takata, with the aid of his translators, visits Stone Flower and the people there greet Takata with warmth and give their consent to allow Yang Yang to accompany Takata to see the father he has never met. But on the road out of China Yang Yang strays and Takata and Yang Yang spend a night in the frightening depths of a canyon: they bond with complex shared needs until they are rescued the next morning. Though Yang Yang has developed a love for Takata he doesn&apos;t want to leave his village and Takata departs back to the prison alone to tell Li. At the prison Takata shares with Li and his fellow inmates photographs of Yang Yang: everyone is so moved that Li performs the opera for Takata&apos;s son on videotape as a gesture of love.\n\nTakata has accomplished his mission of reconciliation with his own son, but Rie calls him to inform him that Ken-ichi has died but left a letter addressed to Takata that explains how deeply moved the son is that his father would make the journey to China, riding alone for thousands of miles out of love. The gesture is enough for Ken-ichi.\n\nZhang tells his story in both Mandarin and Japanese and the translations reflect the differences on the two countries but also represent bridges between the ancient and the modern, between cold interior calloused heart and the warmth of love. The filming and accompanying musical score are as always in Zhang&apos;s films beautiful beyond description. This is a film to cherish, one that is so understated in its approach to father-son relationships that it will touch chords of recognition in every viewer. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "This movie explores the moral dilemmas of a woman who has beaten the system on its own terms.  Madame Xiang was sold at the age of 7 to the drunken lout who is now her husband of 20 years.  She says she cried when she was a child, but long ago she became a stolid seeker of opportunities, with a secret lover and a successful business.  Now her life comes full circle as, playing the solid patriarch that her husband could never be, she buys her retarded son a lovely young bride.  Instead of preaching, Xie Fei builds powerful dramatic episodes that make the viewer feel equally strong sympathy for Madame Xiang and horror at what she is doing.  The film&apos;s last moment, when she can no longer close her eyes to the horror, is very powerful.  The cinematography is especially effective: the lake of the title is filmed with a lyrical beauty that serves primarily to provide an ironic contrast with the unfolding events but also underpins the characters&apos; sense that beauty and dignity in life are somehow possible, somehow their right.",

But, BN is very disappointing.\n\nBecause, the story is very weak and there is nothing new in it. They could have told it in 2 minutes. And the so-called twist is very demeaning. Shankar acts well but towards the end, his role as well as character is a mark of infidelity. Harishri Asokan portrays a different role and I liked it. Rima &amp; Kanika were all wasted. Some sequences in this movie are totally inept and not at all necessary. What is shown in the first half has no relation whatsoever with the second half with the entry of a new character; number of goofs is unimaginable. Songs are futile and cinematography is poor as well. Direction is average and since the foundation itself is cranky, the whole celluloid approach gets dirty. Poor cinema. Poor execution. Poor thinking. 100% Not Recommended.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Mammooty seems to have not read the script and directly started shooting for it whereas the filmmakers thought that the cheap humor involving a condom &amp; balloon would charm the audience. Not a chance!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: No | Sex, Nudity or Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: No | Smoking, Alcohol: Strong",

      "reviewBody": "This film has probably helped to saved lives.\n\nThis is not some Hollywood schlock from the likes of HBO, but instead a thoughtful well intentioned, asking and telling of the facts of Gia&apos;s short, but brilliant life. She was truly a Shooting Star.\n\nZoe Lund tells in loving detail how wonderful shooting Heroin can be, until you think you my might just want to try it yourself, and she follows up with just what it&apos;s like when you run out. The conclusion you reach, as you listen to Zoe, is that the only way to successfully take Heroin is to NEVER start.\n\nIf you only see the HBO film &quot;Gia&quot;, you&apos;ll notice that Angelina never looked worse and the film is thin and uninteresting.\n\nYou must see &quot;The Self-Destruction of Gia&quot; if you are any kind of Gia Carangi fan, period! I was lucky enough to get tickets when it showed on the last day at the Tribeca Film Festival, and the theater was totally packed. After the film ended, everyone sat thru the credits and seem mesmerized and totally quite as the house lights came up. I&apos;ve never heard such a dead silence after a film. This film made it past hundreds of other films to be chosen to show at the Tribeca Film Festival, so I guess Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese must have liked it, as you will too.\n\nI bought the DVD online and will be holding on to this baby! Also I&apos;d like to say I think the Directing and Editing is constantly intriguing as you wait for the next probing question and honest revelation.\n\nYou don&apos;t have to know Gia before you see this film, but you will know her after you have seen it.",

The cinematography has a gloomy finish and the direction is to the point. The two leading actors form a team traveling round performing as a professional dancing couple who has difficulty making ends meet. Ebbe Rode is the dreamer and Bodil Kjer the down to earth realist. Bodil Kjer expands her image to encompass the disillusioned woman reflecting the hard life she has gone through. Ebbe Rodes disappointed optimism turn into violence with dramatic consequences. There is a poignant contrast between the claustrophobic hotel rooms and the empty big city streets. Considering the Saga Studio was scarce in administering proper budgets for their productions it is impressive how professional this film has come to look. It represents a sharp contrast to the mainly unambitious comedy outlet from that film studio.",

      "reviewBody": "I just want to respond to the criticism of this movie&apos;s use of Civil War reenactors as extras. Yes, the average reenactor is a heck of lot older and fatter than was the average Civil War soldier. Reenactors are great at dressing as Civil War soldiers, but most of them don&apos;t LOOK anything like Civil War soldiers, who were very young men reduced to sinew and bone from physical exertion and poor diet. Also, reenactors are not professional actors or stunt men which is very evident in this movie. (In some scenes you can actually see some of them staring into the camera while everyone else is looking off in another direction. Also, their embarrassing attempts to recreate hand-to-hand combat during the finale of Pickett&apos;s Charge are just pathetic to watch. Not to mention the melodramatic &quot;deaths&quot; and the guys grinning like Cheshire Cats while they&apos;re supposed to be acting as in fear of their lives.)\n\nHowever, there is NO way &quot;Gettysburg&quot; could have been made without reenactors. In order to give the movie&apos;s battle scenes an &quot;epic&quot; look, it needed several thousand extras and this film didn&apos;t have anyway near the budget to afford professional extras or travel overseas to rent-out a small European army as Hollywood films used do to. Heck, the production company couldn&apos;t even afford a decent make-up department (which is obvious from those awful, fake looking beards) let alone hire hundreds of professional extras, costume them, and train them. Reenactors, despite their faults, made this movie possible by working for free and by bringing their own uniforms, equipment, knowledge of Civil War tactics, and enthusiasm for this project. It was either use the services of reenactors or no movie about the battle of Gettysburg was going to be made.\n\nWhile &quot;Gettysburg&quot; could not have been made without reenactors, I do feel director Ronald Maxwell could have done a better job of filming around some of the more ridiculous looking ones. Instead, he almost seems to revel in showing off the fattest and oldest of the bunch- the first Confederate soldier with a speaking part is a man over 60 yrs old who had to be at least 300lbs! Now how can anyone believe that this man marched 20 miles a day in June heat while carrying a 50lb pack? Supposedly, Maxwell has learned from his mistakes. While he is justifiably proud of &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; he was not deaf to the guffaws at all those chubby Rebs and geriatric Yanks. Thus, for the upcoming &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; his casting directors were ordered to be much choosier in deciding which reenactors will be in that movie. (In other words, they were ordered to cull out the fatbodies and oldsters.)\n\nDespite being a big fan of this movie, I can recognize the weaknesses of using reenactors as extras in a period war film. However, anyone who applauds the fact that &quot;Gettysburg&quot; was ever made must also commend the dedication of those reenactors who made its creation possible.",

      "reviewBody": "It never ceases to amaze me how people&apos;s minds work.\n\nFirst, you have a brilliant actor - Kevin Spacey - pulling off perhaps the best acting performance of his career as Prot. He claims to be an alien, gets locked in mental institute (understandably), and knows all sorts of things he shouldn&apos;t know about astrophysics.\n\nSo is he an alien or isn&apos;t he? The psychiatrist, played by Bridges, tries to find out, but the question is ultimately left for the viewer to decide. That is what I love about the movie: it doesn&apos;t preach. It doesn&apos;t demand us to believe in Prot. But at the same time, the movie does raise some questions. Do we really know how the universe works? What if - that is the question this movie wants to - and manages to - raise.\n\nThen you have the ending, which isn&apos;t Hollywood-like, it only slightly touches the usual clichés about family and stuff, yet it is hart-warming and beautiful in its own silly way. I won&apos;t go deep into it so I won&apos;t spoil it for anyone, but please watch closely throughout the movie, and be prepared to use your brains a bit at the end.\n\nThe movie also plays a lot with audiovisual stuff. Beams of light are shown throughout the movie accompanied with beautiful piano music, perhaps because Prot allegedly arrived on our planet with a beam of light. This play with light makes the movie a subtly beautiful experience.\n\nAltogether, this is an incredible work of art.\n\nSo you have all this - and what do the critics say? Most of them simply call it cr*p, and if they bother to explain why they think this way, they mumble something about this movie belonging neither to the scifi genre nor to the psychological drama genre (like the critic of the Guardian magazine). Well, get this to your heads: A GOOD STORY DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO HAVE A CLEARLY DETERMINED GENRE.\n\nI repeat, in case the professional critics didn&apos;t quite understand what I said.\n\nA GOOD STORY DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO HAVE A...\n\n...Ahh, what&apos;s the use. The critics ain&apos;t gonna understand it, no matter how much I yell. Luckily, there are always people who are open to a good story. This review is dedicated to those people.",

Robinson is seeking to deport Greene. \n\nGreene&apos;s enemies have a habit of ending up dead. And our story begins with conflicted cop Brian Keith assigned to protect Ginger as Robinson tries to convince her to testify. \n\nRogers&apos;s career was on the downside here, but she&apos;s still a dynamite presence on the screen. Robinson and Keith are solid here and who would have thunk of Ben Cartright as a mobster.\n\nNice film, tightly edited, not a wasted frame in it.",

      "reviewBody": "The picture tells the authentic experiences of convicts of a prison that is a hell on the earth, reflecting the hardship existence of the inmates .We have seen men tortured,harassed and humiliated in a gaol where rules the strongest law.\n\nAn ordinary family man (Stephen Dorff, also producer) is a fine worker with a good woman(Marisol Nichols) and one son. However he kills a delinquent in loyal defense. Then he&apos;s accused and as convict is sent to a severe jail. There is harassed and humiliated until that the fury and revenge emerge. He&apos;s only helped by a con (Val Kilmer)framed for life. The film takes place into four walls of a jail and its yard involving the tough life of the prisoners.The starring confronts risks and sufferings for reaching freedom.\n\nThis interesting film is essentially developed in prison with some images out prison. The greatest part is narrated into courtyard prison because of it reflects the violent existence of the inmates, with the fights,threats,murders and where rules the strongest&apos;s law. In the picture there are thrills,violence,drama,tension and a little bit of action in the final confrontation. The picture obtained enough success, it&apos;s a real ¨Sleeper¨ . Stephen Dorff&apos;s interpretation is very fine but Val Kilmer is much better, he makes a terrific acting as the veteran convict who teaches at naive inmate to taking on the risks and dangers of the gaol ; his performance bears remarkable resemblance to Ben Kingsley in ¨An innocent man¨ directed by Peter Yates and that also has certain similarities in the argument. And of course, Harold Perrineau as sensation-hungry nasty warden is top-notch. Furthermore, the picture contains realist cinematography and atmospheric musical score. Ric Roman Waugh directs with genius and masterfully transcending the issue and gives something definitively original. The story will appeal to Prison genre enthusiast and Val Kilmer fans. Rating : Very good. Better than average, well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "It is difficult to write about this film without mentioning its theatrical origins even though whilst watching it I was at first doubtful that this had ever have been performed on the stage. Gradually the stage origin becomes apparent but there is initially so much use of physical close-ups and street location action as to not make at all obvious at first. First performed in London&apos;s West End in 1965 the play had only modest success but drew a little more attention than had the original version, apparently running some five hours. John Hurt played in the later presentation at the Comedy Theatre and when a film version was muted suggested his pal George Harrison might be approached for funding. This would ultimately result in the setting up of HandMade Films who would go on to produce many a fine British film including Withnail &amp; I (1987) which is often mentioned in the same context as this film, even though it were made some thirteen years later - it was admittedly set in the late 60s. The absurdist origins of the play/film are apparent and Beckett, Ionesco and Genet all come to mind as this swirling nihilist and absurdist drama with homosexual overtones speeds horribly, yet amusingly, out of control. Not an easy watch, being heavy in language with largely unlikeable characters but absorbing and mesmerising all the same with the most sensational central performance from Hurt and able support from the others in particular David Warner as the downtrodden, duffle coated English, rebel without a cause.",

This is definitely one of the former, though not typical of his better work.\n\nStallone will never get any respect for his acting in the mainstream press, which is too bad: if he were an unknown in this role, and had given an identical performance, the press would laud him for his ability to handle subtle bits of comedy interspersed with action and gunplay. But he&apos;s Stallone- with all the baggage that carries, both good and bad- so his work is often overlooked.\n\nIf I were assisting Mr. Stallone&apos;s career, I would have suggested putting this out in film, and keeping &apos;Get Carter&apos; for video.\n\nMadeline Stowe has always been vaguely annoying to me, but not in this film. For one thing, one has to give kudos to her for her amazing physical shape: she&apos;s beautiful, with a figure that a lot of current 20-year-olds should aspire to! She deftly handles both the comic and the pathos of the script.\n\nRent it with an open mind. I think you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised."

Every time it hits cable, I watch it.\n\n Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung play wonderfully off of each other, even in the dubbed version. The story is realistic enough to be compelling, and the action sequences are superb. My personal favorite is the battle on the bicycles in the narrow back alleys.\n\nThe one thing that has made Mr. Chan my favorite martial arts actor is the way his movies infuse humor and slapstick into serious fight scenes, and Project A, in my opinion, does that better than any of his other films.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "name": "The brilliant debut of Caro &amp; Jeunet",
      "reviewBody": "In the late 70s, french director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and designer Marc Caro met and found they shared a lot of interests in the visual arts, their friendship soon became an artistic team that would spent the whole 80s making short films where the duo was able to explore and master the cinema language, perfecting their storytelling abilities and visual design skills, preparing themselves to make a career in film-making. Their efforts were crowned in 1991, when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film, in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers: the post-apocalyptic comedy &quot;Delicatessen&quot;.\n\nThe world of &quot;Delicatessen&quot; is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse (and is now used as currency). In this post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere have found a solution to the hunger thanks to their landlord, the butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who from time to time kills the building&apos;s handyman to feed the bizarre group of tenants. One day, former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) arrives to the building and gets the handyman position, but unfortunately for Clapet and the other tenants, the butcher&apos;s daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) has fallen in love with Louison, and will do whatever is necessary to stop the madness of the delicatessen.\n\nWritten by Gilles Adrien (who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet &amp; Caro shorts) as well as Jeunet &amp; Caro themselves, &quot;Delicatessen&quot; is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected light-hearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter. And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of &quot;Delicatessen&quot; truly become the movie&apos;s soul. And not only the main characters, as every single one of them (no matter how small the role is) is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this post-apocalyptic portrait of France.\n\nVisually, the film is simply sublime. Since the directors decided to divide responsibilities, Marc Caro took full control of the production design and the artistic elements of the movie, so with this freedom Caro&apos;s inventive artistic vision reaches new heights creating a movie that could be described as a moving canvas. Highly atmospheric, the french duo takes the cinematography (by Darius Khondji) to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism, resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done. Still, the movie is more than a visual fest, as Jeunet (in charge of guiding the actors) shows a complete domain over his cast &amp; crew keeping the many elements of the film working nicely in the right place.\n\nAs written above, the characters are the film&apos;s soul, and the ensemble of actors playing them really made a terrific job in the film. Dominique Pinon (who would become one of Jeunet&apos;s regular collaborators) delivers a subtle and charming performance as the ex-clown Louison. He is very believable in the role, and gives the character a very human touch, essential for the kind of character he is playing. The same can be said of Marie-Laure Dougnac, who plays Louison&apos;s love interest, Julie, one of the &quot;more normal&quot; characters in the movie. Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story&apos;s &quot;villian&quot;, and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time (Silvie Laguna for example, is really wonderful).\n\n&quot;Delicatessen&quot; is a solid debut by this two skillful french artists, and it already shows why the two quickly became an important team in the French fantasy cinema. Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn&apos;t reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic &quot;La Cité Des Enfants Perdus&quot;), it&apos;s still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome. Unlike their later films, &quot;Delicatessen&quot; may not be for everyone, as it&apos;s mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable. However, those with a taste for the bizarre will find a great movie in this French comedy.\n\nWhile &quot;Delicatessen&quot; still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet &amp; Caro, it&apos;s not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers. This brilliant mixture of genres is definitely a very recommended movie, and like &quot;La Cité Des Enfants Perdus&quot; (&quot;City of the Lost Children&quot;), an essential film of the 90s. 8/10",

The hero of the nation who successfully eliminated external enemies, takes up the fight against internal enemies, the corrupted public servants. He is unsuccessful in the fight, gets humiliated by court, and in the process, loses his sister and brother-in-law.

      "reviewBody": "Just an ok start to the series. Enjoyable at times, but mostly dissapointing. It first traces the earlier years of recorded blues then you wonder if it will provide enough background to what their was before recorded blues. Eventually, it does. But then over does.\n\nA few highlights. Son House it appears, was an awesome guitarist. Sort of Jimi Hendrix, without amplifiers or groupies. Or maybe just without amplifiers.\n\nSecondly Robert Johnson was quite good. (Whether by nature or devil.) I do not say that, because it&apos;s been said before, but because I personally believe their was some magic in his voice and guitar playing. Beyond all the mythology, their existed a truly fascinating talent.\n\nThirdly, the importance of flute and drum related instruments to early African-American music. I was already aware of that through Lomax&apos;s recordings, but the documentary reveals it also. Of course, the flute and drum didn&apos;t make it out of Mississippi it appears, and didn&apos;t reach to St. Louis or Chicago. But yeah it was an early, and important connection to Africa.\n\nThe documentary is hosted by a young blues artist named Corey Harris, who acts as a sort of Virgil through the regions of blues. He is humble and very sympathetic. So that&apos;s nice.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the film is that it spends maybe too much time in West Africa, which causes things to dip from 7/10 to 5/10. Too bad. Maybe I&apos;m mistaken, but I think documentaries should have some propulsion.",

Images are accompanied by commentary, providing statistics (&quot;14 people died of suicide, 10 male, 4 female&quot;), and philosophical musings (&quot;maybe the truth is not only the end, but also the means&quot;). Marker also employs humor when a scene of men discussing technology and leisure is juxtaposed with pictures of cats, while obviously undermining their rambling it also offers more possibilities for interpretation. The freewheeling camera work and insistent questioning create a cachet of curiosity.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (Universal, 1944), directed by Robert Siodmak, is an interesting drama with &quot;film noir&quot; elements, (based on the story by W. Somerset Maugham which changes the local from Paris to New Orleans), starring two performers long associated with musical-comedy, Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly (on loan from MGM), in their only film together. Deanna Durbin&apos;s long awaited dramatic role, with two songs thrown in for good measure, might have earned her an Academy Award nomination, but didn&apos;t. Due to its lack of television revivals during the last couple of decades, &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; just remains only a memory to anyone who has any recollection of ever seeing it.\n\nThe story begins with Lieutenant Charlie Mason (Dean Harens) about to have Christmas leave from military service to return home and marry his fiancée, Mona, but he receives a letter written by her that reads that she has married someone else. When his plane lands in New Orleans due to a bad rainstorm, Mason, quite depressed, makes the acquaintance with Simon Fenimore (Richard Whorf), a reporter, who invites him to accompany him to a night club managed by Valerie De Merone (Gladys George). While there, Mason meets Jackie Lamont, a night club singer (Deanna Durbin), and after she finishes vocalizing, &quot;Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year,&quot; Jackie has Mason accompany her to a church. During the Mass, she starts to break down and cry. Mason covers up by placing his coat over her. He then escorts this troubled girl to a diner where she tells him her story: (Flashbacks reveal Jackie to be Abigail Martin. She meets Robert Manette (Gene Kelly). They fall in love and are soon married. Their marriage is happy and blissful for six months until Abigail learns that her husband, a troubled gambler, has just murdered his bookmaker. Abigail goes through a series of unpleasant circumstances during her husband&apos;s trial, especially when Robert&apos;s domineering mother (Gale Sondergaard) gives her a hard slap across her face for not having been a stronger influence on him after her son is found guilty and sentenced to serve time in prison.) Forwarding to the present: Abigail finishes her revealing story to Mason. She later learns that Robert has escaped from prison and is out to get her, adding more to her troubles. \n\nWhen I first saw &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; in one of its very rare television presentations on a PBS channel in 1982, I was moved by it and Durbin&apos;s performance from start to finish, and have never forgotten it. Possibly watching this movie again after so many years, I would not have that same reaction I had the first time, but otherwise, it still brings a new kind of experience in seeing Durbin in a serious role, that shouldn&apos;t go unnoticed. Durbin sings two songs, &quot;Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year,&quot; and her lovely rendition to Irving Berlin&apos;s &quot;Always.&quot; I was even surprised to find Gene Kelly playing a role against type. Still new to movies (making his debut in 1942), his dramatic acting comes off somewhat awkward. I&apos;ve seen Kelly act in other serious roles, some good, some not, but his character in this production is definitely unsympathetic. He even gets a chance to carry a gun and use it in a shoot out. No dancing for him here unless he&apos;s dodging bullets bouncing from the floor. As for Gale Sondergaard, she looks too young to be playing Kelly&apos;s mother, a role that would have been far better suited to the likes of Margaret Wycherly (best remembered for her gangster mother role in James Cagney&apos;s in &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949)), but Sondergaard doesn&apos;t disappoint with her domineering performance over her &quot;Momma&apos;s boy.&quot; \n\nAlso seen in the supporting cast is Universal contract player, David Bruce playing Gerald Tyler. Bruce would soon be elevated to Durbin&apos;s co-star in her only Technicolor musical, CAN&apos;T HELP SINGING (1944).\n\nYes,&quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; is a rare find indeed, a different kind of Christmas story, the one that doesn&apos;t get to be added in the package of other Christmas movies that air annually on television, including all versions to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1938), &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and/or &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947). While this movie has never been presented on classic cable channels like American Movie Classics, it&apos;s currently available (as of 2006) in the VHS format and can be purchased through Movies Unlimited. I recommend seeing it, at least once, if not for its dramatic content, but for its casting. (***)",

      "reviewBody": "The film talks about a young woman called Lauren Slaughter (Sigourney Weaver) who works as a lecturer and researcher at the Arab-Anglo Institute in London during day and sophisticated escort serving to VIPS by night at the Jasmine Escort Service . To supplement her income , she has a special client to British diplomatic (Michael Caine) who is acting as ambassador in the conflict amongst Jews and Palestines . He&apos;s trying to create an important peace treaty but the various confronted factions want to shatter the pacification project . \n\nThe plot isn&apos;t narrated with agility and seems to be a little forced and artificial . It&apos;s quite unsuccessful but there&apos;re pretty dialog and not much action with exception on the final reel that&apos;s fast movement and is funniest . The picture obtained lukewarm reception by the public in spite of the magnificent starring duo and was a flop and barely made monetary box office . Although technically well realized is mediocre and doesn&apos;t offer surprises . The motion picture is classified ¨R¨ as abounds the nudism in charge of Sigourney Weaver as an escort becomes a pawn in some very dark politics , violence when the murders happen , sexual themes and profanity . The support cast though unknown is very secondary , the film is mainly interpreted by two exceptional actors : Weaver and Caine . The movie was regularly directed by Bob Swaim . The film will appeal to excellent protagonist pair fans . Rating : Mediocre and entertaining .",

      "reviewBody": "...I managed to pack into a dozen scenes with the whole period of Nazi tyranny in a convincingly evil way.&quot; - Malcolm McDowell about his work in The Passage. \n\nWhen I saw The Passage back in 1981, in Moscow, I had no idea that it had been a big flop in the USA where it only lasted a week upon theatrical release, that it was considered a bad movie a failure. It would be much later that I recognized very famous and talented actors who were in the film, James Matson, Anthony Quinn, Christopher Lee, and Patricia Neal. The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson, the Oscar nominated director of highly successful The Guns of Navarone (1961). By the time I was watching The Passage at the theater, I had not seen Stanley Kubrick&apos;s A Clock Work Orange or notorious Caligula, and I did not know what Malcolm McDowell was capable of as a screen villain. I did know McDowell from the Lindsay Anderson&apos;s O Lucky Man that also had been released theatrically in Moscow several years prior The Passage. O lucky Man had left a deep impression on me and huge part of it was McDowell&apos;s performance as Mick Travis, the young naive man with the most charming smile who wanted to succeed in this world. Watching McDowell in The Passage playing the psychotic obsessed Nazi chasing the family of the anti-fascist scientist across the Pyrenees I was horrified and genuinely scared. Every time he would enter the screen, I felt physically sick anticipating some horror act to follow and McDowell never disappointed. I won&apos;t argue that the movie may not be a great or even a good one but I do remember McDowell&apos;s performance all too well, and I could not forget him in the movie for 28 years. Now, after I&apos;ve seen so many movies and memorable performances, I realize that McDowell was over the top and judging by his own words, he knew it very well and did it on purpose: \n\n&quot;I played this real nasty Nazi who was chasing these people across the Pyrenees. We all knew real early on that the movie was not going to be any great work of art and so I was determined to have some fun with it. My attitude was that if I was going to play a Nazi, I was going to take it totally over the top and do it right. I ended up playing the character like a pantomime queen. What I was doing was so far out that James Mason turned to me one day and said, &apos;That&apos;s wonderful dear boy, but are you in our film? You seem to be doing something different from the rest of us&apos;...&quot; \n\nIf after so many years, one performance in a supposedly bad movie stands out and you can&apos;t get it out of your mind, and you remember the exact day when you saw that movie, who you saw it with and how you felt, for me it means that the movie was not bad at all.",

      "reviewBody": "In this documentary that won a Sundance prize for its cinematography Mahmoud al Massad films ex-Mujahideen member Abu Amar, a bearded, devout Muslim man in traditional dress who is forced to survive by collecting cardboard boxes in his little blue truck with the help of his sons and selling them to a recycling center. We&apos;re in a poor part of Jordan&apos;s second city, Zarqa, from which both filmmaker and his subject come. Abu Amar is rarely without his little son Abu Bakr, who even gets to take the wheel sitting in his lap. We don&apos;t meet the other sons or the several wives or other family members. In a Christian hospital we see his present wife just in one scene, momentarily unveiled for an interview about pregnancy. We often see friends, never identified, who discuss politics and economics. We also see that Abu Amar prays according to the requirements of Islam throughout the day, and goes to hear a fiery Friday sermon.\n\nEarly on Abu Amar and his friends talk about Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaida leader later killed by the US in Iraq. We see Abu Amar watching al-Zarqawi himself talking about Iraq on a TV station. Later Abu Amar watches Bush&apos;s announcement of the targeted killing on television. Al-Zarqawi came from the same neighborhood of Zarqa, but the locals agree he was an ordinary man, drove a bus, was a faceless city hall clerk, had little education, and wasn&apos;t even religious. They never even saw him at the mosque. &quot;Who would think a man from this place would aggravate the whole world?&quot; one says.\n\nOne thing they agree on is that &apos;jihad&apos; is something that it it is legitimate to turn to under certain circumstances. They express sympathy and understanding for those who organize to fight against the US occupiers, but they also insist that those who become &apos;jihadis&apos; do so only when government oppression or economic conditions or both have made them turn desperate. They also note, apropos of al-Zarqawi&apos;s apparent 180-degree shift, that turning to the mosque and the Koran sometimes is also the only help available in their country for a person fighting addiction to women, pills, or alcohol.\n\nAbu Amar was in Afghanistan, but only as a security guard for Mujahideen leaders. He consequently laughs when asked by the director if he learned about their ideas through working with them.\n\nWhen three Amman hotels are bombed on November 9, 2005 and Al-Qaida takes credit, Abu Amar is rounded up and held for four months as a suspect, then found innocent and released. He expresses gratitude for his release: justice was done, he says. He doesn&apos;t seem resentful.\n\nAbu Amar traces all his current financial problems back to a major rift with his father--causes unspecified-- that forced them to close a commercial space where they were going to open a business. Abu Amar now only goes and lets himself in this space at night. There he has a typewriter and a plastic bag full of Islamic quotations. With the aid of these, he is working on a book which he can&apos;t get published. We see him typing away at it, and later reading to friends a passage arguing that it is wrong for Muslims to live in kaafir or &quot;infidel&quot; (non-Muslim) countries; that even converts to Islam should migrate to a Muslim country. This extremely narrow position appears ironic in the light of a step Abu Amar takes at the end of the film.\n\nWhether by choice or by necessity, al Massad doesn&apos;t present a very complete picture of Abu Amar&apos;s milieu. It&apos;s perhaps because of the latter&apos;s strict Muslim principles that not much about his family is revealed beyond his close, if stern, interaction with his little boy. What we get to see is a man doing all he can to hold onto self-respect in a dead-end situation. His night typing on his manuscript seems done mainly to reassure himself that his former commitment and his informal religious studies have some value, rather than with the hope of his writings ever seeing the light of day. Even getting camel&apos;s milk for his sick mother is a frustrating, doggedly pursued process that takes repeated trips. Despite his expressions of faith and hope, his patience and his machismo, finally Abu Amar comes to seem a rather pathetic figure. Perhaps al Massad&apos;s portrait is all the more troubling and memorable for its very incompleteness. The man he is looking at is himself incomplete. The restrained portrait, which takes us up close without seeking to explain, is one whose implications are worth pondering.\n\nSeen at the San Francisco International Film Festival, 2008.",

      "reviewBody": "Bag it is a documentary with a simple and important message; our disposable society needs to change if we are to survive as a species. We are now using 1milion plastic bags per minute. Quite a few countries have banned their use including New Dehli, India, where they were clogging the drains and causing floods. Jeb Berrier travels from city to city and nation to nation illustrating the different ways they are dealing with the problem. \n\nBerrier is sort of a less sarcastic and non confrontational version of Michael Moore. His wife is pregnant with their first child, so he is concerned about his baby&apos;s future. The numbers are staggering; 2 million plastic bottles every 5 minutes, requiring 17 million barrels of oil to produce and 12 billion dollars spent every year on bottled water. \n\nRecycling turns out not to be the simple solution either, as every locale has vastly different guidelines with many categories. 260 million tons of plastic ends up in the oceans from around the world annually, resulting in fish and birds, and in one particularity sad example, albatross&apos;s ingesting it as food and dying. \n\nThe last issue raised is the production of baby bottles and other products requiring BPA to produce. This chemical has been shown to increase the risk of cancer, diabetes, and to drastically alter the hormones levels in newborns.\n\nBerrier has a light touch with an important topic and at 78 minutes, it is well edited with important information without being too preachy and he is a very likable host. Spread the word about this vital documentary and maybe we can make a difference.",

They decided to salvage as much footage as they could with longshots and rears. Shaw&apos;s voice was weak so whole scenes were dubbed. \n\nThe result was an 85 minute action adventure story with a lot of holes in the story about a Russian general, Shaw, defecting to the west. Lee Marvin, Linda Evans, Michael Connors and would you believe Joe Namath are the CIA agents bringing him out and for some reason decide train travel is best. This is an obvious homage to Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s The Lady Vanishes, but I&apos;m sure Hitchcock would not have been flattered with the comparison had the master of suspense saw this film before he died.\n\nThe rest of the players try their best and Maximilian Schell as the KGB guy assigned to kill Shaw before he makes it out of Europe is quite good. As an actor however Joe Namath is a great quarterback, in his few scenes he&apos;s painful to watch dealing with the dialog, limited though it was in his case.\n\nI do feel sorry for Robert Shaw because of the many fine performances he did give us on the big and small screen. My first memory of him was in a short lived British syndicated television series The Buccaneers and that had far more going for it than Avalanche Express.\n\nHad Shaw lived and the movie going public got to see what would have been the story they wanted to bring us, would we have liked it? Hard to speculate, but I&apos;d stay clear of this unless you want to see a nice big avalanche nearly engulf a train with nearly all the cast on it.",

      "reviewBody": "Alex De la Iglesia is an excellent Spanish director . He had much success such as &quot;Accion Mutante&quot; , &quot; El Dia de la Bestia&quot;, &quot;Perlita Durango&quot; and ¨La Comunidad¨ , among others . Here deals with a homage to Spaghetti/Paella Western and other American Westerns shot in Spain . Julian Torralba/Sancho Gracia is an ex-movie stuntman living in Almeria . Julian and his colleagues once made a busy living in Spaghetti Westerns shot in Spain ; nowadays , they are reduced to do stunt-shows for small audiences on the decaying set built for those old Westerns . Here Sancho Gracia , who made several Westerns during the 60s and 70s , plays an old man who brings a village back to life , which the bad guys want to sell to speculators . Sancho Gracia , his friends and grandson must fight against the polices and baddies to obtain their purports . The final showdown between Sancho Gracia and Angel De Andrés López is overwhelming and exciting. \n\nIn the film there is comedy , tongue-in-cheek , humour , drama , noisy action , nudism , and results to be very entertaining . Filmmaker Alex De La Iglesia tries to pay tribute to Spaghetti Western , that&apos;s why he wished its main star , Clint Eastwood , to play himself as a cameo or special appearance , Alex even offered to move to Los Angeles to shot his part ; Clint , who was then working on the direction of ¨Blood work¨ (2002), was forced to turn down this sympathetic offer . Main cast is pretty good , such as Sancho Gracia , Carmen Maura and Angel Andrés López . Support cast is frankly enjoyable , including Alex De Iglesia&apos;s ordinary secondaries , such as : Manuel Tallafé , Eusebio Poncela , Enrique Martínez , Eduardo Gómez and the great Terele Pávez . Evocative production design shot on location in Desert of Tabernas , Almería , Andalucía , where during the sixties and early seventies lots of Spaghetti/Paella Westerns were filmed . Alex De La Iglesia&apos;s direction is rightly made , he called it as a ¨Western Marmitako¨ , it is a special food from Basque Country , where Alex was born . Besides , cinematography by Flavio Labiano is splendid and Roque Baños&apos; musical score is breathtaking , though it imitates Ennio Morricone . Rating : 6.5/10 Good . Better than average . Well worth seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "As a longtime booster of The Cat People, I tended to give the credit to its director Jacques Tourneur (later to helm Out of the Past).  Seeing The Seventh Victim, also from Val Lewton&apos;s B-movie unit at RKO, changed all that.  It seems Lewton was the resident genius, cobbling together stylish horror/suspense films on shoestring budgets.  The young Kim Hunter, away at a private school, learns that her tuition hasn&apos;t been paid because her sister, owner of a beauty empire, has disappeared.  She leaves school and starts scouring New York&apos;s Greenwich Village (also the locale of much of The Cat People) only to uncover a cult of devil worshipers.  Lewton&apos;s thrillers haven&apos;t dated the way James Whale&apos;s, for instance, have, possibly because they depend so heavily on suggestion; the literalness of today&apos;s &quot;horror&quot; films is completely alien to these suggestive, truly chilling films.  The RKO B-movie unit under Lewton was also, probably, a major influence on the look of film noir, soon to become the cutting-edge aesthetic in American movies.  This is as tense and satisfying a 75 minutes as you&apos;ll find until the Mann/Alton team&apos;s seminal noirs of a few years later.",

      "name": "A fine film that should be on DVD - uncut",
      "reviewBody": "I saw The Victors on the big screen in 1964 and its impact has never left me. I saw a cut version on TV a few years ago, and while forty years of film watching and life experience made the movie seem a little heavy-handed and sentimental to me, it still packed a punch. It is not a perfect film - there is the occasional bad moment, and some techniques that were startling in 1963, particularly the newsreels and the hand-held camera used in the opening scene, are now familiar.\n\nNevertheless, The Victors should serve as a needed lesson to &quot;kids today&quot; that WWII was not fun, not easy, and not &quot;an adventure.&quot; Beating the Nazis was a grinding, miserable task that was paid for in suffering and loss. (As for concentration camps, a previous reviewer missed the scene in which one is indeed liberated.) Unusually, the film shows the effect of war on women and children, as well as on the fighting men. It&apos;s also remarkable that the movie was released years before the &quot;disillusionment&quot; of the Vietnam War. Had more Americans seen The Victors they might have had a better idea of what the nation was getting itself into. Watch The Longest Day or Patton, then watch The Victors and then decide which seems the most &quot;true to life.&quot; If you don&apos;t know what &quot;symbolism&quot; means, the final episode, filmed at the height of the Cold War, and its epigraph by World War I poet Wilfred Owen, will show you. \n\nThe opening credits suggest the historical relationship between World war II and World War I. They also should remind everyone that there were plenty of Black GIs in WWII, and that Uncle Sam didn&apos;t win the war all by himself.\n\nThere are moments of real humanity here. The Vince Edwards episode was considered &quot;controversial&quot; in 1963, and in today&apos;s film culture may actually seem banal, but it&apos;s about understanding as well as loneliness. The memorable sequence involving George Peppard and the English family is wonderfully understated.\n\nSomebody should explain why this occasionally flawed but excellent and provocative film has never been released to home video.",

Times change, computer generated effects are &quot;in&quot; and we sometimes forget that people like Willis O&apos;Brien were pioneers in the fx field, working with little but their imagination and creativity. So enjoy this typical 50&apos;s Big Bug entry for what it is. I have seen it a number of times and have a little soft spot in my heart (not my head!) for it. It is full of those actors that were popping up all the time during the 50&apos;s as second leads or in &quot;B&quot; films. The cavern scene with the worms and scorpions is pretty damn good but that little brat Juanito needed to be scorpion bait from the beginning! Probably the funniest thing in the film is the reaction of the military men in the stadium when one of their own gets electrocuted because someone forgot to turn off the power....they just blow it off and go on. It&apos;s a fun film......just enjoy it and don&apos;t think too much."

But honestly everything between was boring to me. Each one had their own dramatic story on why they should take a &quot;life of crime&quot;, which contained no humor or heart. I could care less for these guys except William Forsythe whom had dogs in the movie. Everyone likes dogs. A suggestion: check out &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "One Way Trip 2011 This was an unexpected pleasant suprise! Beautiful foriegn horror from Austria with gorgeous scenery and constantly changing creepy locations and one twist after another. What a ride! I really enjoyed this awesome horror flick with some great gore and quite a few surprises. The camera work on this was way better than the average horror flick I&apos;ve seen latley and it made me want more. With an injection of a few really cool 3d scenes and some great vertigo shots toward the end I felt this was above the average quality of an American horror film experience. I&apos;ll be looking for more like this from these creators. Highly recommended! Stands well above the average fare you sigh at on prime digging for something remotely resembling a film nowadays. Also lands quite a few notches above &quot;Shrooms&quot; this is not a comedy film. This is a Horror action film!",

I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood&apos;s score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis&apos; performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can&apos;t quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old."

The movie has its real own story (based on book, as i got to know), is fast paced, quiet dark and engaging. Overall very well done. Very nice setting and good actors.\n\nSo, only thing I wonder, why this movie is quite underrated here at imdb. I guess it has a problem to get to the right audience: Many might just want to see another flat american-style fantasy movie: They will be swamped and disappointed. For children (&lt;12) this movie might be to dark and rough. For older audience, who like dark fantasy, there might be to much moral and it might be to fariytale-like.\n\nSo, if you like a good, dark fantasy story without blood, but with some moral and heart, this movie is for you!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fascinating, brooding, highly creative film which is ultimately unsatisfactory because of weaknesses of script and direction. The story more or less disintegrates into confusion at the end, and I challenge anyone to be able to say what it all means. The film is worth seeing despite these faults because of its spectacular use of the truly brilliant talents of James Thiérrée and the Polish girl Izabella Miko (Miko is a shortened version of her long Polish surname, and she is not Japanese!) Miko is so amazingly beautiful to look at, and moves with such angelic grace as a dancer and acrobat, that she seems supernatural. Indeed, maybe she really is. She has the same special beauty as the young Julie Delpy, whom she resembles closely enough to be her sister. (A good casting idea there!) The most intense performance in this film is given by the ever-amazing Jodhi May, who has spent her entire career jamming all the cameras with the torrential rain of her feelings. I am always so harrowed after seeing a Jodhi May performance (she specializes in the darkened brow and the glowering eyes of a girl who is perpetually in a frenzied state and may commit a crime of passion at any moment, and often does) that I need time to recover every time. But as if Miko and May were not enough, this film has the genius of James Thiérrée on virtuoso display. I first saw him onstage performing circus routines with his parents and sister Aurélia when he was a child, and subsequently I have seen two of his stage productions. No one can question that he is a genius. But then so are his parents, Jean-Baptiste Thiérrée and Victoria Chaplin. It is Victoria Chaplin who, with the exquisitely innocent and inspired genius which is uniquely her own, best preserves the legacy of her father, Charlie Chaplin. And by saying that I by no means intend to denigrate the splendid achievements of her half-brother Sydney Chaplin (see my review of him in CONFESSION, 1955) or her sister Geraldine, who has charmed everyone for decades with her gamine qualities and profound talent. But the &apos;true genetic Chaplin line&apos; runs directly through Victoria to James, and his resemblance to his grandfather is so unnerving that one has to pinch oneself to remember that it is not Charlie without makeup at all, but the living image of him in the shape of his grandson whom one is watching perform all of his incredible physical feats, and inventing whole worlds of magic such as his mother has also done all her life. This film also has one of the countless fine supporting performances from the French actor who professionally calls himself &apos;Michael Lonsdale&apos;. (Never having met him, I have absolutely no idea why he adopted that strange name. Most people outside France believe him to be British!) Derek Jacobi plays the owner and manager of a small travelling circus which has once known better times, and Miko is his daughter, while May seems to be his mistress (and semi-adopted sister of Miko) and mother of his illegitimate child. He is by profession a ham actor and emcee, and Jacobi easily plays such a part, since he is one of those actors who needs directing or he lapses into being an actor with the emphasis on the second syllable. No one doubts Jacobi&apos;s splendid talents, it&apos;s just that he needs controlling, that&apos;s all. Here he is partially controlled but it is OK because the part is over the top anyway. This film is a spectacular display of acrobatic &apos;aerial choreography&apos; created by James Thiérrée for himself and Miko. The young director and co-author of the film is Robinson Savary. He is highly creative and has a taste for evocative and surreal film-making, heavy on mood and atmosphere. But in this early work, he has fallen down in the story department and has also gone for &apos;suggestive editing&apos; rather than expository editing, sacrificing clarity for hints. He has thus been a victim to the artistic illusion that the power of his vision will make itself clear without the need for explanations. But this does not happen. People do need things explained to them. Not all films can be LE CHIEN ANDALOU, which after all, was a short, let us not forget. Kubrick made this same mistake with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. When it opened in America, Kubrick&apos;s film was 45 minutes longer and made perfect &apos;story sense&apos;, having followed Arthur Clarke&apos;s perfectly comprehensible screenplay. (I watched Kubrick make that film over a period of two years and know many of the things which went wrong. Sometimes my friend Andrew Birkin, who worked on it, and I compare notes and reminisce about that strange adventure.) But the morale is clear: directors have to tell a story first, and then &apos;get creative&apos;. If you try and &apos;get creative&apos; without telling a story, you make a mess of things. If only Savary had not made that mistake! By rendering his film imperfect, Savary has deprived Thiérrée and Miko of their perfect showcase for their unique talents and abilities. The circus trapeze sequences where they perform together as &apos;the White Birds&apos; are so amazing that they are like a miracle, and the editing of those sequences is very good. The film could have been a classic, but it isn&apos;t. All we can do is salute Savary for trying and watch the film anyway, ignoring its story imperfections and paying attention to the splendid visions which it offers us, as if explanations were really unnecessary in the way that the impressionistic director honestly believed. Savary has also directed a 25 minute short film with James Thiérrée which I recommend, which shows him rehearsing one of his amazing stage shows. But that film is hard to obtain outside of Paris, and French Amazon appears not to sell it.",

I didn&apos;t mind the whole Blair witch/paranormal activity/cloverfield camera action they used. It was just the fact you knew what was coming 1 step ahead. Not to leave out the very dull ending but I guess it would have cost too much $ to actually leave us paying folk to know what happened to the people we spent the last 87 minutes caring about. Overall had a few creepy parts. Dog barking made my body ache. Just don&apos;t waste your time and money running to the theater to see this one.",

Yes, the Leech is obviously two guys in painted raincoats, yes some of the acting is wooden and the southern characters stereotyped and hilarious, but the plot moves along fairly well, and for a Corman production, the screenplay is pretty tight. I enjoyed this.  Worth a serious watch.  One of the few pieces of MST fodder that it is possible to watch by itself. Oh, and that Liz character is hottest women I&apos;ve seen in a black and white movie EVER.  Until the end of course: she looks pretty rough at that point."

However, the one exception to the rule has been this movie.  I LOVED this movie. The story line was solid. The direction was superb. And the acting was so good, that I have always wondered why Reeves &amp; Seymour&apos;s career didn&apos;t catapult after this film.  I have watched it many times since it came out, and ever time I am captivated. If you can&apos;t relate to this movie, I think you must have a heart of cold stone. This gets a strong KBONE rating of 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Pay special attention to Seymour&apos;s soliloquy during the play and Reeve&apos;s facial expressions during that time as well Reeve during the last 10 minutes of the movie. I really can&apos;t say enough about this masterpiece."

Writing the script, Kästner did not want his heroes to travel through the so-called German Democratic Republic. Therefore, in the film the heroes go from Copenhagen to their homes in Hanover.\n\nPaola Loew is wonderful as Irene Trübner ! Ralph Lothar as the false Rudi Struve, Paul Westermeier as &apos;Papa&apos; Külz, and Heini Göbel as the real Rudi Struve play very well too - while the real Rudi shows up only in the final part of the film. Actors playing the criminals are convincing as well.\n\nThere are films which age with time; this one does not and will not.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of English, it would be good if somebody would provide for the world public a version of this film with subtitles in English.",

A Room with a View is superficially a love story. and I hate to admit it kind of stays there. But they stick to the books. Having read the respective, Howard&apos;s End, and a Passage to India, I can truly say they adhere to what has been written. But the books are completely about what you read between the lines. E.M Forester was pretty disgusted by his culture. Yet it was his....and he loved it.......because it provided itself with misfits...i.e Lucy and her beau. He was an echo of Oscar Wilde. I think if you look very hard into this movie you will see that. Denholm Elliot is the epitome of an englishman who isn&apos;t an englishman. and he is the complete opposite of Mrs. Vyse....his opposing character. Even the vicar isn&apos;t what he supposed to be. Nude Bathing (Oh my Goodness) and in praise of passion he is a free spirit. I think anyone who can say bad about his movie has issues. Yes, its main-stream international. But its beautiful."

Director Llosa isn&apos;t always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don&apos;t add up to much. But this film is far better than his Stallone/Stone travesty The Specialist.\n\nBilly Zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture. He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he&apos;s very convincing here, reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels.",

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised at this film&apos;s low ratings and poor critical reviews. This is a really, really good film!  A unique piece of filmmaking like nothing I&apos;ve seen in a while!  First of all, it has a great sense of realism.  Writer/director Richard Wenk does a brilliant job at capturing the hustle and bustle of New York City streets.  And unlike in many films, where directors decide to cut corners and shoot part of the movie in Canada, &quot;Just the Ticket&quot; possesses an authenticity of the Big Apple that only NY-based directors like Martin Scorcese and Sidney Lumet have captured better. There are no gimmicky attempts at style (in the words of Mr. Lumet:  what&apos;s style?); we&apos;re not bombarded by pretentious shots of the Statue of Liberty or anything like that.  A film like this perfectly captures the essence of New York, without patronizing the city.\n\nAndy Garcia possibly gives the best performance of his career!  I&apos;ve always admired him as an actor, and I respect almost all Hispanic actors who make it big in show-biz (most of them happen to be great actors, too).  Garcia displays an unrelenting energy in his performance as ticket scalper Gary Stark.  After watching this film, I&apos;m surprised if he doesn&apos;t get approached to star in a Broadway play.  He has enough energy to light up the stage! Yet he&apos;s charming all the way; never obnoxious.  We fall in love with his character.  We fall in love with the supporting characters as well.  Andie McDowell (though I don&apos;t think she has an attractive presence; hey, beauty&apos;s in the eye of the beholder!) is charming as his love interest.  The two Andys have a perfect chemistry together--a real chemistry.  The kind of chemistry that real lovers would possess; and not &quot;Hollywood lovers.&quot;  You can&apos;t help but smile every minute they share the screen.  Though they quarrel at times, you just keep thinking &quot;They were meant for each other.&quot; And best of all (especially considering it&apos;s an R-rated film) their relationship is not based on sex.  There&apos;s not one sex scene in this movie. If it weren&apos;t for some naughty street language, you can take the whole family to see this movie.  Richard Bradford is amazingly likeable as Gary&apos;s friend for life/father figure.  You feel more and more sympathy for him (which is ironic for a guy who scalps tickets and tells lies for a living) and their father-son relationship as the film goes along.  I was touched by the subplot between Gary and his heroin-abusing pregnant friend Cyclops (Laura Harris).  Their interactions, including his attempts to stop her from abusing drugs, are very moving.  I was also glad to see a male-female friendship that doesn&apos;t end in love or sex.  You don&apos;t see that too much in the movies.  Rob Liebman (who co-starred with Garcia in &quot;Night Falls on Manhattan&quot;) makes a few short appearances.  He&apos;s a terrific, underrated actor and it was great to see the two of them share the screen again.\n\n Some may find this film uneven.  I can predict there&apos;s going to be a lot of complaints about the way &quot;it can&apos;t decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama.&quot;  I liked the balance between the comedic and dramatic elements, with romance rubbed into the equation.  This is not one of those over-the-top, slapstick, screwball comedies that many are probably used to.  It has a good sense of maturity.  And most of the humor is used for comic relief. There&apos;s a good deal of drama in the story, so don&apos;t expect to be laughing all the way.  So if you want to blame someone--blame the ones who marketed this film.  But I was so engaged in the story and characters that I didn&apos;t feel a need for laughs.  This is an interesting, moving piece of storytelling that never goes over the top and keeps its feet on the ground.  Never once was I uttering, &quot;this only happens in the movies.&quot;  Wenk didn&apos;t take any cheap shots, and I admire him for that.  So why--oh why was this film so poorly rewarded?\n\nNot to mention this the first film to provide insight into the world of ticket scalping.  And I don&apos;t think they could&apos;ve done it any better.  I saw Garcia on Conan O&apos;Brien&apos;s show when he was promoting the movie, and he said that he did actual field research and posed as a ticket scalper to help get into the shoes of his character.  I&apos;ll also mention that a famous celebrity (a living legend to some) makes a brief appearance.  I was amazed when he appeared on screen.  It wasn&apos;t one of those predictable cameos, where you had a feeling that person was going to show up anyway.  Face it, brace yourselves.  And don&apos;t read the complete IMDB cast list before watching the movie; it&apos;ll ruin the experience.  :)\n\n&quot;Just the Ticket&quot; is a charming, engaging, unique, touching film that&apos;ll fill your heart with good cheer.  It&apos;s definitely one of those overlooked flops that&apos;ll amaze you.  Plus, the soundtrack&apos;s great!  Andy Garcia helped compose most of the music for the score.  I developed the biggest smile on my face when they played &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered&quot; at the final scene. This is a film that captures your heart from all angles.\n\n My score:  8 (out of 10)",

There is nudity in this film as well as drug use going on and the cast of characters entering and departing from his moment in the movie is typical of what u would find in any gay persons life. Make sure u watch the deleted scenes there&apos;s more fo the story there. You must watch it after the movie it will tell u a very crucial piece of info of the end of the movie wont tell u. Movie should affect anyone at any age even though it covers the a week of a 21 yr old it touches on many things that happens to each of us gay. One thing bad about the DVD it had no subtitles option.",

And I think it is better than Santa Claus Conquers the Martians which was hysterically bad but somewhat a must-see just to revel in its awfulness.\n\nTo say that Santa Claus is strange is an understatement. The story is pretty much a shambles, with incoherent and disconnected scenes, and the writing is awful but makes me laugh, one of the few times when writing as bad as it is brings a smile to my face. The Devil himself looks very, very fake, while they do bastardise Santa Claus a bit. There are also some very night-marish images, as a child I got night-mares from the reindeer alone, as an adult I am not so scared any more but I do get the shivers even looking at them.\n\nThat said, it is better paced than Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, it has better effects I think(they&apos;re not great but they aren&apos;t appalling either) and sets and colours wise it is quite lavish. The film is a good length, it starts off quite well with some interesting songs, the climax is thrilling and while they are not great by any stretch of the imagination the actors look as though they are having a ball.\n\nAll in all, this is a very creepy and strange movie, but I was entertained. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Being the third outing in the series to be set against a medical backdrop, I was fully expecting this to be a tired rehash of old gags and ideas; however, I found it quite an agreeable latter-day entry  if still essentially second-tier material.\n\nThe cast sees Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacques and Jim Dale in more or less similar roles as its predecessor CARRY ON DOCTOR (1967); on the other hand, Sid James, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey and Barbara Windsor play different characters. Also, the mid-section of the film reverts to a tropical island setting (to which Dale has been assigned as a punishment, and where wily orderly James is stationed  though, even in such remote surroundings, he manages to keep up-to-date with English soccer results via coded drum-playing from the natives!).\n\nSome of the best gags involve Dale&apos;s accident-prone antics at the hospital early on (including his examination of scantily-clad starlet Windsor) and the latter stages set in Dale&apos;s private clinic (James has devised a concoction which turns out to be an effective slimming treatment  subsequently exploited by Dale under the patronage of wealthy Sims), which also sees Hawtrey once again in drag (he&apos;s a doctor who&apos;s jealous of Dale and has infiltrated the clinic on a mission for Dale&apos;s ex-superior/now-rival Williams). Series regular Peter Butterworth only has one wacky scene; other bits highlight Wilfrid Brambell (uncredited as an eccentric patient), lovely Valerie Leon (as Dale&apos;s sultry secretary) and future Mrs. Michael Caine Shakira Baksh (as a native-girl who successfully undertakes James&apos; miraculous cure).",

They take the brain out of a deformed dwarf named Karl and put it into a body that was built by Dr. Stein and the operation seems to go well. Karl is healing well and responding to everything okay but he doesn&apos;t want to be a medical spectacle for everyone to gawk at so he convinces a woman named Margaret (Eunice Gayson) who works there to loosen his straps and he climbs out the window. One of the side effects of the transplant is cannibalism and he has a hunger for flesh. Also, Karls brain is telling him he is deformed so the rest of his body begins to change! This is one of the few films that Cushing made for Hammer studios that didn&apos;t have Christopher Lee in the cast as well. The sets look great as they always do and it really captures the look of what this part of Europe must have looked like back then. The best thing about this film is the story. After they transfer the brain from one body to another the brain tells the new body its deformed and it reminded me that this aspect of the Frankenstein story was dwelled on only rarely. There is some horrifying moments during this film but its really a science fiction story with the emphasis on science. Great atmosphere and solid performances add to this overlooked Frankenstein entry. Also, veteran character actor Lionel Jeffries plays a grave digger! Well worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Le proprietà dei metalli&quot; (The Properties of Metals) is, technically and emotionally, a well-made film. The actors give it their all, the cinematographer captures the beauty of the Italian countryside, and the screenwriter delivers a decent script. But why is this film on the festival circuit? What elevates it to festival status? Am I missing something?\n\nPerhaps I&apos;m being overly critical, but the film feels like it&apos;s checking all the boxes for a festival darling without offering anything truly unique or groundbreaking. It&apos;s a familiar tale of a young boy with extraordinary abilities, set against the backdrop of a picturesque Italian village. The film&apos;s pacing is deliberate, the performances are solid, and the visuals are undeniably stunning. Yet, it lacks a certain spark, a sense of urgency or originality that would make it truly stand out.\n\nThe film&apos;s central premise, a young boy&apos;s apparent ability to bend metal, is intriguing, but it&apos;s never fully explored or explained. The film hints at a deeper mystery, but it ultimately shies away from delving into the supernatural or the fantastical. Instead, it focuses on the boy&apos;s relationship with his family and the villagers, which, while touching, feels somewhat predictable.\n\nThe performances are commendable, particularly young Martino Zaccara as Pietro, the boy with the mysterious abilities. He conveys a sense of wonder and vulnerability that is both endearing and heartbreaking. David Pasquesi, as the scientist investigating Pietro&apos;s abilities, delivers a nuanced performance that balances skepticism with curiosity.\n\nThe film&apos;s cinematography is undoubtedly its strongest asset. The Italian countryside is captured in all its glory, with sweeping vistas and intimate close-ups that create a sense of both grandeur and intimacy. The film&apos;s color palette is rich and vibrant, adding to its visual appeal.\n\nHowever, despite its technical merits and solid performances, &quot;Le proprietà dei metalli&quot; ultimately feels like a missed opportunity. It&apos;s a film that could have been so much more, but it settles for being merely good. Perhaps this is the curse of festival films, a tendency to prioritize style over substance in the pursuit of critical acclaim.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Le proprietà dei metalli&quot; is a well-crafted film that is ultimately forgettable. It&apos;s a beautiful film to look at, but it lacks the emotional depth and narrative complexity that would make it truly memorable. While it may be a hit on the festival circuit, it&apos;s unlikely to leave a lasting impression on audiences beyond its initial run.",

American Bully tells the tale of four teens, one of them a most charismatic individual leads the other three into a crime of unspeakable horror. Matt O&apos;Leary who has a brother in Iraq and is getting ready to enlist himself gets suspended from school for showing a beheading video from the wars on terror. He thinks that Jonathan Halayalkar ratted him out and Jonathan is darker complexioned. Ergo he has to be one of those Moslem terrorists. In fact he&apos;s a Sikh, but what does O&apos;Leary know from Sikhs? Nor do his friends Marshall Allman, Sam Murphy, and Ross Britz.\n\nIn fact what do Americans for the most part know from these other cultures? We are a most ignorant people if we were not politicians would not have such an easy time talking us into wars. \n\nIn this situation Moslem terrorists don&apos;t do themselves any good either. Since the Seventies they&apos;ve done all kinds of unspeakable acts starting with the massacre of those Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. Not hard to hate these people as young O&apos;Leary and his friends do.\n\nBut in point of fact they&apos;re punks and nothing justifies what they did. And that they chose a Sikh because they don&apos;t know the difference, chalk one up for ignorance.\n\nAmerican Bully covers a wide range of troubling issues, hate crimes, bullying, and ignorance and maybe another viewer can add a few more. These issues deserve a better film.",

      "reviewBody": "Eriprando&apos;s A SPIRAL OF MIST is a most curious film -for me it typifies the &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; problems of a declining national cinema in Italy at the end of the &apos;70s. A great cast, okay soap opera material and a talented director fell sway to the world&apos;s increasing interest in porn.\n\nThat&apos;s a shame because Visconti had rounded up a set of French and Italian thesps who would have done uncle Luchino proud. But why subject them to the ignominy of gratuitous full-nude &amp; sex scenes, much in the manner of a trashy American pic (see Laurence Olivier in THE BETSY) of the period? Because the public in an era of &quot;porno chic&quot; expected stronger stuff in even their mainstream fare.\n\nVisconti was coming off a great local hit, the rape/kidnap exploitation smash ORCA, which generated a successful sequel and is today still much enjoyed on the collector&apos;s circuit. With MIST he moved into soap opera territory, similar to the work of his uncle&apos;s best follower Mauro Bolognini. The story deals with the marital problems of several couples, plus their sexual escapades with their servants, plus an unresolved (and half-hearted) murder mystery, that all spells night time soap.\n\nWhat took me aback was the clearly compromised injection of sexploitation elements into the narrative. By film&apos;s end there are full-frontal nude scenes by nine (3 of them male) of the principal players, not extras or bit roles. The glamorous French star Claude Jade, who brightened up several Truffaut movies, looks positively embarrassed when she is called upon to join hubby Duilio Del Prete in the shower; she comically and daintily puts on a shower cap in this scene. Elsewhere, her acting is top-notch.\n\nDel Prete, who flirted oh-so briefly with American stardom under the tutelage of Peter Bogdanovich with leads in DAISY MILLER and AT LONG LAST LOVE, was experienced in classic sex films opposite such bombastic beauties as Laura Antonelli and Ursula Andress, but it still is disconcerting to see him with his Johnson hanging out here. Later in the film his servant girl gives him a hand job, and we know Visconti is aiming low.\n\nSimilarly, a very lovely starlet who never made it in films, Carole Chauvet, is cast as the central character Valeria, married to loathsome Marc Porel, and seems quite natural au naturel. She gives hubby a blow job later in the film which is an extended scene in closeup, merely kept softcore by the careful framing which does not show explicit penetration. Was this artistically necessary, or just to appease the fans&apos; basest instincts? Stefano Satta Flores gives perhaps the best male performance as a police inspector investigating Valeria&apos;s death while she was out hunting in the woods with Porel. Film presents her fate, RASHOMON-style, in a series of many brief flashbacks, all punctuated by the yellow rain-slicker she&apos;s wearing. Picture leaves the solution to this mystery up in the air, though Porel is Prime Suspect throughout.\n\nAlso adding mightily to the prurient content is Martine Brochard, a MILF of a nurse who is constantly injecting the cast in the rump with unspecified drugs (adding to the general Visconti Sr. atmosphere of decadence). More obviously, the beautiful young starlet Eleonora Giorgi pops up in the second half of the film, also for purely pulchritudinous purposes.\n\nOn a sleaze level, this adds up to enjoyably trashy entertainment, though I for one would have preferred a more straight-forward and conclusive handling of the mystery/suspense elements of the story. It probably represents a good example of cultural differences: never released in America the film would have been X-rated here all the way, yet for a European audience of the late &apos;70s it was probably taken in stride, not unlike the way Scandi audiences lapped up &quot;family porn&quot; comedies such as the BEDSIDE and IN THE SIGN OF... series starring Ole Søltoft."

      "reviewBody": "An extremely bad movie about warrior women which still manages to entertain from the sheer absurdity of it all. That, and a couple of the fight scenes are pretty good too, especially the huge, long-expected battle at the end which very nearly lives up to expectations. Sure, a lot of Italian cinema is stylish, magnificent stuff, but they also made their fair share of clunkers. Alfonso Brescia&apos;s movie is hindered by exceptionally bad dubbing, acting, photography, choreography, lack of script, you name it...it&apos;s a wonder that this film is watchable at all.\n\nThings begin horribly with a really cheesy scene of a man and a woman riding towards each other on horseback in slow motion. What follows is a story involving capture, escape, torture, and eventually betrayal and warfare. This is bad stuff through and through, and bad movie fans will no doubt get a kick out of watching it. The best thing that I can say is that there&apos;s a lot of action, so it never becomes too boring. Sadly the majority of the action scenes take place in the dark, so it&apos;s impossible to see what&apos;s going on. Copious use of day-for-night filming also makes this film look very poor. Forget about any luscious woodland locations - it looks like this film was shot in a copse somewhere, and picturesque is far from the word to describe this disappointing, dirty-looking locale.\n\nThe music is cheesy and horrible, the acting highly amateurish from most of the cast, with only one or two of the leads showing any professionalism whatsoever. Lincoln Tate is okay as the hero, and Lucretia Love (impossible to believe that this is her real name) as the heroine, but that&apos;s about it. The dubbing is highly amusing and over the top as usual, packed with funny lines like &quot;murdering bunch of bitches&quot;. The Amazons&apos; battle cry sounds like &quot;hahohi-i-i-i-i-i!!&quot; and is really cheesy! Despite being a film about strong, powerful women this still manages to be extremely sexist, with one scene involving a lady almost being raped incredibly played for laughs! As I mentioned, the action scenes are all right and worth watching, especially the huge battle at the end which is where all the budget apparently went. There&apos;s a definite martial arts influence with lots of flying kicks, headbutts and punches going on. The gore is minimal but there are a few cool scenes of people being repeatedly speared and stabbed. Most incredibly of all, though, are the many mistakes which are easy to spot while watching. For instance, actresses change parts in one scene, noticeably by their hair colour changing! Also, in the film&apos;s major battle at the end, it&apos;s pretty obvious that the Amazons are actually played by men. Three factors give it away; a) they wear masks to disguise their faces all of a sudden, b) they&apos;re muscular, and c) they&apos;ve got hairy arms and legs. It makes for very surreal entertainment, that&apos;s for sure. Although a terrible film in most respects, BEAUTY OF THE BARBARIAN is a forgotten epic to be sought out by bad-film connoisseurs...if they can be bothered.",

Taras Bulba with his tribes wager war through the long corridors of courage . At this time Polish rule over Ukraine , they join forces with the Cossacks to vanquish the Turks . One time are defeated they force to the Cossacks to live on bad lands . Taras Bulba (Yul Brynner) sends his sons (originally was hired Burt Lancaster but role subsequently was to Tony Curtis and Perry Lopez) to a Polish school . There they encounter hatred , confrontation , struggles but also love when Curtis is enamored with the daughter (Austrian actress Christine Kauffman , she met Tony Curtis on the set and later married him) of a Polish nobleman .\n\nThe film gets noisy action , adventures , romance , jarring burst of violence and results to be quite entertaining . Breathtaking battles well staged with thousands of extras displayed by Army of Argentina where was actually shot . Besides , it contains exciting rider races with bounds and leaps over cliffs as well as horses and men falling into the deep . Actors interpretation is more distinguishing , it features of otherwise routine spectacle . Brynner as a straight-talking , savvy chief leading his tribe is superb . He&apos;s perfect as a proud , wise and stalwart leader . Brynner plays one of his usual oriental or exotic roles (similarly to Brothers Karamazov , King and I , Salomon , Ten Commandments). Tony Curtis turns a fine performance . Brynner and Curtis together for the first time , like father and like son in this exciting adventure . Tony Curtis plays Yul Brynner&apos;s son, but Curtis was only five years younger than Brynner in real life . Perry Lopez and Curtis are also &quot;college students&quot; , when in real life they are about age of 37 . The secondary casting is frankly good such as : Brad Dexter , Sam Wanamaker , Guy Rolfe , Abraham Sofaer and Vladimir Sokoloff&apos;s last film , among others . Spectacular and epic musical score by Franz Waxman . Colorful and glamorous cinematography filmed amid the splendor of its original locale by Joe McDonald . The motion picture was brilliantly directed by J. Lee Thompson (Guns of Navarone , Cape fear) , though in his finale career directed Charles Bronson vehicles . The Nikolai Gogol story titled ¨Taras Bulba¨ was formerly filmed in France (1936) , England (1963) and Italy (1963) by Ferdinando Baldi . The movie will appeal to Yul Brynner fans and costumer enthusiasts .",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Keaton is good, as usual, in the role of Artie Lewis, an NYPD detective who must endure one of the time-honoured cliches of the cop drama: the death of his partner (Anthony LaPaglia). However, LaPaglia was the single dad to three adorable daughters, and in his will he had given custody of the girls to Artie and his wife (Rene Russo). They do prove to be good parental figures (she&apos;d been unable to bear her own children), but all of the problems facing them (inadequate housing for the new family, and a supposed dearth of funds) prompt Artie to do something crooked for once: rob a drug dealer (an effectively smooth and slimy Tony Plana).\n\nThe script by veteran screenwriter Heywood Gould (&quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, &quot;Fort Apache, the Bronx&quot;) has its share of problems; not only is it predictable and manipulative, but it&apos;s scarcely believable. Too many story twists are hard to buy, especially that ridiculous ending. The film is still reasonably entertaining in a visceral way, and Gould maintains an effective forward momentum; Keaton and his excellent supporting cast are so compulsively watchable that they compensate for a fair bit. &quot;One Good Cop&quot; has some decent action, and violence, and makes good use of some NYC locations.\n\nKeaton is compelling in the lead. While you may not always find his character credible, there&apos;s no doubt that the star will always be able to do some true heavy lifting, both comedically and dramatically. The rest of the cast plays like a who&apos;s who of Hollywood players: Russo, LaPaglia, Kevin Conway, Rachel Ticotin, Plana, Benjamin Bratt, Charlayne Woodard, Victor Rivers, Mike Hagerty, J.E. Freeman, Kevin Corrigan, Vondie Curtis-Hall, etc.\n\nHighly recommended to Michael Keaton fans, even in light of the flaws.\n\nSix out of 10.",

      "name": "Decent Spaghetti/Paella Western shot in Spain with two ordinary genre stars : Richard Harrison and Fernando Sancho",
      "reviewBody": "This Italian &amp; Spanish co-production qualifies as an enough-budget, mid-brow western , a so-so level before the great Spaghetti westerns . &quot;$100,000 for Ringo&quot; has a thrilling start when a woman is relentlessly pursued by Indians ; a bit later on , she is murdered by a mysterious killer . The murderer will blame the innocent Indians about the crime . Then , a ¨white men posse¨ attack an Indian tribe , carrying out a brutal slaughter . Meanwhile , a wandering drifter called Ringo (Richard Harrison) arrives in a ranch where he&apos;s mistaken for a former resident named Ward Cluster who was believed dead in the Civil War . Cluster&apos;s spouse is now dead but his young son , Sean (Loris Loddi) raised by Indian chief , Gray Bear (Rafael Albaicín) , also believes Ringo to be his daddy and the kid plans a future with him . Soon after , Ringo or Lee Barton rides into the western town of Rainbow Valley in which he meets himself in opposition to local mobster , Cherry (Gerard Tichy) and his brother (Guido Lollobrigida or Lee Burton , Gina Lollobrigida&apos;s brother) . Ringo joins forces with a bounty hunter (Fernando Sancho) and a sheriff (Luis Induni) attempt to restore peace and order . Cherry seeks to find $200,000 stashed away by a Mexican general (Tomas Torres) and during the course of his chase captures and flogs Ringo .\n\nThis stirring tortilla/Ravioli Western packs thrills , shootouts , noisy action , and riding pursuits . Italian-Spanish co-production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , assaults , exaggerated characters , crossfire , lots of shots and fights . Starring Richard Harrison as a stranger rider , he is pretty nice , he ravages the screen , he jumps, leaps and bounds , hits and runs ; besides , receiving violent punches , whipping and wounds . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation between Richard Harrison and Gerard Tichy with some looks that say it all , including an exciting ending . Strong and robust Richard Harrison was a magnificent muscle-man . Harrison played in Hollywood some minor roles as ¨Kronos¨, ¨South Pacific¨ and ¨Master of world . Then , Harrison jumped at the chance when offered the first character in 1961 ,¨The Invincible Gladiator¨ , which was filming in Europe . He wound up settling in Italy for the next two decades . To avoid being penned in too much as a muscle man , he sought characters in routine spaghetti westerns as ¨Texas the Red¨, ¨Gringo¨, ¨Reverendo Colt¨ , ¨Joe Dakota¨ , even the main role from ¨For a fistful of dollars¨ was offered to Richard Harrison , but he turned down and explaining : Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing Fistful of Dollars, and recommending Clint Eastwood for the part . Support cast is frankly good , thanks to the boastful Fernando Sancho , playing a likable bounty hunter . He played a Mexican outlaw lots of times , as he starred multitude ¨Chorizo¨ or ¨Pipperone¨ Westerns , as the quarrelsome , swanky Mexican bandit , such as : ¨A pistol for Ringo¨, ¨Return of Ringo¨, &quot;Requiem for a Gringo&quot; , &quot;Dakota Joe&quot; , ¨Winchester Bill¨ , &quot;The Man Who Came to Kill&quot; and several others . Other important secondaries are the followings : Gerard Tichy as Tom Cherry who used local Indians to drive off settlers , subsequently turned against the Indians , Eleonora Bianchi as Deborah , a blonde townswoman who loves a drunken man played by Massimo Serato or John Barracuda , Mónica Randall as a beautiful Indian , Francisco Sanz as José , Tomás Torres as Mexican General , Luis Induni as Sheriff , Frank Oliveiras , Cesar Ojinaga . \n\nBeing decently photographed by Federico G. Larraya in Eastmancolor , Techniscope , though is necessary a fine remastering because of the film-copy is washed-out . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga , (Huesca) , similar to Almeria , and a Western village located in ¨Spugles De Llobregat¨ built by producers/directors brothers : Alfonso Balcázar , Francisco Balcázar , Juan Jose Balcazar though this Balcazar family went to bankrupt and had to sell the terrains . It resulted to be the locations where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people , because Almeria was too far and the ¨Fraga¨ landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians , film editing by Teresa Alcocer , nice assistant direction and adequate production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler , the latter creates an acceptable scenario . Climatic and enjoyable musical score , including catching leitmotif , by Bruno Nicolai , usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone , adding a wonderful song : ¨Ringo¨ . \n\n&quot;One Hundred Thousand Dollars for Ringo&quot; was well produced by Alfonso Balcazar productions that financed lots of Westerns . Most of them starred by Richard Harrison , Jorge Martin or George Martin , Luis Davila , Daniel Martin or Robert Woods . The motion picture was regularly directed by Alberto De Martino . He managed to make a fluid and filled with thrills , duels , attacks , and shots , though average . He was an Italian craftsman , working from the 60s in all kind of genres and B movies . As he directed Peplum (Secret seven , Spartan gladiators , Invincible gladiator , Valley of stone men) , Spaghetti Western (Django shoots first , Providence , Charge of seven cavalry) , Warlike (Dirty heroes) , European spy genre (OK Connery , Operation Lady Chaplin) , and Terror (Miami Golem , Tempter , Horror , Holocaust 2000) , among others . Rating : 5.5/10 acceptable and passable , though sometimes embarrassing . If you like Chorizo , Paella , Butifarra or Spaghetti westerns , this one remains lightly watchable .",

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;d think you&apos;re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, going through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.\n\nReda&apos;s father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can&apos;t drive, and therefore enlists the help of Reda, to his son&apos;s protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle.\n\nBut Reda doesn&apos;t see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn&apos;t understand. And hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals.\n\nThe beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences.\n\nIt&apos;s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.\n\nIt certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don&apos;t miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening&apos;s session was still a full house.",

      "reviewBody": "I grew up listening to Gordon MacRae sing The Desert Song on an album that also featured him in the musical Roberta. The soprano in both cases was Lucille Norman, and both recordings were wonderful. So it was with great interest that I watched &quot;The Desert Song.&quot;\n\nHaving myself appeared in &quot;The New Moon,&quot; I can tell you that on stage, these operettas only work if done tongue in cheek. If one were filming them for today&apos;s audiences, I suspect they would have to be done that way as well.\n\nHowever, for beautiful music, &quot;The Desert Song&quot; is operetta at its best. \n\nThe story is not unfamiliar -- just think Superman or Zorro. \n\nShiek Yousseff (Raymond Massey) secretly plots to overthrow the French, all the while pretending to be their friend. Opposing him are the Riffs and their leader, El Khobar. El Khobar is in reality Professor Paul Bonnard who is making a study of the desert. The Riffs&apos; attacks on supply trains keep the villages in food. \n\nGeneral Birabeau (Ray Collins) of the French Foreign Legion arrives to investigate, and his daughter Margot (Kathryn Grayson) accompanies him. He hires Bonnard to tutor her. Margot, meanwhile, has eyes for a Legionnaire captain, Claud Fontaine (Steve Cochran). El Khobar kidnaps Margot until he can convince her that Yousseff is not on the side of the French, but Yousseff&apos;s men attack the camp and take Margot prisoner. \n\nThis is different from the actual operetta, in which Birabeau has a son, not a daughter; his son, Pierre, is actually the Riff leader The Red Shadow. In the operetta, Margot is engaged to Claud Fontaine, but the Red Shadow is in love with her. \n\nGordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson lend their beautiful voices to songs such as &quot;The Desert Song,&quot; &quot;One Alone,&quot; and &quot;Romance.&quot; Grayson is not quite bubbly enough as the flirty Margot. I can&apos;t believe that with that size voice, she sang Butterfly on an opera stage, but I guess she did. \n\nIt&apos;s a pretty production, with Dick Wesson, playing a reporter, providing some comic relief. In the operetta he has a girlfriend, Susan.\n\nThis is the kind of movie where you enjoy the music and the singing. Well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Enter the Dragon (1973) was Bruce Lee&apos;s first (and only) solo big Hollywood production. Too bad he never got to see the fruits of his labor. He passed away during the film&apos;s post production (don&apos;t fret, two more official Bruce Lee films were made after this one. Despite all of the years of hard work and finally making it to the big times, he wasn&apos;t around long enough to enjoy it. Even though Robert Clouse is credited as director and another person is credited for writing the screenplay. This film has Bruce Lee&apos;s fingerprints all over it.\n\nThe movie is about a shady underworld crime lord (aren&apos;t they always) who controls most of the world&apos;s opium drug ring and a lot of other illegal dealings. British Intelligence is stumped, so they seek out someone who&apos;s slick, sly, stealth and who can kick a lot of butt and take care of himself. They find their man (Bruce Lee). After a great deal of convincing they get him to go to the island and participate in the crime lord&apos;s fighting tournament. Along the way, Bruce meets two American fighters (John Saxon and Jim Kelly) who are in the tournament for various reasons. Whilst on the island, Bruce does his nightly snooping around so he can find out more about the crime lord and his illegal activities. Will Bruce topple the organization? Can he make it out alive? Does Bruce really kick a whole lot of butt and take names? To find out you&apos;ll have to watch Enter The Dragon!!!!\n\nBruce Lee worked a great deal on this picture. He wrote most of the screenplay (uncredited), filmed all of the action scenes (uncredited) and directed several scenes (uncredited). Lam Ching-Ying, Angela Mao, Jackie Chan and Bolo Yeung appear in this film. If you haven&apos;t seen this film already then you&apos;re either a kid, lame or something is wrong with you. \n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot; from 1940 begs to be re-discovered by today&apos;s somewhat jaded and special effects over-saturated audiences. Director A. Edward Sutherland knew his business and even if his films aren&apos;t top drawer Hollywood, they&apos;re not backlot dreck either. Thanks to Alpha Video this film was a mere $4.99 at Manhattan&apos;s J&amp;R superstore.\n\nMany movies feature a departed-from-this-mortal-coil soul aiding those left behind to find love or, perhaps, solve crimes. It&apos;s hardly a novel genre. Most are hokey even with top stars (like, say, Robin Williams).  &quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot; with effects pretty good for the times is a charmer from beginning to end.\n\nThree gentlemen, getting on in years, are very successful engineers who live in a palatial town house in Manhattan.  In addition to being business partners they&apos;re close friends.  George Multon (Harry Carey) has a mysterious past act taking a ride on his conscience.  Ramrod straight Alan Chadwick formerly served in a British regiment in India.  Jovial Michael O&apos;Brien (Charles Winninger) brings a blithe Irish spirit to the trio&apos;s Christmas Eve.  The engineers have two housekeepers, Madame Tanya (the versatile actress of stage and screen as well as drama teacher Maria Ouspenskaya) and the butler Josef (Alex Melesh).  The two Russian emigres have their own story: refugees from the demise of the Romanovs, Madame Tanya voices her thanks at being in America to which Josef concurs (these actors had no later problems with HUAC).\n\nA novel ploy is hatched by the tuxedoed engineers to brighten up their Christmas Eve.  Each hurls a wallet with his business card and a $10 bill to the snowy sidewalk outside their manse.  The idea is that whoever returns the wallet and money will be invited to dine in sumptuous luxury.\n\nAn actress, Arlene Terry (Helen Vinson) takes the money and throws the wallet to the ground.  This is the real beginning of fantasy in the flick as such behavior didn&apos;t then and never could happen in Gotham.  But a handsome guy from Texas, a would-be crooner, James Houston (Richard Carlson), and a nice gal, Jean Lawrence (Jean Parker), return the billfolds.  (This was a decade before Carlson became the nation&apos;s and the FBI&apos;s hero as the patriot who penetrated the Evil Empire&apos;s domestic operation as shown in &quot;I Led Three Lives.&quot;  Carlson enjoyed a prolific if not artistically important screen and TV career.)\n\nWouldn&apos;t you know that neither had any plans for Christmas Eve.\n\nSo the two single folks, alone on Christmas Eve in New York, meet at the old codgers&apos; roost and, of course, an immediate attraction ensues.  Amused and moved by the instant romance formed under their roof, the engineers more or less adopt the couple.\n\nBut then...tragedy strikes.  Ignoring the ominous prediction of disaster from Madame Tanya, the trio fly off to get new business and perish when their plane hits a mountain.  Everyone&apos;s grief stricken.\n\nBut, at least for a while, the three dead guys come home to try and manage affairs.  And they find a big problem.  Discovered as a singing sensation Jim is at risk of being seduced by the divorced (1940s signal for &quot;Loose Woman Dead Ahead&quot;) Arlene Terry (remember, we already know she&apos;s a snake because she didn&apos;t return the wallet).\n\nPoor Jean is increasingly left alone while Jim pursues his career and Arlene pursues him.  The ghosts lament his approaching indiscretion but can they save the day?\n\nMuch of the story is predictable but the acting is first-rate.  Winninger&apos;s O&apos;Brien will capture the heart of all who enjoy lovable Irishmen with deep hearts and a hardy brogue.\n\nJean Parker is adorable as the big-hearted kid who finds and almost loses love in the Big City.\n\nThis wasn&apos;t a big budget film but for the time the spectral characters are pretty state-of-the-art.  The outcome is never in doubt but the trip there is charming.\n\nReadily available on DVD: go for it.\n\n8/10",

It&apos;s not as bad as &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;, in fact it&apos;s Academy Award material compared to Plan 9. It&apos;s one of those 50&apos;s low budget movies that I can&apos;t get enough of. I would love to have a collection of movies like this one. One thing I never quite understood was how a Gila Monster survived in Texas or possibly a Midwestern locale. It obviously wasn&apos;t Arizona... Forgot to mention the singing, makes the acting look good."

The whole hodge-podge of conflicted feelings about ethic identity reminded me of &quot;Once Were Warriors,&quot; which was about a violent Maori community in New Zealand. At least that movie acknowledged that the male craziness had a partial source in poverty and racism (without excusing it). Chiko doesn&apos;t admit much of anything about Germany - the early parts of the film are a kind of &quot;rebels without a cause.&quot; At least for me, steeped in the race relations of English-speaking countries plus France, this film self-pathologized Turkish-German males and sensationalized their emotions in a way I didn&apos;t find very insightful. But on the level of production and acting, it was at least an 8.",

I loved the book, the story was very interesting, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever read. When we watched the movie, I knew it would be different, but I didn&apos;t think it would be THIS different. The story almost completely changes, nothing but the bear bones of the book are left, and it made me sort of angry. It was cartoonish, and lacked any symbolism whatsoever. The book was great because of it, and here it lacks something. I feel that someone who hasn&apos;t read the book will laugh, they probably wouldn&apos;t understand what is going on. So much of the plot was taken out. The acting is okay though, Balthazar Getty does a good job as Ralph. Despite the boys being American here, he reminded me of the Ralph in the book.",

      "reviewBody": "Dil Chahta Hai Starring: Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, Dimple Kapadia and Ayub Khan Director: Farhan Akhtar Music: Shankar-Eshan-Loy Released. Debutant director Farhan Akhtar&apos;s (son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani) Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new, trendy and youthful look, completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.\n\nAkash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) and Siddharth aka Sid (Akshaye Khanna), three close friends, have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid, a painter, is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything, everywhere and everytime.\n\nAll three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid&apos;s love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful.\n\n Sid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad&apos;s business. On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town -- but things are different for them now.\n\nFull marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the run-of-the-mill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically, the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.\n\nNow the performances -- all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his career-best role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer&apos;s role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner -- Akshaye Khanna. An actor-par excellence and very natural in front of the camera, Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spell-binding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.\n\nMusic and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy. But one thing is sure -- Bollywood has got one more talented director in Farhan Akhtar.",

      "reviewBody": "Roderick and his sister Pamela are vacationing along the English seaside when they discover a beautiful old house with which they fall immediately in love. They purchase the home from Commander Beech, an elderly man whose daughter and son-in-law once lived in the house. Almost as soon as Roderick and Pamela move in, the disturbances begin. A woman can be heard sobbing in the early morning hours and the smell of mimosa perfume is everywhere. Soon, Roderick takes a liking to the Commander&apos;s granddaughter, a very pretty but solemn and haunted looking girl named Stella. When Stella enters the house, the disturbances increase alarmingly, threatening her life and driving her perilously close to the sea cliffs. The Commander forbids her to set foot in the house, for he knows of the terrible tragedy that occurred there 20 years earlier. But the guilty secret he&apos;s been keeping all these years, a secret that involves Stella and her heritage, will not stay secret anymore and Roderick must face a vengeful ghost if he wishes to save the woman he loves.\n\nThis is a really great ghost story, a true classic of the genre. Everyone involved turns in a brilliant performance, especially Ray Milland as Roderick the sweet and likable composer and Ruth Massey as his spunky sister. Gail Russell as Stella is perfectly cast, always appearing shaken and fragile. The effects are terrific too! The crying ghost in particular will give you shivers as it echoes down the halls of the dark house and disappears with the dawn breeze. Light and shadow are used to maximum effect and despite the fact that this film was made in 1944, it never feels dated and it&apos;s lost none of its power to unsettle, disturb and even downright terrify.\n\nPerfect viewing for a dark and stormy night. This is a flawless ghost story. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they&apos;re worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I&apos;m still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it&apos;s Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn&apos;t a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main &apos;side characters&apos; are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I&apos;ll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)\n\nDon&apos;t let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren&apos;t exactly &apos;tamed&apos;, barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg&apos;s personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.\n\nThe island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its &apos;history&apos; (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can&apos;t say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there&apos;s a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable. \n\nPlease note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn&apos;t take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than &quot;I think this was Gennaro...&quot; Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don&apos;t listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.",

      "reviewBody": "The best part about &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; is Burgess Meredith&apos;s character. He&apos;s even funnier here than in the original...and I love his version of &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;! As for the rest, it&apos;s pretty much what you got in the first film...though with an emphasis on a new character (Sophia Loren) and the upcoming nuptials of two other characters (John&apos;s daughter and Max&apos;s son).\n\nThe story picks up some time after the first film. John is married to Ariel and he and his nemesis, Max, are getting along better. Much of this might be because their kids are getting serious and talking marriage. Plus they have something else to unite them in the story...their hatred of a new lady, Maria (Loren). Why? Well, she bought their old bait shop and is turning it into a restaurant....and the pair do a lot to try to sabotage the place. These scenes are pretty funny. However, later, Max and Maria start dating....and the kids have a breakup. What&apos;s next? See the film.\n\nThis is a cute and enjoyable film. Nothing life-changing or super original but still fun and occasionally funny. Worth seeing if you liked the first one and better than most sequels.",
