      "reviewBody": "A German soldier with a serious head wound survives The Great War to become a celebrated clairvoyant in Depression-era Berlin, mesmerizing audiences (and critics) by the sheer force of his personality. No, his stage name isn&apos;t Adolph Hitler, but the parallels soon become clear. Are his powers a supernatural gift or merely sensitive guesswork? The question takes on added significance when the apolitical showman begins predicting the rise of fascism and falls under the influence (against his own will) of the fledgling Nazi Party. The film presents an intriguing, if not always cohesive, portrait of an entertainer (and by extension, a nation) under the spell of forces beyond anyone&apos;s control, with the title role coming vividly to life in Klaus Maria Brandauer&apos;s equally mesmerizing performance. His efforts helped earn the film a nomination for Best Foreign Language Feature, but the results were likely too dark and ambiguous to win the Oscar.",

      "reviewBody": "Version I saw: Japanese Bluray release (subtitled) Actors: 6/10 Plot/script: 6/10 Photography/visual style: 7/10 Music/score: 7/10 Overall: 6/10 This movie comes from a class of anime films created by editing together footage from a TV series into a movie-length piece, cutting out stand-alone episodes and incidents and focusing rigorously on the series&apos; overarching plot. Often, as in this case, the footage is spruced up by increasing the picture quality and resolution, and adding in a few extra shots, usually in the action scenes.\n\nAs usual, sacrifices must be made when pruning away so much material, and here the main cost seems to be context. Scene transitions are unnecessarily abrupt at times, leaving the viewer disoriented, wondering where we were and why.\n\nNonetheless, the pacing is good, keeping my interested throughout the unusually long 130-minute running time. The music is good, leaning toward an orchestral, cinematic style, and even the couple of English-language characters buck the general anime trend by being fairly passable actors, although they will never exactly win any awards either. There are a couple of problems with contradictory underlying themes, but this bothered me more when thinking about it afterwards than while actually watching the movie.\n\nAlthough I have not seen the TV series, Nanoha the Movie appears to do a reasonably good job of adapting it to the big screen. As a result, whether you like the film comes down more than anything else to whether you like the series. Nanoha is almost *the* quintessential shoujo (magical girl) anime, at least in the modern era. When it comes down to it, if you like magical girls, you will like this movie, and if you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t.",

What makes that all the more remarkable is that the footage was all shot by the assistant director in Turkey then taken to Switzerland for Yilmaz Güney (a brilliant writer/director who had to leave Turkey to escape persecution and imprisonment, mostly because of his empathy for the plight of the Kurdish people under Turkish rule) to edit and dub. The cinematography is colorful, rich and varied. The musical sound track is beautiful and well-integrated. The various subplots seem to echo and build on each other. Somehow, while making the grim realities of modern Turkey all too evident, this film also left me with a feeling of the indomitability of those who struggle for freedom.",

Just a ordinary, very funny comedy.\n\n Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal return when a Japanese minister comes to France for some kind of new defense strategy. Of course, that strategy has to be showed, and than it goes wrong. The Japanese minister is kidnapped and the police tries with the help of Samy Naceri to get him back.\n\nThe final of the film is a bit overdone, when almost a dozen police-cars hit each other near to the Eiffel tower. Absolutely not realistic, but that&apos;s not such a bad thing, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s the result of a great car-chase before, and the things that happen then are so dumb but so funny; irresistible. The greatest moment of the movie is when Samy Naceri, Frederic Diefenthal, some Japanese girl and the military father of Samy Naceri&apos;s girlfriend jump out of a plane. And when they come down...great, great, great, great!\n\nTaxi 2 is a real must-see. Typically French, but great fun."

      "reviewBody": "KISS isn&apos;t known to be the most giving band in the world. Sure, you get your money&apos;s worth, but don&apos;t expect anything more or something like a free autograph or a &quot;hi, how are u doing&quot; from the last remaining original members without taking out your wallet first. That seems particularly true these days, where the band still produces tours and albums on the sole premise that most fans are completists, who cannot suffer holes in their collections. So, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; was one of the last few cases where the fan had the feeling that this was produced by band &amp; fans for fans and not only for cash.\n\nSure, I had rooted for this film when it came out and sure, as a kid I had my room plastered with KISS-posters, wore KISS-Make-Up during Halloween and religiously bought most things that bore the distinct logo (despite the design being altered in Germany, because it resembled the SS-Runes a little too close, suggesting that Mr. Chaim Wietz and Mr. Stanley Eisen were Nazis). Got my dad to smuggle me into &quot;Runaway&quot;, despite being a few years short of admission (and I didn&apos;t want to go see this film because I&apos;m fond of Tom Selleck). Thinking of it, my parents probably bought Gene Simmons a new Cadillac, despite nowadays I&apos;d hope that this money went into the pockets of either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss.\n\nBy the time &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; hit the cinema, it had pretty much been clear to even the hardened fan, that 90 percent apart from the music was hype and that the two founding members had begun to view their band more of a cash-milking-cow rather than a vehicle to transport good music. But why drop a lifelong habit? Like Richard Linklaters &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, Adam Rifkin was able to capture the feel and air of the time &quot;When KISS ruled the world&quot;, which is only one aspect that makes the film work. Though by the time I was old enough to get into the concerts KISS had already taken off their iconic make-up, one could really get a feel of what the great KISSteria must have been like. Then there is the humour: I&apos;m not easily moved to laugh tears at slapstick, but I have to admit that a heartily laughed more than once. The priest and the mushroom-pizza, the clash between KISS-Fans and Disco-Guidos or the Hawk stripping for cash, it all made me crack up. As a bonus, there are plenty of KISS Insider-jokes, from the names of the protagonists to the dialogue; it should be abundantly clear: Adam Rifkin knows his KISS.\n\nWhen talking to the fans, the issue of a sequel would invariably come up. Despite still being a fan-boy deep inside, rationality keeps saying that this just wouldn&apos;t work – as little as KISS worked after 1982. What would people like to see? Our four protagonists being in college and moaning the fact that KISS has degenerated into a run-of-the-mill Glam band during the 80&apos;s? Having settled down to a blue-collar-existence and taking their kids to see the KISS-reunion in the 90&apos;s or having to witness the gold-digging sham that KISS has degenerated to in recent years? No, it&apos;s good that &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; is (and will likely remain) a one-time-thing – could be a lesson there for Simmons and Stanley.\n\n7/10",

(which means &quot;forward&quot; in Italian), Lemmon plays Armbruster, a snobby American executive who travels to Italy to reclaim the body of his father after the latter dies of an autowreck. Little did Armbruster\n\nknow that his old man had a companion with him, a British lady whose daughter Pamela (Juliet Mills) is also present to claim her body. Though antagonists at first, Armbruster and Pamela are drawn together because of their parents&apos; mutual interest. With a rich Italian\n\nlandscape (complete with an awesome view of the Mediterrean Sea), plus a typically great performance by Lemmon and a well-played one by Mills, make this a terrific romance flick."

The same formula story used of Khudgarz &amp; Saudagar two friends becomes enemy &amp; misunderstanding, in my opinion Anupam Kher role must be minimised &amp; in the Climax Shah Rukh Khan role to be shorten S.R.K. alone fighting not digested he couldn&apos;t attract in fight sequence.more role &amp; some fight sequence must be given to Jeetndra &amp; Shatrughan because the story demanded , Jeetendra heading the entire cast &amp; the entire story around him &amp; in the climax there is no role for Jeetendra, it is not the justification of the script writer that&apos;s why the movie flop, Shah Rukh Khan &amp; Raveena acting wise is O.K. Anupam Kher overacting &amp; cross dressing &amp; dancing is wasted &amp; boredom. Shatrughan Sinha has given his best effort, Jeetendra justifies his role &amp; given his best as usual, 1st song is good, Even the Director Ramesh Sippy Sholay fame couldn&apos;t save the film, The movie is not worth to watch."

      "reviewBody": "Great filmmakers usually end their careers on a sour note and this is no exception; barring some inept future use of British lottery money it is unlikely that the knight Sir Richard (nay, call me LORD Richard) will get another 15 million pounds or so to blow again.\n\nPick your favorite: Henry Hathaway bowed out with SUPER DUDE (a blaxploitation film I had the privilege of viewing in Cleveland on a double bill at the Scrumpy Dump Theater (!) some 35 years ago; Billy Wilder ended with BUDDY BUDDY; William Wyler had THE LIBERATION OF L.B. JONES (on paper a step up from SUPER DUDE, but not by all that much); Frank Capra with POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES which he really hated, per his autobiography; Stanley Kubrick&apos;s EYES WIDE SHUT (hardly up to his high standards); Otto Preminger had THE HUMAN FACTOR, which I (alone?) liked (I&apos;ve been a rabid Nicol Williamson fan since seeing him at Stratford as one of the greatest Macbeths, opposite Helen Mirren) and which costarred Attenborough. Even Michael Powell, apart from a look-back docu, culminated his career with an innocuous but hardly impressive Children&apos;s Film Foundation effort THE BOY WHO TURNED YELLOW, which I watched once at MoMA for completeness. There are obvious exceptions: Joe Mankiewicz bowed out with SLEUTH, an estimable movie and David Lean&apos;s A PASSAGE TO India was a winner.\n\nPer the particularly self-serving (and useless) &quot;making of&quot; featurette on the DVD release titled &quot;Love, Loss &amp; Life&quot;, CLOSING THE RING is the folly of several producers who fell in love with a first-timer&apos;s screenplay based on the actual finding of an old wedding ring in the Irish hills. The flimsy, yet convoluted, script got funding and, per the interviews, bowled over Attenborough, too. How audience members react, limited to video fans in the U.S. where the Weinsteins thought better of wasting money on a theatrical release, is an individual matter, but the tired blood on screen here is frankly an embarrassment.\n\nSome cinematic lions, notably Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer, as well as from a more recent generation Brenda Fricker and Pete Postlethwaite, are matched against some young talent, but the performances are uniformly poor. Having seen all of Attenborough&apos;s theatrical releases in first-run I concede he is capable of very good (Gandhi) but when he is bad, he turns out execrable material, notably the insulting A CHORUS LINE adaptation. I enjoyed YOUNG WINSTON, but then again I liked NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA by Schaffner back then too -pageantry is easy to take. But when Richard tried a genre film MAGIC for Joseph E. Levine, after making A BRIDGE TOO FAR for that once-famous showman, mediocrity ruled -about 10 steps below no-budget maestro Lindsay Shonteff&apos;s DEVIL DOLL. \n\nDespite the filmmakers&apos; protests of how moving and inspirational this love story hit them, on the screen it is flat and dull. The young cast, led by Mischa Barton, gives paper-thin performances, and the attempt by Attenborough &quot;to be hip&quot; by having Barton nude a couple of times is beneath contempt. That&apos;s as old a ploy as THE YELLOW TEDDY BEARS, a well-meaning (and boring) British exploitation film from 1964 for which I saw a vintage U.S. coming attraction just this past weekend (resuscitated by Something Weird Video) in which extraneous nude scenes were added to release it stateside as GUTTER GIRLS. Now I might accuse the Weinsteins of such ploys, but for Richard to stoop that low -wow!\n\nThe back and forth plotting from 1941 (actually 1944 it turns out in the narrative later) and 1991 to shoehorn in the Irish Troubles is undigested screen writing of the worst order. Connections between the two are lame and all the &quot;maybe&quot; and suggestive material goes nowhere. For example, strident Neve Campbell (a performance worse even than her terrible effort in the Alan Rudolph dud about sex INTIMATE AFFAIRS) as Shirley&apos;s grown up daughter creates wonderment as to &quot;who&apos;s her daddy&quot; but it turns out to be strictly a red herring, time-wise. Ditto casting Fricker of all people as the old-age version of a W.W. II &quot;tart&quot; who slept with all the Yanks -this hook is dangled for the viewer and left unresolved. Postlethwaite is perhaps the best performer in this one, but his role is 100% functional, designed for a big &quot;reveal&quot; only.\n\nI&apos;ve never seen MacLaine so disinterested (and uninteresting) in a movie- she looks like she&apos;s playing under protest. The character of a woman who had basically three beaux but wasted her life attached to the dead one is admittedly unplayable but she doesn&apos;t even try. Plummer has more energy, perhaps he alone was given Geritol on the set, but this is a thankless assignment as the &quot;good buddy&quot; who never got the girl. The debuting young Irish thesp Martin McCann is insufferably cheery in what turns out to be the lead role, the boy who found &quot;the ring&quot;. Closeups and other emphasis on the object make one think we are living in the shadow of Tolkien, but needless to say this totem is of zero importance.\n\nCLOSING THE RING is so bad one is reminded of the late Frank Perry&apos;s disastrously soapy MOMMIE DEAREST and MONSIGNOR, for which a wonderful director ended up being the butt of catcalls from Midnight Movie audiences. Unfortunately, its plotting is too dull and execution too mediocre for this lame RING to end up with any such afterlife, avoiding even the pitiful fate of having Hedda Lettuce lead camp followers in weekly derision at my local Chelsea (NY division, not England) cinema."

      "reviewBody": "This clever horror movie deals about a couple (Ray Lovelock, Cristina Galbo) afflicted by stalking, vicious Zombies (Jose Lifante, Fernando Hilbeck,Joaquin Hinojosa and many others) relieved by ultrasonic radiation caused by agricultural experimentation. Meanwhile a grumpy Police Inspector (Arthur Kennedy) is investigating the strange events.\n\nGory, gruesome , and ghastly cannibal feast in which the stumbling flesh-eating stiffs are reanimated by means of radioactive waves and can be only destroyed by fire. Unrelenting shock-feast laced with touches of ecological denounce. Army of Zombies appearance roaming the countryside , graveyard and some people besieged inside a hospital deliver the goods , enough to be interesting. Jorge Grau&apos;s first great success is compelling directed with startling visual content . This frightening movie is plenty of thrills, chills, body-count executed by the eerie Zombies and photographed in glimmer color with lurid images and phenomenal results. This is a classic Zombie film where the intrigue,tension, suspense appears threatening and lurking in the foggy outdoors and every room, and corridors from a hospital. At the time considered the plus ultra of disturbing movie is less stomach-churning by nowadays&apos;s standards, yet its fundamental power to thrill remains undiminished. Agreeable performance by Cristina Gabo who made various Giallo and Horror movies as ¨The boarding school¨ , ¨What have you done to Solange¨, ¨The killer must strike again¨. This genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of images-shock is well photographed by Francisco Sempere in location of England : Manchester, Derbyshires , Italy : Cinecitta studios and Madrid . Creepie and eerie musical score by Sorgini. Jorge Grau who also made another good terror film titled &apos;Ceremonia Sangrienta&apos; creates a rare Zombie thriller that manages to be both scary and skilfully made, deserving its cult status . Rating: Good, this is one more imaginative horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . An average budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits.",

      "reviewBody": "With Byrd at the South Pole (1930) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nThis documentary picked up a Best Cinematography Oscar and rightfully so as some of the shots are just downright breathtaking. The documentary covers the year-long journey of Rear Admiral Richard Byrd as he tracks down to the South Pole where he attempts to become the first person to fly over it. The documentary picks up as the ship leaves New York and we pretty much see their not so good life for the next year as they struggle to build up their shelters as well as having to deal with the low temperatures and of course actually building the plane to try and make it fly. I think history buffs are certainly going to get a kick out of seeing this footage as there&apos;s no question that it&apos;s pretty remarkable getting to see this historic event. The cinematography really puts you right there as there are some terrific shots of the wildlife and some footage showing how dangerous everything is. Just take a look at some of the shots during the two blizzards that are shown and you&apos;re really amazed that no one was killed. There&apos;s also quite a bit of humor added in the title cards (the film is silent) in regards to the low temperatures and there&apos;s a funny sequence where we see some spring cleaning and we get to see how they get a hot bath. The Aeriel footage is another major plus. The film starts off with a talking sequence with Byrd delivering a speech about his journey. This is probably the worst sequence because of how badly he struggles to read the cue cards. His eyes are constantly looking over to the cards and even worse is how he has to break sentences up to look over and see where to pick up again. Still, the actual images is what makes this film so special and worth viewing."

      "reviewBody": "As I had never seen the French original, I don&apos;t have nothing to say about it, although the American version is too much underrated by the critics, l spent last night checking out this picture which I had good memories from the early 90&apos;s when I&apos;d watched it on TV, indeed Breathless aged very well and holds up at the time, Richard Gere plays Jesse a wild guy car thief, living blithely as hadn&apos;t anything on the future, often reading a comic book of his fave hero Silver Surfer as pure escapism.\n\nJerry had a misfortune to kill inadvertently a cop after committed a mistake on the road, Jerry had plans to your newest French girlfriend Monica (Valérie Kaprisky) at Mexico, henceforth your life turns upside down, whatever he does all things getting worst, although his adventure spirit he goes ahead in randomly, following his own survival instincts, plenty of nudes and sexy scenes notable by the splendorous Monica, also rocked by the Killer Jerry Lee Lewis&apos;s Breathless as highlights at fabulous soundtrack.\n\nRichard Gere illustrates that is a multilayer and versatile actor, also Art Metrano in a funny queer character with ice screen at mouth as owner of scrap yard and the recurrent stereotyped John P. Ryan as Lt. Parmental of the L. A. Police who enforces a chase without respite of Jesse, moreover the final sequence is really breathless!!\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nResume:\n\nFirst watch: 1993 / How many: 2 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 7.5.",

      "reviewBody": "There are millions of square miles in Korea covered with rugged jagged peaks and layers of ice and snow. In this film entitled, &quot; Fixed Bayonets &quot; the story relates the thoughts and deeds of a select group of soldiers out of a larger division who act as a Rear Guard in such a desolate frozen environment. Anyone who has ever served in the military, can tell you, fighting with a massive army allows one to believe in eventual victory. However, when the force is reduced to a mere handful, as in this case, soldiers quickly become keenly aware of the certainty of death. Furthermore, a single soldier is duty bound to obey orders as they are perceived to be necessary for the survival of all. Indeed, warriors tend to minimize their fears when being led by competent Officers and leaders. Herein is the crux of our movie. Learning he is forth on a list of Platoon leaders, a young Corporal (Richard Basehart) dreads the possibility of Command. Advising him on the eventuality is an experienced veteran called Sgt. Rock. As the Platoon is slowly encroached on by Seasoned North Koreans, death in the ranks is inevitable and with each loss the worry of Corporal Denno becomes more acute. The movie is a soldier&apos;s tribute to the often forgotten Police Action, but one which is nevertheless a reminder of the terrible price America paid in the 1950s. Gene Evans, Paul Burke, Glenn Corbett, John Doucette and a very young James Dean are the cast of the film. ***",

      "reviewBody": "Explorer Robert J. Flaherty spent the majority of 1914 and 1915 along the Hudson Bay, doing research and exploring for a Canadian railway company. Being a keen photographer and potential film-maker, he took a camera along with him. He shot 30,000 feet of film, of the native Eskimo tribes and their alien, hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The test footage was met with universal excitement, only Flaherty dropped a cigarette on the highly-flammable nitrate film-stock whilst editing, and lost it all. He would return, only this time with the sole intent on making a narrative- driven documentary, about one specific family of Eskimos, and their highly-charismatic leader Nanook, a legendary hunter.\n\nThough it is now widely heralded as a masterpiece, and the film that gave birth to the documentary genre, the film is often criticised for its obviously staged dramatic scenes, and truth-manipulation in the search for a coherent narrative and to inject the film with an air of excitement and wonder. Personally, I have no problem with this approach, after all, one of my favourite directors Werner Herzog frequently does this in his documentary films to create a sort of artistic truth, opposed to the point-the-camera approach of cinema verite. In the modern age, we are treated to high-definition, sweeping footage of some of the most exotic and hostile corners of the planet, so it&apos;s a marvel to see where it all started, and Flaherty, faced with early, clunky film equipment and relatively little experience of film-making, created a magical documentary for an audience that, back then, knew little about the world outside their own country.\n\nAmongst the many set-pieces we are treated to, the greatest (and much- celebrated) is the building of the igloo. We watch Nanook build it with skilled precision, slab by slab, and even incorporate a window feature, in order to give the igloo some warmth, and a chunk of ice by the side of it to divert the sun&apos;s rays. With many Eskimos now adopting Western aspects into their livelihood, the film is definitely a window into the past (the Eskimos had in fact already done this, and even wore Western clothes, but Flaherty persuaded them to revert back in order to give the film more of a sense of wonder). For a film-maker who had only taken a three-week course in cinematography prior to Nanook, the film is rich with beautiful imagery. The scene that watches the family trudge into the distance as the mist blows over the snowy surface like fleeing ghosts, gives the film a gorgeous, eerie quality. If you can forgive the film&apos;s manipulations, then this is still one of the greatest documentaries features ever produced, and Nanook (real name Allakariallak) proves to be a charming protagonist.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "This film, which follows the misadventures of an unsuccessful, but self-professed genius, musician who takes on the direction of a musical celebration in honour of a gangster, in the hopes of securing a recording contract. The plot here is not really the focus, rather this is a showcase for famed Italian comedian, Totò. This film, the first Italian film in colour, was put together from a combination of Totò&apos;s most famous sketches, an thus has a somewhat important place in the history of Italian cinema. Comedy is always a subjective genre, and rarely dates well, so a contemporary audience might not get many laughs from this. It&apos;s of a style reminiscent of many Hollywood comedies of the era, relying on fast-paced dialogue and absurd situations, but minus the slapstick/physical elements sometimes found in &apos;screwball&apos; comedies. Indeed, this is not a very visually engaging film. The then new colour system apparently required particularly powerful lights, which may have hampered the production and limited the freedom of movement.\n\nUltimately this is a serviceable comedy, that might particularly appeal to fans of Bing Crosby/Bob Hope style comedy, and is otherwise probably just a good way to discover the work of Totò.",

      "reviewBody": "A Night in Casablanca does have a somewhat contrived plot about spies and hidden treasure, and it mayn&apos;t quite have the consistent genius of their earlier outings primarily Duck Soup, however it is still thoroughly enjoyable thanks to some of the gags and performances.\n\nIt does look striking and has a quirky score. And the dialogue is pretty darn hilarious and quotable, and I liked the cheeky comparisons with Casablanca, one of my all-time favourite movies. A Night in Casablanca is salvaged though by the gags, Groucho&apos;s attempts to get inside various hotel rooms in order to woo Annette and Chico thwarting him every time is a great gag that does not wear out its welcome, but Harpo has the best gag that happens in the opening minutes. The acting is great, Harpo and Chico are very funny and Lois Collier is a nice surprise too, but once again Groucho elevates this film, being as quick and witty as I&apos;ve come to know him by and going into one-line overdrive.\n\nIn conclusion, not outstanding but a lot of fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

It&apos;s about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt. Only one person is willing to believe him, and recruits him for a translator. What they find is even more amazing than they expected.\n\nIt&apos;s a highly underrated movie, in my opinion it&apos;s better than most sci-fi movies and very interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "This is nothing less than a formidable film of almost excruciating force and power in its overwhelmingly correct realism in depicting the tremendous passion of this the greatest of free-thinkers, his denouncement by his best friend and host and the horrible inhumanity of the bureaucracy of the inquisition. When once in the hands of the inquisition, the system was simply so constructed, that it was impossible to get out again - no revocation could help, and all that Venice could do, being after all a republic out of papal control, was to wash their hands and hand the case over to others, leading to a constantly more desperately dwindling spiral of a process to perdition. Gian Maria Volontè is magnificent as Bruno, he couldn&apos;t have been made more convincing in his increasingly desperate argument and protests, showing also his very human sides, while the chief merit of the film is its marvellous visual language, often turning the film into pure expressionism, aided by the at times overwhelmingly apt music by Ennio Morricone. This is more than a film, it&apos;s an inspired passion of a film, showing Italian historical realism at its best. I didn&apos;t know this film existed before I stumbled upon it searching for something else, and starting to watch it there was nothing else to do but to see it through till the end. It should be made more widely known, it pinpoints Bruno&apos;s case and arguments and presents a good summary of his very pantheistic philosophy, which makes the film also very educational and instructive and an invaluable shortcut and comprehensive overview of the everlastingly troublesome and actual case of Giordano Bruno.",

Now it&apos;s 2004 and i just found it out of a billion movie stores And i haven&apos;t seen it in a while and i still love it and intend to buy it.  It&apos;s got humor, adventure and drama all the things i love in a movie.  Great cast, good story-line, Though you never see ones like this anymore.  Fun to watch and enjoy.  Language may not appeal to some parents but all-all it&apos;s a great flick.  Acting was wonderful and the area where the movie was shot was beautiful.  In the VHS version i think a part was cut out but i&apos;m not sure. There&apos;s also alot of familiar faces in the movie.  Recommended for a movie night or in my case a rainy day! ~!"

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;ve got three actors, two old boats, a big ocean, and ninety minutes to fill. So you better have your ducks in a row, otherwise the package is going to sink faster than the proverbial lead balloon. Fortunately, the folks in charge here know what to do, and the void turns into a real nail-biter. Darn near everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the action, and I may have even seen that float by.\n\nAfter a 100+ reviews, two comments might be helpful. Note that in the struggle to survive, Hughie&apos;s (Zane) main adversary is not the expected other male, John (Neill), Rae&apos;s husband. Instead, John spends his time trying to keep his head above water in that broken-down old schooner, a long way from the malevolent Hughie. No, it&apos;s up to the girl Rae (Kidman) to save the day any way she can, without the expected masculine help. Good thing, Hughie&apos;s got an eye for her &quot;fine-boned head&quot; and certain other features, otherwise she&apos;s a dead duck in the first five minutes. Thus, the real contest is a resourceful woman versus an unpredictable man that breaks with the long-established convention of combat &quot;mano y mano&quot;. And this departure, I take, to be a reflection of a surging feminist movement then making its way into popular screenplays.\n\nAnother sign of the times is the anti-climax &quot;add-on&quot;. In the old studio days, killing a guy once was usually enough. Then, after the bad guy was dispatched, the audience could relax and await a return to normalcy for the good guys. However, clever modern filmmakers found they could supply a surprise extra jolt by breaking with convention and bringing the menace back from the apparent dead. That way, the audience can never feel secure enough to relax, and suspense is kept on high right up to fade-out.\n\nThe price they pay, however, is moving from a semblance of reality into the realm of cartoon violence. Here, Rae hits Hughie with everything but a laser blast. So how does Hughie, who appears to be a mere mortal like the rest of us, survive to provide that extra jolt. As you might guess, only by departing from reality as the rest of us know it. Thus, the structure of the screenplay migrates from &quot;what could happen&quot; into &quot;what happens only in the movies&quot;. And, for me, at least, I&apos;m reminded that this is, after all, only make-believe. Nonetheless, the movie really does accomplish a whole lot with a surprisingly very little."

These are naturally sad stories, but I have to say they&apos;re hardly surprising. In fact, the most surprising thing is that the homes they&apos;re fleeing really don&apos;t seem THAT bad. But I suppose the siren call of the mythical American Dream is too much for some to resist. Director Rebecca Cammisa wisely stays away from politicizing the situation, and the film is done without narration and only brief informational titles. However, this means there is also a lack of any proposed remedies to the problem. It seems to me these kids are better off sticking it out at home, at least until they&apos;re old enough to better fend for themselves. Whatever the case, the material is very engaging as we get wrapped up in the plight of these young vagabonds.",

Fate of Bachchan changed after this movie and his acting was appreciated in this movie pacing the way for his first sucesss in the movie &quot; Run&quot; . Shararat is a different from the league film which will surprise you with nice story, good direction, good acting and tight screenplay. This is the movie that will entertain you and your family . Abhishek Bachchan and Amrish Puri did a remarkable job, one as a spoilt brat and the other as the one who brings Abhishek back to right path. Hrishitaa is good too. Casting director did a good job. Each and every actor play their part to perfection. Mohnish Behl did a good job as the evil advocate. Ashish Vidyarthi is ok with his cameo appearance. Romesh Sharma and Navni Parihar as Dad and Mom of Abhishek Bachchan are noticeable . All the credit goes to debutant director Gurdev Bhalla for making a nice family entertainer which you will cherish with your family, with elders and children .",

But I also really enjoy films that suggest that vampires are perfectly ordinary people you would pass in the street.\n\nThis Swedish vampire story deals with two sisters who make the mistake of killing and draining a key member of a biker gang (which could easily be seen as self defence as he was trying to rape one of them at the time). Suddenly our sympathies are with Vanja and Vera and the remaining bikers - the ordinary people - are very much the aggressors as they follow them relentlessly through streets and town centres.\n\nThis isn&apos;t an eventful film, but I get the impression it is deliberately low-key. It&apos;s just one event in the day-to-day (or night-to-night) existence of two vampires in the modern world, and as such it it worth watching - not least for the performances, which are excellent, and the night-time filming, which really puts over the loneliness and desolation the two sisters have to deal with.",

You have to be a fan of this trashy literature to fully appreciate the film, but both Paul May and the cast took it seriously and do a convincing job. There are some scenes (Like the transport of the trees via the waterfall) that make this a slightly above-average film; the cinematography of the countryside, the mountains and the waterfall is nice, but indoor cinematography is mainly flat. Gert Fröbe is fine as Old Dag, which part is the best written; other parts are too shallow.",

There are times when I questioned the duration of real-time in the film as he opt not to use jump cuts to show the shift in time, but except that minor glitch, this film was highly tense, deep and meaningful at so many levels. \n\nUnlike the superficial Hollywood garbage we get to see everyday, Kiarostami&apos;s films show us real people with real problems. Probably one of the very few directors who can claim to have real class in this present era. I started watching this film after reading an interview with the director. The film did not disappoint me even a little bit. I am ashamed that I did not come across his name before.",

The plot follows our main character, Morgan with a serious issue going on in his life and he is looking for a way to deal with it. The second story is about six boys at a Summer camp (one who has anger issues, one who is the spoiled rich kind, one who is the silent/mute kind of kid, one who is a nerd, and the other kid). The boys all have different backgrounds, personalities, and problems of their own. The slapstick and jokes in this movie are just hilarious to yet average including some fart jokes that you could find in any family film, even the music score is splendid and this movie is still worth watching and considered to be a new instant classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Woman in a Dressing Gown is directed by J. Lee Thompson and written by Ted Willis. It stars Yvonne Mitchell, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms, music is by Louis Levy and cinematography by Gilbert Taylor.\n\nIt&apos;s something of an inauspicious title, a title hardly conducive to making this piece of film leap out at you, to shout that it&apos;s essential British cinema. How wonderful to find that not only is it a title completely befitting the material being played out, but that it is actually essential British cinema.\n\nIt&apos;s little known and very under seen, in fact myself was only introduced to it by a Canadian friend! The story centers on a London family of three, husband is away earning the corn at the office, teenage son is just starting out in life after school, and mother? She&apos;s on housewife auto-pilot, but disorganised with it. Her auto- pilot world is shaken to the core when it is revealed that husband is having an affair with his personal secretary, a smart and beautiful younger sort who is demanding that husband divorces wifey or it&apos;s all off...\n\nIt sounds very kitchen sink, but actually it&apos;s not, it&apos;s a very smartly written picture giving credence to mental illness, to the shattering blows of infidelity, of a crumbling family dynamic, a family that in truth is homespun. Ordinary? Yes, but safe as the red brick built poky flat they dwell in. We are not asked to take sides here, to chastise or judge, Thompson and his superb cast merely ask us to delve into their world, to understand it, the psychological humdrum of 50s Britain, the starkness of marriage does mean growing old together, but that nobody ever said it was going to be easy.\n\nLooking at it now it can be viewed as a very important film in the trajectory of British cinema, Mitchell&apos;s character is the fulcrum, making the film a must see as regards the evolution of how women have been represented in Brit cinema through the years. Thompson, better known for tough macho fuelled movies on his CV, does a wonderful job in letting us feel the anguish and emotional turbulence. Hazy camera shots couple up with stark framing of the objects in the cramped flat, all marrying up to the fractured nature of Amy &amp; Jim&apos;s marriage. There&apos;s even humour to be found, very much so, with Louis Levy&apos;s musical cue accompaniments deftly shifting from seething passions to Ealing like comedy as the home life of Amy is scattergun in execution. \n\nKitchen sink, social realist, proto realist and etc? No! This has no pigeon hole to be placed in, it&apos;s just terrific film making, from the writing, the performances, the direction and its worth to anyone interested in classic British cinema, this demands to be sought out. And for the record, the last 20 minutes of film will move and invigorate the coldest of hearts. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary is extremely well filmed at locations all over the world. Before saying more about it, you should know I watched the original German version, so that one is what I&apos;m talking about.\n\nBased on the book by German member of parliament Hermann Scheer, who is also one of the protagonists of this movie, Carl A. Fechner shows, in which ways alternative energies can be used today. As far as I am aware he is correct on the facts, the only thing I disliked is, that it is a slightly biased movie. You get to hear a lot from people who develop or distribute these non-fossile energy forms, but there is only one person speaking for the other side.\n\nNevertheless the movie gives those a voice whose arguments are often underrepresented in a discussion that has been going on for a while on a topic that needs some action. The sooner the better. If you are a stubborn conservative you will dislike the movie, any open minded person should definitely see it.",

A modern day (80&apos;s) fantasy that chooses an interesting setting to tell its tale. The hilarious innocence is non-stop as Raising Arizona showcases relationship, friendship, vanity, ignorance, and the search for peace and forgiveness. Who knows....maybe it was Utah?",

Compare it to an insider joke that only could be understood by a certain group of somehow related people.

It brings to mind the movie, Hawaii, in which the white man&apos;s ways and beliefs were supposed to transform the local inhabitants but as it turned out, the well-meaning visitors had much to learn from the island people&apos;s customs and beliefs. In a way it&apos;s a lesson for us all that we should respect cultural differences, customs and values. As the saying goes, There are many roads that lead to Rome. The episode of trying to spread their inventive wings and fly was great fun to watch and O&apos;Toole&apos;s furry feet were a hilarious footnote to the scene. I regret some of the violence enacted but then those days were not always pleasant times. A happier ending would have been nice. On the other hand this film makes you stop and think. One can observe the conflict of intellect versus soul wisdom being played out. It&apos;s a film well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Here is a film which defies catagorizing. It is, at once, a bedroom farce, a musical, a comedy and a disaster film. The musical end of it is pretty good, with everyone using their own voices. Kay Johnson, in the name role, does a pretty good job as the good woman wronged by an oaf of a husband. The legendary Lillian Roth is super as Trixie. She hits just the right note as the tough-as-nails showgirl who has designs on Reginald Denny. The film really picks up when we get to the masquerade party aboard the Zepplin. This was reportedly filmed in two-color Technicolor, but released in black-and-white, presumably due to the fact that musical pictures had gone out of favor by late 1930, and MGM was trying to cut it&apos;s potential losses by not paying up to print the sequences in color. The Adrian costumes are positively jaw-dropping. The drag queens could get some great ideas by studying these. (The gorgeous creation worn by Kay Johnson is in the Museum of Modern Art in NY). In all, this is a film which, despite it&apos;s obvious flaws, makes for an unforgettable viewing experience. It is a unique film even by the standards of the great DeMille."

      "reviewBody": "As an enthusiastic fan of Italian Westerns I must say that I was quite bored with Sergio Garrone&apos;s &quot;Se Vuoi Vivere... Spara&quot; aka. &quot;If You Want To Live... Shoot&quot; of 1968 (which is, by the way, not to be confused with Giulio Questi&apos;s brilliant and surreal &quot;Se Sei Vivo Spara&quot; aka. &quot;Django Kill, If You Live Shoot!&quot; of 1967 with the great Tomas Milian in the lead). I&apos;m generally not the biggest fan of Sergio Garrone&apos;s Westerns, but I admit that films like &quot;Django The Bastard&quot; certainly have their qualities. Furthermore, I haven&apos;t seen Garrone&apos;s &quot;No Room To Die&quot; yet, which is supposed to be great. \n\nIn &quot;If You Want To Live... Shoot&quot;, however, the boredom unfortunately outweighs the qualities. As many other low-budget Spaghetti Westerns this was absolutely inappropriately given a &apos;Django&apos; title in German speaking countries. Unlike most of the other unofficial &apos;sequels&apos; to Sergio Corbucci&apos;s 1966 masterpiece &quot;Django&quot;, however, &quot;If You Want To Live... Shoot&quot; doesn&apos;t even have a real antihero. This Django, who is played by Ivan Rassimov, is more of a typical good guy. An absolutely cheesy love story and Django&apos;s relationship to a family of farmers even take this film further away from the typical Spaghetti Western feeling.\n\nNevertheless, &quot;Se Vuoi Vivere... Spara&quot; is not a complete failure. The score is pretty good (but far from great). The film also has some cool, brutal moments. But then again, the film&apos;s boring and cheesy parts outweigh the good ones, and the film&apos;s 97 minutes seem very long. The movie is at least 20 minutes too long, they just should have left out all the sentimental family stuff, which seems horribly out of place in a Spaghetti Western.\n\nAll things considered &quot;If You Want To Live... Shoot&quot; is not completely awful, but it&apos;s definitely quite boring and a disappointment for a fan of Italian Westerns.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie and actor Jeeva himself will make you understand the significance of anger at different situations in life. When I said anger its not some typical anger story where the hero smashes 10 men with just his right hand, but a totally different one. The righteous anger is the meaning of the word, the movie title &quot;Rowthiram&quot; referenced by the famous tamil poet, Mahakavi Bharathiyar. He was an important part in India&apos;s independence movement who aroused thousands of people with his poems on Independence and freedom. Gokul the director of the movie has shown us that righteous anger is something every human being should possess. The fight scenes in the movie were so real unlike commercial movies where, not even the heroe&apos;s shoes get dusty. On the whole, an inspiring movie that would make most of us, jealous of Jeeva&apos;s character in the movie.",

Thanks to the makers! Storyline: Young Arab boy moves with his family into a mixed neighborhood in Berlin. He discovers that the old man in the apartment above is a Jew. He tries to fit in with the group of boy from the street, his cousin belongs to. He gets involved in a vandalism and the police presses charges.

Unfortunately, Lawless is tedious through and through. It&apos;s sequences go from bursts of heartless violence to development-less talking. The problem is its atmosphere, which could also be attributed to the choice of digital photography. It tries to be gritty, with its music hinting back to one of my favourite western TV shows, Deadwood, but the slick cinematography is just completely lifeless. It just feels like nobody&apos;s heart was truly in it (besides Guy Peace&apos;s menacing villain) with no chemistry between anyone. It was a huge mistake to try and force some romance subplots in here. There&apos;s nothing too bad about Lawless, besides its humourless and cold approach, it&apos;s just disappointingly average given the talent. \n\n6/10",

Her surprisingly-insightful escort Cheech (Chazz Palminteri), not Mr. Cheech, starts making great suggestions. David falls for aging leading star Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and cheats on his girlfriend Ellen (Mary-Louise Parker). Olive has an affair with leading man Warner Purcell (Jim Broadbent).\n\nIt&apos;s an irreverent Woody Allen movie taking a sharp jab at the backstage world with a healthy dose of mob violence. There are some hilarious moments but I do want more. I keep thinking that the movie is on the verge of great madcap fun. This is a pretty good Woody movie just below some of his greats.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been wanting to see BANG RAJAN for a good three years - and in this age of dvds and internets it&apos;s not often I have to wait that long to see something, but life seemed unwilling to give this film a readily available release with English subtitles. Finally, though, after sitting on the title for 2 years and almost missing out on first-to-market to Oliver Stone in the US, HKL spin-off Premier Asia got round to releasing it - in a 2-disc special edition with numerous interviews for extras, no less.\n\nBANG RAJAN was a landmark for the Thai film industry, a blockbuster hit that helped to create the recent surge in film production and production values. It tells the true story of a village called Bang Rajan, whose people stood their ground and managed to fight off the northern flank of an invading army from Burma in 1765. Without their bravery, Thailand might just be a province of Burma right now. Bang Rajan wasn&apos;t exactly a small village as it turns out, but they were far from a trained army, and were still vastly outnumbered by the invaders. How they managed to hold them off for so long is still a bit of a mystery.\n\nAs far as I&apos;m aware, there had never been a film made on as large a scale as this in Thailand before - though Tan Mui would have been well into pre-production on Suriyothai when BR was made. Director Tanit Jitnukul seems to be specialising in historical epics a bit, and has made several more since - including the very enjoyable KHUNSUK, which reunites many of the cast members from BANG RAJAN, but weaves a more personal story into the tapestry of the wars and times. BANG RAJAN wants to tell the story of the village, rather than any single individual - though about half a dozen characters are picked out to receive the main focus of the story, or to represent the village as a whole I guess. The director&apos;s story-telling skills aren&apos;t quite up to the task of weaving together these threads into a coherent picture, but you do get to care somewhat for the characters eventually. The main aim of the film is to show the heroism and predicament of a whole village of ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, forced to fight to protect their families and their country. In most war films the fighters are soldiers, and their battles are pretty much divorced from their everyday lives (photos of girlfriends back home etc aside), the villagers of BANG RAJAN are caught up in a war that they just happen to be stood in the way of.\n\nWhat makes BANG RAJAN into a war film, though, are the battle scenes - of which there are many, of a surprising scale and brutality. There&apos;s a lot of serious injury, and the sound of flesh being sliced, pierced or lopped off is sometimes relentless. The level and realism of the gore in the film is very high - possibly even higher than Korea&apos;s MUSA, almost as if the opening scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had been filmed with machetes, axes, hammers, spears and arrows. And still with guns and cannons too, for that matter. The Premier Asia set includes a very nice interview with the producer of the film, where he explains that he knows they can&apos;t achieve the degree of &quot;perfection&quot; in battle scenes that Hollywood films can because of their higher budget, but he hopes that the film does at least stand up to international scrutiny in terms of realism. Apart from a few dodgy CGI explosions, I&apos;d say it certainly does.\n\nI wish that BANG RAJAN had got a wide release right after it was made, as it would probably have been pretty successful. 5 years later, it&apos;s thunder has been somewhat stolen by other films like MUSA, SURIYOTHAI, HERO, WARRIORS OF HEAVEN &amp; EARTH and THE LAST SAMURAI. Compared to these, BR must be judged inferior (well, except for Suriyothai, which was more expensive looking but a less captivating film). The story-telling isn&apos;t too tight and most of the acting is unimpressive. It is film-making on a grand scale though, with impressively high production values for its budget (far lower than any of the other films mentioned) and a visceral impact that still stands up. Compared to MUSA it might look a little amateurish, but you have to remember there was no MUSA to compare it to when it came out. I don&apos;t suppose BANG RAJAN had much if any influence on those other historical epics that have followed it, since it was probably not seen far outside Thailand, but at least its impact on the Thai film industry must be taken as a credit.\n\nViewed in 2005 it&apos;s unlikely to be a life-changing film for anyone, but it&apos;s still definitely worth a watch - and I hope that it will sell well enough for Premier Asia to take a few more risks on releasing lesser-known films that don&apos;t already have good subtitled releases elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "A notable film on several levels. First, it was way ahead of America in being a relatively mainstream film that treated gay men as people of depth, value, humor and worth making a film about. (Although there is sad irony in the fact this huge hit play took so long to make it to the screen that AIDS had already totally altered the landscape by the time of its release. That&apos;s something the film only notes in the closing credits, and gives it a bit of a &apos;rose colored glasses&apos; hue). \n\nBut beyond any politics or social significance this is also a very well acted, funny and moving look at one man, Arnold, (played by the unique and charismatic Harvey Firestein, who wrote the play and screenplay) as he looks for love – both romantic and familial in a sometimes very cold world. If Firestein&apos;s performance can occasionally feel theatrical, it&apos;s also entirely appropriate for the starting-to-age drag queen performer he plays. What&apos;s wonderful is how Firestein always keeps the humanity under Arnold&apos;s occasional flamboyance very alive, as does Anne Bancroft as his &apos;difficult&apos; mother. Later in her career Bancroft could tend towards theatricality on screen as well, but she tones it down just enough to feel real here, and anyway, lets face it, next to a drag queen, who is more innately dramatic than a Jewish mother? (I grew up with one, trust me). \n\nMatthew Broderick and Brian Kerwin also do very good work in support, Broderick as a sexy but understated young man totally at ease with his sexuality, and Kerwin as a confused bi- sexual trying to work out his. While never rising to the level of a great film (the direction is very straightforward and bland, there&apos;s almost a TV movie look to it, it never completely surpasses it&apos;s theatrical origins), it&apos;s certainly a good, touching, human, and important one – although to a generation growing up with the reality of gay marriage and deeper integration of gay people into society, some of the historical importance may be lost. But not the essential, timeless embrace of kindness, love, respect and understanding",

Their plan seems almost foolproof, until George&apos;s mask slips and the bankers realize who it is, and older brother Billy doesn&apos;t want any living witnesses. After the wedding Garrett and his deputies set off after them who cross the border into Mexico, but Garrett ends up going solo and gets ambushed by the Clantons.\n\nPat Garrett survives, is horseless but he endures hardship in trying to apprehend the criminals and recovering the stolen money. But capturing the brothers is only the tip of the iceberg for Garrett, as Mexican bandits led by Santero decide to pursue Garrett and his fugitives in an attempt to get recovered money. Braving the harsh desert of the Devil&apos;s Valley Garrett evades his pursuers long enough to reach the Goddard ranch where Santero&apos;s gang surrounds them and lays siege to the house. Only one party will comes out ofthis alive...\n\nBullets certainly don&apos;t argue in this action-packed western which stars an ageing and paunchy Rod Cameron but the man executes his role with authority and style. He&apos;s surrounded by mainly a young cast. It&apos;s not just the action - which is top notch - that makes this early Spaghetti westerns great but it&apos;s the well-written characters, intelligent dialogue, an engaging plot, enough challenges for the hero and the beautiful desert location. This western is brimming with energy and it ends with a happy ending ... I love happy endings. I wasn&apos;t expecting this to be that good - sometimes having low expectations is a good thing.",

      "reviewBody": "Zack is content with his job as a box boy at the Super Club supermarket, seeing the days through with the minimum of fuss and effort. The fact that cashier Vince is the exact opposite only confirms the daily choice that Zack makes not to care. However when a new employee starts in the very shapely form of Amy, Zack finds a reason to change his ways. Amy has a reputation for finding ambition attractive, so employee of the month and assistant manager nominee Vince is in with the best shot. Zack decides to win the employee of the month competition instead of Vince, getting the kudos and the girl  but at what price? You can see the potential here for great comedy. The story of the title is really just there to create a frame for a workplace comedy that one would hope learns lessons from Office Space and The Office in really getting down to the reality to find the jokes. Sadly it never really does this but the results are not terrible  just basic. The plot is quite obvious but mainly stays out of the way by being a frame for the action. The relationship stuff involving Amy doesn&apos;t offer much for the amount of time that it goes on for but mostly it does free up space for the workplace joking. Problem is that it is not as strong as one would have hoped and much of it is at quite a basic level and doesn&apos;t have much in the way of inspiration. It still is quite funny at times and it made for a very easy watch but if you are hoping for more than that then the film will disappoint.\n\nThe cast are solid but not up to the task of lifting it. Both Cook and Shepard are good enough to do the minimum requirements but not good enough to really deliver something special. The support cast pretty much matches this approach by having a &quot;thing&quot; about their characters that allows one gag but not having anything more. The end result is a basic film that never really excels itself in any regard. It does do the basics well enough to make for very easy amusement for the undemanding viewer but nothing more than that."

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1972 (but not in the USA until 1974), &quot;It Can be Done Amigo&quot; is an Italian oater starring Ben Spencer as a gentle giant, Coburn, saved from unjust hanging. He becomes the caretaker of a little boy who&apos;s the heir of a remote ranch that many people are interested in obtaining for some reason. Jack Palance plays a comical gunfighter/pimp who insists that Coburn marries his nagging sister (Dany Saval) because he was previously intimate with her.\n\nIn spirit, but not plot, this is basically an early 70&apos;s Euro version of 1963&apos;s &quot;McLintock!&quot; Unfortunately it was lost in translation for me. Obviously a lot of effort was put into it, but it failed to engage. It&apos;s also marred by the limitations of most Spaghetti Westerns, like dubious dubbing. Plus there should&apos;ve been more prominent women (Saval is likable, but she just grates on the nerves after a while). Still, the movie&apos;s likable; it&apos;s just very eccentric, which limits its appeal, but I&apos;ll give it another try in a few years.\n\nThe film runs 109 minutes and was shot in Almería, Andalucía, Spain.\n\nGRADE: C- (4.5/10 Stars)",

      "reviewBody": "An Angel for Satan is the rarest, and therefore hardest to find of all the Gothic horror films that Barbara Steele made in the sixties; but hunting it down was certainly worth the time and effort as this film is right up there with Danse Macabre and Black Sunday as one of the best films that the horror icon made! Director Camillo Mastrocinque had worked in the Gothic horror genre previously with the somewhat less than brilliant effort Terror in the Crypt in 1964; but it would appear he&apos;d done some homework on the genre since then as this film is much better. The story focuses on a little Italian village. A statue belonging to a rich family has been recovered from the local lake after a heat wave, and Roberto Merigi has been called in to restore it; which coincides with the return of Harriet Montebruno; the daughter of the statue&apos;s owner. There is a story of a curse surrounding the statue, and the locals believe that the village itself will become cursed if it is ever recovered from the lake. Strange things then start happening in the village.\n\nThe key thing for this genre, and indeed the best thing about this film, is atmosphere. Director Camillo Mastrocinque succeeds admirably in bathing the film in a thick and foreboding atmosphere; which is helped by a great score from Francesco De Masi. The plot is spread rather thinly and the film puts its main focus on the central characters, which works well. Barbara Steele is, of course, the star of the show and aside from looking better than ever, also provides the film with its main story lines. Starring alongside Steele is the great Anthony Steffen, who provides a strong male lead. The film is basically a mystery thriller with horror elements tied in; the horror of course coming mostly from the atmosphere and direction. The plot does flow well and the film is always interesting, though my only real criticism of the film comes from the fact that more isn&apos;t made of the curse. There&apos;s a gorgeous sequence explaining how it came about, but that&apos;s the only real mention and it&apos;s a bit of a shame. Otherwise, however, An Angel for Satan is an exceptional Gothic horror film and comes highly recommended to anyone that enjoys films like this!",

The quality of the production in the first half hour suggests that the best is yet to come, so stick with it--rarely fair to prejudge the outcome, especially when, as suggested, top people have accepted to become a part of the production. I personally liked the hand-held camera effect, as it made it seem more of a film crew assigned to document a few days in the life of a universally despised representative of the state.\n\nThis is a very touching--and quite human--morality tale, with absolutely none of the cloying sentimentality that infuses the Hollywood versions of similar stories.\n\nAmong other things, it has made me aware of, and interested in Polish films. Rather like East European wines, I rarely think to taste there films. Perhaps I would like their wines as well..."

      "reviewBody": "Natalia Verbeke gives a good performance, showing a driven professional who goes after the truth despite sometimes experiencing personal fear. She has two nice showcase moments in the film where she proves she really got into her character&apos;s skin (in the cafeteria before Ariza&apos;s deposition and at the paper after a threatening call is received). Jordi Molla, on the other hand, underacts in light of the character he is playing. A military man in such a position would certainly show a great deal more arrogance and violent character, and we all know Molla is capable of showing it after his performance in BLOW. Ana Alvarez is memorable as the submissive girlfriend, but none of the rest of the cast really stand out. There isn&apos;t any real character development to make the audience sympathise with any of the main characters beyond mentions in passing that one of the journalists is divorced and the other about to get married.\n\nThe real problem with this film; however, is that the actors aren&apos;t really given much to work with. The basis of the story is explained in a manner approaching docudrama but without sufficient detail to really justify such stilted plot development. The scenes of GAL members doing horrible acts to the tune of American rock music is a teeny bit surreal as clearly it is meant to show GAL was working non-stop committing crimes of all sorts, but the movie doesn&apos;t get into the nitty gritty of what they actually did except to show one car bomb and one botched kidnapping. The musical choice makes me wonder if the person who did the soundtrack is at all aware of the music scene in Spain in the 80&apos;s and what the characters would likely have been listening to. In any case, the use of flashback at certain parts of the film is supported by the &quot;interview&quot; technique but doesn&apos;t add anything in the way of suspense. Rather it gives the film a sloppy and disjointed feel.\n\nAll in all, the film views like a propaganda film the likes of those shown to troops before wars to get them convinced of how they should feel without explaining too much lest they think for themselves. Frankly, the story this movie covers is a very important one in the history of a country that went from the fascist rule of a dictatorship to democracy without condemning the hierarchy of the previous government for their abuses. Clearly that caused problems in the transition to democracy and arguably those problems are still present today. There are so many historical, political and social issues involved that they cannot easily be treated in 111 minutes. However; that is no excuse for producing a film lacking in focus and development... unless the objective is solely to get the audience worked up.\n\nPerhaps a remake will do a better job. Perhaps a subsequent treatment will be worth watching. Aside from Natalia Verbeke&apos;s 5 minutes, this one sure is not.",

Widmark as the sadistic Udo had a particularly memorable turn. This film actually reminded me quite a bit of the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer, at least the first twenty minutes of that equally good crime drama. In both movies, the turning of evidence by witnesses for the state and their protection figure prominently. Unfortunately, the witness in The Enforcer isn&apos;t as lucky as Nick Bianco. One other note: the great Karl Malden has a small role in this film as a junior detective. Both Kiss of Death and The Enforcer get a solid 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Jake(Hawke, innocent yet with some edge) has been on the force for over a year and a half now. He wants to make detective, and that means joining Narcotics. For his titular training day he must impress Alonzo(Washington, simultaneously threatening and charming). He will soon find that this is a cop who crosses the line frequently. Exactly how far is he willing to go?\n\nThe acting by both leads is amazing. Honestly, for everyone in this. Denzel steals the show, but Ethan still really makes a mark. This is immensely gritty, with many honest looks at what happens in the bad neighborhoods of LA, as told by a screenwriter and director who actually lived there. The authenticity is a huge part of why this is so compelling. With a few exceptions, you really feel like this could happen(there are things that are not very credible. Others have already detailed them, I don&apos;t really have anything to add), and it really provokes a discussion of police brutality. Despite an episodic nature, every scene has a distinct purpose in the overall narrative, although for a number of them, you won&apos;t realise what it is until later.\n\nThis contains a lot of strong language, some brutal violence, and a little nudity. I recommend it to everyone who can stomach the contents. 8/10",

Joaquin Phoenix was great (after his superb role in Gladiator) but leading man Mark Wahlberg seemed a bit lost. Don&apos;t get me wrong! He&apos;s a fine actor and let&apos;s leave it like that. The &quot;oldies&quot; (James Caan,Faye Dunaway,Ellen Burstyn) left behind a good impression. I&apos;ll just end by saying that this ain&apos;t another Godfather or Goodfellas. Just a decent movie to watch on a rainy day. And ponder on the fact that in this movie the young generation have a lot to learn (including beautiful Charlize Theron) from the &quot;oldies&quot;. Excluding Joaquin Phoenix,ofcourse."

      "reviewBody": "West German Heimatfilm / local film with Claus Holm and Waltraud Haas\n\nThe story of this almost ideal homeland film is quickly told. Village jack-of-all-trades Toni (Claus Holm) is in a relationship with the pretty Italian Gina (Renate Ewert), which not only displeases her ex Matteo (Kurt Heintel). One day, pretty Toni is suspected of being a poacher. Suddenly the forester (Sepp Rist), the father of Toni&apos;s ex Andrea (Waltraud Haas), is shot. And then there is Gina&apos;s mother (Ilse Steppat), the attractive tavern owner Coletta Nicoletti. Luckily, the good Andrea has a good uncle (director Richard Häussler does the honors himself) who, as a criminal expert, can shed light on the dark matter.\n\nUnfortunately, life is not as easy as it is in the world of Heimatfilm. Nevertheless, you can watch the whole thing well. As a boxer and former miner, Claus Holm, who was born in Bochum in 1918, became a DEFA star with the enormous box office success &quot;Ehe im Schatten&quot; (1947). The Erlbacher-Toni from the mountains (it was filmed in the Großglockner area) can definitely be taken from him. Waltraud Haas plays her typical role as a kind-hearted but very boring girl to marry. It would be better to admire her in her star role as the Rössl landlady (Im Weißen Rössl, 1960).\n\nThings get more interesting with the two magnificent Italian women, played by the enchanting Renate Ewert and the famous Ilse Steppat (1917-1969). Ilse Steppat had also been there in &quot;Ehe im Schatten&quot; and was already a well-rehearsed team with Claus Holm. Unfortunately, shortly after her magnificent appearance as a Bond villain (On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service, 1969), Ilse Steppat died much too early!\n\nEwert and Steppat&apos;s joy in playing is wonderful. One drawback, however, remains that their roles themselves are too clichéd as &quot;foreign, foreign, exotic&quot;. The native and German-speaking (Waltraud Haas) brings good, the foreign and Italian (Renate Ewert and Ilse Steppat) brings ruin. Fortunately, those days are over!\n\nRalf Wolter (Sam Hawkins from the Karl May films) ensures a bit of a good mood as a Saxon tourist, who also reminds us of the &quot;brothers and sisters in the East&quot; affected by the division. So everything is there, everything checked off that a local film from the fifties has to offer.\n\nIncidentally, the production of the CCC film by Artur Brauner goes back to the novel &quot;Die drei Indizien / The Three Indices&quot; by Martinus and Fichelscher.",

But it&apos;s an important milestone both in Ryazanov work as well as in Soviet cinema. Not everyone can read behind the lines, but it&apos;s a very deep social and moral satire. Already in this movie Ryazanov made a decisive step towards tragicomedy. Nikulin as the honest and very naive detective actually parodies his former &quot;Gorbunkov&quot; impersonations, coming close to grotesque. The final trial scene is excellent and surrealistic. Short contributions from Andrey Mironov, Georgiy Burkov are excellent. Olga Aroseva was know as TV comedy actress before this movie, and this film makes some insight into her deeper personality and talent. The film is also famous for showing the medieval architecture of Lvov and old vintage trams on its streets.",

      "reviewBody": "Oh my. 20th Century Fox must have burned with shame and embarrassment at this wretched turkey being released under their aegis. I enjoy almost all old movies, and up until viewing Pirates of Tortuga had never seen a film that was ALL bad, without any redeeming qualities or entertainment value at all ... but this is the one. Pirates is so very inept in every respect that it can&apos;t even be enjoyed as one of those &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; pictures. The direction is almost non-existent, with scenes that drag on as is a first rehearsal had been filmed, and filmed before it had even been blocked. This plodding footage is interspersed with stock shots and, in cases, entire scenes lifted from earlier (and MUCH better) movies, and the inserts are glaringly obvious, particularly in the first battle at sea (thirty or so background extras listlessly waving swords at each other as if half asleep, never varying their position, suddenly interrupted by a genuinely action-packed insert from The Black Swan!). The cast is headed by lacklustre Ken Scott, who had lent his wooden presence to other Fox productions (his supporting role in Stopover Tokyo helping to sink that particular dud). John Richardson looks fabulous, but has no technique, looks somewhat lost, and after this film went back to virtual extra status until his breakthrough a few years later in She and One Million Years BC. Worst of all, in fact the worst performance I have ever seen by a leading lady in a studio production, comes from Leticia Roman, a pretty but spectacularly untalented Italian girl playing a cockney and spouting lines like &quot;lord love a duck&quot; and &quot;you ain&apos;t ever treated me like a lay-dee&quot; in a voice that&apos;s a cross between Monica Vitti and Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I am in danger here of making Pirates of Tortuga sound like something worth sitting through in order to have a giggle, but believe me it is NOT!",

      "reviewBody": "What makes poetry a special art form? Answers might include bringing together extremes of joy and despair within a couple of lines, offering an alternative to rational thought, enriching our outlook and understanding in ways that prose would struggle to equal. Poetry can provide a single phrase or sentence that is easily remembered and somehow unlocks difficult-to-express inner states, just as a song can (and poetry is the basis of songs). It offers a freedom of expression where you don&apos;t need to explain every aspect of what you are saying - it urges the listener to grasp a semi-spoken truth or idea.\n\nThat&apos;s my rough guess. I&apos;ve got over 40 books of poetry on my bookshelf at the last count, yet I&apos;m no literary expert and appreciate poetry in a very simple way. Most people might agree that poetry offers something special, so a film celebrating the life of a famous poet might be expected to bring us a glimmer of that something.\n\nSylvia Plath has been championed not only as a poet but as a sort of feminist&apos;  a cry on behalf of women treated as a commodity, subjugated by an unfair male-dominated system. Cast in the lead role, Gwyneth Paltrow&apos;s Plath focuses much attention on how downtrodden she was, chained to two children, overshadowed by a brilliant and celebrated Ted Hughes, struggling with bitterness, jealousy, mental instability and a less than attractive persona. We also get the occasional poetic outburst, from who-can-recite-poetry-fastest undergrad shenanigans to romanticised performances of Chaucer (addressed to an audience of watching cows whilst floating downstream in a boat). All punctuated with soft-focus shots of a naked Plath/Paltrow, hysterical and often violent outbursts at Hughes, and scenes of a generally uninteresting and uninspiring life of moderate wretchedness. The only thing that distinguishes Sylvia from the now-unfashionable kitchen sink drama is that its central character is called Sylvia Plath.\n\nSo is the film worthy of the title? In A Beautiful Mind, we learnt of the joy of mathematics, Lunzhin Defence championed the addictive mysteries of chess, and Dead Poets Society made us lift our eyes to literary horizons that could inspire the dullest of minds. Sylvia was limited, perhaps, by the refusal of her daughter to allow much of Plath&apos;s poetry to be used in the film but, for whatever reason, it has failed to be more than a rather humdrum biopic. It offers little insight into her poetry or the magic of poetry generally, and adds little of interest about the historical figure that doesn&apos;t apply to millions of women. If any deep philosophical statement can be drawn from this, the film certainly doesn&apos;t make it, poetically or otherwise. Sadly, it would seem that the words of Sylvia Plath&apos;s daughter almost became a self-fulfilling prophecy: &quot;Now they want to make a film . .. They think I should give them my mother&apos;s words . . . To fill the mouth of their monster . . . Their Sylvia Suicide Doll.&quot; Whilst not quite an empty doll, Sylvia is maybe an arm or leg short of a manikin.",

      "reviewBody": "Although Paul Kramer (played by Paul Klinger) would rather go back to sea, he has promised his parents to look after their hotel/restaurant. One last chance to save the family business is provided by love interest Helga (Anita Gutwell), who invites some musical acts to perform in a TV show at das alte Forsterhaus. The film opens with the various artists already on their way. Prominently annoying are three traveling clowns who insist on performing even without an audience (enough rehearsing already). They are joined by a bus load of Max Greger und sein Orchester. Some evil looking grandpa has also come out of retirement to sing while playing that instrument from &quot;The Third Man&quot; and finally there is some elastic guy trying to give Donald O&apos;Connor a run for his money. \n\nLots of depressing scenes of that pessimist Klingkramer complaining all the time are alternated by lively music numbers with people jumping up and down. At one point those three pierrots start using the tables at the outdoor restaurant as trampolines. Even when they remove their makeup and dress in lederhosen, you still recognize them because they always sing the same song. So if you are just idly switching channels on a Sunday afternoon and keep seeing this film pass by, it may seem to be just one 90 minute music parade. To be more precise, while the middle part features mostly boring drama, the first and last act are basically two versions of the same revue.\n\nAt least the performances have become more elaborate by the time we see them for the (hopefully) final time. Now they feature people dressed up as mermaids and cowboys. I did not notice any TV camera&apos;s anywhere, so perhaps that deal fell through at the last minute. With the Kringer story and the musical bits not complimenting each other at all (though they do try to tear at the heartstrings during the cowboy act), it is very difficult to enjoy both plot lines simultaneously. You either care about the characters or enjoy the music, most likely neither. \n\n3 out of 10"

The movie shows the audience the importance of the church and social classes and enables us to view the attitudes and emotions of people living during the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas.  However, it is evident that Bemberg has a slight bias in that the movie is seen through the eyes of Camila O&apos;Gorman.  This film is a wonderful example of how the movies intend to manipulate the viewer, allowing Camila to have all the rights and giving none to Rosas is rather biased.  The film strongly emphasizes the dictatorship of Rosas and the viewer is given the opportunity to see the profundity and power of this dictator."

Anyway, this movie is OK when it&apos;s OK, and really, really bad when it&apos;s really, really bad. Just watch the hilarious torture scene with Maxmillian Schell. Honestly, it&apos;s hysterically funny how hammy the acting is.\n\nAnd the dubbing is really bad, even though it looks like it was shot in English to begin with.\n\nThe only scenes of merit are the limited battle sequences. The rest is stupid and obvious, with over-wrought faces and an annoying supporting conspirator in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand who bounces from playboy to patriot at the drop of a hat. It takes him three minutes to make the obvious pun that he has a date with destiny. Whatever, watch this film some time if you want a good laugh."

      "name": "Incredibly enduring",
      "reviewBody": "Here is a film that has endured, perhaps because the science (relatively accurate back then) does not outweigh the fiction, and the crux of the fiction is the human relationship. The script, with just a few changes, could have been made as a Western, indeed, the appearance, and many mannerisms of Vic Lundin&apos;s Friday character seems to be based on portrayals of American Indians in Westerns.\n\nCredit has to be given first to director Byron Haskin, no stranger to Sci-Fi, having made WAR OF THE WORLDS, CONQUEST OF SPACE and FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON in the decade before RCOM was released in summer of 1964. Interestingly, for a man who spent much of his career in the special effects department at Warners, the film does not depend on effects, in fact they may be the film&apos;s weak spot. Not that they are substandard for the era, but the repetition of shots of the alien ships in flight, and of the destruction they cause (not even taken from a different angle, or reverse printed), remind one that the film was a budget conscious production. Originally conceived by noted screenwriter Ib Melchoir for a more costly production, budget cuts mandated script revisions that were done by John C. Higgins. This was a curious decision, Higgins was more at home in film noirs that were made by Anthony Mann, this was his first and only genre assignment. To his credit, and Melchior&apos;s misgivings aside, he pared down the script to essentials, and the film in general looks like a costlier production.\n\nMuch of the films success has to be owing to the splendid performance of Paul Mantee as Kip Draper, who carries of most of the first half of the film singlehandedly. Mantee was an unknown at the time of shooting, and he only had one more lead in A MAN CALLED DAGGER, but this casting worked in the film&apos;s favor. With an unknown actor, we&apos;re not in the position to associate the performer with any other role, he becomes everyman, and we become he. We share his loss of his commanding officer, his need to discover new forms of food, shelter, oxygen, and most of all, his isolation and loneliness as he begins to realize he&apos;s not likely to leave the planet. Actor Vic Lundin does well as Friday, we originally are led to believe he is mute, and the actor&apos;s eyes and expressions convey his thoughts perfectly. While it could be carped now that the film is politically incorrect, that it is an example of imperialism that Friday learn English, rather than Draper learning Friday&apos;s language, but such points of view were uncommon in 1964. Besides, that would require the audience to learn Friday&apos;s language anyway, and the script, having Friday owe his life to Draper relieves this as a form of subservience. As the film goes on, the relationship becomes one of equals, and Friday does repay the debt by saving Draper&apos;s life.\n\nApplause should also be given for the talents of Winston Hoch, cinematographer, for depicting a credible Martian landscape. Much of the film was shot in Death Valley, where 16 years earlier, Hoch shot John Ford&apos;s THREE GODFATHERS (he also shot the luscious photography of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON as well as some of the Irwin Allen shows and movies in the 60s), but during the whole of RCOM, we can entirely believe we&apos;re on Mars. Composer Van Cleave contributed a score that unfortunately has not made its way to a home recording, but works marvelously with the mood of the film, embellishing it, but not overpowering it.\n\nWhen the film was completed, Paramount and producer Aubrey Schenk were impressed enough to announce a sequel which was to be titled &quot;Robinson Crusoe in the Invisible Galaxy&quot; but disappointing boxoffice results quelled that project. Mantee would go on to a career of supporting roles on many TV films and episodic shows, and Haskin would come back with the excellent film THE POWER, but this was a shining moment for both of them. As with the best of Sci-fi before it, METROPOLIS, THINGS TO COME, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS or THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, the film is a celebration of the human spirit and a triumph of collaboration among talent."

This is Johan Jacobsen&apos;s first serious movie after having made nine comedies in a row, and he was still a young 32 years old director. The episodes are uneven and some of them are a bit mechanical, but the actors perform above their usual standard. Perhaps the best episode is the sailor Gunnar Lauring meeting the house maid Bodil Kjer hitting honest and sincere notes on falling in love, but you also find whimsical moments from Petrine Sonne and film noir like aspects from Eyvind Johan-Svendsen and Inge Hvid-Møller. Poul Reumert, Poul Reichhardt and Ib Schønberg has also noteworthy contributions in this outstanding compilation movie.",

The first half is scary by using great sound effects, beautiful shots and suspenseful plot. This is quite unlike many horror movies that relies on blood or shock to scare. The second half turns into a crime mystery, and I think the suspense is still well sustained. I did not see the plot twists coming, and hence I was surprised by the ending. Halle Barry&apos;s acting is great, she is convincing as a psychiatrist and even more convincing as a &quot;crazy&quot; person. Her facial expressions in the scene where she got possessed is great.\n\nI enjoyed watching &quot;Gothika&quot; very much."

      "reviewBody": "Despite a lot of errors including one apparently fictional lover for Frances Farmer, the film Frances is a look at on oddball type movie star for her time.\n\nToday Frances Farmer&apos;s activities for various causes wouldn&apos;t raise a sleepy eyebrow in Hollywood. Never mind being committed to an insane asylum. She&apos;d more at home now in the film industry than in the studio system of the day. The system is personified here by Paramount Pictures executive Allan Rich who is a cross between studio presidents Barney Balaban and Emmanuel Cohen in the day.\n\nBut Jessica Lange truly becomes Frances Farmer the girl with a social conscience, truly who did not like the cheesecake image that Paramount wanted her to fill. \n\nShe also learned from her experience in the Group Theater that even liberal activists could be snakes. Clifford Odets with whom she had one torrid affair with and Harold Clurman manager of the Group Theater let her down. Odets&apos;s wife never seen emerges as a villain of sorts who gets her man back. Not is she mentioned by name, but it was Luise Rainer who was still very much alive and lived to the ripe old age of 104.\n\nSo in fact is Farmer&apos;s first husband Leif Ericksen never mentioned by name. He&apos;s given the fictional name of Dick Steele and he&apos;s a minor character and played by Christopher Pennock.\n\nSam Shepard is not real, he&apos;s an amalgam of several left wing activists from the Seattle area where Frances Farmer was from. But he functions as sort of an emotional balance, someone who Farmer could turn to when she was unable to cope with all the lies and promises of show business.\n\nIf there is an award for bit parts ever developed for the year 1982 it would go to Darrell Larson. He&apos;s a real bottom feeder stringer for gossip columnist Louella Parsons. He has two scenes with Lange and in the second she puts him down severely.\n\nLange and Kim Stanley got Oscar nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. Stanley who could have done Frances back in her salad days plays her mother, a rather straitlaced woman who thinks her daughter must be crazy after all she and dad Bart Burns are the Ward and June Cleaver of the 30s, how could they raise a left wing radical. Ergo, she must be crazy. And Frances was going to stay in those asylums until she learned the error of her ways.\n\nJessica Lange fits Frances Farmer so well you forget this is a film biography and think you are peaking in on the life of Frances Farmer. As good as the film is I can&apos;t recommend too strongly that you read her autobiography Will There Ever Be A Morning? One of the most honest Hollywood stories ever written.",

Aside from that, &quot;Albino Farm&quot; is just awful, not even the soundtrack can save it.",

Sometimes it is a bit cheesy but hey, it is a bigger than live love story. The emotions are real, you can really feel with Tim and Vic and it is fascinating how the story develops and all the small things are put together in the end.

For publicity, Nifty Allen (Berle), a band publicist, arranges for the band to adopt a refugee. When the refugee shows, she&apos;s a grown woman named Karen Benson (Henie) who immediately falls for her guardian, the bandleader, Ted (Payne). She connives her way into the train that&apos;s taking the band to Sun Valley, where she quickly gets in between Ted and the band&apos;s singer, Vivian Dawn (Lynn Bari) whose claws come out in full force.\n\n&quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; is filled with skiing, Glenn Miller music, and Henje&apos;s fabulous skating. By 1941, Henje was starring in her own ice show, and her skating in this film looks less dated technically than it does in earlier films. And there&apos;s no one today who can come close to her spin sequences. I can&apos;t remember how it was done, but she skates on mirrored glass, and it looks great. This was an ideal role for Sonja - she gets to smile, skate and does not have to do anything too dramatic. Payne does well and sings pleasantly as her leading man.\n\nOne outstanding musical feature, &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo,&quot; a Miller standard, is performed first by Tex Beneke and the Miller singers and then - brilliantly - by Dorothy Dandrige and the Nicholas Brothers. This alone makes the film worth watching.\n\nDelightful.",

One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and take dancing classes every Wednesdays. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his &quot;little secret&quot;. Meanwhile, Beverly feels the changes in her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether John is having an affair.\n\n&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; is a delightful entertainment. It is pleasant to see a nice cast like the sexy Jennifer Lopez, the charming Richard Gere, the surprisingly great dancer Stanley Tucci, the funny Lisa Ann Walter, the wonderful Susan Sarandon and excellent support actors and actresses playing and dancing great music along 106 minutes. After watching this feel-good romance, the viewer will certainly feel lighter and relaxed. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Dança Comigo?&quot; (&quot;Dance With Me?&quot;)\n\nObs: On October 15th 2005, I saw the original &quot;Shall We Dansu?&quot;, which is better and better than this remake.",

To survive they look for food, and find that people have been to the island before, in fact a large group of people on a freighter ship that has wasted away.\n\n There are some clues on the ship as to what happened, and some strange goings on that stress these &quot;friends&quot; to the breaking point, and their cohesion starts to unravel.\n\n There is just something special about this eerie and fun movie that if I ever see it in DVD format I will pick it up."

      "reviewBody": "This is a fictional crime story based on the exploits of the infamous &quot;Banda Della Magliana&quot;, which terrorized the city of Rome for two entire decades. The movie is OK and it features an all-star cast and a famous director, but if you really want to see the same story brought to a much much higher level (not to mention going way deeper into the details), I strongly recommend you watch Romanzo Criminale The Series (two seasons of 12 episodes each), which is now available on Netflix, from other online sources and on DVD&apos;s.\n\nThe &quot;condensed&quot; story line of the movie is at times confusing and fails to successfully put the story into its historical context. Really, two hours aren&apos;t nearly enough to explain the back story and the historical references, especially to someone who didn&apos;t grow up in Italy --and particularly in Rome-- in the 1970&apos;s and 80&apos;s. So, I watched the movie years ago when it was released, and I was left with so many open questions that were only answered to my complete satisfaction once I watched the series (and yes, there are some continuity issues between the two productions, so don&apos;t think of the series as complimentary to the movie but rather as a complete retell.) I know that I&apos;m actually ending up reviewing the series here more than the movie, but really if you watch the series, then you will find that the movie is just a brief summary of the story without much character development, despite the more famous cast and director (incidentally, Mr.Placido is credited as a creative consultant in the series.) The series, on the other hand, is one of the best small-screen productions I&apos;ve ever seen, really quite up to the level of outstanding crime dramas like the Sopranos or Breaking Bad. \n\nI would rate the movie 6/10 and the series 10/10.",

The viewer knows they saw masterful construction work, but with lousy glue.\n\nRichard Todd plays a Londoner wrongly accused of murdering his mistresses&apos; husband.  He is befriended by a young actress (Jane Wyman), her eccentric dad (Alister Sim, perfect as a daffy version of a Brit gentleman)\n\n This film has arresting female characters (Marlene Dietrich is great as Todd&apos;s gal-pal.  Patricia Hitchcock makes a top-grade debut in her father&apos;s films, and Kay Walsh is unforgettable as a blackmailer.)  \n\n The film begins in mid chase, has a terrific long take during a  flashback, several other chases across and around stages and outdoor performances.  The finale in a cluttered, noir-ish prop room is good stuff.  What truly mars the film is the uninteresting sub-plot with detective Michael Wilding."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Flight of the Navigator&apos; might have been produced in the mid-Eighties but it certainly hasn&apos;t lost it&apos;s charm over the last twenty years and it does stand up well against more recent family film offerings.\n\nThe story begins in 1978 with twelve-year-old David Freeman, a happy all-American kid who lives with his loving parents and typically bratty eight-year-old brother Jeff. One night he sets off into the woods to look for Jeff only to be knocked unconscious when he falls from a ravine. When David awakes in what seems like hours later to him, he discovers actually eight years have passed and it is now 1986. Although he is still twelve years old, the world has moved on and even his little brother is older than he is. NASA are very interested in David when his EEG scan reveal readings in the shape of a UFO they have discovered and other scans of the boy result in star charts of distant galaxies being spewed out from the computers. But our hero is determined to return to his family so he breaks free and hides aboard the UFO which holds the key to everything.\n\nJoey Cramer gives a likable performance as David, a boy who enjoys adventures but ultimately just wants to be with his family. I think anyone watching the film would empathise with his character&apos;s anger and sense of helplessness when David discovers NASA have no intention of letting him go home. Matt Adler as sixteen-year-old Jeff is another notable actor in the film in the way he depicts his character&apos;s uncertainty of dealing with his little big brother and his developing protectiveness towards David. Also, look out for a younger Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nFor those who watched &apos;Flight of the Navigator&apos; as children in the Eighties, there is definitely a nostalgic feeling to it. However, I think children of present day would still enjoy the film as it has a little of everything and issues raised as still relevant and/or interesting today such as pre-teen crushes, annoying kid brothers, the thrill of following a hero on his &apos;quest&apos;, a fun mentor for the hero (even if it is metallic!) and arrogant scientist-types. It is important to remember that this is a children&apos;s film aimed very much at an eight- to twelve-year-old demography so it doesn&apos;t delve too deeply but the plot is quite unique, the characters are interesting and it is a film that is well put-together. Certainly one to enjoy with the whole family.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Skin Game&quot; is one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s earlier sound pictures, and although the story held potential, it is a rather bland film despite a couple of good Hitchcock touches.\n\nThe story centers on a rivalry between two neighboring families who have very different views on the future of their community.  Mr. Hornblower (Edmund Gwenn) wants to see the land developed and used for factories and businesses, while the Hillcrest family wants to see the traditional homes and countryside preserved.  The resulting conflicts hold some real potential, and lead to some good moments as the families try to outwit each other in a &quot;skin game&quot;, but the movie as a whole is never really very compelling.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is not a better film.  There are no big names in the cast, but Hitchcock made several fine movies with just this sort of cast.  Gwenn is good in his role, and Phyllis Konstam is believable and sympathetic as his daughter-in-law whose troubled past eventually provokes a crisis between the two families.  \n\nPerhaps Hitchcock stayed too close to the play on which the film is based (it does have a bit of a stage-bound feel), or perhaps for once he did not have a strong sense of the material&apos;s potential.\n\nHitchcock saved his best for the movie&apos;s most important scene, when a crucial parcel of land is auctioned off.  The auction scene, and a confrontation afterwards between the main characters, is well-done with some good twists.\n\nThere are also some nice ironic touches at the end.\n\nHitchcock fans should still watch &quot;The Skin Game&quot; at least once, to notice the ways that the director&apos;s usual touch can be seen, but this movie may not be of much interest to others."

The new conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Sir Simon Rattle, leads the project. He believes that the music, the classic music, is not only for people from higher class of the society, but belongs to all people. It is just like water and air, people need music to live. \n\nThe life in the movie!! If young people with low self-estimation dance, what would happen? Can you find your lack of self confidence in your way of dancing? The most attracting part of this movie describes the most deepest ego in the human-being, even when you move, you will show your character immediately. Through the dancing in a modern ballet, the adolescents find their power, their values that they have never had in their life, some of them even want to be a professional dancer.\n\nWhat a wonderful movie!! Only thinking of the changing of children will touch me deeply. I really recommend it. 10/10",

Greta Schiller&apos;s &quot;Before Stonewall&quot; looks at the history of LGBT people throughout the 20th century. I would never have guessed that World War II turned out to be an earlier kickoff.\n\nSince this documentary only goes up to Stonewall, it doesn&apos;t cover Harvey Milk (he got his own documentary that same year). A similar documentary is &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, about the depictions of LGBT people in cinema. All three documentaries are worth seeing to learn about LGBT history in the US. It sounds as though there&apos;s a sequel to this one, so I&apos;ll try to see that also.",

Based on a true horrifying event, the film comes across as uninhibited &amp; Extremely bear.\n\nDe Palma&apos;s Direction, as mentioned, is ruthless, like the story itself. David Rabe&apos;s Screenplay talks about Human-Cruelty &amp; it very efficiently narrates that. Cinematography &amp; Editing, are mention-worthy.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Michael J. Fox delivers a believable performance, that ranks amongst his finest works to date. Sean Penn is mesmerizing as the bad-guy, causing hate each time he appears on-screen. John C. Reilly, John Leguizamo &amp; Don Harvey, are terrific. Thuy Thu Le as the frightened victim, delivers a haunting performance, that&apos;s impossible to forget. Ving Rhames is good in a brief role.\n\nOn the whole, &apos;Casualties of War&apos; is worth a watch, but its certainly NOT meant for the faint-hearted.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not a big fan of Italian &quot;mondo&quot; movies, not so much because of their sleazy, hypocritical exploitation of the Third World, but mostly because of their occasional use of unsimulated animal (and occasionally human) slaughter. You don&apos;t have to worry about that here though because instead of this &quot;mondo&quot; movie taking place in some primitive tropical hellhole, it takes place in a more modern dystopian hellhole--Sweden! And NOTHING here is unsimulated. Ironically, this is kind of the reverse of the usual mondo film where a &quot;modern&quot; society passes judgment on more backwards &quot;primitive&quot; ones. Here it is the more modern society (Sweden) that is taken to task by what was then still a backward theocracy (Italy) for having such things as sex education and day-care for working mothers.\n\nLike most mondo films though a lot of this is just laughably ridiculous. There&apos;s a scene where a man is arrested for beating up a kid who is trying to steal his car because car theft was supposedly perfectly okay in Sweden but violence wasn&apos;t. But even if anybody then or now believed that, wouldn&apos;t you have to wonder how the filmmakers manage to record this &quot;spontaneous&quot; scene from several different camera set-ups? Even more unconvincing is a scene where a group of marauding bikers &quot;gang-rape&quot; a young girl. You might ask why the Italian filmmakers didn&apos;t try to help the &quot;victim&quot; instead of doing various set-ups and close-ups of her during her ordeal. Of course, you might also notice that the &quot;rape victim&quot; here is actually Swedish sex star Marie Lilljedahl from Joe Sarno&apos;s &quot;Inga&quot; movies and Jess Franco&apos;s &quot;Eugenie&quot;, so the better question might be why Italian filmmakers in this ridiculously staged scene didn&apos;t have the &quot;bikers&quot; tear the clothes off this Scandanavian lovely for the delectation of the audience (but I guess for that you have to check out &quot;Eugenie&quot; or &quot;Inga&quot;). Don&apos;t worry though, the movie does show plenty of naked, nubile Swedish girls including a nude photography session and whole gaggle of them running around bare-assed in the snow or sunbathing nude. (The narration claims Swedish women always sunbathe nude, yet almost all these girls have visible bikini lines).\n\nOther scenes like one of blind orphans diving for stolen property in the bay are so bizarre it&apos;s hard to tell if they&apos;re fabricated or not. And, of course, you also get scenes of alcoholism, drug use, and even a ridiculously staged suicide! The English version I saw was narrated by British actor Edward Purdom (who adopts quite a smarmy, morally superior tone for a guy that would later direct &quot;Don&apos;t Open Until Christmas&quot;). The music is actually pretty good including the famous &quot;M&apos;nah. M&apos;nah&quot; song that later appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Any other entertainment value here though was purely unintentional."

      "reviewBody": "With Green Butchers (aka: De Grønne Slagtere) we are in the territory previously marked out by Sweeney Todd, Eating Raoul, Delicatessen and the like: art house cannibalism. The peculiar flavour of writer-director Anders Thomas Jensen&apos;s film is partly explained by this choice of subject, as well as his involvement in the Dogme film movement, having contributed scripts for Mifune (1999), The King is Alive (2000), as well as Open Hearts (2002). The Dogme movement has made a virtue of making films to a strictly naturalistic series of rules, the severity of which, whether entirely serious or not, was intended to &quot;force the truth out of characters and settings.&quot; Green Butchers is not a Dogme film, but some of its characteristics owe themselves to an artistic manifesto which instructed its adherents to make films by all means available, even &quot;at the cost of good taste&quot; if necessary.\n\nIt&apos;s Jensen&apos;s second feature film after the well-received Flickering Lights (aka: Blinkende Lygter, 2000 - a film which also starred Mikkelsen and Kaas), another comedy-drama. Jensen&apos;s sly, dry humour is much in evidence here, too, as we follow the business of his two misfit butchers, &apos;Sweaty&apos; Svend and pot smoking Bjarne, into the path of making meals out of unwanted humans. As critics have observed, this is a film with two intertwined threads, with much overt, and grisly, dark comedy revolving around Sven, a man who &quot;has never been loved.&quot; He&apos;s apparently unable to show anyone the inside of his freezer without adding them to the chilled cabinet for the customers next morning, prepared as his speciality dish &apos;Chicky Wicky&apos;. Bjarne&apos;s story brings to the narrative more in the way of pathos and sweetness as, while struggling with the predations of his increasingly erratic partner in butchery, he also has to come to terms with the sudden revival of his brain damaged twin brother, as well as burgeoning relationship with the slightly naïve Astrid.\n\nPlaying both Bjarne and twin Eigil, Nikolaj Lie Kaas is remarkable in giving entirely separate performances throughout, so much so that I was going to make him a name to watch, but a quick look at his filmography reveals that he has already made 28 (including one related to his portrayal here, the notorious Dogme film Idiots of 1998) of which no fewer than 20 will have appeared in the last five years! The Walkenesque Mikkelsen, who is perhaps most familiar to British and American viewers as Tristan in the recent version of King Arthur, is also memorable, offering up Svend&apos;s characteristic, sweaty, culpability whilst sporting an unnaturally high, damp forehead (an on-screen effect gained, we learn, by a watering unit ingeniously devised by the special effects department).\n\nIn the interviews which accompany the film on disc, Jensen mentions how keen he was to &quot;make something better than farce&quot; out of his subject matter and, if it has a fault, it is that his film occasional teeters too far in the opposite direction, refusing some obvious opportunities to show the comedy of panic or grim humour. Instead, Dogme&apos;s metier means that Green Butchers unfolds slowly, with more natural pauses and silences, and an unforced lunacy all of its own. Such deadpan absurdity frequently pays dividends (one especially relishes Svend&apos;s quiet words to the newly returned Eigel, soft toy under his arm, that he should &quot;point the giraffe somewhere else, so that we can talk calmly again&quot;) although there have been complaints from some that a sharper edge to the bloody proceedings, other than those demonstrated by Bjarne and Svend&apos;s knives, would have been welcome. To be sure, some cannibalistic movies, such as Romero&apos;s Dawn Of The Dead bring an apt comment on consumerism. Instead Jensen&apos;s film relates slaughter back to interior matters such as Svend&apos;s compulsive, murderous need to be loved and successful - a result he eventually achieves through his marinade - or even by placing the act of butchery in a entirely different context outside of society altogether. For instance the comment by Holger, famous for his deer sausages, that &quot;It&apos;s mythological to kill an animal and then mock it by sticking it in its own intestine.&quot; Outraged by the role that nature played in provoking the death of his parents, Bjarne sees his work as specifically an act of revenge on animals, not people, a logic that places him apart from such characters as Sweeney Todd. While the eager consumers of Chicky Wickys queue up outside the shop eager for their next portion, obvious satire is played down. In interview, the cast and writer see the film&apos;s focus elsewhere, on &quot;coming to terms with one&apos;s fate,&quot; or learning to live at peace with oneself.\n\nOf course interior states are always subjective rather than objective. And if the Dogme creed values strict naturalism, then Green Butchers is a film which, although related to the movement by eschewing overt dramatics, it never the less inhabits a separate, almost fantasy world of its own - another point acknowledged on the DVD&apos;s accompanying interviews. It&apos;s a place not unaopposed to the fertile and dark imaginations of Caro and Jeunet (to whose successful Delicatessen it has sometimes been compared) if without their Gallic flamboyance, and whose odd elements gradually fit into a weird whole. Indeed the last scene of the film makes the point succinctly, drawing together the principal characters in a moment that is both playful, absurd and unifying at the same time. Given the unique nature of Green Butchers (how often does one see a Danish cannibalism movie?) as well as uniformly excellent performances, it can be recommended."

      "reviewBody": "This fictional account of Johann Strauss&apos; life is highlighted by one of the most exquisite scenes in musical history--far from real of course--in which the composer and an operatic diva are driven through the woods in horse and buggy while the countryside comes alive with the sound of music. The pastoral beauty of the scene itself combined with the intricate way &apos;Tale of the Vienna Woods&apos; is woven into the musical scene (as composer Strauss begins humming the tune along with his diva friend) is just one of the charming highlights of this MGM musical.\n\nSwirling waltzes are captured with such superb angles in the Oscar-winning camerawork, it&apos;s no wonder David O. Selznick was impressed enough to insist that his own technical staff derive inspiration from viewing the film.\n\n Soprano Miliza Korjus does some excellent trills as the operatic diva who steals Strauss from his wife (temporarily) until the obligatory happy ending. Luise Rainer suffers gracefully (in an insufferable role as the wife!!) and Fernand Gravet does well as the composer. His scenes with Miliza Korjus are what makes the film the gem that it is. She all but steals the film and was nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar and then disappeared from the American scene, returning to Europe to resume her operatic career."

After he is fired from his clerical bank job because of his preoccupation with composing, he decides to follow his passion and form an orchestra. After some famed opera singers, including Carla Donner, hear his music, they expose Schani&apos;s music to the masses, to royalty and to music publisher Julius Hofbauer. As such, Schani becomes the toast of Vienna. With his new found musical fame, Schani&apos;s life, which includes his work in the European Revolutions, changes. He becomes torn for his love for his loving and faithful wife Poldi Vogelhuber and his more emotionally passionate but somewhat destructive love for Carla Donner, who herself is involved with Count Anton Hohenfried.",

Accepted, Von Werra may be representing one of the most vile regimes in history but you desperately want him to succeed, and it&apos;s real edge of the seat stuff to see if he can pull it off.\n\nHead and shoulders above most other British war movies produced during this era, it just gets better and better every time I see it.",

I find the whole look and tone of the film like a comic book from my childhood; and it is the imagination struck from this that has me remembering scenes for days later. I know it is not a lot different from a zillion other 55 minute westerns of the 30s from poverty row, but this one has several compelling factors: A tall, young and handsome John Wayne in really groovy jeans and shirts, Noah beery Jr whose modern hair style sees him look like a young Warren Beatty, astoundingly glorious photography of mountains streams mighty waterfalls and incredible jaw-dropping horse-over-the-cliff stunts, hilarious PepeLePew French Canadian baddies, a great scene with 2 skeletons at a table; and very inventive camera angles and clear- lake water photography. THE TRAIL BEYOND is a real time travel western and the viewer can really feel the time and place. I show this surprise gem to many modern friends who are equally astonished. If there are many more of this caliber I want to see them. THE TRAIL BEYOND is worth the journey.",

      "reviewBody": "An speleologist, his wife and a friend seem to be the only survivors on earth when they regain surface after an underground exploration. I was a little disappointed by this film, since I hoped to find something similar to those old science fiction from the fifties, not so much based on special effects, but on the philosophical questions related to nuclear destruction, the end of the world, and so on. Instead I found a superficial study of the three surviving characters, not very deep in any case. We never get to know what is the cause that everybody on surface died and the only survivors are these three people who were in a cavern or alike. Anyway, it is not very long, so you won&apos;t waist a lot of your time watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most beautifully crafted and haunting films that I have ever seen. Not only is the amazing ensemble cast give truly beautiful, effective performances, but the direction and cinematography combines to create a magnificent visual and mental feast.\n\n This story about the Guadalcanal campaign during WW2, based on the James Jones novel, weaves the lives of many characters together seemlessly, creating a philosophical/emotional experience of war. It&apos;s not just about war. It&apos;s about love, faith in yourself and others, friendship, humanity, morality and also works as a startling indictment of man&apos;s conflict with nature. The amazing opening sequence, sets up a tranquility as the character Witt, finds peace on a secluded island among the natives, a peace which is shattered by the war.\n\n What follows is not a mindless battle-after-battle onslaught of pyrotechnics, smoke, dust and blood, but a thought-provoking, visually and verbally poetic analysis of war and humanity. In my opinion it is the greatest war film since Apocalypse now, which I believe bears more flaws than this. It&apos;s not an Us-and-Them war story about the glory of the USA defeating the evil Japs. It sticks close with the characters, as we hear the thoughts, their hopes, their fears, leading to a moving experience.\n\n This film was released a few months after Saving Private Ryan and unfortunately did not experience the same attention that the latter film did. Ryan was an excellent film, but to offer a comparison, The Thin Red LIne treads where Ryan didn&apos;t dare. Ryan sat in the safe territory of Good vs Evil with a bit of Futility of War and a lot of American Patriotism. It seemed to be more about America at some points than about war. The Thin Red Line is about war, the people involved and the destruction it creates for the mind, the soul and for nature. It does not deviate from this to make simple contrasts and offer easy binary oppositions.\n\n In fact, TTRL is not an easy film. Gasp, it even tries to make you think. Though the title is not really explained in the film, I believe it is implied, and could have many meanings - the line between sanity and insanity, morality and immorality, love and hate, companionship and loneliness, nature and man, war and peace. While the characters share their thoughts, deeply poetic as they are, the meaning is not thrown in your face and neither is the answer to the questions raised. In this way it is the most thought-provoking war film I&apos;ve ever seen and one of the best films of all time in my book. Top ten easily.\n\n Now to my whinge. I think TTRL was shunned unmercifully at the 1999 Oscars. Shakespeare in Love beat two brilliant films - TTRL and Elizabeth - to get that oscar, and don&apos;t get me started on Gwyneth&apos;s award. This is the best film of 1998/9, in line with Elizabeth. It&apos;s unfortunate that the two, thoug h greatly revered, did not achieve the success and attention they deserved.\n\n Don&apos;t be afraid by its length, it&apos;s a beautiful journey, full of rich colour, sound and the reward is a deeply moving human experience, unlike any other that the past decade has offered.",

This is one of those movies that came out while I was still delivering papers, and I didn&apos;t see it because I read horrible reviews for it in the paper. I decided to finally watch it, and while the reviews were way too harsh, this is not a great romantic comedy, and it falls flat largely because of Nick Cannons over-the-top and somehow, still wooden at the same time performance. This actually could have been a pretty fun movie with a different leading man. Christina Milian does a good job, and you cannot fault her. It would also help if Cannon and Milian had more onscreen time together, as it is a bit limited. They just never build a really strong connection, and I&apos;m not entirely sure why Milian would be interested in him for real. I actually think it would have been a better movie if Kenan Thompson was the lead, or hell, Kal Penn, and Cannon was one of the sidekicks, he just cannot handle this role at all. He tries, and sometimes it is fun, but it is wildly inconsistent.\n\nSteve Harvey is over-the-top cringe, I really really think someone else should have played his dad. Every scene he is in is painful to watch, his expressions, his vocal tone, everything feels grossly out of place, and he is normally pretty funny.\n\nThe movie is filled with some great hip hop and rap music from the early 2000&apos;s, and is a blast from the past, the dancing, the clothes, etc. I do love that Alvin is a hardworking intelligent entrepreneur, but again his character is OTT exaggerated by cannon, he comes across less cool than Urkel actually. He does not feel like a real person, but a bizarre caricature.\n\nIf you&apos;re a teen though, you might still enjoy it, and I did enjoy it at times, even though I am well out of my teens, but I feel as thought this could have been a really good movie, and it was, instead a missed opportunity."

      "reviewBody": "In the beginning, there is stress: How annoying the cadrage is..., how breathless the editing... Of course you notice that the camera concept is about to make sense, because our Hero Hanna is breathless and emotional quite over the edge. But glorious DP Florian Foest (watch out for &quot;Jagdhunde!&quot;) is taking it too far, in the first, maybe, forty minutes. He doesn&apos;t like too much indoor or incar light either. BUT what comes out of that is pure painting, watch it in a dark cinema, on TV you maybe will not see a thing in this brilliantly organized shadows... The beauty of this film is... well I&apos;ll tell you... But first it&apos;s important to point out that the storytelling is tending to be quite scrappy, it&apos;s like a whole cup of dramas that happen to Hanna, but it has broken to peaces and the biggest parts are adjusted in a slightly imperfect way. A lot in this film is too big, too much color on the lips of thalbach&apos;s, too much emotional rock in the score. but after all, this is a film, that seems to be... reigned by love. and like live and love, it doesn&apos;t care too much if it&apos;s getting on once nerves, sometimes too much. it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s sad, it&apos;s touching. and has great photography, at last.",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins with a young woman by the name of &quot;Deborah Carter&quot; (Dada Gallotti) riding a horse from her ranch toward a small town several miles away. Suspecting that she has $150,000 on her from the sale of her ranch, a group of bandits led by an outlaw named &quot;Montana&quot; (Rik Battaglia) intercepts her along the way. However, upon discovering that she has no money on her, they subsequently proceed to gang rape and murder her out of sheer spite. Not long afterward, her brother &quot;Jeff Carter&quot; (Richard Harrison) discovers what has happened and, after recovering a poncho left by one of the members of the gang, decides to track down every single one of them in a quest for vengeance. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that--although it followed a rather familiar plot for the typical spaghetti western of the time--the director (Tanio Boccia) wasn&apos;t quite able to establish a smooth transition from one scene to the next resulting in a rather choppy feel to the movie. Neither did he use the talents of actors like Richard Harrison or Anita Ekberg (as the saloon owner &quot;Jane&quot;) to their full potential. That being said, while I don&apos;t consider this to be a terribly bad picture, considering the issues just mentioned, I have to rate it as slightly below average.",

      "reviewBody": "Only 13 years before this movie was made, in 1973, the father of Emilio Estevez (Martin Sheen) starred in the brilliant classic &quot;Badlands&quot;, which has a similar storyline. This 1986 movie &quot;Wisdom&quot; is nowhere near as impressive as that seventies classic though, but &quot;Wisdom&quot; is definitely still worth a watch. Especially the acting is great. So if you like(d) Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore in the past, this movie is definitely worth a watch. Back to the eighties!\n\nThe story is simple. Emilio Estevez and his girlfriend Demi Moore, steal from the rich (the corrupt banks) and give to the poor (the American farmers). Will they get away with this Robin Hood kind of crime?\n\nThe good: the acting is really good. It&apos;s a lighthearted story, with a few subtle jokes and a few puppy love romantic scenes, but it&apos;s most of all a thrilling and suspenseful bank robbers movie, with lots of hold ups and chases.\n\nAny bad? It&apos;s a bit silly now and then, credibility wise. It has got that eighties sound, with the silly synthesizer music. But overall these faults are minor. This is one heck of a charming action movie. Definitely a forgotten movie, that is worth more attention. Still quite enjoyable after 30 years.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening scenes paint an idyllic picture of nature as well as the relationship it shares with people. With vegetation reflected off the surfaces of ponds, animals roaming about, and the sounds of nature in the background, the bayou feels like a slice of heaven. Even the people who occupy this land don&apos;t disrupt the environment since they appear to be one with nature. This is until we&apos;re introduced to the threat of industrialization. It starts with the boy (he&apos;s referred to as Alexander in the opening, but he&apos;s credited as &quot;The Boy&quot; in the film) being knocked into the water due to the wake of a motorboat. We then see an oil tower poking through some trees in the background. The interference of industrialization keeps spiraling until we&apos;re introduced to an oil well. With smog being released from its exhaust pipes and the sounds of its machinery being audible throughout much of the bayou, it seems out of place and sacrilegious.\n\nThe more one watches the film though, it becomes readily apparent that we&apos;re watching a glorification of the oil industry since the film refuses to properly acknowledge the problems it causes to the bayou. You&apos;re clearly asked to support the oil well, but given the glaring issues it causes (in addition to the real-world negative effects oil drilling has on the environment), this puts the film at odds with itself. Coming mainly from the perspectives of the working man and those impacted by the oil well, the potential for a great critique on industrialization is there, but we&apos;re instead left with an incongruity between the depiction and the endorsement of the industry. Flaherty was commissioned by Standard Oil to make the film though, so it&apos;s no surprise that it&apos;s propaganda.\n\nThe best parts of the film concern the boy&apos;s trials within the bayou. As idyllically shot as the bayou is, we&apos;re constantly reminded of the danger some of the wildlife poses, specifically in regards to an alligator which recurs throughout the film. Its scenes are memorable, with the standout being a middle scene where the boy attempts to catch it. That scene is tense, but Flaherty was undoubtedly a madman when shooting it. Boudreaux&apos;s and the alligator&apos;s scenes weren&apos;t recorded separately or anything. Rather, they were in fairly close proximity to each other, thus putting Boudreaux in actual danger when that scene was shot. As a result, the suspense in that sequence concerns worrying about real-life harm coming to the actor. To be clear, I don&apos;t approve of this as it&apos;s clearly child endangerment, but on a gut level, it made for a certain kind of thrill which left a visceral impact on me.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s fairly interesting and I enjoyed it in some respects, but the propagandistic elements made it feel like a missed opportunity.",

It turned out that I needed some of the Windex, the father of the bride uses for everything, to clear my eyes and enjoy the film.\n\nNia Vardalos has written from the heart this story of a crazy Greek family with all the stereotypes in it for us to savor and enjoy what has come out under the firm direction of Joel Zwick. \n\nNot only is Ms. Vardalos talented as an actress, but she can write quite a story, star in her own tale, and bring together this cast of loonies and make us believe we are inside these folks&apos; home. \n\nMichael Constantine and Lanie Kazan are the parents of the bride and they preside this crazy household in Chicago. Nia Vardalos is the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; we see at the beginning of the film and she wins John Corbett&apos;s heart and disarms him completely. He got her family in the bargain and he&apos;s stuck in it for better of for worse. Andrea Martin is very effective as the pushy aunt.\n\nAll in all, it should be seen for the fun of it. This is a funny film, very well paced and acted. \n\nPlease pass the Windex!!",

This one goes on too long but deserves to edge out the glossy English speaking movies which play to the same audience in the multiplexes.\n\nThe film is full of great players given the chance to do their stuff. Darin has the authority of a major leading man and it&apos;s a great pleasure to see already familiar veterans like Alterio and Aleandro in strong roles. Her spin on senility is a beautifully judged mix of touching and funny that the film needs to grab the broad public. Verbeke registers as an exceptionally vivid version of the sexy, winning fantasy girl that we keep on seeing in films. \n\nIf you want to argue that these characters are a distortion of real life you&apos;re in a different mind set to the makers and the fourteen dollars a seat customers they are playing to. \n\nI enjoyed seeing this recognisable world of cell &apos;phones, old friends, resolved family tensions and gourmet food put across in an unfamiliar setting with superior film know how. It&apos;s like a good overseas holiday. The old Sascha Guitry gag of the security system picture or the finding the priest at the final wedding were worth the cheer they got at the performance I saw."

It suffers only from some slow stretches; Burt perhaps tried to make it more &quot;arty&quot; than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the &quot;tough cop&quot; role he plays (notice, for example, the scene in which he attempts to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s. The film also has some offbeat touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fistfight and many well-directed shots.    (***)",

This movies deserves much higher and I can assure those who have not seen it that they will agree with me once they have seen it.\n\nAlmost all aspects of movie making are amazingly rendered. It will easily compare with any movie about war and politics. The savagery, otherwise recorded only in books, is depicted marvelously. I want to praise a couple of actors but it would not be correct to leave anyone out so I am just saying that they were all tailor made for their roles. There is some real reel footage in the movie and that drives home the points raised in this movie.\n\nOn a tangent  it is interesting that the so called civilized countries continuously plumbed new depths of uncivilized actions only for land and riches. It is an amazing display of imperialistic debauchery.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this last month at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The premise of this film was done before back in 1968 in the film Candy. You take a lovely nymph-like girl with a lot of hair and a beautiful body and build a series of disjointed, ridiculous sketch-like stories around her with the help of a big name actor or two and pretend it&apos;s a comedy. This film does the same except it pretends to be a drama. The films title character Ana (Manuela Vellés) is a gifted young artist living with her father Klaus (Matthias Habich) in a cave near Ibiza, Spain. Yes, they live in a cave but it&apos;s quite nice and richly appointed for a cave dwelling. Newcomer Vellés almost didn&apos;t have the role as it was originally attached to actress María Valverde who wisely bowed out and you can only imagine if it was her refusal to do a certain scene in this film. One day a wealthy art patron from France named Justine (veteran international talent Charlotte Rampling) discovers the artistic potential in Ana and wants to cultivate her talent by setting her up in her exclusive art colony she runs in Madrid. Ana meets Linda (Bebe Rebulleto) who becomes her best friend and Said (Nicolas Cazalé) who becomes her boyfriend. Ana discovers the doors to past lives through regressive hypnotism by an young American hypnotist named Michael (Asier Newman). The movie has you hooked for a while and you wonder where it&apos;s going to go but once she heads for New York it rapidly falls apart as a film trying to hard to be an art film with a political and social message. The film looks great with art direction by Montse Sanz and cinematography by Mario Montero and direction from the talented and celebrated, international film festival award winning Julio Medem. The film is dedicated to Medem&apos;s sister Ana Medem whose actual artwork are featured through the film. Her Picassoesque style painting were to be shown at an exhibit in Valencia when on her way there she was tragically killed in a car accident. I hate to be critical of a film dedicated to someone who represents such a personal loss to it&apos;s director but the story written by director Medem is so bad that I can&apos;t help it. Watching this film you realize that this guy knows how to make a film but you wonder why he didn&apos;t make one this time. It features some nudity and some prolonged unnecessary violence and I would give this a 5.5 out of 10 and not recommend it to a general audience.",

      "name": "A cult classic best martial arts Van Damme Style movie!",
      "reviewBody": "Bloodsport (1988) is my favorite action Van Damme movie. It was the first movie I ever saw about Van Damme that introduced me in to his movies. This is the film I grew up with it, I have first see it, when I was 8 years old! I love this movie to death! In my opinion is Van Damme&apos;s best martial arts film! Beside Hard Target, Bloodsport is one of his best movies till date. I Love it so much. Best martial arts movie, is never boring, is fast and entertaining and It is awesome seriously. And I still love it today, Bloodsport also introduced me in to martial arts. Jean Claude Van Damme&apos;s Bloodsport is still today it&apos;s best. After this movie there were a few copycat movies that copy the idea from this movie. Like were Bloodfight (1989) with Bolo Yeung returning, with the same name, but playing different character from the Bloodsport and Bloodfist (1989) with World Kickboxing champion Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; Wilson. I also love the music from this movie lately it helps me a lot the song &quot;On My Own - Alone&quot;, I also love the song &quot;Fight to Survive&quot;.\n\nThis is my favorite tournament fighting film too. This film also inspired the video game Mortal Kombat and for that? This film is twice as awesome to me. This is a film where you see JCVD at his peak and this is my second favorite JCVD flick after Hard Target and Universal Soldier. It holds up really well to this day and it&apos;s a shame the film does not have a special edition on DVD and Blu Ray. The film does have a big cult following so it not getting any features to this day is lame. Great concept, great cast, charismatic characters, bad ass fights, and a kick ass soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best martial arts flicks ever made without a doubt for me. Fell in love with the film ever since I saw it on VHS when I was a kid.\n\nAs for the Bloodsport sequels? For the most part? They all suck. They can&apos;t even hold a candle to this film. Bloodsport is a classic and a fight that is worth watching anytime, anywhere. I still own this movie on VHS and on Blu-ray. I don&apos;t have the DVD I don&apos;t need it. I am going to say it again I love this movie to death, it is my childhood JCVD film and I grew up with it. I have always enjoy it. It has a real bloody bad-ass fights. Van Damme and Yeung kicks fighters to the ground. Original this movie was almost never released, but Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be released, this movie is praised and loved all over the World including Asia, USA and East Europe. The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this film. When Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast, Dux announced that Van Damme wasn&apos;t nearly in good enough shape, and put him through a 3-month training program. Van Damme called those three months &quot;the hardest training of his life&quot; - this despite being a world-championship martial artist in his own right.\n\nIt does feel good to go re-watch films like this especially dealing with the very sad fact that films like this classic aren&apos;t made anymore and seeing Van Damme these days on film, he just seems to stone faced or depressed. I have enjoyed training sequences, flashback sequences on Frank Dux&apos;s earlier childhood life and a life of a young man. The chase sequences where Helmer and Rawlis are chasing Dux was hilarious and very entertaining. Chong Li, in my opinion, is one of the best non horror villains out there. My personal favorite JCVD villain and my favorite martial arts villain. Also, though it isn&apos;t the same character; almost like a bizarro world version, another Chong Li appears in a movie called Bloodfight (Bloodsport knockoff) played by Bolo Yeung. Van Damme maybe had some problems in his later years, but I always admired him for everything he did to make this movie well known back in &apos;88, from re-editing the original cut to promoting the movie by putting posters of it himself in cinemas. This movie for me is a perfect 10, I don&apos;t care what anyone says.",

      "reviewBody": "Someone likely had a good idea in planning this film: place a straight man in a prison cell area reserved for homosexuals and all variations of gender role playing. That concept could prove interesting as an exploration of &apos;community&apos; among the &apos;unwanted&apos; of detainees. But as written by Jared Kurt and Jules Stewart and especially as directed by Jules Stewart the film loses all semblance of originality, for one reason - because it casts women in the roles of transsexuals and transvestites so as not to offend the actors or the audience with same sex variations.\n\nBut that is only one reason this film sinks. The script is tepid to poor, a story is practically nonexistent, and the characters are tropes played by actors who seem embarrassed by what they are asked to do. What little story there is can be summarized as follows: a wealthy but drug addicted and alcoholic record produced named Raymond Saxx (Goran Visnjic, one of our stronger actors usually) passes out, is arrested for homicide, and thrown into LA County Jail in a unit reserved for Homosexuals and sexual deviants K-11. From there it is a power struggle run by transvestite Mousey (the first female - Kate del Castillo - cast as a male and it doesn&apos;t work). Cocaine and other drugs are readily available through the corruption of Ben (Jason Mewes) who works in the office of the deputy Sgt. Johnson (DB Sweeney) who is likewise drug addled and preys on the inmates for sexual favors. Bad things happen, such as the murder of child molester Detroit (Tommy &apos;Tiny&apos; Lister) by transsexual Butterfly (Portia Doubleday) and Raymond finally comes out of his cloudy drug abused head and figures a way out of this very odd confinement, but not without a series of meaningless circumstances that serve only to point out the depravity of the inmates.\n\nYes, it is that bad. Try as you may to find a saving grace to this film is without success. Perhaps if the writers and director had had the courage to use an all male cast instead of putting female actors in the roles of men who are range from simply nelly to butch to surgically transformed (in various stages) into transsexuals the film may have had a reason for being made. As it is, it is an embarrassment for Goran Visnjic, and DB Sweeney and the rest of the actors who for some reason signed on to this poorly conceived and made project. \n\nGrady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is one of the best films of all time. It has all the elements of a great movie. From the opening shot to the final I was absolutely riveted to this compelling, truthful, beautiful, and humorous look into the lives of a Taiwanese family. Ang Lee, known quite famously now for &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Hulk&quot; has done a masterful job of directing and storytelling. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. The movie as mentioned focuses on on Widower, Master Chef Chu, who is having a hard time relating to his three independent daughters. He attempts to communicate his love for them by creating these incredible gourmet dinners. The daughters are very defined, each with a different personality. The eldest, is a Christian, which is the first time in a movie I have ever seen, where a Christian is portrayed in a favorable light. She is struggling with being an old maid and the fear of leaving her Father uncared for if she does get married. The second daughter is wild and rebellious. She is portrayed extremely well by the ultra sexy Chien Lien Wu. This woman is absolutely stunning!!! She is torn between three things, her career, her desire to be independent, and her liason&apos;s with two men, one who is married. The third daughter is portrayed sweetly and innocent who ends up stealing her best friends boyfriend away. There are many plot twists and turns, but in the end, the movie finishes in a beautiful and happy way. I have now watched this movie twenty times and I think it is a great contribution to the film world. I wish more people knew about it here in the States. This movie can move you to being a better person. On a side note, I highly recommend you order some Chinese food, because you will be starving for it before the movie is over.",

The color 3-D photography is excellent and the crew only pulls off the typical stick-it-in-the-camera 3-D hijinks a few times. The opening sequence of Raymond Burr walking through the carnival is some of the most effective 3-D photography I have ever seen.\n\nThe story...yipes! It&apos;s campy and weird in an Ed Wood sort of way but it seems that the entire cast and crew were in on the joke. Lee Marvin and Lee J. Cobb both time their performances in a very strange but funny way. Anne Bancroft vamps up a storm in some scenes and Raymond Burr plods thru his role. The gorilla suit is funny too. Good movie? No! Fun? Yes!\n\nThe second half drags at points and the 3-D photography loses a little steam here. I wouldn&apos;t want to sit through this movie in 2-D at this point. \n\nWho knows if this is ever going to be projected again, but if it is and you enjoy 50&apos;s kitsch make it a priority. The screening I was at, during the intermission, projected 1950&apos;s era 3-D nudie slides by...HAROLD LLOYD, the silent film comedian! Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think that will ever happen again.",

So part 3 concludes their journey. And is as dramatic as they get. The inciting incident does not seem that big ... but turns out it is .. life an death and all that.\n\nHaving said that, the movie is still overall not riddled with heavy drama, even with that hanging over their heads, there is time for jealousy and other issues one might have growing up. We get our villains back from the first one, but this time around ... well we sort of hope they have grown up too ... not just physically but metaphorically speaking ... I reckon there is not too much mystery or things you&apos;ll be surprised will happen in the journey of the movie. Still a neat little movie that is mainly aimed at younger people.",

      "reviewBody": "Sandrine, a parisien girl, fed up with her unfulfilling existence as a computer trainer and the everyday problems of city life decides to leave the Paris to become a peasant farmer.\n\nSandrine buys a farm high on the Vercors plateau in South-East France from Adrien, an old peasant suspicious of Sandrine&apos;s college ideas.  It&apos;s spring and Sandrine makes a good start, developing other aspects of the farm, a rural Gite welcomes travellers and school parties and a Web sites advertises goat&apos;s cheese.\n\nAlthough the locals are suspicious they are perhaps more accepting of a young, dynamic outsider free of the petty local rivalries that set family against family in these close knit rural communities.  This is no Jean de Florette and is illustrated when Adrien defends the changes Sandrine has made to his mates in the village bar.\n\nHowever the rural idyll is not all that it might seem to city folk.  The audience is confronted with graphic scenes of a pig having its throat cut to make Boudin (black pudding) and later of mad cows being killed with a bolt gun.  Winter comes and the sense of despair and isolation felt by many small farmers is complete when we see Sandrine in long shot, alone in the barn after one of her goats has stillborn kids.\n\nThe film explores the conflicts between conformable but ultimately pointless city life - going nowhere in the Paris traffic and the savage beauty of life on the isolated Vercors plateau.  Even the peasants shop at the local hypermarket in Grenoble.\n\nAdrien&apos;s initial scepticism gives way to a hope that Sandrine will carry on his farm but he has difficulty with the rapprochement, perhaps caused by events in his own life.  The Nazis burned his farm in &apos;44 looking for maquisards and later Government men arrive to kill and burn his cattle infected with mad cow disease.  Are the government men worse than the Germans? For Adrien maybe, as these events lead to the death of his wife.\n\nLike the Vercors, Sandrine seems both beautiful but uncompromising but  we see constant flashes of the temperament that, like the weather vane in front of her house, cause her to make sudden changes affecting those around her. She is really quite vulnerable needing the occasional love of her city boyfriend and the friendship of Adrien.  Maybe it is this qualities that will lead to her eventual success?\n\nA final comment, like many movies these days there is quite a bit of product placement - Volvo cars, Lowe mountain gear, Carrefour but the countryside is wonderfully shot."

I was enchanted by it ; the music is fantastic and the physique and voice of Sophia Loren (especially in pyjamas) is just.........so loveable gorrrrrrgeous and erotic ! Marlon Brando seems a little out of it all at times was perhaps not the right actor for the Role ; Margaret Rutherford in the personage of &quot; Mrs Gaulswallow &quot; ( just where to God&apos;s name did they think up a name like that ?? ) had me in total fits of laughter during her short appearance. The film is strange as it is in modern colour with good picture quality but the sound and dialogues as well as being poor acoustically are reminiscent of the 40s or 50s but obviously in keeping with Chaplin&apos;s style. I have always liked most of Chaplin&apos;s (talking) films but it is the quality of his musical scores that really get me. The score from Limelight and &quot;This is My Song&quot; which comes from A Countess in N.Y. are absolute masterpieces of Romanticism. Lovely !!!"

      "reviewBody": "OK this is going to be a bit long... but it will be good food for discussions.\n\nYes, this movie is &quot;Hollywood&quot;. The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn&apos;t just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.\n\nI think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven&apos;t seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn&apos;t want to be a poster child for women&apos;s rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she&apos;s gonna have to wear that hat anyway.\n\nViggo is great too. I don&apos;t think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn&apos;t about women&apos;s rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O&apos;Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven&apos;t had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.\n\nI don&apos;t know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who&apos;s been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it&apos;s a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I&apos;ll give that one to Ridley, he&apos;s trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men&apos;s emotions.\n\nAs for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he&apos;s got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.\n\nQuite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don&apos;t think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that&apos;s about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?\n\nOne last comment. I was at the Army Officer&apos;s Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer&apos;s that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A&apos;s. The next day they weren&apos;t laughing... they just said &quot;you know what, that wasn&apos;t half bad.&quot; That don&apos;t sound like much, but it&apos;s high praise from that group.\n\nProbably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn&apos;t Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.\n\nEnjoy the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Without a doubt, Saw has become an absolute phenomenon. I find it quite impressive how a small $1 million horror film garnered strong word of mouth and made it big, spawning a franchise which has become Lionsgate Films&apos; yearly bread and butter. I&apos;ve really enjoyed the Saw films and have been there since the beginning, viewing the first film on opening day in the UK. It was refreshing to see something original and to my surprise, the sequel, Saw II was just as good. However, the third instalment (still good) showed signs of clutching at straws.\n\nSWAT Commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent) has become obsessed with finding Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), particularly since his fellow officers have died via his sadistic games. However, Jigsaw finds Rigg and has him play his own game. With two of his colleagues, Officer Matthews and Hoffman (Donnie Wahlberg, Costas Mandylor) held captive in one of Jigsaw&apos;s traps, Rigg has 90 minutes to try and find them. Meanwhile FBI Agents Strahm and Perez (Scott Patterson, Athena Karkanis) question Jigsaw&apos;s ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell) in an effort to uncover Jigsaw&apos;s mysterious accomplice. \n\nSaw IV is a sequel that is struggling to stay consistent with the numerous plot strands and filling up of plot holes. It almost feels like an extreme connect the dots puzzle as one tries to piece together all the characters and incidents from the previous instalments. Even when watching it, I could already imagine Internet forums swarming with hundreds of questions.\n\nWhat made the first film so unique was that the victims are often people who essentially deserved to be punished, be they drug dealers or con artists frantically trying to save themselves from the macabre situation they were in. With Jigsaw as judge, jury and executioner, do we as an audience side with his objective, or do we sympathise with the wrongdoing victim during their last few seconds before they die a fantastic death? As the sequels have progressed, saving oneself appears to have been completely abandoned, for in the third instalment as well as this one, some victims simply have to wait to depend upon someone to help them. Also some supposedly innocent (?) people are dragged in (the guy with his eyes sewn shut is involved in the film&apos;s best trap, but who the hell was he?), while some injured victims are merely swept aside and we never know if they live or die.\n\nIn an effort to try and make a bigger sequel, games are no longer in one confined space, but set in different locations across the city, pushing &apos;suspension of disbelief&apos; to the limit. For example, Rigg&apos;s apartment is turned upside-down within a matter of minutes, with blood on the walls, pictures hanging from the ceiling and how someone managed to get a scalping chair up there without anyone noticing is beyond me! Some may like the distancing from the previous movies, but for me this is a slight shift towards conventional slasher movies. \n\nActing wise, it&apos;s rather mediocre. Apart from Tobin Bell, quite a bankable name now because of the Saw franchise, a number of small stars litter the film and help keep the costs down. For me, the only other name that stands out is Donnie Wahlberg, and even he is somewhat wasted. \n\nAs expected, it&apos;s reliant on flashbacks, some of which made me feel like I was watching a soap opera rather than a horror. However director Darren Lynn Bousman does fulfil on account of gore, pushing Saw IV with &apos;in-your-face&apos; violence and close ups that probably wouldn&apos;t have passed through the BBFC with an uncut 18 certificate five years ago. \n\nIf you&apos;ve been following the franchise then you can&apos;t help but be roped along for the ride. I certainly was. For something that was written, shot, edited and practically gift-wrapped all inside one year, it still works. It&apos;s just a shame that what was once so original three years ago now feels stale with hardly anything new to offer. Hell, there aren&apos;t even any jumpy moments! Given the rush-job nature at dishing out sequels, maybe they&apos;ll have more fun at turning it into some kind of weekly/monthly TV series.\n\nI really do hope that this is the last one, because really now, enough is enough. But as Jigsaw says, &quot;the games have just begun.&quot; \n\nRating  five out of ten.",

The acting may have been a little cheezy, but it wasn&apos;t all that great in Moulin Rouge! either. People need to understand that this is a MUSICAL and musicals aren&apos;t necessarily known for their great acting performances. They are noted for their brilliant choreography, songs, and stage settings, which I felt both &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot; contained. Moreover, the story in &quot;Xanadu&quot; wasn&apos;t all that incoherent and reminded me a lot of &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; when Kevin Costner is inspired by a voice from an invisible muse to build a baseball field. So, while some of the criticism of this film is justified, I feel much of it is not and it took way more of a beating than it should have. One has to remember that there have been many films made which were raked over the coals by critics, yet the films became enjoyed by many later on."

This film is hardly the Old Testament (one assumes in its entirety), but just a tiny segment. I could talk about the lousy cinematography, the editing, where the shots shift from day to night as each character is speaking, or the odd strained dialog and dubbing, but why bother? I&apos;d never heard of this stinker before, and now I know why. Although it might have some biblical significance, I would have to say avoid this one at all costs. Stick to the &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;. Trust me."

The productions of the travelling group of thespians are the funniest things I have ever seen.\n\nForget the plot about the young unwed mother with two suitors and just watch the hilarious performances of the rag-tag travelling gypsy players who tour Ireland performing in a threadbare tent, led by the flamboyant actor manager played with gusto by Milo O&apos;Shea. For those of you who are not familiar with this great Irish stage actor, Mr. O&apos;Shea played Sam Malone&apos;s Irish Uncle in the Woody&apos;s Wedding two-part episode of Cheers, on TV.\n\n The troupe of players are not above changing the script to accommodate whatever actors or costumes are available, and they open up with a song and dance act, no matter what the play. Lines are read from cue cards, and even made up as they go along.  Even Othello begins with a can can.  You will never be able to watch Gone with the Wind with a straight face again after you have seen it performed as a musical in a tent in a small Irish town. I have not laughed as much since I saw the theatrical troupe in a Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream.\n\nThe lead actors, Robin Wright and Aidan Quinn make an attractive couple, and Albert Finney does well as the heavy, but it is the players who make this movie such a joy."

Right from the beginning, we already see how abusive the cheating husband is. Slim, the determined wife, fights back. She appears helpless at first, creating much sympathy for her. She lives in threat and danger every day. There is much suspense and thrill throughout the film. As the film progress, we see the satisfying finale. I hope all spouses who are battered can stand up against the terror like Slim does."

Krista (Sylvia Kristel) is a whorehouse madam who beds them both turn by turn.\n\nAllegedly, this trio are based on real-life characters. One can&apos;t help wondering if director Francis Girod and co-writer Jacques Rouffio saw their cheerful amorality as a metaphor for the moral disintegration of society during wartime. If that is their aim, the film is a wretched failure. Its attempts at black comedy are too crude and obvious to convince. (Are we meant to whoop with delight when Piccoli eats his boss&apos;s pet frog?) It is frankly sick-making to see the Nazi persecution of Jews and homosexuals used as a set-up for cheap and unfunny jokes.\n\nTo make this movie still worse, both of the &apos;great&apos; French actors (Depardieu and Piccoli) ham up their roles atrociously. Dolled up in her white tuxedo, la Kristel looks very fetching indeed - but she has precious little to do apart from that. Oh well! At least she does not embarrass herself by overacting.\n\nDavid Melville"

      "reviewBody": "Blackthorn is an estimable contribution to Western movies. Contrary to the American style, here the epic it&apos;s illustrated in a less gimmicky way. There&apos;s not apotheosis at the endings of the sequences with a high emotional music theme. Poetry it&apos;s in the words, the silences, the landscapes and the development of the characters. Apparently it&apos;s a traditional story about compensation with the past, but there&apos;s much more. An a-la-Hawks representation of male friendship, a social message, a nostalgic review of classic Western and two little twists in the story that avoid a possible predictable ending. Very interesting it&apos;s the Mateo Gil&apos;s choice, in opposition to the Roy Hill movie, to show Bolivia as a wide open country. While Roy Hill, in the 1969 movie, shoot the South American scenes in a cloistered vision -to give them a claustrophobic value that works as allegory of the characters mood- in contrast with the North American scenes, Gil hasn&apos;t renegade to shoot the desert, the wide plains and even the canyons from Bolivia brought out by the brilliant cinematography of Ruíz Anchía. Perhaps there&apos;re a couple of moments that the narrative pace goes down in contemplative scenes, but overall the rhythm and the story will keep your attention. Great works of Sam Shephard, Eduardo Noriega, Stephen Rea and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. You would like Blackthorn if you like Unforgiven, Appaloosa, Open Range or, of course, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but not if your taste it&apos;s nearest to The Quick and the Dead, Young Guns I or II, or Cowboys &amp; Aliens.",

Rather than the worst. \n\nSure, it&apos;s corny and it&apos;s histrionics can seem overly familiar, but it still packs a punch. This is due to the fact that it&apos;s played completely straight. Well, relatively straight in the case of the Borgnine/ Stevens double-act. And it achieves real dramatic resonance from it&apos;s allegorical plot line. It pretty much created the template for the &apos;disaster&apos; film.\n\nFavourite bits:\n\nRed Buttons&apos; funky little walk up on deck.\n\nThe way Pamela Sue Martin and her date boogie down when they hit the dance floor.\n\nPamela Sue Martin&apos;s legs. Ditto Carol Lynley.\n\nLynley&apos;s hippy brother.\n\nRoddy McDowall&apos;s accent and dialogue (consisting mostly of &quot;yes, sir&quot; and &quot;I think so, sir&quot;).\n\nErnest Borgnine learning that kids can be useful as well as merely irritating.\n\nHackman&apos;s &quot;Please, God - not THIS woman&quot; schtick and death scene.\n\nAll of Stella Stevens&apos; wardrobe."

But if you think over a plot of this film you understand that the main idea is not to show a beautiful love but to tell us about the world of teenagers who have absolutely different lives.\n\nBabi is a good girl from a respected family. Hache is a bad boy, who loves freedom, burn-up and everything fringe. But just a small meeting changed their lives cardinally. They fell in love, did crazy things, resolved themselves and everything would be fine, but they are so different that despite their feelings, they cannot be together.\n\nAt first sight it sounds like a banal film about a tragic love, but it is necessary to watch it to understand that it is not so.\n\nThrough the film my mood changed a lot of times. After it my head was full of thoughts. In my opinion, &quot;Tres Metros Sobre el Cielo&quot; is a film that should be watched not only one time.",

      "reviewBody": "Watkins&apos; Gladiators a.k.a. Gladiatorena a.k.a. The Peace Game (1969) is a very interesting film that features a unique concept.The movie takes place in a alternate reality where warfare has been abolished. Countries that want to settle their disputes handle them inside a high tech arena. Each country sends in a crack squad of highly trained commandos. While inside, they play a game that&apos;s similar to &quot;capture the flag&quot;. The supercomputer controlled arena is operated by technicians from neutral countries. The computer randomly puts up obstacles in the way of the commandos (adding a bit of intrigue to the game). The generals from the opposing forces (along with their allies) play a game of chess with their commandos, watching the proceedings from the safety of a control room (TV screens and computer monitors follow the action). Around the world, the game is televised (except in Russia, China and The United States). The TV programmers even have a say in the action (they have to satisfy the TV viewers).\n\nOnce again, Watkins uses his faux documentary style to capture it all on film. This movie&apos;s truly ahead of it&apos;s time. A concept like this one would make a great reality T.V. show. Unfortunately, like most of Peter Watkins work it&apos;s a hard movie to find. But if you ever get a chance to watch it, I recommend that you do. \n\nHighly recommended.",

However, I&apos;ll tell you people who haven&apos;t seen it the same thing I told my sister when I brought the movie down for a get together. She asked me why I liked it and I told her. You simply cannot watch clambake without having a lot of fun! You may like it for its inherent MST3K value, or you might like it because of the Kings&apos; great singing. Whatever the reason, you will love this movie! Don&apos;t believe any of the bad reviews, because, in my opinion, if you&apos;re watching any Elvis movie you know darn well what to expect. Maybe they don&apos;t have great stories and high production values, but they all have one thing in common..... They don&apos;t take themselves seriously. So stop judging these movies by a serious standard. I guess before I finish I should go ahead and say that this is one of my favorite Elvis movies, right up there with Viva Las Vegas. However I like Shelley a lot more than Ann-Margaret.   Thanks Elvis!",

But this movie is not slow, because that would require some movement. It is just standing still most of the time, which is a shame because it could have been so good! \n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, there are some great aspects to the film, visually it&apos;s a stunner! The cinematography is really really good, there are so many beautiful shots and scenes. But when it comes to plot and narrative something is deeply wrong. I think you could have cut out at least an hour without disturbing the plot at all. It is too long! And just because you have nice nature shots with a voice-over that says something like &quot;mother, you are everywhere&quot; once every minute doesn&apos;t make it deep. It just make the film boring. Also I would have preferred less focus on the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith (which consists of them staring at each other with &quot;deep&quot; voice overs), and instead have more focus on the relationship between the settlers and natives. \n\nHowever, I think that the part with Christian Bale is a lot better and far more interesting. Sadly most viewers won&apos;t see it because they are probably sleeping by then. I think they could have shown more of Pocahontas in London, the clash of cultures is an interesting subject. \n\nLastly, I saw the extended cut, avoid it like plague. It doesn&apos;t add anything interesting, it just make the film even longer.",

      "reviewBody": "Believe me, any of those French critics who can see this odious mess and STILL consider Jerry Lewis a genius ought to be drowned in their own vichysoisse! Jerry is at his most self-indulgent on this project, and isn&apos;t helped by a lot of leering jokes that even a horny twelve-year-old would consider in bad taste. The all-but-incomprehensible plot and sluggish acting don&apos;t help, either. Only bright spot about this film is the underrated, under-used Dick Shawn as Jerry&apos;s Russian counterpart.\n\nAt least a good director experienced in handling Jerry, like Frank Tashlin or Norman Taurog, could have possibly made something out of this, but Gordon Douglas was always a director (?) whose main virtue was that he could bring in films on-time and at or under budget. Douglas&apos; films were successful because of either their stars or stories (&quot;Robin and the Seven Hoods,&quot; the Carroll Baker &quot;Harlow&quot;), but he himself was a director of workmanlike competence and no more. It&apos;s a reputation he upholds here, with his indulgent direction and sluggish pacing.\n\nAll of which proves, once again, that Jerry Lewis&apos; last really good film on his own was &quot;The Nutty Professor.&quot; After that, he started believing his press clippings, especially his foreign ones, and, after a while, he wasn&apos;t as much funny as downright pathetic. And &quot;Way... Way Out&quot; is a textbook example of this."

      "reviewBody": "Shareef Badmaash starts with the development of the a new design of a sophisticated super aircraft by two Indian scientists after putting in their hard work for a decade. For the sake of the security of their new invention which is a confidential information, they destroy their research papers after preserving the complete blueprint in a microfilm. As this news gets spread in the underworld, many baddies become aspirants to get it which is worth crores of rupees if sold to the foreign powers.\n\nThe microfilm containing the design of the aircraft reaches an outlaw who is apparently a highly respected person in the society - Deewaan (Jeevan) when he gets these two scientists killed by his henchman (Mac Mohan) and usurps the microfilm. He keeps it in his safe containing a number-lock but his safe gets burgled by his confidant Ajit (Sudhir) only the same night who loots it for the sake of the precious jewellery worth lakhs of rupees kept in the safe but takes away the microfilm also alongwith them which Deewaan has very cleverly hid in a briefcase. Upon Deewaan&apos;s complaint to the police (quite understandably his complaint covers the theft of the jewellery only without any mention of the microfilm), Ajit is arrested by the police and then sent to jail but the stolen stuff is not found with him.\n\nNow Deewaan and many other criminals who are in quest of the microfilm (and also the jewellery), want to get Ajit released from jail and then hog the stolen stuff from him. For this purpose, they need a daredevil person capable of doing it. The name of a seasoned criminal Rockey comes to the fore in this regard. In the eyes of the law, Rockey is dead but the underworld players come to know that he is alive and now lives by wearing a different identity of Sust-Raam (Dev Anand). Now all the criminals try to lure him to get this job done by him for their sake. After initial reluctance, our hero Sust-Raam whose real name is Ramesh, decides to do it for Deewaan only whose offer is the biggest one.\n\nTo get Ajit released from jail, he ascertains all the relevant information the most important piece of which is that a cabaret dancer Seema (Hema Malini) is the girlfriend of the jailer. Now starts the interaction of the hero with Seema, the heroine of this movie. The narrative meanders through romance, songs, comedy, twists in the tale and surprises for the characters as well as for the audience till the climax arrives and finally the nation&apos;s asset, i.e., the microfilm reaches its correct destination.\n\nShareef Badmaash is a formulaic movie, a typical potboiler of the seventies. However as asserted it is an entertaining movie, keeping the viewer engaged from the beginning to the climax. We know that our hero cannot be a criminal. He appears to be a ruffian (Badmaash) but actually being a Hindi movie hero (in that era), he is bound to be a straight and law abiding citizen (Shareef) only. Hence the truth of Rockey&apos;s identity must be hidden only to be known in the climax. The heroine&apos;s character is also mysterious for a major part of the movie. Well, to enjoy the Bollywood movies of the seventies, we have to watch them with a proper mindset and we should not contrast them with the contemporary cinema. Despite predictability of the final outcome, the curiosity of how the things take shape and turn out with the progress of the movie, keeps the viewer glued to the screen. Seasoned director Raj Khosla has kept the script completely under his control and now allowed it to go out of hand anywhere.\n\nDev Anand and Hema Malini always made a lovely pair despite the age difference between the two (of about quarter of a century). Mannerismic Dev and dream girl Hema always shared good on-screen chemistry between them and hence were always able to successfully pull together despite the routine scripts written for them. Shareef Badmaash is no exception. Dev Anand has delivered a stylish performance in the lead role despite his advancing years (he&apos;s in his fifties). Hema is extremely charming. All others including the ever gorgeous Helen, all are fit in their respective roles. The best among the baddies is undoubtedly Ajit, the stylish villain of the seventies. Shatrughan Sinha is also there in a cameo.\n\nTechnically, this movie is okay with the length also being not much though lengthier movies used to be made in that period. The story flows well without any boredom anywhere. R.D. Burman&apos;s music with songs in the voices of Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and Kishore Kumar is good. Asha-Kishore duet Neend Churaake Raaton Mein is the best song in my opinion.\n\nSumming up, Shareef Badmaash is a nice timepass from the Bollywood of the seventies. Watch it to get an entertainment of two hours and odd minutes and meet Indian Gregory Peck Dev Anand who is a gentleman (Shareef) and a ruffian (Badmaash) both at the same time.",

More of a warning: You&apos;re going to have to love the concept, I think, to sit through this production.\n\nI suggest to the authors that they load up a web-server with it, treat it as a storyboard for a real production, and see if anyone bites on it.\n\nIt&apos;s just not ready for putting people in the seats to experience it, and this is from one who loved J.

Once again, for a fan I think this film still has enough laughs be be mildly entertaining but there&apos;s no doubt this is where the series started to slip away. While there aren&apos;t as many laughs here as the previous two films the thing manages to stay alive due to the nice characters created by the cast. Guttenberg, Smith, Graf, Winslow and Leslie Easterbrook are back with Bob Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinsky returning from the second film. The movie tries to have a plot with the academy threatened to be shut down but of course this just sets up all the attempted laughs. The best moments of the movie happen as we get a semi-remake of the original film as we see the new recruits going through their training. This film only runs 83-minutes, which certainly wasn&apos;t the normal thing in 1986 so that should tell you that the screenplay doesn&apos;t go for too much."

      "name": "Nixon: Probably the Most Interesting Political Figure of the 20th Century.",
      "reviewBody": "Richard Nixon&apos;s (Oscar-nominee Anthony Hopkins) life is told from his early childhood days in 1920s California to his disgraceful resignation in 1974 from the Watergate scandal (one of the stupidest and most trivial events of U.S. history). The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon (a superb turn by Oscar-nominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role) alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with big-time oil men in Texas (Larry Hagman leading the group) and even with J. Edgar Hoover (scene-stealer Bob Hoskins). It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from high-ranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated, the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon, but Nixon (full of self-doubt and inferiority complexes) is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 (Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency). More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California, leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam, a whole host of questionable allies (led by James Woods, E.G. Marshall, J.T. Walsh, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Fyvush Finkel) and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger (an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino, who rivals Hopkins&apos; performance the whole way) end up turning Nixon&apos;s life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and public/national/international/military/social chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president&apos;s personal life is shown through flashbacks (Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film). We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis, his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate break-in (led by Ed Harris) continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened (the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear). 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone (who received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script) surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; and &quot;JFK&quot; would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with &quot;Nixon&quot;. However he gives Nixon&apos;s story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations (some that seem very logical and some not so much). Thus the film goes on and on (running about 195 minutes). Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interest-generator. Whether you like, dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person, &quot;Nixon&quot; the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone&apos;s better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more under-rated and under-appreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Yep, it is another one of those Iraq and Afghanistan documentaries. I know the burnout rate is high on these, which is probably why I almost did not bother, but nothing else was showing. Man, was I happy I saw this! It has rekindled my hate for the Bush administration, which had turned to apathy over the last year. This tells the story of an Afghani taxi driver that is mistakenly picked up as a Taliban supporter, but before they find out he was innocent, he has been beaten to death by his American torturers.\n\nThis film has interviews from all of the guards that were responsible, JAG officers, FBI people, CIA agents on the ground etc. And you see that all of the blame lies with Ashcroft and the Bushies, who gave one vague order after another that they wanted confessions and they wanted them quickly, with a wink and a nod about what kind of methods to use. So you have these frustrated high school drop-outs presiding over these people thousands of miles from anywhere, and they won&apos;t confess. So, beatings and humiliations follow. And when the crap comes out, the Bush administration passes a bill that absolves all higher-ups from any responsibility and they start to bust the enlisted men and women, who were following orders. Pathetic. Of course, we also find out that over 95% of the prisoners being held, were captured by Pakistanis and Northern Alliance people, WHO were paid by the US government for each person they turned over, guilty or not guilty. And you wonder why meaningful confessions were so hard to come by. It reminds me of the scene from Full Metal Jacket, where the psycho army guy shoots the Vietnamese farmers from his helicopter. He says the ones that run are VC, the ones that don&apos;t run are well trained VC. Very tragic.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the third comment written on this movie, the first was very positive, the second very negative. The negative one wrote that the positive was written by a member of the CH7 staff. My comment will be rather positive and I have nothing to do with the production of the movie.\n\nI&apos;ve read an article on a newspaper about CH7, it was free to download so I gave it a try. I liked it and today after seeing it for the third time I still had fun.\n\nOf course CH7 has a lot of technical problems, the footage goes from acceptable to very poor (there are for example night scenes that are clearly shot on daylight and then retouched). The color in general is sometimes bright and of good quality but other times it seems very washed out and shot with low res cams.\n\nI liked the cut of the movie, it&apos;s a bit weird sometimes but this is OK for the story that is presented. The music is also very poor, but not disturbing. There is only a Mission Impossible similar tune that is maybe used too many times.\n\nSpeech sound is a bit worse, in some scenes it&apos;s difficult to understand some lines because they are to low, and there are speeches where the question is with a good volume but the answer is impossible to hear.\n\nThe acting is sometimes very amateur, but the main part of the time it&apos;s acceptable and its supports the story.\n\nAnd now to the important part, which makes this movie interesting: the story. The plot is very linear with some very funny moments, I really enjoyed it, and the main idea of the medias that manipulates the news, the girl group that can&apos;t sing and the main characters that wants to fight this problems is very well presented in a pleasant ironical way.\n\nCH7 can&apos;t compete whit a real movie, here I must agree with the negative comment. But it&apos;s an effort of a group of young people to create something with their own hands and the result is an enjoyable film: compared to a real movie it is technically very poor, but it still has something to tell and I thanks the CH7 staff for giving me a nice story that proves that a movie can also be made with low budget.\n\nI&apos;m waiting for their next projects.",

Usually, Smalltown, USA is almost paradise and this one says the opposite : it&apos;s a pit, faraway of modern life and hard for professional life or romances as every one knows every body ! That was indeed my feeling in my own hometown before leaving for the big city The movie takes a long time to get settled (while it&apos;s only 100 minutes), but it&apos;s worth staying because this coming of age story (a theme that has always resonates in me) is about a grad teen having a crush for Jamie Lee ! Sure her occupation is crazy (manager of stunt cars) but in her cowboy clothes or in the teen fantasies as a rock star, she is totally stunning and thus i was really connected with what&apos;s happening between them. Swayze was solid as a poor hick unable to save his weeding while Jenny was a big disappointment : she thus plays her unfaithful wife but like the future Tralala from Red Hook, she is too much into teasing and nothing else As this small town is near Chicago, we have also as bonus, the locals siblings from the area, maybe in their 1st appearance as both sister and brother are still young !",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the best films made in the third reich with a credible storyline and very credible actors. On the other hand it is one of the most dangerous films containing poison that did not weaken in the 6 decades since its production. This film was intended as a preparation and secret promotion for hitler&apos;s euthanasia program. The plot(official, therefore no spoiler): A brilliant doctor&apos;s young wife falls ill to multiple sclerosis and urges him to kill her before the agony begins. Unable to find a cure he fulfills her wish and is accused of murder.This sounds like a dime novel but is based on real cases and presented in a very credible way(and I am allergic to sentimental films normally). This credibility and the fact that it is difficult to identify this as a nazi film by simple watching (a few seconds of cutting would remove all evidence) makes this film dangerous even today. The film asks the viewer for his judgement on the topic and even supplies him with possible objections but the answer is inevitable &apos;pro reo&apos;. So this film could be used as ammunition in todays discussion about assisted suicide and its extensions (e.g. against the patients will if his resistance is considered as irrational by an authority as discussed in at least 2 western countrys). Therefore it (the film)is still banned in Germany except for scientific study. It&apos;s a pity, for it IS a very good film but  I can&apos;t object the reasons.",

Maybe not Raj Kapoor&apos;s best, but certainly interesting and groundbreaking for its time. This was actually the first Bollywood film I ever saw where it was clearly expressed (even though through a song and dance scene) that the pair was sleeping with each other - even more unusual as the couple consisted of two teenagers! Very Seventies in style with a severely overacting cast, but great fun nevertheless. In many ways a movie of a much freer and more uncompromising spirit than most Bollywood fare of today - but then, it was the Seventies..."

Both he and Sushma lead a very busy life, so much so that they have no quality time to spend with Raj, leaving his care, even breast-feeding, to their maidservant, Mrs. Braganza, who Raj regards as his mother. When Mr. Nath finds Raj to be precocious, he has him enrolled in a distant boarding school. When Raj returns after 12 years, he does not find any change, save that Mrs. Braganza does not work there anymore as she has been fired by Sushma. At his 18th birthday party, he meets with flirtatious Nima, and this is when he sets his eyes on Bobby, Mrs. Braganza&apos;s 16 year old granddaughter, and falls head over heels in love with her. To his delight he finds that she also loves him, much to the chagrin of his parents, who agree to meet with Bobby&apos;s dad, Jack, and Mrs. Braganza, but humiliate them. This does not deter Raj and Bobby and they continue to meet, so much so that Mr. Nath instructs him not to leave the house or he will have him and the entire Braganza family arrested if they attempt to get the young couple married, as they are minors and must attain the age of 21 to be married. Raj decides to wait for 2 more years and accordingly writes to Bobby. Raj will soon realize that his parents have already selected a wife for him, in the shape and form of Alka Sharma, the only daughter of wealthy Mr. Sharma. Watch what impact this has on Raj on the occasion of his surprise engagement to Alka.",

From the earworm opening song to the final battle with the kaiju-of-the-week, Ultraman remains a staple of Japanese pop-culture. The show was a follow-up to the popular &quot;Ulltra-Q&quot;, an anthology series similar to the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; (but with bigger monsters) and both were produced by Eiji Tsuburaya, best known for the special effects in the original &apos;Godzilla&apos; (1954) (hence cameos by some of Toho&apos;s monsters). Episode 1 is an origin story that explains how Ultraman came to be on Earth and how he formed a special bond with Science Patrol agent Shin Hayata (note: names may vary between the original Japanese and dubbed versions). The writers cleverly added a visual timer on Ultraman&apos;s chest which displayed his energy levels. This gimmick made every battle a race against time, adding to the suspense and excitement (although presumably it would be problematic if an enemy monster ever figured out what the light meant). Overall: probably a bit slow and primitive looking for modern young audiences but good nostalgic fun for the older crowd and a must watch for kaiju eiga fans of all ages.",

In essence, this is a vulgarization of the Bonnie and Clyde myth in Western garb with Jed (Milian) an illiterate brute with Robin Hood pretensions and Sonny (George, just off Peckinpah&apos;s STRAW DOGS [1971]) is almost always on the point of being raped by all and sundry. Among the gallery of grotesques that cross their path are blinded lawman Savalas, whorehouse madam Betti and sex-starved aristocrat Yanni. Ennio Morricone provides the typically eclectic music score but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s one of his more memorable works.",

If you made it all the way through Brian Camp&apos;s review you will see at the end that he added that Clans of Intrigue was the title when he wrote the review but now IMDb has changed it to Legend of the Bat. I don&apos;t know why either Brian... \n\n&quot;Clans of Intrigue&quot; was released in Hong Kong on 03/05/1977 and &quot;Legend of the Bat&quot; (aka Clans of Intrigue 2) was released on 07/08/1978.\n\nThat&apos;s right, &quot;also known as &quot;Clans of Intrigue 2&quot;, Legend of the Bat is a sequel to &quot;Clans of Intrigue&quot;... Lung Ti resumes his same role in this but Hua Yueh comes back as a different character.\n\nAnyway... This page is for reviews of Clans of Intrigue. So, there&apos;s not much I can add that hasn&apos;t already been said.\n\nI hope that IMDb fixes this error and makes a &quot;Legend of the Bat (aka Clans of Intrigue 2) 1978&quot; page so I can write a review on it (Its as good as Clans). \n\nOoops... I just found it... IMDb has it listed under its other alias name aka &quot;Bat Island Adventures&quot; (1978). Well, they still need to remove this Legend of the Bat cover from this page and return it to Clans of Intrigue like it originally was and should be....",

Its art.\n\nIts not easily digested, so if you like a movie without putting yourself into it, this would not be the one to choose then.\n\nHowever if you like depth, humor and real affections and human emotions of all manners, this movie is a good choice.\n\nIts about the transformation of being narrow, unhappy and closed to change into a sensitive, alertness, warmness that makes it possible to feel love and fullfillment. In this case for the very first time. Its the princess(Birgitte Price) that goes through the transformation, and she does it with amazing expressions and reality. The credit of this movie goes to her. The prince is good too, with just the right appearance and behaviour.\n\nThe main actors has a unique chemistry and are masters of acting. The dialogs are carefully chosen and penetrate accurately if you listen with your heart.\n\nThe shooting locations and music is very authentic and matching.\n\nThe essence of its story is timeless and valuable i.e. true love and how to be open to receive it and live it.",

A Bad Day To Go Fishing is the story of a burnt out, punch-drunk, former World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion and his equally washed-up promoter slash manager, taking on any and all opponents in challenge matches in 27 South American cities. Unknown to the brain damaged ex-champion, his manager who calls himself,Prince, has been paying off all his opponents to lose to him. Without giving away the ending, the two losers end up in an obscure South American town, where the younger, stronger, and meaner opponent refuses to lose the fight. This film is a character study of lost souls just trying to get through life day by day, by any means possible. And yet, down deep in the human spirit, sometimes,given the right situation,human beings can recapture the glory of their youth, even if it is for a brief moment in time.",

Regular Heimatfilm actress Marianne Hold - of whom I am never too kind - is quite acceptable here as she shows the viewer an independent woman, and certainly is very attractive in this film. Added feature (at least for my taste) is Angelika Meissner, who sings a couple of songs with a dubbed voice. Gerhard Riedmann plays a tenor, but take it from me that his singing voice was also dubbed.  The most curious part is played by Hans Nielsen (a fine actor), who has nothing else to do than just to be there."

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s a film about couple of world-class athletes from Bavaria who never give up. What&apos;s rather cool is that they don&apos;t ever triumph in the film, and that the footage on their attempts is all the more hair-raising and expressive of the challenges they face for that. In addition camera placement, whose details are never revealed, shows a level of daring comparable to the climbers&apos; physical feats. Its invisibility is a measure of its accomplishment. A DVD with &quot;making of&quot; details about how the film was shot as well as more mundane information about the logistics of the climbs and the shoot would be particularly welcome here. What we do get is a lot of rumination and some of the most astonishing footage of rock climbing at the highest level you&apos;re ever likely to see.\n\nThomas and younger brother Alexander Huber are speed rock climbers and this film documents two attempts to set a record on &quot;The Nose&quot; of El Capitan in Yosemite, with an attempt to cross a stormy but beautiful pass in Patagonia in between. Accidents abort the &quot;Nose&quot; record attempts. The Patagonian pass can&apos;t be crossed, not surprisingly, because of the weather.\n\nEl Capitan is the gold standard of rock climbing, and &quot;The Nose&quot; is its 1,000-foot central sheer upright front, which at first seemed to climbers to be simply impossible. The first who succeeded in the attempt to scale it took 47 days in 1958. With modern methods and training it now normally takes those who succeed 2-3 days but the speed record is something under three hours. That gives you an idea of what kind of performance this is--the gap between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;excellent&quot; in this field. These climbers are in another world, moving at a speed so scary and at a level of adrenalin so high once they&apos;re on their way with a good start on a good day that they move beyond fear. Not so in the days and hours beforehand though, of course. And the El Capitan record attempts each begins with lots of dummy runs, some of which take many hours longer than the record.\n\nSomewhat oddly, since Alexander and Thomas do plenty of talking to the camera, the film conveys little about their personal contexts beyond mounting climbing. Obviously this is disproportionately central to their world. But they do live in the real world, somewhere (actually quite near to each other). Clearly they&apos;re German-speaking (and that&apos;s about all we hear them speak), and they have a mother who cooks in a restaurant-quality kitchen--and objects to Thomas&apos; continuing to risk his life though he&apos;s married with two children.\n\nThere&apos;s also a handful of American climbers and ex-climbers who talk to the camera about the sport and the Hubers. They provide interesting and sympathetic outlooks and a welcome relief from the obsessive intensity of the brothers. Obviously the Hubers have, when they&apos;re at work on the rock, a symbiotic level of coordination that is a key element in their ultimate success. But such bonding isn&apos;t without its element of psychodrama. Taking a break with other people helps make the film more relaxing to watch. The only serious misstep is the film&apos;s attempt to show a nightmare of falling one of the brothers has, with fudged blurry footage. It&apos;s unnecessary and doesn&apos;t quite work. Beyond that, one could only have wished for a little more personal context, perhaps from their mother.\n\nYou have to look somewhere else to find out a little about what else these guys do besides climb rocks. Alexander has a degree in physics but works as a mountain and ski guide and Thomas is also a mountain guide and plays in a band. This they themselves never mention. Rock climbing is their obsession, their greatest challenge. But among their many ruminations are the points that they need to gain satisfaction from working alone too--Thomas especially, since as a climber he is overshadowed by Alexander--and that bravery in this one activity doesn&apos;t guarantee equal courage in the everyday challenges of life.\n\nIt&apos;s a troubling paradox that Alexander was taught to climb by Thomas, but has outstripped him as an athlete. He is also more meticulous (as may befit a physicist), more the planner. Thomas is more emotional, more of a dreamer, more impulsive, and has this baggage, of being bettered by his junior, less celebrated in the press--and needing to chalk up some solid climbing accomplishments solo--which apparently he has done. The psychological complexity of the brothers&apos; cooperation and competition is well depicted, even if their ultimate motivations--and how it feels to be them in the rest of their lives--are left unexplored. \n\nWhen the brothers fail in their two &quot;Nose&quot; record attempts in this film, it&apos;s because of a pretty serious mishap each time. The footage can&apos;t show the full details, but it does convey through its coverage of these moments how close to death the Hubers are working. It also shows how demoralizing failure is when you&apos;re so close to spectacular accomplishment. But as they say to each other after the second aborted try, &quot;Now more than ever.&quot; And, though the film doesn&apos;t show it, they did set the record. It&apos;s just not a part of Danquart&apos;s footage. This is only one of a series of lacunae, but we can&apos;t entirely fault the director for that: maybe this way we get closer to what it is to be at the top. You have to keep trying. It&apos;s isn&apos;t easy, even if you&apos;re the best, and peak performances skirt the edge of failure, nearly always. Darquart has caught the austerity of life at the top of the rock climbing world.",

      "reviewBody": "Chaharshanbe-soori (2006) was shown in the U.S. with the title &quot;Fireworks Wednesday. It was written and directed by Asghar Farhadi.\n\nThis movie really has two plots. One plot line involves a young working class woman who who will be married in a week. She starts work at the apartment of a wealthy family. Just a few minutes into the plot we realize that this is a dysfunctional family. The husband has flown into a rage and smashed a window with his fist. (He has a bandage in his hand throughout the movie.) The wife suspects that her husband is having an affair. She enlists the young maid to spy for her.\n\nThe relationship between the wife and the husband is the second plot line. Is the husband truly having an affair, or is this a neurotic obsession on the part of the wife?\n\n(There&apos;s a third subplot about a man who parks his car just outside the gates of the apartment. He appears friendly enough, but I could never figure out what he was doing there. Probably everyone who saw the movie in Iran understood perfectly well what was happening. I couldn&apos;t get it. Even so, two solid plots are plenty for one movie.)\n\nThe reason the movie is called &quot;Fireworks Wednesday&quot; is because it&apos;s the Persian New Year, and everyone is shooting off fireworks. Fireworks are everywhere. I&apos;ve never been to a movie--including war movies--with so many explosions in it. After a while, your brain partly shuts out the sound, but it&apos;s always there.\n\nThis is a powerful, dramatic, well-acted film. Although it&apos;s a drama, there are many funny moments. For example, the young outside worker and the older woman who works as concierge bond immediately. They&apos;ll never be in the upper class, but that doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t laugh at the weird rich people for whom they work.\n\nThe two female leads in the movie are extraordinarily talented. Hedye Tehrani plays the wife &amp; Taraneh Alidoosti plays the domestic worker. \n\nWe saw this movie at home on the small screen, and it worked very well. It has a very high IMDb rating of 7.8, so I&apos;m not alone in my admiration of it.\n\nIf you like unusual, interesting foreign films, with great direction and great acting, find this movie and enjoy it!",

      "reviewBody": "The German cover praised it as a mix between Rumble in the Bronx and Ong Bak and while I am aware that marketing tries to sell me something, I rarely felt as ripped off as with this flick.\n\nThe humour is kind of strange and rather dull. At times it felt more like a parody than a comedic martial arts movie, without succeeding in it. To be honest, many things may be worse in the German translation, but that is the one I watched and it was horribly bad.\n\nThe martial arts was underwhelming. Very many cuts, some even switched directions and left me wondering what actually happened. No real moves where shown because of this, which is why I had the impression the actors could not really fight. Whenever there was a fight that tried to resist from cutting every other second, the director decided to use too much slow-motion and unwarranted &quot;explosive actions&quot; (aka bodies flying away comically after being hit).\n\nThe director, furthermore, decided to use many different styles, for example artsy shots, strange close-ups, grey filters, black and white moments with some colour as if it tried to be a Sin City movie. Many cuts were disorienting, because it failed to follow the movement of the characters or showed things that could not be or should not be continued this way. Easy continuation errors, I&apos;d think.\n\nThe Tiger Blade is not a blade, but the name of the protagonist, but we only get to know it is his moniker after a real blade is introduced as some kind of McGuffin, because it doesn&apos;t really do much. Add to that the sad point that the &quot;magic&quot; in the movie was unnecessary and boring and didn&apos;t make the story better.\n\nI am willing to say that the movie may be better in the original, but the German version was laughably inept. That said, I believe it is one of the first movies of the director, so I may view it as an inspired &quot;first try&quot;.\n\nIn conclusion, if you&apos;re looking for a good martial arts movie, great actors, a gripping story, you should look somewhere else. If you are in the mood to make fun of a movie with a group of friends, this may be it, though.\n\nIt is not horrible, it is simply far from good.",

      "reviewBody": "When I heard about a sequel for Van Damme&apos;s absolute worst film &quot;Cyborg,&quot; I rolled my eyes and thought, &quot;Oh no....Why did they make this? To cash in on the success of a movie that WASN&apos;T a success? There&apos;s no way this will be good....&quot;\n\nWell....I was eating my words about fifteen minutes into it.\n\n&quot;Cyborg 2: Glass Shadow&quot; is by no means a masterpiece, nor is it an especially inspiring thriller, but I was surprised how entertaining it was. This might be due to the fact that it completely abandoned the plot of the first film and started from scratch, thus it can be viewed as a completely original motion picture. The plot is pretty standard: late into the 21st century, a company calls PINWHEEL have developed cyborgs that look and act just like real humans, even down to emotions. &quot;If God didn&apos;t make you, we did,&quot; one of the big business men quotes.\n\nBut what if one of the cyborgs begins to recognize independence, as Cash (a beautiful Angelina Jolie) does? That&apos;s when Mercy comes in. Mercy is a freelance cyborg who, after the death of his wife, has dedicated his life to helping renegade cyborgs beat the system and flee to another country. The part is played by Jack Palance, who actually does a good job, though he spends most of the time on a computer screen with closeups of his mouth.\n\nAt any rate, Cash decides to flee, and she takes along a human to guide her (and he also happens to be in love with her...). His name is Colt, a skilled warrior (Elias Corteas, who bears a close resemblance to Robert DeNiro). Pinwheel sends two people to track them, Danny (a chilling Billy Drago) and Chan (the standard oriental-warrior-cyborg chick). So it&apos;s a desparate race for the two to survive in an odd, futuristic city.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty much a standard plot from there, which is predictable and easy to figure out. But at least it HAS a plot, something the first film can&apos;t claim. And this film has good qualities in other areas. The special effects are above average, including the awesome shots of a battery-charged city of 2170! The characters are also well drawn out and defined, with nice chemistry between the two leads and a chilling performance by Drago....That man is evil incarnate. Good score, too.... Does anyone know if the soundtrack is available? Lastly, the action is well-choreographed with some nice settings.\n\nSumming it up, the director knows what he&apos;s doing, and he managed to make a so-so plot get lifted by an excellent cast, great, memorable characters, top-of-the-drawer dialogue, okay special effects, and good stunts. Recommended if you&apos;re like me: I hated the first film. It&apos;s worth taping if it ever comes on TV again...I know I will....\n\n**1/2 out of ****"

And, not to forget, I was going to watch a photocopy of my favourite actress, Katrina Kaif (favourite, mind you, for all reasons other than her acting!), which is really frustrating. This is the second time Salman is doing something like getting a carbon copy.\n\nSo, anyways, in one word, this movie is average. Very average. For more than one reason. It&apos;s a good entertainer, but all the super-bollywoody factors make me hate it, like flying (means a LOOOOOOONG jump), like breaking a sword with a bloody fist, etc, etc. Thank god for what happens in the end, though.\n\nThe direction is OK, doesn&apos;t feel stretched, but isn&apos;t that smooth either. The editing is flawed, but I&apos;d give the cinematography a solid 8/10. Scenes are beautifully captured, no doubt. The 300-type CGI makes one want to puke, at times. The soundtrack... except the one song that I know people will like, it sucks.\n\nAnd for the performances... Salman Khan&apos;s acting was... let&apos;s say... what it was supposed to be. Satisfying, nothing great. For others, it was fine. The newcomer Katrina Kaif-ish girl, though didn&apos;t have too many dialogues, was pretty OK.\n\nAnd for the movie... I just LIKED one thing, which is the small twist in the end. As for the rest, it was OK. It is, after all, a love story, and nothing more. And when it comes to love, India has invented so many stories and I&apos;ve seen so many that honestly, I&apos;m bored.

      "reviewBody": "A storyline that is the extension of Chandramukhi has the same formula but dulls in comparison to the first movie.\n\nVenkatesh was fascinating to watch. He was given enough opportunity to showcase his talent, which without a doubt was amazing. His range of emotions was versatile, and of his characters had their own feel. \n\nAnushka came in the second half and she was amazing. Her dancing was full of grace and despite her small screen time, her character was etched well. \n\nAvinash was good as a Acharya. \n\nShraddha Das &amp; Richa Gangopadhyay both acted well. Their characters were given enough screen time to develop and help the story progress.\n\nKamalini Mukherjee&apos;s character was okay. She neither added nor took away from the movie. Unfortunately she was not given enough scope to fully develop her role in the film. \n\nPoonam Kaur and Sujitha were not necessary for the film. They had only a small part to play and were not necessary for the film.\n\nAll the other characters were okay. The comedy scenes with Brahmanandam were not really funny, even though Venkatesh was good at delivering his dialogues. \n\nThe songs and background score were adequate. The cinematography was nice but the screenplay was okay. The build up to the climax was okay, but the actual climax was so-so. \n\nThe positive aspects of the film were the story line, Venkatesh, Anushka and Avinash. The rest of the cast could not measure up to the original cast of Chandramukhi.",

The first part of the film deals with the tension that mounts as the escape is prepared by tunneling to the escape point far from the men&apos;s barracks. The second half of the story follows their escape route as they hide from German authorities in order to escape to Denmark and then to safety in Sweden.\n\nAll of it is told in crisp, no frills fashion and in the very understated British style of filmmaking, vastly different from the way the subject matter would have been treated in an American film. Particularly impressive are the sequences where Genn and Steel must rely on their own wit and abilities to deceive the enemy after their escape from camp.\n\nTension mounts toward a satisfying ending. All told, an excellent British film that tells a true story without a lot of false bravado.",

      "reviewBody": "I liked when Woody Allen went back to comedy and starred in his own films again during this period. He started showing his age in the 00&apos;s, but in this film he&apos;s still a lot of fun and capable of being a physical comic. It&apos;s a story about a real down on his luck has-been of a director (Allen) who&apos;s so desperate that he&apos;s reduced to filming commercials in Canada. So he has no choice but to accept an offer to direct a big movie that could put him back on top - the problem is, the two producers are his ex-wife (Tea Leoni) and her new fiancé who stole her from Allen (Treat Williams). Right before production all the stress gets to Woody and he experiences psychosomatic blindness and has to direct the whole movie without being able to see. He can&apos;t blow this important opportunity and has to fake his way through without letting anyone but his trustworthy agent and his Asian cameraman&apos;s interpreter know what&apos;s happening.\n\nThis is a sure-fire recipe for laughs, and it mostly delivers. Tea Leoni is perfect for the role of Woody&apos;s long-suffering ex who&apos;s stuck working with him again under such touchy circumstances. I also enjoy Mark Rydell as his dedicated agent and mentor. Debra Messing plays another in a long line of ditzy young girlfriends who can&apos;t seem to resist shacking up with the 66-year-old Allen. The one flaw is that the movie goes on a tad long, and maybe the gag wears thin by the home stretch. *** out of ****",

SVENGALI follows its source novel (&quot;Trilby&quot; by George Du Maurier) pretty closely, which is rare for horror film-adaptations of the 1930s. Apart from John Barrymore&apos;s appropriately mesmerizing leading performance (here revisiting the genre after a whole decade), I recall one particularly amazing tracking shot demonstrating Svengali&apos;s hypnotic powers over Trilby, and there are even brief flashes of nudity (remember this was a Pre-Code film, but also that our heroine is a model)! Barrymore followed SVENGALI with the thematically-similar THE MAD GENIUS (1931) but, unfortunately, I haven&apos;t had the opportunity to watch that one",

      "reviewBody": "This is another adaptation of the White Snake myth of forbidden love between humans and demons but the good news is that it is hyped up with so much CGI wizardry that it looks almost like an &quot;Avatar&quot; clone, complete with copious amounts of &apos;wire-fu&apos;. However, the bad news is that director Tony Chin sees it fit to keep the film&apos;s IQ at kiddie level with talking mice and clownish rabbits.\n\nWhat&apos;s more is that Jet Li, obviously the star attraction here, is caught in a difficult position, having to mouth silly lines and perform unintentionally funny stunts instead of actual kungfu.\n\nLike in A Chinese Ghost Story, we have a tale of young herbalist Xu Xian (Raymond Lam) and a thousand-year-old snake demon (played by Eva Huang Shengyi). It all starts with an underwater kiss with which the sexy snake incarnate rescues the hapless young man from drowning. After that, she continues to pursue him, against the advice of her close friend Green Snake (Charlene Choi) - until he agrees to marry her.\n\nThe match is against the law of nature and sorcerer Fa Hai (Jet Li) of Jinshang temple has sworn to trap and slay all such demons before they wreak havoc on the villagers. Trouble is, the kind-hearted Xu Xian has befriended the sorcerer monk and slaying the White Snake would hurt her innocent hubby.\n\nThe spectacular opening sequences of a battle between Fa Hai and the Ice Witch (Vivian Hsu) gives us a taste of what is to come. One thing we can be sure of is that Tony Chin spares no expense over the sets and period setting that provide a deliciously rich fantasy just like those of Jame Cameron&apos;s &quot;Avatar&quot; and Tim Burton&apos;s &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;. The animation is a bit tacky though, considering how far CGI has gone today.\n\nStill, the make-or-break factor in any romance flick is the performance of its leads and here Eva Huang and Raymond Lam are not just a good-looking couple but they managed to look like young lovers. Juxtaposed against them are the ghoulish and comical relationship between Charlene Choi&apos;s Green Snake and Wen Zhang&apos;s novie monk Nen Reng who gets &apos;converted&apos; to the other side early in the movie. Other stars to look out for include Chapman To, Miriam Yeung and Lam Suet who seem to be having fun playing childish farmyard characters like chickens and rabbits. Nothing to be excited with this CGI extravaganza with Jet Li in it. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"

      "reviewBody": "Summer with Monika is a very fine, sometimes masterful showcase of what would be to come with Ingmar Bergman&apos;s more notable and personal dramas. That is, in the technical side of things; here he uses a lot of shots that are simply there for the location, the imagery of the rocks and beach and waters where the characters are at. It&apos;s much more in a sense of a documentary of these two people than a usual tale of young love. But it&apos;s a good story at the core, and in it Bergman also establishes one of the actresses that would become crucial to his career. \n\nHarriet Andersson is remarkable as the happy, though high strung and (as one in my generation might call) &apos;needy&apos; Monika, who works at a vegetable stand. She meets Harry (Ekberg) in a bar one day, and the two hit it off after later seeing a movie. Monika&apos;s home life is the pits, as is Harry&apos;s work environment. So, they act on an impulse to get away for the summer to an island. Out of that comes what is very natural in a relationship- happiness, love, despair, hunger, and the oncoming (unplanned) child. The third act goes as how one might expect, but the way it&apos;s filmed and acted is still extraordinary.\n\nOnce Bergman gets his film on the water, he just shoots and shoots. Some of this may not seem to go anywhere, some of it may just seem like shots of animals and rocks. But I have a feeling Bergman was likely inspired by either painters or the neo-realists with their documentary feel. If nothing else, everything feels very much alive and real with how the characters talk and act to each other, and that doesn&apos;t lose its ground after fifty years. \n\nSome shots here and there (one when Monika is out one night, when Harry is not at home, is intriguing on how it just stays on her, and how it&apos;s lit) are some of the more memorable ones of the 1950&apos;s for the director. I also liked how the characters were believably stuck in the middle of a very plausible dilemma- do they keep on going on with a great, bit love affair alone and off from civilization, or do they face up to what they have to do with living? It&apos;s a tragic, somewhat obvious conclusion, but the way it&apos;s told is how it scores some points.\n\nBasically, Summer with Monika is a fresh, dark love story that may appeal to those looking for a good alternative to a film of today loaded with cynicism or delight in the shrill conventions with the characters. One may have seen characters like Monika and Harry in other films, yet they are fitting for the style of Bergman&apos;s precise bittersweet whimsy and depth.",

      "reviewBody": "Before George and Martha there were Jimmy and Alison, the vituperate couple at the heart of Osborne&apos;s legendary play and I suppose you could say the British Kitchen Sink movement started here. The difference, of course, being that while the Arthur Seatons and Colin Smiths of this world were unequivocally working-class kicking against the system and the intelligentsia, Jimmy and Alison were the intelligentsia playing at being working-class. And therein lies the rub; unlike later &apos;kitchen sink&apos; movies &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; isn&apos;t so much looking back as mired in the past, an uneasy amalgam of the kind of British films that were coming out in the late fifties and the kind of ground-breaking British cinema that would come to prevail in the early sixties.\n\nThere is no denying it is extremely well played. Burton is loudly splendiferous as Jimmy yet he seems strangely miscast at the same time. Perhaps it&apos;s that booming, melodious voice; this is a Jimmy that is more Shakespeare than Osborne, (note how Olivier completely subsumed his Shakespearean tendencies to become the definitive Osborne hero in &quot;The Entertainer&quot;). By the time Burton got around to playing George in &quot;Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; you could say he had grown into the part.\n\nBetter cast are Mary Ure as Alison and Claire Bloom as Helena. Their performances feel new and edgy, a move away from the traditional kind of performances that British actresses had been giving up to then while Gary Raymond is an admirable Cliff and a miscast Edith Evans does what she can with Ma Tanner. Tony Richardson opens it out from the Porter&apos;s depressing flat to give a more &apos;cinematic&apos; feel yet it still feels stagey and not in a good way. It&apos;s a refreshingly &apos;grown-up&apos; movie but you may still wonder what all the fuss was about when the original play first opened.",

      "reviewBody": "Beyond Borders brings to light the very realistic struggles of the millions of refugees created by war and the valiant efforts of aid workers who contribute to their survival in spite of overwhelming odds.  The storyline of crossing your life&apos;s borders away from a comfortable life to help other struggling human beings is a story worth being told. In this type of humanitarian experience, every aid worker I have come into contact with has described the experience as extremely enriching.  I&apos;m saddened most of America did not embrace this subject matter at the box office.  We, as Americans, live a very comfortable life comparatively, and perhaps it&apos;s out of fear, complacency or just selfishness that we generally do not cross borders to help fellow human beings.  This attitude does not make us very popular around the world, but perhaps if more people become aware and did something to help other people in their struggles, the world would be a better and safer place to live.\n\nAs a journalist who covered the Afghan / Soviet war, recently watching the &quot;Making of&quot; on the DVD was compelling to see how the filmmakers made something so realistic without putting their cast or crew in harms way.  I hope this film will be embraced as a DVD so that studios will continue to make films of solid subject matter.  Angelina Jolie was well-cast in this role for she (in real life) is the Ambassador for the United Nations High Commission of Refugees (UNHCR). She brought much  passion into this role, and while she appeared a little &quot;girlish&quot; initially, the character had to grow out of her pampered life for us to follow her across the borders both real and metaphoric. I am pleased she was brave enough to embrace such a role, and hope she will continue to grow in her range of acting choices. Noah Emmerich reminded me of a very gentle Aid worker I knew killed on the job, which tugged at my heart strings.  While Clive Owen&apos;s portrayal of a man who closes off his heart to survive the cruelty of every day life in the war zone is accurate, for the general public who has probably not lived through these extreme conditions, it&apos;s difficult to empathize or care. I&apos;m sure that is why there might be a general dislike of this character.  For a handful of my friends, the romantic connection was unrealistic, but in reality if you&apos;re living day to day in such extreme conditions and you&apos;re friend dies, you&apos;ll let down your guard just to feel alive. I&apos;m sure a lot of people had sex just after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThe excellent production design, cinematography and poignant music moved the story forward, but while I loved this subject matter, I also felt the transitions between three very distant locations caused the film to feel somewhat disjointed.  Perhaps that was due to &quot;behind the scene&quot; budget constraints (maybe some transition scenes were cut before they could shoot them) or perhaps some studio executive was pushing the film out to theaters before the cut was ready because the investors were crying out for their ROI.  Who knows what the politics were...\n\nEither way, I liked the film, am going to buy the DVD and will definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to be inspired beyond their own border. I certainly was.",

      "reviewBody": "Once in a while comes along a movie which transcends the medium&apos;s boundaries and sets new standards. Bahman Ghobadi&apos;s remarkable and riveting new film is one of these rare examples. Made in only 17 days and without a permit, &quot;Persian Cats&quot; is guerrilla film making at its best. It is a faux-documentary, in style of Kiarostami&apos;s Close-Up &amp; Panahi&apos;s Offside, about the underground music scene in Iran. It is really about the universal power of music and the passion of the youth which know no boundaries. We see that Iranian musicians go to any lengths to defy censorship and restrictions to play their music. They do not need concert halls. They play anywhere: from metro stations to cow sheds and for anyone who wants to listen. Music and lyrics for the young Iranians has become a desperate, but at the same time powerful, means of expression and communication with the world at large. The music played in the film is very powerful and its range is quite remarkable. We see bands playing jazz, pop, heavy metal, rap and singing in both Farsi and English. Ghobadi&apos;s film manages to convey all the passion, energy, anger and hope that is contained in these music. It is a brave, and undoubtedly controversial film (specially with the the two leads seeking asylum in the west and Kiarostami denouncing the film), made with so much passion that the viewers can not remain unmoved. It is masterfully directed and photographed and brilliantly edited. A masterpiece which is certain to become another milestone in the history of Iranian and world cinema. Absolutely unmissable.",

      "reviewBody": "I hated this movie. I could not make up my mind whether the clichés and stereotypical acting from children and adults alike, along with a narrative that only VERY young children will find anything but phony and unbelievable were unintentional, or if this was the director&apos;s premeditated attempt at expressionism or outright surrealism. To me this became an incoherent mess. Perhaps amateurish is a term applicable to this film.\n\nThe story is about a Danish girl of about 10 years who saves a falcon chick when the branch which supports the nest breaks off during a rain storm. The scene where the girl climbs about 30 feet high is actually quite suspenseful. To seek shelter from the heavy rains she climbs inside a large truck which is parked along the roadside. She falls asleep, and when she wakes up the semi-trailer has arrived in southern Italy. Anyone faintly familiar with Euroepan geography will, as I did, balk at this premise.\n\nThe girl&apos;s arrival in Italy seems not to trouble her in the least. In fact, she doesn&apos;t actually appear to realize that she is away from home and acts irritated at people speaking to her in a strange tongue and not understanding her words.\n\nThere she teams up with a band of Italian boys of between 5 to 12 years and gets involved in their &quot;adventures&quot;. There are several minor story lines, all highly implausible.\n\nThe film has some nice Italian, dance-like feel-good music. \n\nI was watching this film in a public library alongside two other people, a man and a woman of between 60 and 70 years of age. They enjoyed it immensely and smiled and shared approving glances throughout the film. I mention this just so that the reader will beware that others may &quot;get&quot; what I totally missed from this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Of course that, like Final Fantasy: Advent Children, RE: Degeneration was also made for the fans and for those ones who are familiar to the stories behind the happenings over the game series.\n\nRE: Degeneration is an &quot;episode&quot; after the happenings of RE 2 and RE 4, so if you&apos;ve already played these ones you will notice some familiarities, but if you haven&apos;t, what you already know by the crap movie trilogy is kinda useful. Anyway, its a lot enjoyable.\n\nEven being a CG movie, it has a lot of action and the movie follows the same steps of each game of the series, so it has references of the games all the time like: the different big and rich scenarios that are more than just scenarios but part of the story and also enemies of the characters; the new characters being presented, each one of them having their very own importance in the story; the zombies that pops everywhere and also the final boss, that gets bigger and bigger on each new episode of the game series.\n\nOf course that, the best thing about this movie is the great come back of some of the most loved characters of the series like the best and smartest special agent Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, a sweet girl that has the strength and courage of a lion. Both Leon and Claire are portrait here exactly like they are in the games.\n\nThe CG movie is also very faithful to the games, I mean... even the CG are similar to the games CG, giving the feeling that at any moment the game will starts or you will have to press a command at any moment, and that&apos;s very thrilling for the fans.\n\nWell, that&apos;s it... that&apos;s sad for me to say - as a movie lover and also a RE fan that has been playing the series since 1996 - that the best Resident Evil movie is a CG movie, and that is a shame for the movie trilogy and everyone involved in it. The Resident Evil trilogy is a reputation destroyer for the game series and RE: Degeneration finally comes to deliver what the fans were missing: something new but faithful to the games.",

      "reviewBody": "Talented writer (and later director) Joe Mankiewicz wrote a decent early screwball comedy script with I LIVE MY LIFE, one that in some ways anticipated the much better MY MAN GODFREY of a year later. It meanders a bit, is repetitious and ultimately tedious, but with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy it might have worked.\n\nJoan Crawford didn&apos;t have the light touch or resourcefulness needed to make the contrived comedy reversals of this story come to life. The result is that a movie whose script suggests a frothy romp becomes a very strained love story with failed comic overtones. Brian Aherne is tall, handsome, gallant and completely believable as an academic trying to learn how to unwind, rather like Cary Grant in BRINGING UP BABY three years later. Unlike Grant, he hadn&apos;t the gifts of comic timing or of charm -- there is something cranky and grudging about him, and maybe this kept him from becoming a star despite his good looks.\n\nBut this was a Joan Crawford vehicle, it was tailored for her, and it was she who was expected to carry it. As usual, the broad, strong face is as striking as a Modigliani sculpture but less expressive. Adrian, the great MGM designer so closely associated with her, is largely responsible for providing the illusion of presence and magnetism which Crawford didn&apos;t actually have. In this picture he gives her one of her most extreme and frankly ludicrous costumes, and in upstaging her, it exposes the essential flaw in their professional relationship.\n\nAdrian had wit as a designer and his costumes here are all amusing comments on Crawford&apos;s character, but they expose rather than enhance her. The worst example seems meant to be a literal suit of armor since Crawford wears it in a scene in which her defensive, self-conscious character realizes she loves Aherne but must give him up in order to save her father from financial reversals. It&apos;s rendered in what looks like silver lame, with gigantic panels that fit over each shoulder, open on the sides but completely obscuring her arms from the front -- an armless Athena ready for battle. Less awful but still attention-getting are a series of black suits and dresses which are cluttered with enormous starched white collars and bibs or exploding swags of stiff material suggesting stylized nun&apos;s habits. \n\nIn contrast, two simple costumes are far less theatrical but more effective in letting us examine Crawford: A backless, halter neck sailor suit is playful and sexy when she wears it without a bra in her first scene. And much later a starkly elegant white satin dressing gown proves to be more beautiful and glamorous than the two wedding gowns she also wears, the second of which uses tiers of orange blossoms to cover up damage her spoiled heiress has done to it. The two pared-down costumes at least allow us to observe the actress and woman for ourselves to decide what we think of her. Little was required of Crawford in this period and she gave very little in return. And we have to wonder if Adrian tried to hide this or was in fact the cause of it: Why should Crawford have learned to feel and act when her collars and sleeves upstaged her in every scene anyway?"

We had a splendid time.\n\nNow I have a copy in VHS of the film and I use to watch it from time to time. \n\nI know it´s mostly a documentary about The Beatles break-up which is kind of sad, but it would be unfair to say the film is not most enjoyable and besides the rehearsals and the arguments, it ends with the very last Beatles concert, (the famous rooftop concert).\n\nThe Beatles were four guys who spent some six years together 24 hours a day, &quot;eight days a week&quot; as they would say, working very hard, dealing with all kind of stressing events and it´s logical they split up in the end. Fame is very expensive. George Harrison explains it very well in the last chapter of The Beatles Anthology: &quot;The fans gave the money and the screams, and The Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems...&quot;. And I agree with him. It had to be hell!.\n\nNone of the four Beatles was to blame for their break-up, that´s something that just had to happen.\n\nIf you ever have the chance of watching this film, just do it. It´s a must for all the Beatles fans and all the music lovers.\n\nI hope this gem is released in DVD with lots of extras in the near future!!. Please, release it!!.\n\nLong live the Beatles!.",

      "reviewBody": "I had a few reservations about this film. Firstly we have seen Michael Sheen play a number of real life people in the last couple of years. Would it be possible for Sheen to cast aside these previous roles and play another big well known (in the UK) character in Brian Clough. I also had the distinct feeling that this may be a made for TV film that was bumped up to a theatrical release based on Sheen&apos;s recent success. My final reservation was whether the football would look good as it is frequently very poor when played by actors.\n\nI have got to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The main focus of the film is the relationship between the young pretender in football management Clough and the master in Don Revie the Manager of Leeds United. The film focuses on Clough&apos;s short tenure as the manager of Leeds after replacing Revie in 1974. The lead performances by Sheen and Meaney are excellent and it is at least as enthralling as the Frost/Nixon interplay.\n\nIt is a perfect film for me as it covers a period when my football passion was at its peak as I was about 10 years old at the time. As for the reservations I had nothing to worry about with Sheen. He transforms into Clough and it is truly a remarkable portrayal. I still tend to think that the film wouldn&apos;t lose very much on the small screen. Finally the film cleverly uses real life footage and we see very little of the actors playing football. That&apos;s probably just as well as they seemed a little older than the real players were. I&apos;ll have to check their bios to confirm that, but Bremner and Clarke looked the wrong side of 40 to me.\n\nI suspect that to get the most out of the film you&apos;ll probably need to like football, but if you do you&apos;re more or less guaranteed to enjoy it.",

It stars Whoopi Goldberg, Ted Danson, Nia Long, Will Smith and Jennifer Tilly.\n\nWhen doing a biology project at school, Zora (Long) notices that her blood group is different from her mothers, Sarah (Goldberg). Having never known her father, Zora learns that she was the product of artificial insemination. Quickly setting off to find out who her father is, it comes as a big shock when it turns out he&apos;s tall white car salesman Hal Jackson (Danson), a surprise since Zora and Sarah are black! \n\nNot the most powerful of set ups it has to be said, but in spite of the lowly rating afforded it by many critics and film lovers, it&apos;s a sweet and honest affair. Film pins its hopes on the central comedy premise of a white man somehow fathering a black daughter from a black mother. From there it follows a familiar course from the shock and horror born out by the reveal, to opposites at war and on to maybe opposites attracting? This of course only works if the viewer has a soft spot for Danson and Goldberg in the first place, but with them giving it complete gusto, and being a real off screen couple as well, their play off of each other is very easy to warm too. Sure it&apos;s contrived, and very treacle based once we land in the final quarter, but the mixing of races aspect has been well handled by the makers and there&apos;s some decent comedy moments. It may not be laugh out loud funny, unless you be the type of person who finds Danson astride a runaway elephant funny? But it has its moments and director Richard Benjamin is also enough of a pro to not let the pace sag. Good support comes from Long and Smith, while Tilly is wonderfully memorable as the fitness freak bimbo girlfriend of Danson.\n\nSlight but never less than charming, it&apos;s safely recommended to fans of the two principal stars. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Ultimately I liked this a lot, although it was very strange. It went through at least three completely different, distinct tones and styles over the course of the film. At first it played like a slightly skewed, but still rather melodramatic, teen drama, almost like one of those Korean soap operas. Very different from my previous exposure to Kim Ki-Duk. Then it started to become a violent revenge story, like something Chan Wook-Park would do. Still sort of more conventional than other Kim Ki-Duk though, not at all minimalistic or slow. The beginning part was actually somewhat contrived, not like an &quot;art&quot; film at all, in any sense of the word. But then, in it&apos;s last third, the film becomes an abstract road movie, much more in the style i&apos;ve previously associated with Kin Ki-Duk. I certainly can&apos;t say that this is a consistent film, and the pacing was obviously rather uneven given the gradual transition from borderline-conventional melodrama into minimalistic, impressionistic art film, but overall there was something about it that I liked a lot. Through all the muddledness, i can tell that Kim Ki-Duk is an interesting filmmaker. There&apos;s obviously something going on in his films worth taking note of.",

      "reviewBody": "High school student Michael Harlan (John Stockwell) is a kid with a fairly narrow focus: he&apos;s a car junkie. His girl dumps him because she thinks he spends more time tinkering with cars than with her. To get his science teacher Bob Roberts (Dennis Hopper) off his back, Mike scours a local military junkyard for any piece of junk that he can pass off as a science project. Well, the item that he steals is no ordinary junk: it was discovered back in the 1950s and is apparently an alien device that can create time-space warps. When Mike, his buddy Vince (Fisher Stevens), and Bob start messing around with the thing, an immense amount of havoc ensues as the high school is inundated with characters and animals from the past and a possible future.\n\nDebuting director Jonathan R. Betuel, who&apos;d written &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;, does alright with this first feature. It doesn&apos;t display *that* much imagination (we get cavemen, mutants, and a dinosaur, but not that much more), but it does have some good energy. Nicely shot in 2.35:1, it gets off to a solid start, and the characters are amusing to watch. Stockwell is likable in his first top billed role (after playing the best friend to car junkie Keith Gordon in &quot;Christine&quot;), and Danielle von Zerneck is appealing as his leading lady. Stevens, and Raphael Sbarge as the nerdy Sherman, are very much playing stereotypes, but they do give the roles 100%. The adult actors are largely wasted - Barry Corbin as Mikes&apos; dad, Ann Wedgeworth as the dads&apos; new wife, Richard Masur (who gets to be broader than usual) as a detective. The true standout performance in &quot;My Science Project&quot; comes from Hopper, who&apos;s perfectly cast as the former hippie who&apos;s all too happy to relive his protest filled youth. Robert DoQui, Michael Berryman, Pamela Springsteen, and an uncredited Al Leong all have small roles.\n\nThe music by Peter Bernstein is appropriate, the visual effects are well done overall (especially that dinosaur, the work of Doug Beswicks&apos; team), and there are some funny lines here and there. All in all, the movie is juvenile, silly, and ridiculous, but it does do a respectable job of entertaining its audience. Stevens&apos;s line (used as my summary), when asked why he&apos;s wearing shades indoors, is truly a howler.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Patricia Clarkson&apos;s delicate beauty is a good counterpoint to Eastwood&apos;s ruggedness. It was interesting to see actors like Neeson and Carrey paying their dues. When I first saw this film, I didn&apos;t realize that the &quot;car chase&quot; scene, running from the toy Corvette, was a spoof of Bullitt, but on viewing this time, I found the homage hilarious. No, this film isn&apos;t the equal of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; but it&apos;s not bad at all for a fourth sequel.",

Cohen, John Frink and John Frink managed to come up with for the story told here.\n\nNow, the storyline told in &quot;Extinct&quot; was rather good, lots of nice details to the storyline, and also a good amount of comedy added to supplement the storyline itself. And there was an abundance of likeable characters throughout the course of the story.\n\nVisually then &quot;Extinct&quot; was good. There were nice details to be seen in the scenes, and lots of unique characters and locations, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of &quot;Extinct&quot;.\n\nWith &quot;Extinct&quot; being an animated movie, then having a proper voice cast ensemble is a thing that can make or break the success of the project. And I will say that they definitely had put together a good ensemble for &quot;Extinct&quot;, with the likes of Adam Devine, Ken Jeong, Rachel Bloom, Zazie Beetz, Jim Jefferies, Henry Winkler and others.\n\nI found &quot;Extinct&quot; to be enjoyable, as did my 11 year old son, so directors David Silverman and Raymond S. Persi definitely made something with appeal to all ages.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Extinct&quot; lands on a six out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I love the classic horror movies of the 1930s. They were made when the talkies were still novel and film makers were experimenting with storytelling approaches, often taking inspirations from German Expressionism (indeed &apos;The Mummy&apos;s director Karl Freund, who later directed another 1930s classic &apos;Mad Love&apos;, originally worked as a cinematographer on Fritz Lang&apos;s science fiction classic &apos;Metropolis&apos; and several movies by F.W. Murnau). And it was before the Hayes Code kicked in and took a lot of the fun and thrills out of horror movies (just look at how safe and uninteresting horror became in the 1940s with a few notable exceptions e.g. the movies produced by Val Lewton). The film obviously owes a lot to &apos;Dracula&apos; and Edward Van Sloan and David Manners from that film reappear here in similar roles. Karloff is brilliant as Imhotep a.k.a The Mummy, and stage actress Zita Johann is wonderful too, very striking with exotic good looks. Too bad she became very quickly disillusioned with Hollywood as she should have been a major screen star. Karloff and Johann are fantastic on screen together, and make &apos;The Mummy&apos; impossible to forget. I was quite surprised to discover that this movie wasn&apos;t enormously successful when originally released, but it has obviously captured the imagination of thousands of film fans since. It is easily the best Mummy movie ever made (though I also have a fondness for Hammer&apos;s &quot;Blood From The Mummy&apos;s Tomb&apos; made almost forty years later), and much more entertaining and intelligent than the awful remake starring Brendan Fraser et al. &apos;The Mummy&apos; stands alongside &apos;Dracula&apos;, &apos;Frankenstein&apos;, &apos;Island Of Lost Souls&apos;, &apos;Freaks&apos;, &apos;The Invisible Man&apos; and &apos;The Black Cat&apos; as one of the best horror movies of the 1930s, an era that has had an enormous impact on horror ever since. Highly recommended!"

      "reviewBody": "There is no doubt that &quot;Air Hawks&quot; moves at a rather quick pace, and I suppose it could be classified as a &quot;B&quot; movie by the standards of its day, but the rather formulaic pioneering-aviator plot is enlivened considerably. That&apos;s done by the engagement -- by the bad hombres in the competition to Ralph Bellamy&apos;s ITL transport company -- of a German accented scientist who has developed an invisible ray to set aircraft engines on fire. What could have been a really dim-witted &quot;mad scientist&quot; movie was short-circuited -- no pun intended -- by keeping the science-fiction element restrained, and by a focus on the personality of Bellamy&apos;s character. He&apos;s a &quot;Tom Swift&quot; kind of go-getter, but not a goody-goody, and this hero-type had no small appeal to the audiences of the mid-1930s. Love interest Tala Birell ( Natalie Bierl, also known as Talusha ), is also excellent.\n\nEven as the Great Depression was continuing, people in this country continued to hunger for the heroics of air pioneers and other men ( and some women ), who seemed to stand for &quot;can do&quot; as an answer to any question or problem. In that regard, &quot;Air Hawks&quot; gains a large measure of Q or &quot;likability&quot;, both for Bellamy and for his erstwhile ally in the newspaper business. In many ways this is more of &quot;a yarn&quot; than a really deep motion picture story, but that&apos;s OK, and it works well even now. Seventy-three years have passed since this film was released but the concept wrapped into this movie, that of there being a secret weapon which can bring down an aircraft from a distance without using a rocket or a missile, and without leaving any traces of its use, is an important and intriguing notion. One only has to look back at the destruction of TWA 800, and the controversy surrounding it, or the crash of Swissair 111, to know that the secret weapon concept is not something purely out of the realm of Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.\n\nFast-paced, well-edited, and with lively performances by all concerned, this &quot;Air Hawks&quot; action / adventure production gets a vote of eight and would have notched a nine if Wiley Post had been given a little something more to do than to say &quot;hello&quot;.",

To escape, Storm heads to Surface World where he runs into Sumai (Bolo Yeung), a freedom fighter who might just know why The Controller wants to go take over Surface World.\n\nThis is endlessly complex for a DTV action flick, but I have to say I enjoyed it. Blanks is an excellent martial artist, which helps bypass his stiff acting filled with blank (ha!) expressions. As always, Bolo steals the show. Frequent Blanks co-star Jalal Merhi is the gang leader Niki and I COME IN PEACE alien Matthia Hues, a damn good fighter in his own right, stars as The Controller&apos;s right hand man Bigalow. Bobbie Phillips provides the female sidekick, which takes an odd turn about halfway in when she becomes the titular half-robot TC 2000.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Sirish Kunder has made a commendable debut in Hindi cinema as a director. This editor-turned-director has made an impressive attempt to make Jaan-è-mann what it is. Superb editing, exotic locales and a heart warming love story. I had never imagined that special effects could be of such an imperative to a romantic love story. This movie delivers the best in technicality. Scene transitions are superb, dream sequences, going into and out of flashback has its own style and the film is full of jolly and merry instances. But all that does not make a movie great if it lacks its soul, the screenplay. Sirish Kunder, in his first screen writing attempt, has clearly shown his incompetence and inexperience.\n\nKunder, though has filled the film with lots of one-liners, pretty catchy dialouges and an amazing score, technically the script has pitfalls. Lack of adequate character conflicts, the trait of the film gone missing somewhere and, and most importantly, a novice screenwriter makes the movie lose its charm. Jaan-è-mann could be a thoroughly entertaining if we set the screen writing rules aside, but beyond that, if you&apos;re planning to watch a movie by experienced professionals, this one is definitely not your cup of tea.\n\nLets look at various aspects one by one:\n\nSalman Khan - Good performance. Thank god he&apos;s given up laughing like hyena. We see veteran in this movie. A sad an miserable shade of his character makes home in public&apos;s heart.\n\nPreity Zinta - After KANK, she&apos;s my ultimate favourite. This angelic beauty looks great throughout and she&apos;s still watchable as a college girl. And my God, she does great Russian accent. \n\nAkshay Kumar - I like the way he laughs, he..hee..heee. Akshay has come a long way into romantic comedy from action movies and he&apos;s good at it. He&apos;s in fact good in any character he gets into.\n\nAnupam Kher - This one actor knows the heights of performance, although he plays a person without, um.. much height.\n\nAnu Malik - The track &quot;Humko Maloom&quot; is great. Fabulous. But not all songs are ones we can say &quot;are really great.&quot; Worked late night and wrapped up in a haste?\n\nGulzar - Is he trying to be different or did the producers ask him to do so? Why does he need to use so many English words in songs? I feel bad calling a veteran bad but he fails to live up to the expectations.\n\nFarah Khan - Great. At least this is the best she can give to her newlywed husband Sirish Kunder. She&apos;s put her heart and soul into it making choreography one of the strongest aspects of this movie.\n\nSirish Kunder - Editing - superb! Space sequence - superb! Visual transitions - superb! Should definitely go ahead and make more movies. But before that, I urge him to buy the book &quot;Screenwriting&quot; by Syd Field and read it once.\n\nApart from this, the production design is laudable. The baby who plays Preity Zinta&apos;s daughter is really sweet. Enormous curtains hanging down from the roof look exhilarating. New York, as always is breathtaking. What&apos;s even good is the actors&apos; chemistry and the way the entire movie has been set up.\n\nIf you&apos;re finding it hard to choose between Don and Jaan-è-mann, my choice would definitely be Jaan-è-mann. It&apos;s a value for money but not yet the film I can call the best film of the year.",

Instead we have endless gags and stupid dialog with the dozens of would-be yocks turning out to be groaners.\n\nIt&apos;s about two rival airlines, with their sexy stewardesses having sex in between the comedy shtick routines. Acting is poor and even talented sex performers like Hillary Scott (unrecognizable with dark hair) and Sunny Lane deadly dull in their f*cking and s*cking routines.\n\nThe only laugh I got was the packaging, that promises 9 hours of footage (ugh!!), accomplished by a second disk including never-ending BTS filler and the usual pompous self-interviews by Mullen and his partner in crime, producer/stylist Scott David."

      "reviewBody": "Die Fledermaus is one of the greatest of the operetta genre so of course any film or performance of it raises high hopes. This 1962 film was incredibly disappointing, and in my mind only the awful and downright distasteful 2001 Salzburg production was worse. There are some brownie points here with Boy Gobert&apos;s sparkling Orlofsky, Peter Alexander&apos;s poignant rendition of Bruderlein und Schwesterlein and the athleticism of Marika Rokkh, but everything else doesn&apos;t work. As wonderful as Strauss&apos; music is, it is very difficult to appreciate it when the way it is arranged comes across as very simplistic and done to the extent that it doesn&apos;t sound like Strauss at all. The playing of the score could have sparkled much more and been much more lush in sound, here it was rather plodding and bland-sounding. The story also disappoints, also simplified and very crudely. Thankfully it is not as distasteful as the Salzburg production, but the fun, endearing silliness, heart and charm of Die Fledermaus&apos; story is lost here, at best there is only one or two mild laughs and no emotional investment at all. Of the performances only three are halfway decent, the rest are forgettable and the waste of Hans Moser is unforgivable. Even visually it doesn&apos;t appeal, the costumes and sets are rather cartoonish, the colours garish instead of lavish and the camera work suggestive of a complete lack of experience behind the camera judging from the lack of finesse. To conclude, truly disappointing and poorly done film version of an operetta masterpiece. It is not quite as awful as the Salzburg production but every other performance of Die Fledermaus is a million times better than this. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

Burns has the characters look into the camera and talk about what&apos;s going on with them and what they are feeling like its a documentary. I&apos;m not a big fan of this technique but it does work okay here. Brittany Murphy is very good and shows a lot of natural charm and Rosario Dawson has an interesting role. The only part that doesn&apos;t quite ring true is Stanley Tucci as the cheating husband. Why would anyone cheat on Heather Graham? But for the most part its an extremely well written film and all the actors are very good. Nothing elaborate but very honest. You have to appreciate it for that.",

      "reviewBody": "Bombay (1995) :\n\n Perhaps the Best work of Fiction depicting Hindu-Muslim 1993 Riots and it&apos;s Communal Harmony. Arvind Swami, Mani Ratnam and AR Rahman, the Classic Roja trio does it again with new sensational joining Manisha Koirala. Among all those films about Hindu-Muslim 1993 Riots i have seen, Bombay is perhaps the best work of Fiction included in real events. The topper of the list is none other than &apos;Black Friday&apos; which was a non-fiction project. Bombay is a story of an eccentric couple, a Hindu man marries a muslim girl against the restrictions of guardians and settles in Bombay city. Later, the Babri Masjid incident make Bombay go frantic and riot between Hindus and Muslims takes over. The fictional characters of the film tries to make themselves look more genuine and communal friendly in the first half of the film. The love story, married life and birth of childrens almost wastes the first half and then Bombay truly goes on Riot mode in last 40 minutes. Mani Ratnam gets almost everything right from situations to consequences to human emotions to communal harmony and humanity emancipation. Bombay is more clever and cleaner film than his &apos;Roja&apos;, i don&apos;t have any complaints about the screenplay and structure as i had with Roja. AR Rahman goes on to deliver another quality music album besides the fact that Bombay lacks patriotic and harmony theme song. However, all the songs in the Film are fantastic. Choreography of the songs is unexpectedly brilliant. Every song uses the situations and moments correctly. Arvind Swami proves his metal again and Manisha Koirala shines equally despite a normal and sober character. Her presence in the climax scenes feels less and that&apos;s where I want to bash Mani Ratnam, not her because it&apos;s not her mistake. Rather than calling it a Classic I would say, Bombay is morever a Social Classic and far more important film than all other films of it&apos;s time. Mani Ratnam made this film exactly on time when it was needed despite the slight fear of the controversies it could have created. I can feel how people would have reacted and accepted Bombay in 1995 because many Indian citizens were still in shock of the consequences of riots. Dialogues will give you Goosebumps. Bombay doesn&apos;t really fall short of anything in its genre but if i really have to ask for something more which was missing then it&apos;s more Hard-hitting and Burning Climax. The film doesn&apos;t have any character of Saviour who should have at least tried to stop these things, it just goes on an goes on without anyone even trying to stop or restrict it. The other missing thing as i told you Heroine&apos;s presence in the last moments is too blur. As a Director Mani Ratnam has made a Powerful Social Film that might have brought change in some people&apos;s evil thinking for sure. I have seen his 5 films till date (Roja, Bombay, Dil Se, Guru, Raavan) and Bombay is by Far his Best Film. This is not a Classic but little more than it.\n\nRATING - 8.5/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest",

      "reviewBody": "Joel McCrea stars as the outlaw Wes McQueen who makes one last train robbery in Raoul Walsh&apos;s exceptional and sprawling Western remake of his own &quot;High Sierra.&quot; As many commentators have pointed out, &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; is a major improvement over &quot;High Sierra&quot;, a better-than-average Bogart vehicle marred by John Huston&apos; tepidly moralizing screenplay. Walsh&apos;s breathtaking use of the landscape (especially toward the end) in &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; makes it more fascinating and exciting work. Walsh&apos;s heroes are often characterized by adventure. McCrea&apos;s Wes McQueen recalls such Walsh protagonists as Eddie Bartlett, George Custer, Gentleman Jim, Capt. Nelson, and Jeb Rand. They have a way of going too far. They are really existentialist heroes. Walsh&apos;s depiction of McQueen and his loyal bad girl&apos;s (Virginia Mayo) final descent into self-destruction is truly grim and pessimistic. Although &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; is devoid of the psychoanalytic verve of Walsh&apos;s &quot;Pursued&quot;(arguably his greatest Western), it is nonetheless a brilliant and memorable film that needs more following and appreciation."

No one understood the craft of film-making (silent or otherwise) better than Chaplin. He never compromised his artistic vision, perfectionism, or his integrity. Charlie literally made his films up as he went along, rehearsing on film and discarding whatever didn&apos;t work. Such techniques would prove too costly and time consuming today. This documentary consists of some of Chaplin&apos;s best experiments - some of which he re-shot and much of which he ordered burned. Like many a magician, Chaplin didn&apos;t want his secrets getting out. Luckily, many of his best tricks are revealed here for posterity. It&apos;s all lovingly narrated by James Mason. And the scenes that were cut from THE CIRCUS, CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES are as good as anything that ended up in the final releases. I wish this was available on DVD, as my tapes are beginning to wear out.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a surprisingly good film. Despite the mediocre quality of the visual animation it didn&apos;t affect the entertainment value of the movie not so much.\n\nInitially my biggest fear was seeing this cartoon sourcing or stealing ideas from all other existing cartoon films as I noticed some of the creatures had characteristics &apos;borrowed&apos; from the Madagascar Penguins, Powerpuff Girls and so forth. Fortunately, it had enough ideas, interesting elements and sense of humour (which was sometimes very lame in my opinion) to sustain itself.\n\nIt is a commendable effort from an unknown anime production house. The major flaw that I see is that the progression of the plot is not clean cut. Never mind the visual quality as of course I don&apos;t expect a film such as this to be of the same standard with blockbuster Disney/Pixar cartoons. But I feel the animators had squeezed in too many big actions at a very fast pace - even the dialogues got mixed up and confusing for the audience at times. As a matter in fact, the whole movie looked like a very messy party. Whether this was the intention or otherwise, I feel they had slightly ignored the importance to keep things a little less messy, and allow more focus on the plot that matters, which would have made this movie easier to follow and hence more memorable.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw this as a preview in London.\n\nI do not blame any of my fellow reviewers here for slamming this down as the worst horror film. Indeed it is, if you watch this expecting to be scared out of your wits.\n\nBut this is not that film. The marketing for this movie, though brilliant, is criminally misleading.\n\nThis is a movie with a very clever spin on the normal exorcist fare. What this turns out be is a fascinating suspense drama using exorcism as a narrative tool.\n\nI found the script to be very clever and entertaining. The main lead actor who plays the reverend is very charismatic and carries the whole movie. Admittedly, the movie would be half of what it is without his performance. The other actors, particularly the teenage victim who maybe possessed by a demon, are very good too.\n\nWhat I didn&apos;t like most is the very end. It felt tacked on for the sake of living up to its misleading marketing. I can honestly say that if the film ended 10 minutes earlier, I would have been totally satisfied with a complete film and was ready for the credits.\n\nHowever, there are attempts to make you jump out of your seat but unfortunately, these moments are too copy cat of the techniques used in Sixth Sense and similar. It may be effective to some but I feel it could have been done better and hence live up to the marketing hype after all! But those are small negatives. This is a movie very much worth watching, if you don&apos;t hate mockumentary style films. Lower your expectations, ignore the marketing and just enjoy a clever suspense drama. If you jump a few times, then think of it as a bonus.",

      "reviewBody": "At the strong recommendation of the panel of &apos;Le Masque et La Plume&apos; I went to see this film.\n\nI was struck by, as others have said here, the fraternity that existed between the priests. I thought the most interesting aspect of the film was the relationship between the priests. At times you can feel the tension because of the strong decision they had to make. Also it being 7-8 men living together it was interesting to see the different personalities in a group environment; you have the natural leader, the introverted, the brave, the scared etc.etc.\n\nI imagine like most people who&apos;ve seen this film the performance by Wilson Lambert was very touching. He was totally believable as the cloister&apos;s leader.\n\nUnfortunately the church is undergoing a very hard time in regards mostly to child abuse, it&apos;s nice to have a reminder of the positive aspects. I myself went to a catholic school with some Brothers and a monastery on campus. I have a very positive image.\n\nParticular favourite scenes are when they prepare and sell the honey at market and of course when they listen to Swan Lake and enjoy a glass of wine.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is about three immigrants from the wave of Russians with German or Jewish ancestry, of which many came to Germany between 1989 and 1993. Its simply ruined by the strange decision to let the three main actors speak in perfect high German and not do accents, which everyone coming from Russia I met at that time, had. In their suits they also look like modern hipsters. So they come off more as the annoying douchebags you can find in every bar in Berlin today. Maybe they thought it was &quot;racist&quot; to let these guys sound as if they were from Russia, but it s not fitting at all especially since this is kind of a time piece.\n\nEqually fatal is the decision to put Matthias Schweighöfer in the main role. His acting style is polarizing anyways (imagine a 30 year old man talking, grinning and gesturing like a child actor as Macaulay Culkin, but many think its &quot;sweet&quot;), but here it looks like he intentionally avoided to give his role any depth with his constant frolicking and grimacing. Unfortunately, despite its about three friends, he is in nearly every scene.",

They live in the rural &quot;North&quot; at the outbreak of the Civil War, raising 2 eligible teenagers (a boy and a girl), as well as a 10 year old boy. The emminent Civil War has the Quaker community divided on the issue of pacivism. Several &quot;older men&quot; in the congregation quickly turn coats, urging Cooper to join them in fighting the Rebels who plunder and burn Northern villages and kill women and children. When put to the true test, it is Cooper who proves to be the &quot;true Christian&quot;.\n\nA love story between the teenage girl and her soldier suiter is a beautiful bonus. The entire cast is excellent, and the timeless theme song by Pat Boone puts the icing on the cake. This is a 5-star classic. You&apos;ll want to watch &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; again and again.*****"

When Claude arrives at her home, Ann and Muriel become close friend of Claude, but Ann pushes Claude towards Muriel and they fall in love for each other. However their mothers propose a separation during one year without any communication between them to make them sure about their real feelings. But after six months in Paris, Claude is seduced by many love affairs and sends a letter to Muriel calling off their commitment. When Claude meets Ann in Paris later, they have a love affair; but Claude still has feelings for Muriel. \n\n&quot;Les Deux Anglaises et le Continent&quot; is a pointless and dull romance with a melodramatic triangle of love that recalls a soap-opera most of the time. The cinematography, sets and costumes give a beautiful reconstitution of the period; the gorgeous Kika Markham and Stacey Tendeter have great performances; but the excessive narrative of the obvious is irritating and the feature could be shorter. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;As Duas Inglesas e o Amor&quot; (&quot;The Two Englishwomen and the Love&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Rounders is I believe, one of the most widely underrated movies of our time.\n\nI first saw this movie as it was a &apos;bonus DVD&apos; thrown in for free with my DVD player back in 2000, so naturally I didn&apos;t expect much (as the other bonus DVD&apos;s were very mediocre), but what I found was a very enjoyable movie.\n\nAt that stage in my life, I had only played a little poker as a child growing up, and never &apos;Texas Hold&apos;em&apos; so to be honest, a lot of the terminology went &apos;over my head&apos;, but even so, the film became an instant favorite of mine purely because of the performances.\n\nThe film has so much star power, and yet none of the fine actors try to &apos;steal&apos; scenes. Damon, Norton, Malkovich, Landau ... and then the fine supporting cast of Turturro, Jansen, and Mol.\n\nIn fact, there is a scene with Martin Landau and Matt Damon that is perhaps one of the most beautiful performances I have seen in a long time between two very fine actors.\n\nSo even if you&apos;re not a poker player, the story is tighter than a lot of Hollywood &apos;pop fluff&apos; and the performances alone can sell the film as an enjoyable movie capable of multiple viewings.\n\nBut ... if you start playing poker and get really into what they are talking about, and reading about poker theory (like Doyle Brunson&apos;s book Super System) then the movie moves up to a whole different level.\n\nA lot of the time, Hollywood will attempt to cover a specialized error, and usually fail, or at best only partially succeed, whereas Rounders managed to get everything &apos;spot on&apos;, just look at the US DVD, it has a commentary track from 4 World Champion Poker players, if that&apos;s not a stamp of approval then I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nWhen you factor in how the film can be enjoyed by someone who has little to no idea about Poker (as I did when I first saw the film) just because of the tight story and stellar performances and also be &apos;immortalized&apos; by poker enthusiasts as the best movie ever made on the subject (and truth be told, a big reason why the World Series of Poker has been doubling it&apos;s entries year after year) ... what you have here is a true gem that works on so many levels and what I believe is, as I said initially, one of the most widely underrated movies of our time.",

The one liner&apos;s, particularly the one where the Russian says &quot;This time next week, I kill you dead&quot;, and just the crappy effects were enough to make this movie great.  My favorite part of this movie is when the giant chainsaw comes out of one of the robot&apos;s crotch.  I mean, come on.  How can they be serious.  And then you have the fat cowboy who is exactly like Joe Don Baker killing Chinese people.  It&apos;s great.  If you&apos;ve never laughed at anything, rent this movie, or if possible buy it.

      "reviewBody": "This period sex comedy is very tame by today&apos;s standards, actually even by, say, 1969&apos;s standards.  When the film was made, Europe just entered the period in which brief glimpses of female nudity (breasts and bunms) became acceptable in feature films.  The film even mocks the censorship restrictions by pulling a (painted) curtain whenever a couple is going into clinch, and claiming that it&apos;s a Napoleonic censor, i.e. contemporary to the story.  I reckon this was meant as a thinly disguised deliberate insult to the 1960s censor.\n\nThe film makes a half-hearted attempt at combining sex with romance; the actors in the romantic roles apparently did not have the strength to carry the film and so the romantic tanglings were kept short.  On the comedy side, the film isn&apos;t really a winner either.  The writing seems outdated, more like a 1950s comedy.  Some very good comedy actors such as Gunter Philipp and Oskar Sima are shamefully under-used and appear somewhat uneasy with the genre shift.  Only Jacques Herlin is a real treat.\n\nThe sequels to this film were slightly better (apart from the final film of the series which is awful).  They managed to create a more convincing combination of the comedy with the sexual shenanigans by getting baudy while being helped with less restrictive censorship.",

My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s only been three times) and she loves it too.\n\nIt is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in &apos;Love Actually&apos; brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.\n\nI live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why mess with the original?\n\nMy only problem with &apos;Still Crazy&apos; is that it wasn&apos;t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience.",

      "name": "NOT a comedy but still a great movie (satire is not dead!)",
      "reviewBody": "Satires are not always comedies, just like comedies are not always satires. Examples: &quot;Robocop&quot;, &quot;District 9&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;Stepford Wives&quot; ...these are all brilliant satires; yet they are not comedies.\n\nI think it&apos;s misleading for Pumpkin to be advertised as a comedy. Sure, it&apos;s packed full of subtle humour, but like the films I mentioned above, its intent is probably not to make us laugh out loud. Its intent is to give us an offbeat look at society without taking itself too seriously. So if you go into this film expecting something &quot;HYSTERICALLY FUNNY&quot; (says the Washington Post), you might be disappointed.\n\nAnother caveat: this film is not about disabled people--not like, say, &quot;Shine&quot; or &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. True, the plot is about a sorority girl who gets into an &quot;inappropriate&quot; relationship with a mentally challenged boy, but that&apos;s just a metaphor for what the film is really hitting us with. The film simply uses this metaphor to illustrate the screwed-up norms of human society. Pay attention early on to the speech Christina Ricci gives about how sororities &amp; fraternities end up dividing us, labeling us and creating differences where none really exist. I believe that encapsulates what this film is trying to tell us about our world, and you&apos;ll realize it&apos;s a lot more than just a romantic comedy.\n\nIn order to fully appreciate this film, you CANNOT take anything at face value. Everything ...even the wooden acting or the melodramatic pill scene or the exploding car (lol)... is designed to be over-the-top, showing us a bizarre world and giving a little wink to the audience. Almost every scene will have you wondering if the filmmakers were being ironic, and that&apos;s the beauty of unravelling a film such as this. It&apos;s very subtle but well executed, almost like Hitchcock&apos;s brand of humour in Strangers on a Train which, similarly, pokes fun at the veneer of polite society hiding the screwed-uppedness beneath (in fact, &quot;Pumpkin&quot; has a tennis scene that&apos;s reminiscent of the tennis scene in the &quot;Strangers&quot;).\n\nI&apos;m not sure if everyone will like Pumpkin but I sure did. If you&apos;re a fan of the 4 satires I mentioned in my 1st paragraph, I think you&apos;ll like it. If so, I highly recommend the Mexican film &quot;Casi Divas&quot; (2008) about a cut-throat talent competition, and the Spanish movie &quot;El Crimen Ferpecto&quot; (2004) about a man trapped in a department store overnight. Along with &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, these are light-hearted gems that make us think hard about the human condition. Oh don&apos;t forget &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988) which fits right in with the bunch, though a bit on the darker side.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a disappointment: I had expected something sophisticated along the satirical lines of Jean Renoir&apos;s THE RULES OF THE GAME (1939), given its backdrop of an aristocratic fete. Instead, we&apos;re treated to a pretentious drama  basically a four-parter in which the main characters are named after the respective actors playing them! It&apos;s also set on an island to drive further home the idea of an allegory  but whose point is obscure, with the stream of ambiguous and heavy-going chatter being interrupted only by the occasional lyrical moment (the film, at least, looks good)! \n\nInternational stars Michel Piccoli and Irene Papas appear as the elderly couple, while lovely Leonor Silveira (a recurring presence throughout the latter phase of Oliveira&apos;s career) is the younger woman and Rogerio Samora her jealous husband. They all try but are defeated by a meandering script  which eventually sees Piccoli expressing his love for Silveira: naturally, this gives rise to argumentswhich are brought to an abrupt end by a gust of wind that ruins the younger couple&apos;s garden party. Five years later, things resume at a castle where the two couples are newly gathered: as before, there&apos;s no happy ending in sight for any of the characters  plus nature puts in a disruptive appearance yet again by way of a downpour.\n\nHaving to do perhaps with the impossibly advanced age of the director himself, what I&apos;d watched of Oliveira&apos;s recent work prior to this had been imbued with a sense of calm meditation  which, unfortunately, has been replaced here by an unwieldy (and, frankly, tedious) rhetoric!",

Neumann) and good, nice, kind and well-principled young king (prince) who tries to make tender her calm heart to get married with her. After being refused (she&apos;s very capricious), he conclude to make her better. He start to work as a gardener at her castle (in secret) and successively bring she to her senses...The story continues when already reformed princess and the young king (she learn about his real identity later) have to take refuge from troops, that princess father (old king) has sent (of course he took a bad and mean counsellors advice). They have to take shelter by several ordinary and poor families, which are always very friendly and give them a help... Of course the tale has happy end.\n\nConsidering the fact that film was make in 1952 when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia was very rigid, you can feel a bit of labour ideals in the story (at the castle lives incapable king controlled by a mean counsellors, the well-principled people come only from &quot;extramural settlement&quot; and all are hard-workers exploited by aristocracy, the only exception is good king, but he&apos;s a worker as well - gardener - and his own serfs loves him...and so on). But there is no significant stress in this sense so the film remains dateless. The main thing that makes this film unique is fine film art and splendid story finesse with humour. It&apos;s the czech classical masterpiece and most favourite film in our film history ever (over 10 millions visitors in cinema so far - that&apos;s absolute record, the czech rep has 10 mil inhabitants today - and countless TV spectators), hardly could be overcome.",

      "reviewBody": "The decidedly miscast Paul LeMat here plays Charles Bigelow, a Columbia University entomology professor who tracks his odd-duck ex-wife Margaret (Diana Scarwid) to her old hometown, which is typical Smalltown, U.S.A. (She&apos;d left their daughter (Lulu Sylbert) with him and then disappeared.) Not only does he find it to be a strange environment (it seems to be stuck in the 50s), but the locals aren&apos;t exactly welcoming. A couple of WTF experiences later and he realizes that, in fact, the aliens have landed, and have kept this town in this state for a quarter century. He teams up with a tabloid journalist, Betty Walker (ever lovely and appealing Nancy Allen), and a supposed nut case (the excellent Michael Lerner) to take on the &quot;strange invaders&quot;.\n\nThis film was fashioned by director Michael Laughlin (&quot;Dead Kids&quot;) and his co-writer, Bill Condon (a future director, himself) as both a loving tribute to and parody of vintage science-fiction. In that respect, it gets its look and feel just right. It&apos;s often amusing, has its heart in the right place, and in this viewers&apos; humble opinion, actually has a fairly decent pace. The script isn&apos;t perfect; it does have some holes, but overall Laughlin and Condon did a nice job here. Having partly shot their film in Canada, it does have a delightful scenic quality, which is only enhanced by the widescreen photography. It also features some wonderfully icky and gross makeup and creature effects that are certain to have some more squeamish viewers going, &quot;Ewww.&quot; Best of all is the score by John Addison, which does a fine job of truly evoking the era.\n\nAs part of their presentation, Laughlin and Condon cast the film with some supporting roles and cameo appearances for performers from old time sci-fi: June Lockhart and Mark Goddard from &apos;Lost in Space&apos;, Kenneth Tobey (&quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, etc.). Cinemas&apos; original grumpy old man, Charles Lane, co-stars along with Louise Fletcher (playing a not-quite-on-the-level government agent), Fiona Lewis, a too briefly seen Wallace Shawn, character actor Jack Kehler (in his film debut), singer Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett, and Dan Shor &amp; Dey Young, the young stars of &quot;Dead Kids&quot;. LeMat is a rather bland hero, but Allen is luminous, and Lerner pretty much delivers the best performance in the thing. Condon has an uncredited cameo as a guy listening in a doorway.\n\nPerhaps the most value lies in trivia revealed by Laughlin on his audio commentary: at the time, he was young Sylberts&apos; stepdad; her real dad was the legendary Hollywood production designer Richard Sylbert, and her mom is Susanna Moore, the production &amp; costume designer on this film; Laughlin was involved with Moore when this film was made.\n\nPay close attention during an early scene to hear what may have been the first use of an R.E.M. song in a movie.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

The film actually lived up to the trailer, which made me want to see it.\n\nCole Hauser carried his role of Bo Laramie well.\n\nTom Sizemore oozed the right amount of SCUMBAG for the role, but that comes as no surprise to me.\n\nMy only real problem was the rather blatant lobotomy they gave Dennis Farina&apos;s character. Any detective worth his salt would&apos;ve instantly made Laramie the prime suspect when the photographers who nearly killed his wife and son turn up dead.\n\nProbably wouldn&apos;t buy it on DVD, but I&apos;d definitely see it again.",

      "reviewBody": "MORNING GLORY (RKO Radio, 1933), directed by Lowell Sherman, stars Katharine Hepburn in her third feature film and one she was born to play. The story involves Eva Lovelace (Hepburn), an aspiring actress from Vermont who comes to New York City in hope to get an acting job in the theater. While at an employment office, she comes across a veteran actor (C. Aubrey Smith), a theatrical manager (Adolphe Menjou), and a young playwright (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) who, at first, thinks she&apos;s &quot;daffy.&quot; Eventually, the leading lady (Mary Duncan) of the upcoming play walks out on opening night because the producer refuses to meet her salary demands. Then Eva, the understudy, is given her big opportunity to take her place. After her stage performance (which is not presented on screen), Eva steals the show and becomes an overnight success. Now in love with the playwright (Fairbanks), Eva comes to realize then and there that a career and a relationship cannot mix, which places her in a dilemma.\n\nWhile Hepburn won her first Academy Award for her performance here, I personally feel her role as Jo March in LITTLE WOMEN (RKO, 1933) was far better suited for her and should have gotten the award for that one instead. And like the character of Eva Lovelace, no one can be Jo March but Kate Hepburn. The story elements to MORNING GLORY does echo Kate&apos;s early stage origins. In spite of some scenes where she, at times, overacts, this is HER movie from start to finish. In a TV documentary on Kate&apos;s movie career, it was said that Constance Bennett was scheduled star as Eva Lovelace, but when Kate read the script, she saw herself as that character and got to play her instead. Kate is, however, convincing when she changes from naive youth to a mature woman. The movie includes some very witty dialog to help the story along. Great bit: The exchange between Mary Duncan and Geneva Mitchell outside Menjou&apos;s office, &quot;You&apos;ve gained.&quot;/ Response: &quot;I&apos;ll soon be your size, my dear!&quot; Another memorable scene is Kate&apos;s reenacting the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; balcony scene at a dinner party. Kate and Adolphe Menjou later appeared in STAGE DOOR (RKO, 1937) with Ginger Rogers, which improved over MORNING GLORY. Both have the elements of looking like a filmed stage play, but the 1937 production presented more characters and a plot that moved at a faster pace.\n\nMORNING GLORY, which was distributed on video cassette in the 1980s, first by Nostalgia Merchant and later through RKO Radio Home Video, played regularly on the American Movie Classics cable channel prior to 2000. MORNING GLORY was remade in 1958 as STAGE STRUCK with Susan Strasberg and Henry Fonda, but while both versions can be seen from time to time on Turner Classic Movies, it appears that MORNING GLORY happens to be the better known of the two.

      "reviewBody": "I hadn&apos;t heard of this movie until my parents told me about it, and we ended up watching it tonight. I thought it was pretty entertaining! It definitely &quot;feels&quot; like a 90s movie at times, and it can be a bit cheesy, but it doesn&apos;t really need to be anything more or less than that in my opinion.\n\nThe performances by Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep are great. I loved seeing Bacon play a bad guy, I don&apos;t know if I ever have until this point. The story is gripping mostly during the latter half of the movie, the intensity is turned up and there&apos;s a pretty solid payoff by the end of it. This movie would be too generic if it weren&apos;t for the river setting throughout the whole movie - it really added some memorable moments, and I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be forgetting this one.\n\nOverall, this was a fun time! It has everything that I&apos;d normally look for in a suspenseful/thriller, has likable cast members and throws a spin on a conventional drama, turning it into something memorable and worth giving a look.",

      "name": "Brad Davis leaves no Stone unturned in this hot LA police action flick",
      "reviewBody": "****SPOILERS**** Brad Davis, Johnny Modine, in a 1987 cop thriller set in LA with him looking for the killer of his dad Sam Modine, William Lanteau, and finds a whole lot more then he bargained for in the process. \n\nThe movie &quot;Cold Steel&quot; has the distinction of being the first and last film directed by Mario Puzo&apos;s, who wrote &quot;The Godfather&quot;, daughter Dorothy Ann Puzo. Being a first-time directed film it isn&apos;t exactly a modern Film-Noir classic or top-flight police action drama but it is quite watchable. The pacing by Ann does move the movie along with a number of shoot outs and an incredible car chase scene that ends up, in of all places, at a racetrack. The final scene in the film with Johnny having it out with the bad-guy in the movie Jonathan Banks, Issac the Iceman, and his mob at the new LA Police Headquarters construction site is a real thriller. The climatic and exciting scene is as good as anything that you&apos;ll see in films similar to &quot;Cold Steel&quot; like &quot;Die Hard&quot;. \n\nBrad Davis though very likable in his role as policeman Johnny Modine is a bit off when it comes to being a tough and expert law enforcement officer.You can forgive Johnny early in the movie when he&apos;s a bit too aggressive with a robber he arrested at a grocery store in the police station. It was days after his father was murdered and Johnny wasn&apos;t exactly interested in following the law by the letter where a person is innocent until being proved guilty, as well as him only being the cop not the judge and jury. But Johnny falling for Kathy Connors, Sharon Stone, who walked into his life, or bar, and practically threw herself at him should have been something that Johnny should have been very suspicious of. Johnny should have known that the drop dead gorgeous looking Kathy wasn&apos;t exactly interested in his striking good looks as well as his very refined social graces. Johnny was almost on the floor slouching on a chair at the bar drunk when Kathy first met him.\n\nIt later turned out that Kathy had a very personal reason to get to know Johnny and become very friendly with him, and it wasn&apos;t love at first sight, in order to set him up for the kill by Issac who murdered his father. Sharon Stone has a much broader range of acting then you would have expected her to have in a B-movie like &quot;Cold Steel&quot; and showed the talent she had back then, in 1987, that later made her one of the top ranking actresses in motion pictures that she later became.\n\nEverybody in the movie seemed to be really enjoying themselves in their roles and it showed on the screen with the film never bogging down and becoming boring. The big secret in the movie about Issac killing Johnnies father as well as Issac&apos;s connection with Kathy who&apos;s brother Eddie, Michael Warren, was a major factor in her allying herself with him. Kathy trying to kill Johnny was a bit strange and unusual but still interesting and did make sense, to Kathy at least. \n\nJonathan Banks&apos; Issac was a better then average psycho drug addicted killer but the idea of giving him a gang, when he would have been better as a lone killer, who&apos;s job seemed to be committing robberies to get money to buy Issac drugs was a bit far fetched to say the least. The reason for that was because he didn&apos;t want anyone to see his face! That&apos;s what Issac kept saying over and over in the movie. If anyone did like Johnnies father and the Fishman, Ron Karabatsos, Issac murdered them as if he were some very well known and wanted criminal who would be recognized by anyone as soon as they saw him! Yet both Johnnies father and the Fishman, who were killed by him, had no idea who the heck Issac was when they saw him! \n\nIt was sad to see Brad Davis in one of his last movies before he died of AIDS in 1991 and realize what a great talent he was and how many good films and theater performances he would have giving the public had he lived. The movie &quot;Cold Steel&quot; is a fair and modest action film but it didn&apos;t give Brad, who did the best he could with his role in the movie, the opportunity to show the public the fine actor that he really was.",

      "reviewBody": "Agustina of Aragón was a Spanish heroine who defended Spain during the Spanish War of Independence , first as a civilian and later as a professional officer in the Spanish Army . Known as &quot;the Spanish Joan of Arc&quot; , considered to be the saviour of Zaragoza , she has been the subject of much folklore , mythology , and artwork , including sketches by Francisco de Goya and the poetry of Lord Byron . Narrated in a long flash black in which Agustina arrives in the Royal Palace accompanied by General Torres (Jesús Tordesillas) . It starts with Napoleon (Guillermo Marin) orders his Generals to invade Spain but then occur insurrection in Mostoles , Bruch and Valencia . While Agustina (Aurora Bautista) goes out of Barcelona to Zaragoza to marry her fiancé Luis Montana (Eduardo Fajardo) who results to be an ¨Afrancesado¨ . But a pursued man accompanies her in the stagecoach . Before dying at a confrontation with a sadistic French lieutenant (José Bódalo) , he gives to her an important document she has to deliver to Lorenzo ¨El Pastor¨ (Fernando Rey) . Thanks to a brave Guerrillero called Juan (Virgilio Texeira) , she gets to arrive in her destination . Later on , the Zaragoza siege takes place and Agustina becomes a leader in the resistance . Then , the city of Zaragoza is really besieged by French troops and Spanish forces under General Palafox (Fernando Rey) are scarce . By the time of the siege , French army choked with vast numbers of refugees fleeing the advancing Grande Armée . In early June 1808 , the French began to advance on Zaragoza, which had not seen war for about 450 years and was held by a tiny provincial force under José de Palafox , whose heroism would come to rival Agustina&apos;s .\n\nThis is a remake to original film titled ¨Agustina De Aragon¨ (1929) by Florian Rey . The picture is divided in two parts : The first one is the best , being developed as an adventure movie and plenty of action and suspense . The second part deals with the Zaragoza siege , filled with successive battles and fights and it is packed with strong ideological charge . As in the fifties Spain was isolated from other other countries , suffering starvation and shortages similarly to the besieged people . The flick is marred by overacting , most of them play similarly to stage actors ; as the influence of the theater in players results to be extreme and embarrassing , specially by Aurora Bautista who gives a ridiculous and histrionic performance . The settings (Sevilla studios) are acceptable though mostly made in ¨Carton-Piedra (stone)¨ as well as matte-painting . Very good cinematography in black and white by Ted Pahle . And atmospheric score by Juán Quintero , including evocative songs and Aragon ¨Jotas¨ . The film is dedicated to ¨The sons of the Spanish Independence¨ . The motion picture was lavishly produced by CIFESA , the most known production company during Francoist period , that often financed these false but breathtaking historical spectacles , being professionally directed by Juán De Orduña at his best . With director Florian Rey formed the production company &quot;Goya Films&quot; . Juán adapted to cinema famous novels such as Zalacaín El Aventurero , Cañas Y Barro , El Frente De Los Suspiros , Nobleza Baturra , Lola Se Va a Los Huertos , being especially known for his historical renditions such as Teresa De Jesus , Alba De América , La Leona De Castilla , Agustina De Aragón and Locura De Amor . His most successful picture was El Ultimo Cuple with Sara Montiel . \n\nThe picture is based on historical events : As valiant Agustina (March 4, 1786 – May 29, 1857) uprising against the French and doesn&apos;t hesitate to lead the battle and even fire a cannon to stop the invaders when others escape . On June 15, 1808, the French army stormed the Portillo, an ancient gateway into the city defended by a hodgepodge battery of old cannons and a heavily outnumbered volunteer unit. Agustina, arriving on the ramparts with a basket of apples to feed the gunners, watched the nearby defenders fall to French bayonets. The Spanish troops broke ranks, having suffered heavy casualties, and abandoned their posts. With the French troops a few yards away, Agustina herself ran forward, loaded a cannon, and lit the fuse, shredding a wave of attackers at point blank range. The sight of a lone woman bravely manning the cannons inspired the fleeing Spanish troops and other volunteers to return and assist her. After a bloody struggle, the French gave up the assault on Zaragosa and abandoned their siege for a few short weeks before returning to fight their way into the city, house-by-house. With the human cost proving truly terrible on both sides and the city&apos;s defences hopelessly compromised, Palafox finally accepted the inevitable and was forced to surrender the city to the French. Despite the eventual defeat, Agustina&apos;s action became an inspiration to those opposing the French. After being captured, she was imprisoned and saw Eugenio die at the hands of her French guards. She subsequently mounted a daring escape and became a low-level rebel leader for the guerrilleros, helping to organise raids and attacks that harassed the French. As the strategic situation deteriorated for the French Army, her role became increasingly orthodox as supplies and training were covertly provided by the Duke of Wellington. Agustina began to fight for the allied forces as Wellington&apos;s only female officer and ultimately rose to the rank of Captain . According to some sources on June 21, 1813, she acted as a front line battery commander at the Battle of Vitoria under the command of Major Cairncross, who reported directly to Wellington himself.",

      "name": "It could have been Astaire&apos;s last film...",
      "reviewBody": "... but thankfully it was not. Having worked since he was a child, Astaire decided that he was tired and wanted to retire. He announced that Blue Skies was going to be his last hurrah. Fortunately for us, Gene Kelly had to bow out of Easter Parade and he managed to coax Astaire out of retirement to take over. Astaire&apos;s career was revitalized and he went on to perform into his 80s.\n\nAt any rate, here both male stars are in love with the same woman (Joan Caufield in this case). I like the pairing of Astaire and Crosby. Their respective talents play well off each other, especially in their &quot;A Couple of Song and Dance Men&quot; performance. There are so many songs that show up in Irving Berlin musicals that I didn&apos;t even realize were Irving Berlin songs. Crosby performs &quot;(I&apos;ll See You in) C-U-B-A.&quot; I must say that I prefer Desi Arnaz&apos; rendition. Crosby sang it too slow for my tastes. One of the supporting players, Billy deWolfe, was funny enough. However, I wasn&apos;t a fan of his shtick when he was performing sans Crosby or Astaire. He had one bit that went on for quite some time. He was portraying &quot;Mrs. Murgatroyd.&quot; I was surprised that his routine was allowed to go on so long since it was just not that amusing. I did some research and found out that deWolfe was a popular comedian in the day and &quot;Mrs. Murgatroyd&quot; was one of his popular characters. Knowing that information, it put his performance into context and it helped make sense out of the attention his act is given in the film.\n\nThe showstopping number was Fred Astaire&apos;s &quot;Puttin&apos; on the Ritz&quot; number. The rest of the film is average, but Astaire&apos;s number makes the entire film worth watching. It is fantastic and a complete joy to watch. The filming and special effects involved in this routine are excellent when considering the production date. There was also another rendition of &quot;White Christmas&quot; which is always enjoyable.\n\nOh, do notice that the lyrics to &quot;Puttin on the Ritz&quot;, which was written for the 1930 film of the same name, have been changed to remove any perceived racial elements. The original lyrics talked about well dressed African American servants out on their night off. The version sung here mentions people who are &quot;dressed up like a million dollar trouper trying hard to look like Gary Cooper&quot;. Not many people in 1930 would have known who Gary Cooper was. He was not a big star yet. At any rate, this film is where the change is first made.\n\nI&apos;d recommend it, but just don&apos;t expect &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;.",

      "name": "Impressive and dark swordplay film by Tsui Hark",
      "reviewBody": "Tsui Hark&apos;s Dao aka The Blade (Hong Kong, 1995) is an updating of the old one armed swordsman legend that also has been depicted earlier in the history of Hong Kong cinema. Tsui&apos;s new vision is something that dropped my jaws now that I watched it for the third time after many years and without remembering almost anything about it. The film turned out to be among the best Hong Kong cinema miracles from the nineties I&apos;ve seen so far.\n\nVincent Zhao Wen Zhuo aka Chiu Man Cheuk is Ting On and Moses Chan Ho is Iron Head and they&apos;re both very loyal to their master, an old monk who has teched them during their young lives. The film&apos;s narrator and lead female is Ling (Song Lei) who is secretly in love with both of the men but is not quite sure which one will be her loved one. Soon a violent murder takes place, a hand gets chopped off and revenge comes to mind, but none of the characters seem to care or think about their emotions but only to go after their insticts which in this case are mostly about violence and getting even. What follows is more or less (usually more) amazing imagery and bits of sword fighting from this unique film maker of East.\n\nThe film depicts people without the willing or ability to express their emotions and that&apos;s why many of the reviews seem to dislike the film telling the characters are very cold and inhuman. Of course the film would have needed an example among its characters of how a brighter life could be achieved but still the coldness and lack of expressing emotions is not there without its purpose because this is exactly the film&apos;s theme. The ending, the imagined happiness, is fortunately there but still I think there should have been more contrast to the characters&apos; inability to be like a feeling human being. This film is pretty pessimistic as it hasn&apos;t any happy or &quot;natural&quot; characters at all, but since we know (those who dare to accept these sides in themselves) what kind of a creature human being is, films like this start to make much more sense and force us to look at the mirror. Would you have gone to take revenge if you were in the one armed swordsman&apos;s shoes? \n\nThe visuals here are quite amazing and this belongs alongside Ringo Lam&apos;s Burning Paradise (1994) and Billy Chung&apos;s The Assassin (1993) to the Hong Kong&apos;s hyper dark martial art films that never are as near as &quot;light&quot; and also humorous as some Once Upon a Time in China (1991) for instance or other box office hits. Hardly any mainstream audience will like films like Dao because they lack almost every possible entertaining or pleasant element that can be found in Hong Kong martial arts films. The film is very dark and haunting especially when the guy has lost his arm and is training in agony in the misty and menacing house with hysterical female (this character is also very bad and should not have been so noisy and really brainless all the time) taking care of him. Again the smoke and darkness is something that I simply cannot mention having found in too many Western films.\n\n The action is so incredible it again makes me wonder how they edit their films like this. The editor in Dao is Kam Ma who has also edited John Woo&apos;s A Better Tomorrow films (1986 and 1987) among many others. The action scenes consist of many close ups and unconventional camera movements that create the kind of hysterical impact I can remember from Jackie Chan&apos;s Drunken Master 2 (1994) for example. The action goes even further in the final 15 minutes during the big fight when all the main characters finally get to take their mission to the end. This end fight is like the mind blowingly incredible finale in John Woo&apos;s A Better Tomorrow 2, choreographed by the great Ching Siu Tung: both of these finales get so over the top and (thus) separated from the rest of the film that it gets even surreal and thus makes the film&apos;s own world look even more impressive and striking and hammers the message and images to the viewer&apos;s head. The blood sprayed in these both cases is much more than just results of blade cutting flesh as it all depicts things from our main characters and their values much more effectively and graphically (to say the least) than words likely could. The finale in Dao is among the most jaw dropping scenes from any Hong Kong film of all time and once again these makers have shown their talent and capacity. Dao is not only very dark film, it is also very violent and has sudden bursts of very angry gore during the film and of course mostly in the mentioned last fight. Since there are no any real heros, no good characters and not too much sunshine in Dao, it is easy to expect that sadly this kind of film won&apos;t appeal to masses but considering that it starts to look even more valuable that films like these get still made despite that fact.\n\nDao also lacks all the possible stupid bits of dialogue that often can be found in Hong Kong films. The mentioned female in On&apos;s new apartment of course excluded. The film has some very effective silent scenes which is pretty rare in Hong Kong films I think. Especially the montage during On&apos;s painful training sequence is very effective as well as some of the scenes depicting Iron Head&apos;s unwillingness to use violence in the bar filled with drunken men. He just watches and tries to hold his temper and not hurt anyone. Details like these tell much more about the characters than any fastly and badly written unnatural words ever could.\n\nDao is a stunning experience even with its flaws and if they were corrected and fixed, this film would really be a masterpiece and maybe perfect of its kind. Now it definitely is a masterpiece of its maker, Tsui Hark, and it has the kind of potential and power that keeps on reminding the admirers of Eastern cinema of what makes these films so unique, precious and overwhelming. 8/10",

      "name": "a murder mystery and the gypsy lieutenant",
      "reviewBody": "The name of the murder victim found with a candle in his mouth suggests that he is an outsider in Hungary. The lead detective, Lieutenant Sapphire, is a gypsy, who despite being adopted and raised by &quot;regular&quot; Hungarians, has his nose rubbed in his minority status every day. His sidekick is Jewish, the prime suspect is another gypsy sleeping with the murdered man&apos;s wife, and for good measure, there are despised Romanians among the petty criminals and potential witnesses. These are some of the principals in Gabor Detter&apos;s brilliant examination of a society brimming with ethnic resentments, told within the conventions of a police procedural.\n\nThe murder mystery, however, is no mere excuse for some sort of sociological polemic about the tensions in Hungarian post-communist society. Rather, whatever we learn about the frictions between outsiders and &quot;real&quot; Hungarians as embodied by Kocsis, the precinct captain, emerges naturally from the investigation: the interrogations, the footwork, and the speculation among the cops, witnesses, and suspects. The lanky Lt. Sapphire, with his hangdog face, is as tough as any hardboiled American detective , but as he is also an Eastern European, he is emotional, loving, wracked by self-doubt, and in love with his vegetarian wife Eva, whose dirty talk is in English and who walks around in the natural as often as she can. And if the case were not complicated enough, why not shelter the teenage gypsy girl who had been sold by her own sister to the murdered man and is the subject of an intense search? Ultimately, &quot;Tableau&quot; is an exhilarating ride for all of its 120 minutes, containing a surprising amount of spoken English, an incredible number of scatological references, significant nudity, and terse, exciting dialogue that is translated into wonderfully idiomatic English subtitles. Also impressive is Detter&apos;s visual strategy between scenes, where he puts an extra jump into jump cuts by moving characters magically, an approach that pays off in a beautifully rendered final shot. As for his cinematography, look for a scene in which silvery, rustling tree branches become part of the interior space of the police car where Lt. Sapphire talks with teenage gypsy girl. The image is so perfectly integrated with mood, story and character that it will bring tears to your eyes!",

But if you like watching a movie that you can make fun of and groan at, then this is the movie for you.\n\nAs I was watching this I was thinking just how bad this movie was, but I kept watching to see what goof, inconsistency, bad line, etc. would come up next. And I was not disappointed.\n\nYou&apos;ve got stupid people running around in the desert and guns that never run out (almost never) of ammunition. You&apos;ve also got the chance of running into a radioactive rain storm, but only drive cars with no roofs. And much, much more.\n\nThis is a prime example that if you make the movie bad enough, but still entertaining, it will hang around for a long time.",

Sure there were plot holes, the dubbing was bad, the duck sounded ridiculous, those were part of the reasons I enjoyed it, simply because a logical movie doesn&apos;t play with my mind like this one did. Fulci deals with a lot of psychological issues and the areas of the unknown. There is enough unsaid that keeps you guessing until the very end (some which never gets said, but we won&apos;t go there). In my opinion, this movie had a faster pace and more solid plot than most of Fulci&apos;s more popular efforts. It was simple: someone who talks like a duck is killing beautiful women in New York. I did find it scary. Sometimes I&apos;m intrigued how they think up some of the things they did in this movie. Maybe it should be called &quot;The Amsterdam Ripper&quot; because of the extreme sex, violence, and drug atmosphere. But on the Anchor Bay DVD uncut release, the cinematography was amazing. I do love that this is an Italian movie filmed in New York, another totally illogical thing to do in my mind, yet on some level, it works for the sheer creativity and guts to do something new. No Academy Awards, but they sure don&apos;t make movies like this anymore! I&apos;ll give it 3 quacks out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Adults often don&apos;t try to watch kids movies, except if they have to, as their own children&apos;s company. And they find it to be punishment or wasted time. Often not without a reason. But Lepel is a movie that should be watched without prejudices, and it will give you a lot in return, on the adult level.\n\nIt is a movie about dreams, a dreams that can&apos;t turn to reality, analyzing limits how far can we go trying to live with or in them, and what are the compromises we make not to give them up completely, so at least a part of those dreams can come true.\n\nWe see a boy who dreams his parents will return home. They are supposed to travel around the world, that&apos;s what his grandmother tells him.. But she is abusing him; while he is dreaming about his mother he doesn&apos;t see or doesn&apos;t care for abuse and for obvious lies she is telling him. We see a shy salesman in love with his female boss, doing the best work to impress her, but afraid to say a word, let alone ask her for a date, scared to lose the dream he lives in. We see a woman, trained driver, working in a store and dreaming of going to Africa rally but aware that she, as a woman, doesn&apos;t have a chance to do it - and still she keeps on practicing. We see a teacher eager to have his pupil win the mathematics contest, ready to kidnap a boy, help abuser, cheat children, just to have his dream come true. We see a girl, victim of mother&apos;s abuse, who only wants to stay unnoticed for as long as she can, and never to have any mother again - but finding herself in situation to help a boy desperately seeking for one.\n\nAnd all the dreams will somehow be realized... but not a single in a simple way, without sacrifices and compromises.\n\nA scene where a friendly salesman helps boy in search for new mother, and more than a hundred women take part in interview, asks us unpleasant questions about family in today society, when many women offer themselves as (foster)mothers, but mostly for selfish reasons, ready to do and give only what the boy had in his previous dysfunctional family. And the only good adult female person refuses to be a mother, because today families and parenting are so complicated that she feels she is not up to do it. People who have heart and conscience are rare, and don&apos;t fit in our world.\n\nIn most children movies runaway kids have numerous adventures, they solve mysteries, find treasures, they are smarter than adults, go from peril to peril and nothing can happen to them. And if they have a company, police or secret services can&apos;t do anything to beat them.\n\nKids in Lepel are not superheros. Yes, Lepel runs away, but he doesn&apos;t go to distant country or desert island. He lives in neighbourhood warehouse. A crowded place where he can hide, but always in danger to be found. Yes, a girl helps him. A girl who also lives there, for a long time. Unbelievable? For a short while; but then we learn that a salesman knows she is there, he helps her all the time, hides her, prevents other people to find her hiding place. These makes the story almost realistic.\n\nBut a big flaw waits (as usually) till the end. Our older hero Max, salesman, is a lousy driver. But, to impress his boss who he is in love with, he drives a borrowed car so good that she takes him as a co-driver for the really race in Africa. And he drove so good only because a 8 year old boy (who also, of course, isn&apos;t a driver) tells him how to do it, using his knowledge of maths... So, goodbye driving instructors, all you need is a kid and in a few minutes you are new Schumacher or Loeb.\n\nOther than that, a film can be recommended to people who still have heart and conscience... and, let&apos;s hope, a family.",

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to thrillers, no film industry around the world has done even half as great a job as Cinema of South Korea has since the dawn of this new millennium. Inspired from a real-life Korean serial killer, The Chaser tells the story of an ex-detective turned pimp whose girls have been disappearing lately without clearing their debts, leading to financial losses in his business. While tracking back, he finds out that all girls had vanished after meeting the same client whom one of his girls is meeting right now &amp; decides to find him before it&apos;s too late, not knowing that the client he is dealing with is a sadistic psychopath.\n\nFor a film that presents such an expert level of craftsmanship in nearly every filmmaking department, it&apos;s even more surprising to find out that this is director Na Hong-jin&apos;s debut effort. He has filmed it amazingly well, kept it very grounded &amp; emotionally layered, portrayed imperfect characters perfectly &amp; retained the story&apos;s cruel intensity from start to finish. The screenplay also deserves a praise for the little humour its writers were able to infuse in the film&apos;s appalling nature. Cinematography &amp; editing set an ideal tone for its plot and the performances by its cast is very impressive, sturdy &amp; spectacular.\n\nBy approaching the story as realistically as possible &amp; paying extra attention to small details that most films skip over, The Chaser effortlessly manages to avoid falling into its genre&apos;s clichés. And for a film that has &apos;chaser&apos; in its title, it&apos;s astonishing &amp; heartwarming to see how brilliantly those chase sequences are executed by not giving in to silliness like absence of fatigue, leaping over a 10-foot wall etc. On an overall scale, The Chaser is a deeply unsettling, mercilessly violent &amp; unflinchingly brutal cinema from South Korea that paints a disturbing portrait of a serial killer while also making a subtle statement against the jurisdiction and, in my opinion, is one of the finest thrillers ever made.\n\nA genre masterpiece. Not for the easily distressed. Strongly recommended.\n\nFul review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

      "reviewBody": "Wanting a better life for his family, Keach enlists with the LAPD to supplement his wife&apos;s meagre income while he attends law school. But the job soon becomes all consuming leading to the breakdown of his marriage to Alexander whose support wanes in the face of constant neglect playing second fiddle to the force. In turn, Keach loses touch with reality whereby he questions his motivations for remaining in situ, but the job compels him to endure. After a litany of setbacks, alcoholic and facing ruin, he&apos;s briefly resurrected by Cash, taking pity on his misguided loyalty, and helping him to re-discover the purpose he once idealised. Rich, rewarding tale of an everyday struggle is told in a rather grim but entertaining fashion by accomplished director Fleischer.\n\nDespite solid performances from Keach and Alexander in particular, this is George C.Scott&apos;s movie, as the maverick older statesman with nothing but the badge to define his identity. His character is a scene stealer, and is at times, fierce, frightening, benevolent and ultimately, very bleak. The highly emotional scene in which Scott telephones Keach and relays the metaphor of the old man and his burglar, resonates throughout the remainder of the film, and beyond.\n\nThere&apos;s not the synergism that you&apos;d expect and if it weren&apos;t for the distinction that Scott, Alexander and Wilson as the modest rookie, each bring to their respective characterisations, &quot;The New Centurions&quot; would be just another police story, and this is evidenced to a degree when their characters are no longer in focus. A very capable and vast supporting cast bring a gritty reality, and the story ebbs and flows toward a sudden and unexpected climax. The anguish experienced by the characters is palpable, and every time the mood brightens, there&apos;s another catastrophe waiting. Probably not the movie to watch before joining the academy, but highly entertaining and thought-provoking nonetheless.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw Medea in college and was highly critical of it, finding it disappointing on almost all counts: terrible sound editing, cheap film stock, over bright lighting, bizarre, amateurish acting styles, inadequately edited, etc. Then there was the extended murder scene of Glauce and Creon going seemingly on forever, and then . . . wait; what&apos;s this? It&apos;s repeated all over again? Did someone get the wrong reel into the house?\n\nAnother ten years went by before I watched it again and after the second viewing, found myself emotionally drained, my jaw on the floor with the realization that I&apos;d just finished a film that alternately horrified, fascinated and astonished me.\n\nMedea is a grim, violent, film, minimally processed which only adds to its gruesome, wild rawness. This is Pasolini&apos;s Medea, not Euripedes and it is not easy viewing. Its wild, African/Middle Eastern score with the nasal bleating of women&apos;s voices in near pre-historic sounding rhythmic chant adds further to the element of being &quot;out there&quot; this film produces: This is about as far away from popular cinema as one can get. Medea doesn&apos;t easily compare to films of any other style or genre; not even with some of Pasolini&apos;s other work. But, if you can succumb to its hypnotic, mesmerizing pace at once both frenetic and static - you will realize this is as about as close to a hallucinatory experience one can achieve without the use of an illegal substance. Granted, not everyone wants that experience.\n\nAs Medea, Callas is simply amazing. Oddly, when the film came out she was roundly criticized for not being able to transfer the magic she so naturally gave on stage to the big screen. I will strongly disagree. The more I watch this film (which is probably several times a year for well over a decade), the more amazed I am by her performance in it. Where I, too, had first been critical of her languid weirdness, I&apos;ve grown to see her commitment to the role. I&apos;ve come to be riveted to her painfully expressive mask as she completely inhabits this character who is, quite literally, capable of everything (yes - everything is the right word here).\n\nWhere I was once critical of the lighting, I&apos;ve grown up to realize what Pasolini did; why he chose to film at the times of day he chose, and the resulting, fascinatingly brutal and surreal luminosity that bathes the entire film and the almost palpable sense of its visual texture. Stunning. The landscapes Pasolini chose to film in are as brutal and as vital as the characters of the tale. His near excision of all spoken text ( the screenplay is nearly dialogue free) brings us into a timeless, yet somehow ancient world where all is understood without the use of verbal communication. The savage, bloody rites of sacrifices for fertility and harvest initially seem barbarous then become somehow beautiful and fascinating. Then they make one cringe with the realization of how, not so long ago, this was us.\n\nA remarkable, savage and beautiful film."

We saw this movie at school, and everyone hated it. They said it sucked, because it was in black &amp; white, and the effects were hilariously bad!\n\nI disagreed! \n\nThis movie is nearly 80 years old, and it&apos;s still a hit!\n\nThe cinematography is incredibly beautiful. One of the greatest shots of all time is when Kong is on the top of the building! \n\nThe acting is fine.\n\nThe story is great, but my friends found it stupid. They thought it was unrealistic because there were dinosaurs and a giant gorilla on the island etc. \n\nThis movie is entertaining throughout the whole movie! Most black &amp; whites movies got a lot of dialog and long scenes with no editing, but not in this one! There are plenty of scenes in this movie where there are no dialog, but great editing and entertainment! \n\nThe effects are so fantastic! Young people may find Kong hilarious when they see a close-up picture of him. But I was absolutely blown away! Imagine that you&apos;re in 1933. You go to the movies and you&apos;ve never seen something like this before!\n\nKing Kong is a one small step for man. One giant leap for film making!\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is beyond criticism. Within its celluloid record there clambers cold history. The tanks are real. The planes are real. The people are real. This was a contemporary war movie to the actual war, without the layers of myth laquered by years of failing memory.\n\nUnlike recent high budget over-the-top productions and the copious blood spattering within, this little epic tends to mute the violence into the pathos of the moment of death. That being the death of heroes. And the emphasis appears to hinge on the suddenness, the randomness, and the tragedy of men dying hard. It is a stark memorial to the courage and sacrifice of the World War II soldier.\n\nAmazingly, and very much in contrast to most other war films of the period which demonized the enemy, this film provides a neutral texture to the foe. Here the German soldiers are but shadows on the cave wall. The stray Italian soldiers appear as comic sidekicks in the maelstrom of a nation at peril from two sides. The enemy appears to escape the moral condemnation that other films embraced. This is war and this is what it is by those who fought it.\n\nThe film describes the landings of an infantry platoon on the Salerno beaches in Italy. All of a sudden they are left leaderless as two of the senior officers meets a soldier&apos;s fate. The beach scene remains a descriptive detail of what a soldiers paradox in modern warfare was. They bring the war but they do not know where it is, where they are, whether the war will visit them, or what lies in front of them. Without the need for special effects the director garnishes the film with the fog of war skillfully.\n\nA startling moment is when the third ranking leader, a noncom sargeant succumbs to panic and shell shock. It is perhaps the kindest treatment of the condition ever presented cinematically during that period. The rest of the platoon appears to be supportive to the fallen insane sargeant. But the war goes on. They move on.\n\nRallied by a solid sargeant the platoon moves onto its objectives, a bridge and a farmhouse at a cost. The objectives are difficult and the angst of leadership and follower play the scene well. And unlike most war movies where heroism goes beyond definition, these heroes are all very much afraid.\n\nThe film has a solid core of young actors of the period. Dana Andrews, a very young Lloyd Bridges appear to anchor the cast. The black and white format suits this tiny epic. The cinematography, stunts are solid and consistently well done. It is a darkish film very much worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "Having never watched a Hong Sang Su film, I did not know what to expect as I tore the cellophane off of this DVD. After having watched this film, I am still not sure what to think of it. I was intrigued at first because I like novels and movies about writers, and the character Hyo Seob sums up what it is to be a struggling writer who at one point in his career was not only a successful writer, but also a university lecturer. However, it seems that although he is poor in monetary means he is rich in love. He in fact has two women who love him: A 24 year old former co-worker and a very attractive married woman. However, even with these strings of affection, Hyo Seob still loses control and repeatedly gets drunk which leads to not only physical harm, but also damages his already stagnate career. The only thing that seems to give Hyo Seob even moderately happy is that the married woman, Bo Kyeong, has ceased having sexual relations with her husband which gives him sole possession of at least that.\n\nBo Kyeong comes off to be a very unhappy woman. There is no affection between her and her husband and the only glimmers of light in her life centers around Hyo Seob, who is &quot;cheating&quot; on her with a young woman 11 years his junior.\n\nDong Wu, Bo Kyeong&apos;s husband, spends most of his time working. He tries to keep a cool facade, but a few times in the film his crafted mask breaks. Because he is no longer having sex with his wife, Dong Wu looks to prostitutes to fill his desires. While on one trip he has sex with a prostitute and does not use a condom which causes much tension throughout the remainder of the film.\n\nThe young woman who is dating Hyo Seob, in my opinion, is the saddest character in the film. She gives all of her love to a man, who although a tad affectionate, seems to think of her as little more than a vessel for his sexual desires and a proof reader. She works a number of small jobs just to make ends meet. Even doing voices for pornographic cartoons. One of the bleakest moments in the film is when she goes to see Hyo Seob on his birthday and Bo Kyeong is there. This scene ends with Hyo Seob slapping her viciously several times while she continues to state how much she loves him.\n\nThis is definitely not a light hearted film. It is quite heavy and slow, but quite poignant."

On the downside, the fight scenes are very badly choreographed, and I wonder why everyone in Scotland uses the same variety of sword, whether they&apos;re sailors, soldiers of the French king or elderly landowners, all with approximately equal levels of competence -- save O&apos;Herlihy who, although he looks to be at the same level, can defeat three other men.\n\nThe story is one that has been remade many times, from a major production by Edison in 1917 to a TV movie in 2005. Stevenson basically basically invented the Young Adult Novel with this and TREASURE ISLAND, and his youthful heroes, strong stories and exciting adventures have made him a favorite for movie-makers. Although there are better versions of this story (I prefer the superbly cast Disney version), there&apos;s little to complain of in this one -- I have, in my usual manner, already done so -- and MacDowall&apos;s performance is perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock&apos;s THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.\n\nThe story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan&apos;s remarkable sense of visual style. Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife&apos;s tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield. He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities. But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.\n\nThe small cast is extremely, extremely good. I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown a bit since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well. Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson&apos;s younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.\n\nWhat isn&apos;t flawless is the story. The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn&apos;t quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film&apos;s religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick. I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it&apos;s a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film&apos;s conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed. There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark. Entertaining nonetheless.\n\nGary F.

      "reviewBody": "Toys is a movie easily overlooked and dismissed as childish and nonsensical. Nothing could be further from the truth though, as it is a movie of surprising depth and style.\n\nThe first point that must be covered is the performance given by Robin Williams as Leslie Zevo. Although it is fraught with his almost trademark wackiness there is an underlying current of a man who is on the edge of coming into his own. The layers of the character he plays are subtly shown, as Leslie is a man who is strong, but unsure of his strength and covers that insecurity with comedy and whimsy.\n\nThe film is visually striking, a real art department tour de force, and is very much removed from any hint of the past at first glance. Looking deeper into the visuals however reveals the films deeper content of classic surrealist motifs, especially that of dismembered body parts and other parts separated from the whole. Partially assembled dolls, the parts of which come out of machines that are shaped as further separated body parts, are shown throughout. Alsatia lives in rooms within rooms that seem separated from the wholeness of houses, and indeed lives in a paper fold-out doll house herself, the reasons for which become quite apparent by the films end.\n\nThis aesthetic choice, combined with the toys vs. weapons juxtaposition makes the films textual purpose clear. Toys is a surrealist reaction to the end of the Cold War, in the very same vein as the original surrealists reactions to the end of the First World War. The film even makes several direct references to one of the surrealist masters, Rene Magrite, especially in the music video sequence. This places Toys in a very deep anti-war tradition, one that is expressed very openly in the entire premise of a General taking control of a toy company and turning it to military purpose.\n\nAny who would dismiss this film as merely childish surely owe it to themselves to take another look at this surrealist masterpiece and lose themselves in the quirky visuals and creative world that is placed on screen.",

      "reviewBody": "Na Young-sae was once touted as the best dance trainer in Korea, and was in contention for another trophy during the national dance competition, until dirty underhand tactics by rivals ruined it all for him. Seeking a comeback, his manager and him hatched a plan to import a foreign talent from China, Jang Chae-rin, to partner with him and reclaim his spot at the top.\n\nAlas, Chae-rin turns out to be the inexperienced teenage sister of the real mccoy, and Young-sae goes into a frenzy as the championships is only 3 months away. Reluctantly, and realizing the lack of time, Young-sae has no choice but to make do with what he has, and put his training skills to the test in turning a rookie into a professional ballroom dancer.\n\nThe storyline sounds familiar, like Dirty Dancing&apos;s, exploring the situational device of having a teacher and his protégé go through their lives together experiencing new found relationships through the language of dance. They start off awkwardly, and most of the time the plot focuses on the rigorous training in which Young-sae puts Chae-rin through. There is an unnecessary subplot though, of the marriage investigators who probe into the fake marriage between Young-sae and Chae-rin (that&apos;s the rouse used to get her to Korea), just to add to some laughs.\n\nDance has always been associated with passion, feelings and love. This movie doesn&apos;t stray from these themes, and the main leads heat up the screen with their sensual dance moves, albeit too little screen time. Just when you thought it&apos;s time for them to take on the championships and arch-rivals, the plot takes a twist, which I thought was probably an attempt to avoid being predictable.\n\nLadies might want to prepare your hankies for the emotional scene towards the end, where Young-sae and Chae-rin declares their love for each other indirectly at the marriage bureau. Extremely touching that, especially when you think back on their attempts to fabricate a fictional story on their relationship, which has taken on for real.\n\nIt is of course helpful that the two leads are eye candy. Park Keon-hyeong as Young-sae seemed to have the easier role of the mentor, snarling most of the time with a diva-ish, yet tender attitude towards his protégé. Mun Guen-yeong has the tougher role to flesh, transforming herself from simple naive girl into chic professional dancer, with a heart pining for Young-sae. The chemistry between the two is superb, and their dances together once they got their groove right, just magical.\n\nWhich of course brings me to my main gripe - I want more! But the attempt to make the story unconventional turned my request down, although the end credits featured a clip of them dancing, serving as some kind of compensation for the lack of dancing screen time. It&apos;s not the partner, but the partnership that mattered, said Young-sae. It rocked, and left me wanting more! Some might find it &quot;been-there-done-that&quot;, but I recommend this for those who which to get jiggy with it on the dance floor. I found myself tapping to the soundtrack as we get whirled around the ballroom, and I&apos;m sure ballroom dance lovers, or romantics at heart, will do the same too.",

Besides many familiar (and unfamiliar) monster heads, the film is a virtual who&apos;s who of American International Studio players from the 50&apos;s. One can almost suspect the movie was made to keep the contact players busy between films. If only Michael Landon had appeared as the Teenage Werewolf, I would have given it another couple points in the ratings. One also has to give the studio credit as the studio itself becomes the &quot;back lot&quot; for the film. And certainly, the plot of killing off studio executives must have appealed to all the writers, actors and production staff making the film.",

Now it won&apos;t win any Oscars, but it really kept up the Disney Tradition for being a clean and fun film. It was wonderful to see Kurt Russell on the screen again with Disney. The acting, again, not an Oscar performance out of anyone, was clean and sincere, very believable. The sets and special effects were, well, good. The diversity and conflict between students of the school, once again... good. There were some very witty and dry remarks about high school life as well. Good writing. I say the most surprising thing about this film was that it was just plain old fun! It had the patrons laughing as well as I. My 7 year old and my 3 year old loved it and it was still adult enough with a strong enough plot to keep the parents interested as well. All in all, it made for a fun afternoon.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a well written balanced and realistic look at a high powered working mom&apos;s life. There is enough humor to keep it a comedy and enough seriousness to keep in from being silly. Sarah Jessica acts here like Carrie as a mom and she is very likable and charming. I haven&apos;t enjoyed her roles in romantic comedies like Failure to Launch and Did You Hear about the Morgans, so it&apos;s nice to see her back in form. The supporting cast is well cast. Christina Hendricks as the best friend is lovely and this movie doesn&apos;t exploit her figure at all. It shows her face is really captivating and she should get more movie roles. Pierce Brosnan is quite good and suave as a big finance guy. Kinnear doesn&apos;t have a very demanding role. He looks younger than before and provides a decent support. Kelsey is good in his few moments as the big boss. The little girl wasn&apos;t very cute. Seth Meyers is quite good as the office ass. It&apos;s definitely not a long SATC episode. Overall a watchable and very pleasant movie especially for SJP fans and for families with working moms. Makes you appreciate the burdens of a career woman with a family more."

But as Marine, I can&apos;t tolerate an over-aged, fat, Stacy Keach wearing a beret (Marines don&apos;t wear berets and are not fat.) as a Marine Corps 4 star General. If all you want are a bunch of explosions, then this may be the movie for you.(notice the obvious pre-built artillery simulator pits dug in the sand on the beach landing) I&apos;ll say one thing, though, this Christian Boeving actor is on par with Arnold and can speak English.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a magnificent adaptation of David Guterson&apos;s acclaimed book.  Scott Hicks took on a gargantuan task in attempting to make the book into a film, not only because it was so powerful and well received, but because it was so lengthy and daedal.  The result, however, was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.\n\nThere were really three stories intricately interwoven into one.  The main story was the trial of a Japanese American for the murder of a fisherman who owned the land wrongfully taken from the accused&apos;s father.  The other two stories provide insight into critical events affecting the trial.  The first involves the childhood love affair of local newspaperman Ishmael (Ethan Hawke) and Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), who is now the wife of the accused.  He has uncovered information that can aid the defense, but his resentment for having been jilted by Hatsue stands in the way of his bringing it forth.\n\nThe second ancillary story is the persecution of Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants during World War II.  We see depictions of hatred and bigotry, as law abiding Japanese citizens are shamelessly herded into internment camps.  This seething animus serves as the psychological backdrop for the trial, which occurs in the early 1950&apos;s when the memories of the war and lost loved ones is still fresh.\n\nFrom a directorial and cinematography perspective, this film was nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is a cinematic work of art.  Between Hicks&apos; brilliant camera perspectives and Robert Richardson&apos;s beautiful lighting and earth tone coloring, the film was resplendent in powerful and stirring images.  Many were so artistically done that if made into snapshots they could easily hang in any art gallery.  Each shot was meticulously thought out.  Many involved complex shots through windows, silhouette backlighting, elaborate blocking, and scenes where actors, props and camera were all moving in different directions to create fabulously fluid perspective shots that slowly unfolded to revealed the scene&apos;s full content.\n\nThe editing was also fantastic.  I have seen comparison&apos;s between this editing and The Limey&apos;.  While there is some similarity in technique, this was far more elegant and flowing, whereas `The Limey&apos; was jumpy and disconnected.  This style of editing was absolutely necessary to adhere to the book&apos;s non linear format.  Hicks needed to insert scenes that explained the feelings and motivations of the characters, and the only way to do this was with flashbacks and jump cuts.  Despite the fact that such editing is disconcerting to a large majority of viewers, it was an artistic decision that was exactly right for the story, and seamlessly done.  The same is true of the audio overlays with monologues of characters superimposed on one another, giving great power and emphasis to certain of the characters&apos; lines.\n\nThe story itself, with all of its components, was engaging and well crafted. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to develop more of the characters. The scenes depicting the herding of the Japanese out of their homes for relocation were chilling.  The courtroom scenes were realistic, not forsaking court procedure for dramatic effect, as is so common nowadays. The love scenes were sensitive, romantic and passionate without the need for sexual explicitness.\n\nFrom an acting perspective, this was more of an ensemble production.  All the actors gave wonderful performances, especially Youki Kudoh, who was torn between her love for Ishmael and her loyalty to her family and traditions. Kudoh was so emotionally involved with the part that she actually began crying during the featurette when recalling one of the scenes.  Screen legend Max von Sydow was also fantastic as the aging defense attorney fighting and pleading for justice amidst the racial hatred.\n\nThis is a beautifully crafted film with a compelling story.  It is a filmmaking 10/10.  It has unfortunately not found a wide audience since its strongest elements are not areas of mass appeal.  For the refined viewer who can appreciate filmmaking as an art, and enjoy an intriguing but deliberate story with exquisitely woven subtleties, this film is a delight.  For those who prefer Hollywood&apos;s movie success formula of fast paced linear stories with lots of violence, profanity, clever one liners and raunchy sex, this film will bore them to death.",

      "reviewBody": "Carter Page III (Woody Harrelson) is effete, witty, charming, full of himself and full of ripe, juicy, trenchant commentary on the Washington social scene and its denizens. He has to be - it is literally his life. Carter is what&apos;s known in Washingtonian parlance as a &quot;walker&quot;. He squires about the rich and powerful wives of the rich and powerful men on the Hill, whenever they require a male escort to attend dinners, benefits and other social gatherings. You know - the ones their husbands would rather jump off a building than attend. And because Carter is a bonafied &quot;Friend of Dorothy,&quot; there&apos;s none of that pesky bother of having to worry if he&apos;ll climb into the wives&apos; beds, the way he slips so smoothly into their confidences. \n\nBut somewhere between the glittering parties and the bon-mot laden games of canasta, reality bites in the form of a brutal murder; the victim being the lover of one of Carter&apos;s &quot;special friends.&quot; Ever the dutiful confidante, Carter covers for her without realizing exactly what he&apos;s letting himself in for, especially when the connections he thought he had begin to dry up and wither like the flowers on a table from a party that ended years ago. Though he literally has spent his life putting the &quot;art&quot; into artifice, Carter must now look beyond the boundaries of his superficiality and that of his so-called friends and acquaintances, if he wants to save his own hide. \n\nThe &quot;outsider looking in&quot;, even if he is part of the world that holds him at arm&apos;s length is one of director Paul Schrader&apos;s favorite themes; one he has visited repeatedly, whether he served as a writer (TAXI DRIVER), a director (AUTO FOCUS) or both (AMERICAN GIGOLO) as he does here. As he explores it yet again using the country&apos;s seat of power as his landscape, he is certainly served well by an outstanding cast. \n\nHarrelson&apos;s acting has never been as subtle and yet powerful as he inhabits Carter, rather than just playing the character. Kristin Scott-Thomas radiates beauty and desperation as his friend-in-trouble, and the ensemble is well-rounded out by Willem Dafoe as Scott-Thomas&apos;s husband; the regal presence of Lauren Bacall; Lily Tomlin in a very restrained mode as a power broker&apos;s wife; Ned Beatty as her husband, Mary Beth Hurt as another one of Carter&apos;s &quot;canasta&quot; group and William Hope as an extremely unpleasant Attorney General who is very reminiscent of a certain Mr. Spitzer. \n\nSpecial mention must be made of Moritz Bleibtreu as Emek, Carter&apos;s German-Iranian boyfriend and the only person who really stands by him when the designer crap hits the fan, and has nothing to gain from it but his partner&apos;s love. (Well, there IS the matter of finding a gallery to exhibit his politically-charged photo art, based explicitly on the the Abu Ghraib scandal). But kudos to Bleibtreu for matching Harrelson as they modulate the complexities of their relationship without falling back on the usual stereotypical tics and camp flourishes. \n\nWith the lush production design and costuming augmented by the oh-so fitting songs of Brian Ferry (which Anne Dudley&apos;s nearly ambient score is based upon), THE WALKER is a pretty film to look at and be taken in by...as pretty and alluring as Carter is himself. Until you discover - as he himself does - that underneath all the trappings, the wealth, the elitist vanity is a void, where friendship, compassion, love, fidelity...not a single one of those things really exists. The movie isn&apos;t so much about him solving the murder mystery that hangs over him like the Sword of Damocles, but the &quot;mystery of his own life&quot; - finding all of those things he traded in for life among the political elite.\n\nNot a light and frivolous way to pass the time, much like most Schrader films. In fact, many viewers might turn it off before getting halfway through. But the Oscar-worthy work from Harrelson is definitely worth sticking around for.",

Gerard Depardieu is a great actor who&apos;s not afraid to try all sorts of roles, only they show the true human nature. This film moved me. very deep and although I did not have much of respect for Vanessa, in this film she proved herself to be a good actress. I got very moved by two songs and I&apos;ve been surfing on the film site and others in order to find them. I just saw the film recently on YV and did not have the time to register the title and the artists. The first song is showing for a very short while 2 musicians and a little girl in the metro, starting to sing a wonderful (Romenian?)song. The second is when Depardieu is on the beach, at night, drinking down his pain, while the music is crying on the tape-recorder he brought with him. An italian song, I should think. Please, help me to find the right songs and their interpreters. you&apos;ll make me very happy. I was so moved. I&apos;d love to know if the music is on Cd or if the artists have their respective CD\n\nFriendly greetings from Claudine"

      "reviewBody": "I watched Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s DOWNHILL (1927) starring Ivor Novello. I thought this was a fascinating film although it&apos;s not very well regarded.\n\nNovello plays a wealthy Oxford student who stupidly takes the blame after a vindictive waitress points him out (his father is rich) as her seducer. The real seducer is his friend, but he takes the blame, assuming it will all blow over. But he gets expelled and sent home where his father pitches a fit and calls him a liar. Novello storms out of the house.\n\nCast into the cruel world, Novello must find his own way. In a brilliant sequence, following an intertitle that announces &quot;make believe&quot; we see a well dressed Novello holding a cup of coffee, but as the camera pulls back we see that he is holding a tray and serving coffee to a flashy couple (Isabel Jeans, Ian Hunter). Well at least he has a job! But then as the couple heads to the dance floor the camera pulls back again and we suddenly realize that, as the couple starts dancing, they are on a stage. The audience comes into view and a line of high-kicking dancers races out onto the stage.\n\nJeans turns out to be a selfish woman involved with Hunter. There is never enough money. Novello becomes a hanger-on until he receives a telegram with news about an inheritance. Jeans quickly marries Novello and starts spending freely. Time passes. Jeans and Hunter are sitting in a lavish bedroom. She&apos;s endlessly sitting at dressing tables, admiring herself and her jewels. Novello comes home and find a pile of bills, an overdrawn notice from the bank, and Hunter in the closet. The apartment is in her name and he&apos;s thrown out into the cruel world.\n\nNext we find Novello as a taxi dancer in Paris. He seems to have a &quot;manager&quot; who sells his dances and possibly more. While he dances we see a middle-aged age woman (Violet Farebrother) sitting at a table. She can&apos;t take her eyes off him. She arranges for an introduction. He babbles away, telling her his sad story while her eyes frankly devour him. Amazing sequence. But as morning dawns and the blinds are raised, Novello finally see this tawdry world of drunks and dissolutes and once again goes out into the cruel world to Marseilles.\n\nSick and broke, Novello is saved by a pair of sailors and put on a ship back to England after they find a returned letter. Do they think there will be a reward? During the voyage, Novello hallucinates and relives his past accounts with all the horrid women in his life. This is a beautifully done scene. Finally he arrives home.\n\nI cannot think of another film from this era where the male is the societal victim and who, through nobility, suffers as he descends to the depths at the hands of women. Novello is actually playing a twist on the many Ruth Chatterton roles where she follows this sort of journey to find redemption and/or death. Along with The Lodger, this may be Ivor Novello&apos;s best film performance.\n\nAs for Hitchcock, there are many great scenes here and lots of symbolism as Novellos is seen on escalators and elevators going down, down, DOWN."

If you know what kind of genre I am talking about, you will know what to expect from this film.\n\nThe cast is multinational, where pretty much everyone is a stereotype to some extend. Or described using the basic characteristic features from a particular nationality. The plot usually involves a small crew (even on a huge spaceship) coming across some alien creature and having to fight for survival. In this case, the enemy is a Russian android infected by some unknown virus (that&apos;s never really explained). It&apos;s a pity that Frank Zagarino (a.k.a. the Shadowchaser) only gets a limited screen time and barely uses his martial arts skills. The rest of the cast is OK, especially Musetta Vander is easy on the eye (even though her fake Russian accents is terrible).\n\nThe part I have always liked about these films is that the producers use any factory they can to stand in for the spaceship/space station. It&apos;s simply hilarious. So get yourself some popcorn and some beer and enjoy. I know I will :)",

      "reviewBody": "Jamie Lee Curtis&apos; older sister Kelly is front and centre here as she plays Miriam Kreisl, an expatriate American schoolteacher working in Frankfurt, Germany. One day she nearly runs down an elderly, weird stranger named Moebius Kelly (genre veteran Herbert Lom, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;), who passes away after she brings him to her house to recuperate. From there, even nuttier things begin happening, starting with the discovery of a catacombs beneath Miriams&apos; own house. A handsome young doctor named Frank (Michel Adatte) sympathizes with her, and attempts to help her unravel the mysteries now abounding in her life.\n\nWritten by director Michele Soavi along with his producer / mentor Dario Argento and Gianni Romoli, &quot;The Sect&quot; is noteworthy for some very slick, stylish, accomplished filmmaking. This is supplemented by a screwy plot where, for a while anyway, you&apos;re not exactly sure where all of this is going. The ultimate diabolical plans for Miriam automatically call to mind another horror classic that has clearly inspired &quot;The Sect&quot;, but that won&apos;t be mentioned here. And this plot is helped along by some genuinely interesting and compelling horror film imagery; viewers may be pleased by the various squirm-inducing (although not necessarily gore-oriented) effects set pieces. Among the elements incorporated are a hallucinogenic insect inserted into a nostril (!), Miriams&apos; sweet but magical pet bunny, who at one point does some channel surfing (!!), and a Manson-type Satanic cult leader named Damon (Tomas Arana, &quot;Gladiator&quot;).\n\nThe film eventually goes on a little too long to be completely effective. The subplot with Miriams&apos; friend Kathryn (Mariangela Giordano, &quot;Burial Ground&quot;), for example, isn&apos;t all that necessary. Still, it&apos;s hard to deny the overwhelming, crazed atmosphere of &quot;The Sect&quot;, enhanced by an excellent score by always-reliable Pino Donaggio (&quot;Piranha&quot; &apos;78, &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; &apos;80, &quot;The Howling&quot;).\n\nThe performances are all reasonably good, with sexy Curtis creating a likeable lead character. Italian film veterans Giovanni Lombardo Radice (&quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot;) and Donald O&apos;Brien (&quot;Zombi Holocaust&quot;) also appear, but it&apos;s the magnetic Lom and the effectively creepy Arana that leave the biggest impact.\n\nHighly recommended to fans of Spaghetti Horror and director Soavi.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

For example: &quot;dying&quot; Turkish fighters watch peacefully the continue of the battle, they look around after being boiled by hot water and jumping down (at the wall climbing), fake Gypsy dancing for long minutes without any reason. But it was the last big Hungarian film. The original story is perfect with its heroic historical content and romantic events, which would be interesting for a foreigner too. A modern adaption would be a good idea, but the present Hungarian film makers weren&apos;t able to do as good film as the story would deserve - I think.",

Maybe it is only the sin to be part of different periods and our victorious pragmatic perspective.\n\nA film about opened and closed wood doors . The dance of a chimpanzee and a pink poodle , few drops of Fellini and a lost, again and again, bag. And, sure, the way to Caracas."

(In much of the third world today, municipal dumps are inhabited by poor people who scavenge trash to make their living. It wasn&apos;t that long ago that the same was true in the US, by the way. In the late 1800&apos;s the NYC dump was home to a population of desperate scavengers too.) Kurosawa does his usual brilliant job of creating a full spectrum of characters, except that here most of them are damaged and dysfunctional. Kurosawa is loved for his portrayals of honor, courage, and heroism. Some find it more difficult to appreciate his unblinking examination of loss, failure, wickedness and despair. This film lays bare some of the dark corners of the human heart, and presents the full spectrum of human reality, warts and all - but with an emphasis on the warts.\n\nIt&apos;s not a dark film nonetheless. These tragic blighted lives are shown with zen clarity and humor. We see a cross-section of human psychology, both good and bad, and the genius of Kurosawa makes it clear that each of us share the feelings and foibles of these Tokyo dregs.",

Astaire and Burgess Meredith play rather over-aged students (Fred Astaire a &apos;young man&apos;??) who play in a band called the Perennials, a college band who start to take all the bookings from more established outfits like Artie Shaw&apos;s, thanks to their enterprising manager Goddard.  Naturally both are competitive and want both to be in Shaw&apos;s band and get off with Goddard.\n\nYawn.  Artie Shaw and his band appear and play great music, although he was no actor - you&apos;d think all those dumb movie star brides would have taught him some tricks of the trade ... Goddard doesn&apos;t look the part and her role doesn&apos;t seem right for her.  Charles Butterworth also appears as a lousy mandolin player who finances a big concert for the band.\n\nFairly enjoyable despite the shortcomings but no great shakes when up against Fred&apos;s best work with Ginger."

Despite all their impressive skills and accomplishments, they&apos;re denied a promotion in the agency as a result of blatant nepotism. Still determined to make their mark, and much more importantly to upstage a pair of rival agents, they intervene in a mission to travel to a mysterious island and retrieve a sophisticated thingamajig that could be a potent threat if it falls into the wrong hands. Engaging sequel is far less cheesy than its predecessor, has a much better story, and lots of imaginative visual effects accompanied by exciting, cliffhanger action scenes. Overlong, and still corny at times, but has just enough of the right ingredients to entertain all audiences. ***"

But I have to say my jaw expressively saying is &quot;dropped to the ground&quot;. Why doesn&apos;t anyone really do information background checks anymore. First of all I am a Jehovahs Witness, and yes I know many people that had gotten themselves in a similar situation. But what bothered me of this movie was its overall portrayal of my faith. I don&apos;t want people to think Im a sect. And guess what I am EDUCATED. Isn&apos;t that a twister. I have mine in arts, but enough about that. Why doesn&apos;t anyone ask Jehovahs Witnesses what they do. Yes, we don&apos;t have a goal of materialism. But we do need to support ourselves &quot;HELLO!!!&quot; To be honest all my friends have degrees! whether its in Arts, Teaching or Medical. We have them all in fact I was going for a degree in RN too. So maybe in Denmark they don&apos;t research too much because I am a full time Pioneer and I own my own Business! My faith didn&apos;t stir me to be apprehensive in accomplishing that. Like the girl sadly displayed! I&apos;m offended...BIG TIME."

      "reviewBody": "From what I gather, &quot;Knightriders&quot; didn&apos;t do very well at the box office when it was released. Upon watching it, it&apos;s easy to come up with plausible explanations for this. While the poster seemed to promise wall-to-wall action, there isn&apos;t that much of it, and what action there is often becomes monotonous. The movie tries to do so much that many of the plot threads feel unfinished at the end. And of course, the unbelievably long running time - 145 MINUTES!!!\n\nYet at the same time, I can&apos;t really call this a BAD movie - I would lean more to calling it &quot;misguided&quot;. That&apos;s because as problem-filled the movie is, there are some good things about it. The actors give their characters a lot of heart - Brother Blue is especially good. (And I thought Savini actually wasn&apos;t bad in his role as well.) While the action scenes become monotonous, there are some impressive stunt sequences. The medieval-style music score fits like a glove. And there are some moments that are just *perfect*, the best being the opening sequence. \n\nIf you do watch it, I recommend that you split up your viewing into several sessions, so that you don&apos;t become too bored by how the movie keeps, well, spinning its wheels. There&apos;s a great movie hiding in there - perhaps with a lot of work (and a little magic), it might one day be successfully remade."

      "reviewBody": "***SPOILERS*** German movie about a masked killer in and around the English castle of Blackmoor who&apos;s out to avenge his fathers murder by the future Lord Lucius Clark, Rudolf Fernan, who lives there. \n\nThe killer who&apos;s father Charles Manning was Clark&apos;s assistant and good friend in the British colony of Kimberly in Africa, where Clark was the district governor, was murdered by Clark who stole over 6 million in pound sterling worth of uncut diamonds that his father had. What the killer doesn&apos;t seem to know is that Clark is really his father, which was brought out at the end of the movie. But there seems to be some disconnect here with the killer when it&apos;s revealed that he came upon a batch of love letters by Clark to his mother Bettie Manning that he found hidden in the castle! the guy couldn&apos;t put two and two together? \n\nEarly in the movie we see that Clark is having the stolen diamonds cut by his creepy butler Anthony, Dieter Eppier, who used to be an expert diamond cutter until he was sent up the river for five years for stealing diamonds from his employer. Clark is secretly sending the diamonds hidden in cigar tubes to the owner of the &quot;Old Scavenger Inn&quot; in London Mr. Travish, Hands Nielson, who&apos;s fencing the hot diamonds by paying Clark in cash for them. \n\nWhat both Clark and Travish as well as Clark&apos;s lawyer Mr. Tromby, Richard Haussler, doesn&apos;t know is that the killer has someone working at the &quot;Old Scavenger Inn&quot;, his wife, who&apos;s tipping him off about the transactions. At one point in the movie he ambushes Clark&apos;s delivery man with the diamonds who happens to be his gardener Sebastian, Albert Bessler, killing him and taking the stones. \n\nWhat the cagey Clark is doing is getting rid of the diamonds so that the killer can&apos;t get his hands on them and giving the money that he gets from Travish to his niece Claridge Dorsett, Karin Dor, as stated in his will on or after her 21th birthday. The masked killer is determined to get the diamonds or the money that Clark gets for fencing them before she does even if it kills her. \n\nInteresting German 1963 import that has you guessing to who the killer is until he&apos;s dredged out of the swamp outside Blackmoor Castle at the end of the movie and his identity reveled. &quot;Strangler of Blackmoor Castle&quot; is a bit too violent for movies released back then in those days in the early 1960&apos;s with a number of shocking and bloody decapitations that are really gruesome even watching the movie now. \n\nThe film does have some comic relief in it with the lord of the castle Lord Blackmoor, Hans Reiser, spending all his time listening and recording on his portable tape recorder bird love calls in the woods.",

Ruben carefully builds a creepy atmosphere, relying on brief glances, moments of silence and quietly expressive performances (especially by Julia Roberts) to help the viewer understand that, behind the image of a perfect couple, something is really wrong. Unfortunately, after Roberts escapes from her husband, the movie turns into a strictly by-the-numbers thriller, where you can predict almost every development of the script. It&apos;s a visually polished movie, though, and the very good performances give it a strong psychological center that keeps it above-average.",

      "reviewBody": "What an odd movie to pop up on my list of recommendation on Prime. The cast is excellent (I&apos;ll watch anything with Daniel Craig), but the ensemble is amazing. The precis presented by Prime is incorrect -- the young woman returning to the monstrosity that is the Hotel Splendide is the former lover, not the sister, of the chef, and this change turned what I thought might be a quirky comedy into a rather dark but still lively exploration of what happens when the dead refuse to die. The atmosphere of this film is somewhere between Grand Budapest Hotel and Amalie -- I definitely feel the shades of Jeunot and Caro flitting about -- but the revolution which occurs is quintessentially British -- low key, strange, and ultimately enlightening.",

      "reviewBody": "The flick deals with a respected house of style (managed by Eva Bartok and Cameron Mitchell) where happens several bloody murders and gruesome executions . A diary seems to implicate about anybody fashion models are dying . Then the diary disappearing originates a real massacre of the remaining fashion girls . An inspector (Thomas Reiner) investigates the strange killings with numerous suspects (the usual baddies Franco Ressel and Luciano Pigozzi or Alan Colins , Massimo Righi , among others).\n\nBava&apos;s second great success (the first was ¨Black Sunday¨ or ¨Mask of Demon¨)is compellingly directed with startling visual content . This frightening movie is plenty of thrills, chills, high body-count and glimmer color in lurid pastel with phenomenal results . This is a classic slasher where the intrigue, tension, suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room, corridors and luxurious interior and exterior . This genuinely mysterious story is well photographed by Ubaldo Terzano and Mario Bava with magenta shades of ochre , translucently pale turquoises and deep orange-red .\n\nThe movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre , Bava (¨Planet of vampires¨, ¨House of exorcism¨) along with Riccardo Freda (¨Secret of Dr. Hitchcock¨ , ¨Il Vampiri¨) are the fundamental creators . In fact , both of whom collaborated deeply among them , as Bava finished two Fedra&apos;s films ¨Il Vampiri¨ and ¨Caltiki¨ . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color in shining red blood , usual zooms and utilization of images-shock . Later on , there appears Dario Argento (¨Deep red¨, ¨Suspiria¨,¨Inferno¨), another essential filmmaker of classic Latino terror films . Rating : Good, this is one more imaginative slasher pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style throughout a story with magnificent visual skills.",

This suspense thriller lacks both suspense and thrills. The films hackneyed script by Preminger&apos;s no talent progeny just barely surpasses the ham-fisted direction that Otto delivers.Perhaps he let his son direct most of this movie too. It certainly looks like the work of a complete amateur. Unlike many of his other failures, which are at least interesting to watch, this film has no redeeming value at all. The first problem is the way the film plods along. At times we just wonder if this story is ever going to get moving. Secondly, all of the somnolent actors look like they are lost and confused. Finally none of the characters we are suppose to be sympathetic towards deserve are sympathy. They seem either banal or puerile. Is it any wonder Mitchum turned down this stinker!",

      "reviewBody": "In The Films Of Frank Capra Citadel Film Series and in his memoirs, Frank Capra described Platinum Blonde as a film that Columbia did strictly as a moneymaker, no messages of social significance that would be found in his later classic work, just a nice girl-boy-girl comedy. Still and probably because Robert Riskin did some of the dialog I found plenty of things that would be instantly recognizable in Capra&apos;s more well known films.\n\nThe Platinum Blonde is of course Jean Harlow and this film title gave her the title she would have the rest of her short life. She&apos;s a society girl who sweeps reporter Robert Williams off his feet and into marriage much to the chagrin of her formidable dowager mother Louise Closser Hale. \n\nSomeone else is chagrined as well, Loretta Young who was only 18 when she made this film. Loretta and her sisters added a few years onto their ages in order to work back then. Loretta plays one of Williams fellow reporters who is known only by her last name of Gallagher. Just like Jean Arthur was known as Saunders in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. Lots of similarities between the two though Arthur&apos;s character was far more sophisticated than Young.\n\nStill Platinum Blonde more closely resembles Mr. Deeds Goes To Town. Williams is like Gary Cooper trapped in that big mansion. Only it was Cooper&apos;s own mansion that he inherited. Robert Williams is in on a pass and on a kind of probation so to speak, to see if he can adjust to life among the idle rich. In 1931 lots of people would have liked to have been given the opportunity.\n\nThe only one in the household he strikes up some kind of friendship with is butler Halliwell Hobbes. Note the echo business with them, it would be repeated in Mr. Deeds.\n\nThe week Platinum Blonde was released with reviews acclaiming Williams as a new star, he died of peritonitis. What an incredible loss, he was an actor with a breezy insouciance just like Robert Montgomery or William Haines over at MGM. He probably could also have done parts at Columbia that James Cagney was doing at Warner Brothers. Williams could have been Harry Cohn&apos;s first major star of the sound era. Anyway his comic timing was perfect and he steals the film from those two movie legends who were his leading ladies.\n\nYou&apos;ll also like Reginald Owen&apos;s portrayal as Harlow&apos;s family attorney and general busybody. Williams also deals with him in the way Gary Cooper ultimately dealt with his shyster.\n\nPlatinum Blonde is one of Frank Capra&apos;s best early films and watching it will make you sad though when you see Robert Williams and you will agree that he had a brilliant career ahead of him.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the remarkable elements about this improbably interesting, intelligent and engaging fictionalization of the Jack the Ripper story is the fact that the amazing Klaus Kinski is not the only reason the film held my interest. Basically, this is a rather graphic horror film with a lot of perverse sexuality (all of which is too disturbing to be interesting from any prurient perspective). Yet this is not Jesus Franco&apos;s standard garbage, but rather an interesting Freudian interpretation of Jack the Ripper, which deviates far enough from the actual historical facts to allow for a few surprises along the way.\n\nThe cinematography is generally good. The editing and pace are decidedly unamerican, and will turn off mainstream audiences. the film proceeds at a steady pace, but features dialog which is more oriented toward driving the plot than elaborating the characters. The cast is pretty uneven, but strong support comes from Menkopff, Chaplin and Fux. Kinski&apos;s role, though not much of a challenge for him, is interpreted with the great actor&apos;s usual intensity. The sets, though not particularly London, and a tad anachronistic at times, are detailed and enjoyable in their own right.\n\nWhat the film does successfully - and again, it&apos;s not all Kinski - is to create a tense and disturbing atmosphere, punctuated with occasionally graphic scenes of sexual and bloody violence. Along the way, the director presents an interpretation of Jack the Ripper which is straight out of Freudian pop psychology. The effect is powerful, and the film is memorable. Perhaps Franco&apos;s best work, though I&apos;ve not seen them all (for good reason!)",

      "name": "Ravioli Western with a prolific Italian director and two main actors from Spaghetti   : Steffen and Berger",
      "reviewBody": "This is an exciting film , plenty action , thrills , fights , and starked outdoors from El Lacio , Rome . This violent Western is set on dirty outdoors and dark interiors , the star is a mysterious revenger, ¨a man without name¨ , who comes to avenge against nasty villainous . It deals with an avenger named Davy Flanagan (Anthony Steffen), a war veteran and nowadays a Northern defector . Without memory , he gone back from a dark past to revenge his own death . He hasn&apos;t records and arrives in a small town , a location dominated by violent gangs and nasty gunfighters as Dirty (Mario Petri) . In that place there is a dangerous band led by a bandit called Crazy Joe (Fortunato Arena) and his hoodlums . There he meets a judge (William Berger) who tells him his unknown wife Liza (Ida Galli as Evelyn Stewart) is newly married a tough gunslinger named Clay Hackett (Robert Hundar) . Flanagan is wanted , as posters publicize : reward ¨10000 dollars , Dead or Alive¨ . As Davy being pursued and chased by bounty hunters , as he is detained but he get escaped .\n\nOffbeat Western follows the Sergio Leone wake , as it is proceeded in Spaghetti models . It&apos;s a moving western with breathtaking gunfight between the protagonist Anthony Steffen against the heartless Mario Petri and Fortunato Arena , in addition a stirring ending fight in the saloon and town square . This movie is a lot of fun to watch . It&apos;s an entertaining story with a touch of peculiarity , some great roles , and an amazing music score . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge , as a tough man seeks vendetta and his objective results to be a bloody revenge . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare , but what makes this movie stand out is its style . Steffen is appropriate in his usual character , he ravages the screen , shoots , hit and run and kills . The picture is well starred by Anthony Steffen . Acceptable action sequences with rousing attacks and spectacularly realistic battles . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , Anthony Steffen is good as Flanagan . Anthony Steffen may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados, but in his day, from the mid-&apos;60s to the early &apos;70s, Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics . The handsome, Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz de Teffè von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there, Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre , where he found his niche . Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood, however, Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction .His acting is often accused of being wooden, but in many manners is ideally suited to playing the steely-faced gunslinger synonymous with the genre . His others successes include features as ¨Seven Dollars to Kill¨, ¨The last Mohican¨, ¨Train for Durango¨, ¨Gentleman Jo¨ , ¨Four dollars for Django¨, ¨Shango¨, ¨Arizona colt¨, ¨Apocalypse Joe¨ and several others . Although Steffen&apos;s performance in the movie is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character . There appears as secondaries the habitual in Italian Western and Peplum , such as Robert Hundar , Raf Baldassarre , Luis Barboo , Eleonora Vargas , Alberto Dell&apos;Acqua , Jean Louis , among others .\n\nThere is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , such as in the final gunfights . The movie gets the usual Western issues , as avengers antiheroes , violent facing off , exaggerated baddies and spectacular duels , excessive zooms , among them . Good production design creating an atmospheric but poor scenario , and fine though rotten sets . The musician Robby Poitevin composes a nice soundtrack in Morricole style and well conducted , this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie; as it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background . The soundtrack contributes tremendously to the atmosphere of the film, including an emotive leitmotif, the music score is perhaps the best part of this film . Striking cinematography by Enzo Barboni ; however , being necessary a correct remastering .\n\nMario Caiano&apos;s direction is well crafted, here he&apos;s less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and packs too much action , but especially this thrilling Western contains long shot&apos;em up and violence . He directed this decent western , genre in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of the rest of his career , as he directed several Spaghetti : ¨Brandy¨, ¨Avenger of California¨ , ¨Ringo, face of revenge¨ , ¨Bullets don&apos;t argue¨, ¨Lone and angry man¨, ¨A train to Durango¨. Caiano is a craftsman who has directed all kind of genres as Peplum as ¨Ulisse vs Ercole¨, ¨I due Gladiatori¨, ¨Maciste Gadiatori di Sparta¨ and Terror : ¨Nightmare castle¨, ¨ Eye in the labyrinth¨ and even Pornonazi as ¨Nazi love camp 27¨. Although Caiano couldn&apos;t be deemed an &quot;A&quot;-list director, his movies had a professionalism and a verve that many of those made by his fellow B directors lacked . This is a passable though muddle and uneven Western but will appeal to Spaghetti aficionados . Rating : 6 , riotous Western in which there&apos;s too much violence , action and enough excitement",

The performance of the young actors is very good and realistic, the camera-work is beautiful. It&apos;s entertaining and exciting for children but still emotional and nostalgic enough for adults. The music, for my taste, does a little bit to much sometimes and some scenes feel a bit constructed, but the whole feeling and atmosphere make up for it. I especially liked the love story.\n\nOne of the best German youth/kids movies of the last years! It&apos;s a shame it didn&apos;t do so well at the box office but its success at festivals is well earned.",

Jimmy ( Wesley Snipes - And no early 90s urban thriller is complete without Wesley Snipes )loses a friend in the course of duty and the audience instantly know that these two unconnected characters will tie in with the plot somehow - And they do in a script that while not being the most tightly plotted screenplay you will ever see since there&apos;s a few too many characters involved is at least undemanding and easy to follow .\n\nOn the style front it&apos;s not exactly in the same league as HEAT but probably contains more substance than an episode of MAIMI VICE while we also get to see an early supporting role from Viggo Mortenson . I rate BOILING POINT six out of ten",

      "reviewBody": "I went to see this movie because it was advertised as having Argentine tango in it. I am a tango dancer and I was completely blown away by it. But even so let me emphasize that this is not only a movie for tango dancers. I spoke to a non-tango dancer right after the showing and she was equally fascinated. But since this was the reason I wanted to see the film, I choose the tango angle to comment on it.\n\nIn this movie tango serves as a metaphor for how people communicate and &quot;meet&quot;, in the truest sense of the word. But apart from this Argentinian input it is very French in so far as it has all the significant qualities of a typical French flick: long takes, close-ups, much silence, and intense but subtle emotions -- mostly all of the above at the same time. And altogether quite conducive to the tango content, much more so than an American production could have achieved I daresay.\n\nAll throughout the 20th century the Tango and France, especially Paris, have formed a lasting, passionate bond, a love affair that feeds both sides and still prospers. Tango is everywhere in Paris. It&apos;s as much part of the upper middle class culture as going to vernissages is. It is useful to know this, otherwise one could wonder how the main protagonist Jean-Claude Delsart, a middle-aged, very reclusive marshal, could so easily end up on the floor of the tango studio across the street from his office.\n\nThe way Argentine tango is portrayed in this movie is gracefully true to the soul of tango. It has only one &quot;flashy&quot; scene, a performance by a professional tango couple and as usual with public tango performances, I find this one of its weakest moments: pure form and posture, completely void of feelings and emotions.\n\nBut the important scenes in the studio do capture aptly what is so fascinating and endearing about (the mastering of) this dance: the carefulness and timidity in a beginner&apos;s approach toward his or her partner&apos;s body; the subtlety; the listening; the addictiveness of the intimate atmosphere; the beautiful, beautiful music; the gradually growing confidence and freedom; and\n\n\n* sometimes, eventually - the passion.\n\n\nTango can, at times, have a quite positive and joyful air about it. But its origins have much more in common with what the Portuguese call &quot;fado&quot;. A melancholic mood, full of heartache and longing, with the heaviness of reality weighing down on minds and souls that are capable of enduring deep sorrow and intense passion.\n\nThis is what the movie is about. &quot;Je ne suis pas là pour être aimé&quot; could be translated as &quot;I do not exist to be loved&quot;. A stark, even cruel normative statement that is the point of departure for Delsart. The rest is a journey and, no, I will not tell where it ends. The story as it evolves is sometimes almost unbearably sad and yet the protagonists keep on living through it. The dance isn&apos;t over until the last note is played.\n\nThe tango metaphor works extremely well with this story and does so until the end. Compared to other &quot;tango movies&quot;, this is one of the better ones. Of course, nothing beats Sally Potter&apos;s &quot;The Tango Lesson&quot; - but what could.\n\nThe only reason I don&apos;t give this movie full marks is the fact that some of the plot turns are a bit too predictable. But nevertheless, this is an engaging story well told, well made, with extraordinary characters. A modern fairy tale -- or maybe not?",

Before the movie, Todd Solondz himself wished that we would enjoy this &quot;fable/fairy tale&quot;. Though this movie has fable like qualities, I wouldn&apos;t suggest showing this movie to a kid unless you were interested in destroying the kid&apos;s morale. Every character in the movie is malignantly realistic and I lost count of how many times I put my hand over my mouth and shook my head trying to decide to laugh or scream. &quot;Palindromes&quot; has a totally unique way of looking at abortion, pedophilia, individualism, family and parenthood through the points of view of these well developed characters. Though we may not have wanted to experience these point of view, the character&apos;s acceptance of their own realities makes the viewer take another look at their reality.\n\nI think this is a great movie for people with daughters. If this movie doesn&apos;t make you want to be a better parent then I guess there is no hope after all. Well, I&apos;m finally closing in on 200 words, I could have definitely stopped after saying &quot;people had to laugh because if they didn&apos;t they would have to cry.&quot;",

Patrice Leconte is no slouch either and he has moved on light years from &apos;Les Bronzes&apos; and turned out a string of intriguing, offbeat, enchanting and excellent films, indeed, his track-record is the equal of any of the great post-war French film makers (and totally eclipses, it should go without saying the pretentious pairing of Godard and Truffaut)and with illustrious names like Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Cornau, Claude Sautet, Bertrand Tavernier, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, and newer kids on the block in the shape of Ann Fontaine, Daniele Thompson, Agnes Jouai, Zabou, etc, that is saying something. Here he turns in a very tasty offbeat entry and finds in Michel Blanc the perfect leading man to convey at one and the same time a sense of isolation and inner strength.  This is a film in which most, if not all the characters have an agenda.  The lazy cop just wants to nail the sad son of a bitch who he considers perfect patsy material just because he chooses not to socialize with his neighbors.  This is now a crime? Alice, the subject of Hire&apos;s open voyeurism is anxious to keep suspicion from falling where it should, her own boyfriend, but such is the quality of Sandrine Bonnaire&apos;s acting (she turns in an equally offbeat and ambiguous performance in Leconte&apos;s latest film, &apos;Confidences trop Intimes&apos;, currently on release)that we can&apos;t be sure that she doesn&apos;t REALLY fancy Michel Blanc&apos;s essentially colorless Hire.  Hire himself is not interested in diverting suspicion from himself, as he could so easily do, as protecting Alice, with whom he has fallen in love, from both the indifference of her boyfriend (which, natch, she can&apos;t see) and the repercussions should he (Hire) talk to the gendarmes.  The only jarring note in fact is the aggravating Michal Nyman grating sounds that pass for music in his circle of pseuds. Pity I couldn&apos;t rewrite that to read Jarre-ing notes, had Leconte had the good taste to hire Maurice Jarre, or indeed, ANYONE bona fide musician. That cavil to one side this remains an absorbing film, not perhaps quite eclipsing &apos;Panique&apos; but certainly fit to stand beside it. 8/10"

The cast is international. The lead character is Paris which is a little odd. He always struck me as a bratty teenager. Of course, that&apos;s not the Paris in this movie. They are making him the hero and the Greeks as the villains. It&apos;s love against the world. I don&apos;t buy it, but that&apos;s what they&apos;re selling. The dialogue is a bit stiff. It&apos;s trying to be a Shakespearean tragedy. On top of that, the production is big. It&apos;s huge in fact. It&apos;s an old Hollywood epic in that sense. They really have ships and war engines. They have some big sets. They have masses of extras. It&apos;s very big and the battles are big. Whatever flaws this has, it&apos;s worth it to see all the construction and destruction.",

      "reviewBody": "I personally rank this film, based on William Faulkner&apos;s last novel, among my favorites. Not that I would rank it as a &quot;great&quot; film, but it&apos;s a lot of fun. It&apos;s true that McQueen may have been in fact older than his character was supposed to be, but his attitude and style seems to bring it off. Mitch Vogel, as the young boy Lucius, who is lured into stealing his grandfather&apos;s (Will Geer) new Winton Flyer automobile for a wild weekend in Memphis by Boone Hoggenbeck (McQueen) is completely believable as a kid who wants the adventure, but has to be drawn into it because he respects his grandfather so much. Rupert Crosse as McQueen&apos;s other reiver (thief) in this caper adds an extra comic relief as the one who gets them into a real fix in Memphis. Ordinarily I hate movies with running narration, but the narration in this by Burgess Meredith as the grown old Lucius, remembering his exciting weekend in Memphis, adds a real touch of poignancy to this tale of youth lost. Additionally, Sharon Farrell as McQueen&apos;s prostitute girlfriend, Clifton James as a vicious southern sheriff, and Juano Hernandez as a kindly old black farmer add real dimension to the film. Throw in a beautiful score by John Williams (his first film score) and you&apos;ve got the makings of a warm, charming story, accurately drawn, from the turn of the century. The scene at the film&apos;s end, where the grandfather has a heart-to-heart talk with the boy, is wonderful, and very &quot;authentic.&quot;  The director, Mark Rydell, did a terrific job. I&apos;ve seen this movie many times, and it never fails to entertain me."

This time, Buddhist Bai Yun (Shun Lau) and his disciple Fong (Tony Chiu Wai Leung) try to transport a golden Buddha idol across town, getting themselves hounded by thieves and then taking shelter at the haunted Orchid Temple. There, Fong encounters Lotus (Joey Wang), a female ghost at the evil bidding of the Tree Devil (Siu-Ming Lau), awakened 100 years after the events of the first film.\n\nThis sequel&apos;s story is more in line with the original film, having a traveling leading male character meet a beautiful female ghost at the Orchid Temple, who&apos;s spirit is binded by the evil Tree Devil. But, this movie is still fresh nonetheless, with it having a fast-paced plot, chock full of crazy magic spells and action sequences, seductive and spellbinding female ghosts, hair-raising demons and non-stop adventures. There is also a touch of humor, drama and romance, following the tradition of the previous two films. The female lead is once again played by Joey Wang. Although a different character, the ghost she plays in this sequel is a touching throwback to the first film; Wang portrayed all three different characters from each of the three movies with ease, charm and uniqueness.\n\nThis film has another beautiful music score composed by James Wong and Romeo Diaz and crazy special/visual effects galore! The acting by another memorable cast was great, albeit a tad goofy sometimes. And, the breath-taking scenery and period costumes were a treat - very colorful and vibrant. Hats off to Producer Hark Tsui and Director Siu-Tung Ching for putting together such an awesome and timeless trilogy in all three films! Overall, this sequel holds up well on its own. Like the first sequel, this film does not surpass the original Chinese Ghost Story (some scenes are rushed, some drag on too long a bit), but is still very entertaining and fun - one of the greatest sequels I&apos;ve seen.\n\nGrade A",

At least, it&apos;s the first horror movie that made me cry...of laughter! So, if you want to see a good,Norwegian horror movie, this is not the one you want to see. see &quot;Villmark&quot;(Dark Woods) or &quot;Fritt Vilt&quot;(Cold Prey) instead.(But no-one of them scared me so much either...) The only horrible with this movie, it&apos;s the fact that it was ever made!!!\n\nDON&apos;T BUY IT! DON&apos;T RENT IT! DON&apos;T SEE IT!",

      "reviewBody": "The Pitch: It&apos;s like looking in a mirror, only not.\n\nThe Review: Juliette Binoche has had a career spanning nearly thirty years, and for much of that has jumped between roles in her natural language and English. You might think that, with the supposed paucity of good female roles in movies, that there&apos;s not much left for Binoche to cover that she hasn&apos;t before, but here she gets to explore some new territory to Cannes best actress award-winning effect. In the process, she gets to cover a range of languages, not only English and French but Italian, but in this case there is a specific purpose to the variances of the language.\n\nThe set-up is simple: William Shimell plays James Miller, an British author on a tour of Tuscany where his work on originality in art has been better received than in his homeland. Binoche is the woman who comes to hear his talk, and the two are then drawn together in a discussion of his work. Once the two meet again, the course of the movie charts their discussions over the course of an afternoon, taking in the Italian countryside and engaging with a number of characters along the way who cause them to reflect on their differing viewpoints on Miller&apos;s work.\n\nThere&apos;s a turning point as we approach the halfway mark where one of those characters seemingly mistakes the pair for a married couple. What starts as a role play, set off by the misunderstanding, takes on more and more aspects, and eventually both the pair and the audience are lost in the drama. The whole movie reveals itself to be an intricate construct on this concept, almost every aspect of the theme, the performances or the setting playing with the motif of originality versus imitation. Reflections in car windows sometimes obscure the actors themselves, POV shots ask us to engage directly in the drama almost as a participant and this even extends to the leading pair themselves – Shimell is a renowned baritone, not an actor, and there is a slight but noticeable difference between his performance and that of Binoche, which almost feels like a copy of acting rather than being fully immersed in the role.\n\nWhile this reinforces the concept, it does prevent the audience from fully engaging, being kept slightly at arm&apos;s length by the constant artifice. That&apos;s not to say that there&apos;s not a lot to enjoy here, with the confusions and the tensions making this verge on a romantic comedy at times. Despite the differences in acting ability, Shimell and Binoche make an engaging couple at times and as time wears on, you find yourself more keen to believe that the beginning was the illusion and that their relationship is real and not the copy. Much of the credit for this must be placed at Binoche&apos;s door, using the language differences to vary mood effectively, but also adding colour and emotion in all of the languages she uses. The only one here who&apos;s on familiar ground is director Kiarostami, who&apos;s explored these themes before but never to such mainstream effect – worth checking out if you&apos;d like to engage your mind and your heart.\n\nWhy see it at the cinema: There is a very literal aspect of the visuals which runs throughout the course of the movie, which the cinema screen will allow you to fully appreciate.\n\nThe score: 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Retreat&quot; is a three-hander, starring Thandie Newton, Cillian Murphy and Jamie Bell (although there is one other character with a brief speaking part). Kate (Newton) and Martin (Murphy) have gone off to an island retreat to regroup after Kate miscarries; they return to a solitary cottage on a remote island where they had been happy years earlier, thinking it might help their relationship. But Kate is withdrawn and Martin doesn&apos;t know what to do, and the whole thing might not have been a very good idea after all. One day, they stumble upon Jack (Bell), an injured military man to whom they are quick to offer shelter. Unfortunately, the generator in the cottage has shorted out, and the CB radio seems not to be working, so when Jack tells them that a fast-moving and lethal air-borne infection has been sweeping the world and the only way to protect themselves from it is to barricade themselves inside the cottage, they have no way of knowing whether he&apos;s telling the truth or not. But Jack&apos;s decisive (and bullying) behaviour convinces at least Martin that something is going on, and although Kate initially resists and suggests that they just leave the cottage to the &quot;crazy&quot; man, she too is more or less bullied into submission. And it is true that something is going on, but whether they can figure it out in time to save themselves is an open question....\n\nThis is writer/director Carl Tibbetts&apos; debut film. I expected it to be a very tense psychological thriller, and to some extent it is, but there are flaws that perhaps a more experienced scriptwriter and director could have smoothed out. Largest among these is the simple fact that if Martin had listened to Kate right after Jack shows up, they wouldn&apos;t have gotten into this mess. It&apos;s hard to swallow disbelief when some plot points are so, well, silly. This is not to pan the film at all – it&apos;s sharp, has some beautiful cinematography (it was filmed in Gwynedd, Wales), and a lot of the twists and turns (especially at the end) are unexpectedly rich. But really the best reason to see this film is for the acting; our three leads are just outstanding, with Thandie Newton&apos;s performance serving as the focus that holds the whole film together. Definitely recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "When looking for a religious film to watch I knew that I wanted to watch one about Islam because I wanted to be more informed. After watching &quot;Inside Mecca&quot; I am extremely glad with my choice of film because it provided me with a much brighter and more knowledgeable outlook on Islamic beliefs and rituals. This movie explains and depicts Islam&apos;s hajj, which is a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia that is one of the five pillars of Islam. One of my favorite aspects of this movie was that it showed the journey of hajj from the perspectives of three people who broke the mold of Muslim stereotypes. There is a white Texan female, a black South African man and a Malaysian man. Before watching this documentary I ignorantly presumed the majority of Muslims to be Arab this movie taught me that only about 20% of Muslims are Arab. I thought that these three characters all had beautiful stories and reasons for being Muslim, especially the man from South Africa who adores how Islam accepts all genders, races and social statuses because he has seen so much racism throughout his country that he is now looking for peace through hajj. This movie does not only give the audience insight into who actually worships Islam but it also gives history to why they travel on hajj and it gives specific reasons for why Muslims partake in the numerous days of rituals. From this movie I have learned that Mecca is not simply going to visit the Kabba, but instead it is a spiritual journey that people choose to join in order to strengthen their relationship with Allah. This movie did get slightly boring at times but seeing how much emotion people feel when experiencing hajj and simply seeing the masses that attend was certainly incredible and gives perspective to those like myself who know very little about the Muslim faith.",

      "reviewBody": "The Basketball Diaries is the story of the true experiences of Jim Carroll, underground poet and entertainer, and how he overcame drug addiction to become what he is today. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Carroll. The film is not for the squeamish and it has the best drug withdrawal scenes since Frank Sinatra did Man With The Golden Arm.\n\nWe first meet Leo with his friends Mark Wahlberg, Patrick McGaw, and James Maddio as a group of delinquent Catholic school kids. They all play basketball and they all are constantly in trouble. DiCaprio is your kid with all the teen angst and self conscious about his lower class status. His mother, Lorraine Bracco, works as a chambermaid in some swank Manhattan hotel and I&apos;m sure she parts with some big bucks to see her kid gets a Catholic school education. There&apos;s no father in the picture.\n\nBut drugs of all kinds are available and the whole group of them get hooked with the exception of McGaw who breaks with his friends. The title is based on the notebook diary writings that DiCaprio keeps. Eventually they&apos;re published and Carroll is acclaimed and still today as a writer who speaks to young people today. \n\nLeo and the rest of the cast give some terrific performances. It&apos;s easy to see why he and Mark Wahlberg became the stars they have with this film. Also Bruno Kirby as the closeted gay basketball coach who misreads DiCaprio&apos;s mind and comes on to him is also a standout.\n\nThe Basketball Diaries hopefully if seen by some of the young will serve as a &apos;scared straight&apos; guide to saying no to drugs. This film really does show the horrible consequences of a destructive drug habit and the fact it can be beaten and one can live a most useful life.",

      "reviewBody": "The best moments of the quirky love story, &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot;, come in the beginning sequence when the introspective Adele (played by the beautiful Vanessa Paradis) is questioned about her clinical depression by an unseen voice in a room full of unseen therapists. Adele explains both her natural attraction and her bad luck with successive men who mistreat her in one way or another. Then comes Gabor (Daniel Auteuil) who tries to &apos;rescue&apos; her from the bridge she is about to jump off. Their relationship starts out like a Pymalion story with the more intelligent Professor Higgins and the unrefined Eliza but then turns into a road show, like &quot;La Strada&quot;, with the experienced showman Zampano and poor waif Gelsomina but finally ends up looking like &quot;Two for the Road&quot; with two sick puppies who can&apos;t do without each other. You come away from &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot; thinking about love in the abstract rather than love you can feel. Do we really care that in the end, the knife thrower and the target have changed places? Can we really understand the pathetic lives of a younger woman and an older man who instinctively know what the other is doing and whose sexual gratification comes from experiencing the fear of dying? Given the high drama of their lives, you would think &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot; could come to some conclusion about two desperate characters trying to find some meaning in life. Instead we meet them back on a bridge where they started out in the beginning, with an oddly chosen Brenda Lee tune thrown in to accentuate the strangeness of a strange film."

The Masterson character received quite an education. The story was one part, the clashing of cultures. The world of troubled youths is a very different world then the world of the affluent. I give the Masterson character credit for realizing the limits of affluence and attempts to step out of this world. I also give credit to the Grandmother who seemed to realize and support the Masterson character&apos;s attempts to grow. The social workers in this movie were very realistic. This is a tough age to be if one is socially conscious, no matter the circumstances.",

      "reviewBody": "In 2009, Swedish film director Fredrik Gertten made a film called Bananas!*, which centered around the depressing lives of the Nicaraguan plantation workers of the popular American company Dole. The work quickly transcended from depressing portrait to involving legal drama as Dole was found to be using an illegal pesticide on their crops of bananas, causing them to be tainted and workers to be sterile. As corporations often thing, they thought no harm, no foul, what the consumers don&apos;t know will not hurt them. That all shifted when the film entered eligibility for the L.A. Film Festival. What was originally a documentary whistleblowing on the corruption and wrongdoings of an enormous corporation was the byproduct and immediate target of the same corporation, threatening lawsuits and legal action if the film play in the festival.\n\nGertten, bewildered by the lawsuit from Dole representatives who clearly had not seen the documentary, allowed it to premiere at the festival with a statement at the beginning saying Dole reports it to be fabricated and containing &quot;patent falsehoods.&quot; What unfolded was three solid months of breakneck legal action; a corporation of 75,000 versus an indie film company of four, with the corporation using tactics only in play by the person with the bigger piles of money. Dole did everything from buying the name &quot;Fredrik Gertten&quot; on Google, utilize a tactic called &quot;astroturfing,&quot; which we discuss later, bribe several news sources, and play filthy with a company completely ill-equipped to fight back.\n\nGertten has done a dirty job to begin with, which is blowing the whistle on unfair corporate practices. He also did another, which is fight back against the same corporation that used similar unfair practices against him at all costs. And they still lost. If there&apos;s one thing we see in Big Boys Gone Bananas!* it&apos;s that when indie cinema and corporations clash the issues can get going - straight off a cliff.\n\nBack to the concept of internet &quot;astroturfing.&quot; It is often seen on websites like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, in terms of the film world, where accounts are made by representatives or marketers of the film, who feel that they need to establish completely fake reviews talking about a film (usually one that has been panned or will likely be) in a glowingly positive light. They&apos;re a tad difficult to spot, but when you see one with flattery and buzz words over content and substance, chances are, it may be an act of product-astroturfing. In the media world, it is when articles or responses are usually concocted in the same ingenious way as writing reviews. It&apos;s a disgusting little tactic, but it has gained immense popularity for its ability to sway people.\n\nThere&apos;s an amazing, yet depressingly real story inside Big Boys Gone Bananas!*. A story that is worthy of being told for generations on. In America, it received little coverage. The kind of story you&apos;d believe would make front-page headlines in a country that calls itself the greatest in the world was shoved to the side collectively, without a trace. Gertten&apos;s bravery to carry out Bananas!* and boldly show it at a film festival was true courage. Making and producing Big Boys Gone Bananas!* was an act of insanity.\n\nStarring: Fredrik Gertten. Directed by: Fredrik Gertten.",

      "reviewBody": "The Hills Run Red (2009) After reading several reviews for The Hills Run Red offering high praise, I suppose my hype meter kicked in. I was told that it was gritty, grimy, and uber-violent. Sounds good right?\n\nThe story follows Tyler(Tad Hilgenbrink: Amusement) as he develops an obsession with an 80&apos;s slasher film called The Hills Run Red. Legend has it, that it was immediately pulled from theaters after it was shown, due to a strong reaction to the violence shown on screen. Since then, all people involved in production have mysteriously disappeared. After some internet browsing, Tyler manages to get a line on the director&apos;s daughter, whom is showing off her beautiful natural breasts at a strip club. The plan is, find the daughter, get her to help him find the movie.\n\nThe Hills Run Red is one of those films that I realize is a cut above most straight to DVD horror films, and I DID enjoy the film. I guess I just felt a little disappointed. I was expecting a little more exploitation, and a lot less CGI. The kills are inventive, but is almost killed by the CGI work. This is the type of film that you NEED practical effects for.\n\nActing is good across the board, most notable is Sophie Monk, who plays Alexa. Sophie is a stunning natural beauty. Nothing like seeing some meat on the bones instead of the current skeletal Hollywood trend. The pacing is excellent, the cinematography is top notch.\n\nAs I said, it&apos;s a great film, and I highly recommend it, I guess I was just expecting something different. I&apos;m going to have to knock it down a point though for the shoddy CGI work. Get a clue up and coming film makers, there is no substitute for well done practical effects. CGI will NEVER replace the rubber suit, and fake blood.\n\n3/5 -napalmfuzz\n\nhttp://liberaldead.blogspot.com",

You get &quot;Cold Harvest&quot;, except that this ambitious mix is not as interesting as it sounds. Gary Daniels is fun to watch, especially in the fight scenes, and Barbara Crampton does a surprisingly good job in her role, but why do they have the main villain, who turns out to be an awesome fighter, fight only once (at the end), and kill people with his guns throughout the rest of the movie? If you&apos;re a fan of Gary Daniels (and I&apos;m slowly becoming one myself) check out &quot;Bloodmoon&quot; first, as it has more fights and a fantastic villain (Darren Shahlavi). (**)",

It contains The plot and suspense the first film had and the action the second film had. Perfect combo! The story is beyond amazing, Very creepy in a way yet totally awesome for the people in the theater watching it all play out. An apocalyptic world with few human survivors banding together, fighting, traveling etc. to try to find a place of safety from the infection and all the dangers that come with it. I&apos;m guessing if your on this page you have read the plot so Anyways back to the review. The film was a pleasant surprise... though there was one setback, There wasn&apos;t much time for any info or background on important members of the convoy, all you know is they are there... Your not really given time to hear a little out each one and kind of get each one to have there own amount of screen time due to the lack of time the film was working with, I mean come on... Why not make it 2 hours and add a little more in? Anyways besides that i thought the movie was a blast to watch and i am definitely going back to the theater sometime this weekend to see it again...",

(Let&apos;s see here -- the bad guy in his lair always has an eccentric pet with him -- okay the guy has a parrot! Check that off the list!)\n\nA film obviously made in Britain pretending to be a Hollywood film, which takes place in Las Vegas (unconvincing cardboard set inside a sound stage, plus some actual second unit stock footage), San Diego (England), Oregon (England again) and Hawaii (more stock footage, plus various underground tunnels (more paper mache sets in a sound stage).\n\nComically fake nuclear bombs. Laser guns mounted on bulldozers. Giant spinning tape reel computer banks...no wait, those were real at that time.\n\nBad directing, jump cuts, dropped frames, one establishing shot where the camera drops off the tripod. Awkward staging. Hokey dialog. The whole plot totally ridiculous. Well, it is like a live action comic book. So why should I take any bit of it seriously? Well, the characters seem to be dead serious about the whole enterprise. (That&apos;s good. True camp does not work if you give a &quot;nod and a wink&quot; to the audience...though that one scene with the slot machines in the mental hospital was perhaps a bit over the line...) \n\nYes, fans of The Batman or Green Hornet TV shows of this time period will be right at home here. Plenty of bright primary colors, swish pan transitions, and blaring cool-daddyo-jazz soundtrack. It&apos;s all here for the fan of 1960&apos;s camp and Cold War pop culture kitsch to treasure as an endemic artifact of its time, the likes of which we may never see again.\n\nThank goodness.",

      "reviewBody": "The Halperin brothers had just independently made the really bad but curiously watchable WHITE ZOMBIE. Paramount subsequently hired these cash magnets to make this low budget for the studio )but massive budget for the Halperins) hour of nonsense. It&apos;s quite fun.\n\nIt&apos;s utterly ridiculous which is what makes it so fun. H B Warner&apos;s solemn and theatrical delivery of his lines explaining in all seriousness how he&apos;s invented a machine to use &apos;microgenic&apos; rays to extract &apos;the soul&apos; from the dead adds to the silliness. It&apos;s especially crazy as he says all this to the jail warden who simply accepts all this gibberish as absolute common sense..... and lends the doctor the body of the executed criminal to experiment on - as you do!\n\nThat old style acting in this picture (although this is ten times more natural than in WHITE ZOMBIE) is perfect for an over-the-top, moody &apos;horror&apos; film like this. Naturalist and believable acting in a big kids&apos; fairytale world have been weird. When it came out audiences were thrilled and scared - today you&apos;ll be entertained by its daftness.\n\nIt&apos;s one of those pictures made by innovative, imaginative &apos;amateurs&apos; which don&apos;t look as professional as films made by &apos;proper&apos; directors but the enthusiasm of the Halperin brothers (and Paramount&apos;s budget) makes this worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "SIR! NO SIR! demonstrates the unbelievable scope and power of the anti- war movement within all branches of the American military during the Vietnam War era. This documentary serves as a reminder for those of us who lived through this turbulent period of American history, and provides a cogent and factual historical record for those who were not yet born. Contemporary American pundits on the Far Right would like to see these truths silenced...permanently. The film shows that anti-war sentiment and anti-war activity permeated all sectors within the American Military establishment, and many brave men sacrificed their careers, and their very lives to stop our country&apos;s unnecessary and immoral war in South East Asia. One thing that struck me while watching the film, is that today, huge media conglomerates are being owned and operated by fewer individuals and groups, and how easy it has become to suppress and distort America&apos;s long history of dissent. These days, any critical examination of this country&apos;s involvement in foreign entanglements is perceived as disloyalty to the troops. Nothing can be farther from the truth, and SIR! NO SIR! shows that the genesis of this particular heresy began in the 1960&apos;s as those in power attempted to silence opposition to one of America&apos;s most unpopular wars. The film also boasted many Special Features which helped to reaffirm the theme that there was a concerted and intelligent opposition to the war in Vietnam , and this view was shared by a significant portion of this nation&apos;s fighting forces. Great film."

Also, I would be lying if I said I didn&apos;t watch it to see Song Hae-Gyo as the main role.\n\nUnfortunately I was caught by these traps.\n\nFirstly, if you are watching this movie in order to learn historic facts, don&apos;t bother. Almost half of the movie involves senseless fighting and unpleasant sensuality, while trying to immerse viewers into the absent plot line.\n\n**TINY SPOILER** Clichés are existent. It&apos;s the same old thing: Two young friends are tragically split up because of an overly dominating father, the girl goes through physical/mental hardships (becoming a kisaeng) while the boy trains to fight enemies and ultimately to meet back with his childhood friend. **SPOILER END** \n\nThe first parts of the movie pathetically try to involve viewers emotionally by using children to enhance our pity for their tragic separation, and grab the attentions of fight-scene lovers by including a brutal battle scene. While these kept me interested in the short-term, I can&apos;t say the same about the rest of the film.\n\nSome good points: What can I say about korean movie actors? Beautiful, accurate and gets-to-the-point expressions. Although this film was Song Hae-Gyo&apos;s first movie, she does an incredible job bringing up clear emotions according to the situation.\n\nThe atmosphere was excellent almost throughout the whole film. Dark, brutal and tense lighting keeps audiences suspenseful and wondering what terrible event will happen next. (Very similar to Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) The music is average, as it doesn&apos;t include memorable scene-music (like Old Boy did) but suited the situation alright.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, this movie used korean must-know historic facts and famous actors to make people interested and to get them to watch it. This is not excellent, but not a disaster either. You may enjoy it if you&apos;re a fan of tragic love stories, but other than that, nothing is special here. 5/10",

      "reviewBody": "An excellent job by director Jim McBride of putting Myra Lewis&apos;s book about the life of legendary rock and roll star Jerry Lee Lewis (her husband) on film.\n\nDennis Quaid gives an over the top performance (sometimes a bit too over the top; but, then again, this is Jerry Lee Lewis) as Lewis, arrogant and child-like, trying to deal with sudden fame, having to deal with the consequences of having married his thirteen year old cousin (Myra, who authored the book). Quaid was truly excellent in this role. Yes, the lip-synching was perhaps a bit too obvious at times, but for the sake of hearing some great music performed by the real Jerry Lee Lewis, that was an irritant I could easily put up with. The relationship between Lewis and Myra (Winona Ryder) is developed sensitively and tastefully by McBride. Humour is added by exploring the complex love-hate relationship between Lewis and his cousin, the evangelist Jimmy Swaggart (Alec Baldwin). There is also great irony, given what ultimately happened to Swaggart, as we listen to him lecturing Lewis about the dangers of taking the &quot;gold-paved streets of rock and roll.&quot;\n\nI really enjoyed this movie. Perhaps it was guilty of portraying everyone in it as a bit of a caricature, but it still seemed to offer an entirely believable story of Lewis&apos;s life. Well worth the watching.\n\n9/10",

The first time I watched this movie (and trust me, it&apos;s worth watching again and again) I completely forgot the actor and was watching the life of this Cuban transplant unfold. And please, oh please, let Richard Harris find another role within which to shine as he did this one. He may be a prolific actor, but I hate to see his talent wasted in such &quot;blockbusters&quot; as Gladiator and Harry Potter.... His face, his eyes... you feel the distance and sorrow his character feels without his uttering a word. Brilliant. I&apos;m constantly amazed when I mention this film that NOBODY seems to have seen it! One of my top ten favorite films of all time.",

Both films are bad. But lets review Mujhe Se Dosti Karoge. I loved the music of mujhse Dosti Karoge. All songs are very melodious and fit well with each other. my favorite being Andehki Anjaani Si. The story, was nothing new, in fact it was very clichéd. The writer attempted a new style, but fell flat. The performances, the characterization was a huge drawback. Kareena&apos;s role was completely wasted. Her acting also was okay. Rani was good, but not great. Hrithik is a good actor, and tried his best, but the because of the disaster screenplay, and poor direction, Hrithik could not bring out his true potential. But he was still good. The length is also very long, I must say I watched this film twice and both times, I almost died from boredom. This film was was a flop at the box office. I see a lot of people praising this film. And I see nobody praising good films of Hrithik&apos;s like Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne lage and Na tum jano na hum, which were released the same year as Mujhse Dosti Karoge but also flopped. Those films were amazing, and Mujhse Dosti karoge is trash compared to those films. Take my advice, as a hrithik fan watch his every film, except for this one. listen to the songs though.",

Like many French movie stars, Jean Gabin is no oil painting, but he does have a certain energy and charisma, and he needs to, in order to avoid being upstaged by the colourful menagerie supporting players who surround him. Wanted by the French authorities, master criminal Pepe le Moco and his gang take refuge in the seamy labyrinth of the Algiers Casbah, where the police can never quite catch up with them, but slowly his sanctuary becomes his prison... Meanwhile the wily local inspector bides his time until a woman provides the flashpoint that could prove to be Pepe&apos;s undoing.

Especially if the other guy is bigger than him or has a bigger gun. He&apos;d rather keep the peace if possible. In this movie the other guy is much, much bigger than him. It&apos;s Dan Blocker, big as a mountain and mad as a wild bear. Frank knows better than to make him mad so he tries not to.\n\nAnd of course we also have Raquel Welch. Raquel kind of outshines Frank in this movie. She&apos;s like a neon sign to 1960&apos;s beauty and sex appeal. And baby you can&apos;t turn that shine down. It&apos;s on all the time, bright as the sun. She&apos;s also in her 20&apos;s and Frank is getting into middle age. The screams of the bobby-socks girls have long faded away. But that&apos;s okay. That&apos;s the way life is. You get older and lose some of your sizzle.\n\nI didn&apos;t like this one as much as the first one, Tony Rome (1967). So I&apos;m not going to say this is better. But if you liked the first one you can check this one out too. That&apos;s what Frank would do.",

Mitchum plays Jeff McCloud a burned out rodeo rider who spots some potential star talent in Wes Merritt. He also spots Merritt&apos;s wife and the Merritts are played by Arthur Kennedy and Susan Hayward. \n\nMitchum&apos;s been thrown by one too many bulls and horses and he&apos;s a burned out man. Still the allure of the circuit holds him in sway. He mentors Kennedy until they come to a parting of the ways and not just over Susan Hayward. The part is a perfect fit for Mitchum, his own footloose past made him understand the character of Jeff McCloud and bring it to life. \n\nThis was the first of two films Mitchum did with Susan Hayward. She&apos;s clearly in support of him and she knows it. Her big moment on screen is dispatching a rodeo groupie at a party who had designs on Arthur Kennedy. Her footage had to be shot first, according to Lee Server&apos;s biography of Mitchum, as Hayward had a commitment in Africa to shoot The Snows of Kilimanjaro.\n\nAmong the supporting cast Arthur Hunnicutt, one of the biggest scene stealers around, is very good as another burned out rodeo rider. Mitchum looks at him and sees that is his future. In fact in the end, so does Kennedy.\n\nThe Lusty Men is a fine depiction of rodeo life, ranking up there with the later Junior Bonner and 8 Seconds. Good entertainment all around.",

      "reviewBody": "This is known as a classic Korean action movie. It&apos;s actually quite outdated now and I wouldn&apos;t really recommend it now. But when it first came out, I thought it was really cool as a kid. So I have to give it some credit for that time period. But watching it now, I just see so much flaws about this movie. And it&apos;s not because of the cheesy aspects of it. But it&apos;s a movie that makes a very simple story overly complicated because of the poor pacing and editing. This movie could have been shorter, but is longer than it should be because characters just lingers and stares at stuff for a lot of the time. I know it&apos;s to show the characters emotions and feelings but come on, this isn&apos;t suppose to be an Asian drama series. What this movie tries to do is copy &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; except without guns and rely more on fists. And most of the fight sequences are actually quite impressive because of the rawness, despite some flashy kicks. Thanks to Jung Doo Hong, who is this legendary Korean stuntman and stunt choreographer. This is also the IT movie for Choi Min-Soo. Overall this is a tought guy manly movie that is worth a watch only if you want to know more about and watch classic Korean movies from the 90&apos;s.\n\n5.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "What can I say about Last Night that hasn&apos;t already been said?  Well, to start, I feel this is the kind of Canadian film we Canadians have been BEGGING to see for years.  However, because of the fact that the film saw limited release in arthouse theatres across the country, and is just appearing on video now, chances are good that Last Night will not be seen by a large majority of the public if not sent in to full release across the United States.\n\nThis movie is Canadian -- without shoving the fact that it is down your throat.\n\nNow, on to the actual guts of the movie.  I find the understatement of the fact that the world IS ending in six short hours to be so uniquely Canadian. There is an odd, somewhat macabre scene in the movie where McKellar&apos;s character is being harassed by his mother for showing up late for &quot;Christmas&quot; dinner.  Not once does mother mention the end of the world.  McKellar&apos;s response?  &quot;... and in case you haven&apos;t noticed the world is going to end today, and I&apos;ve had a lot on my mind.&quot;\n\nGetting off my maple leaf waving-high-horse, I will say this:  the performances by McKellar, Sandra Oh and Callum Keith Rennie are nothing short of superb.  They portray characters you at times love, hate, and fear, because there are times (many times) that we see ourselves in these characters.\n\nThe soundtrack for Last Night (available on the Sony Classical label) is a mixture of both the corniest music on the face of the earth (Burton Cummings&apos; live performance of Glamour Boy) to great oldies (Last Night [I Didn&apos;t Get to Sleep at All]) to songs few (if any people) have ever heard before (i.e. the Defranco Family&apos;s &quot;Heartbeat, its a Lovebeat&quot;)\n\nThe story moves at a graceful pace, there are no surprise endings, and the characters are human(e).  Last Night is a masterpiece."

I&apos;ll stop there and just say this was quite a thrilling crime drama though compared to others from the period, also perhaps a little subdued. Still, a suspenseful atmosphere permeates throughout especially when a boxing match where someone tries to kill provides the exciting climax. No big music score is provided but there are some good sequences when the story doesn&apos;t take the time for some romance between either of the male leads and Ms. Smith which aren&apos;t really needed. So on that note, The Turning Point is well worth the time.",

      "reviewBody": "On May 18, 1933 the Federal Government under FDR&apos;s &quot;progressive agenda&quot;, created the Tennessee Valley Authority, a vast scheme of regional development that involved, in part, the diverting of masses of water into valleys thus protecting large populations of people from the ravages of flooding rivers. Dams were created to assist in this enterprise and to harness the vast energy of the raging waters through turbines which in turn created electricity for communities that still lived in the &quot;dark ages.&quot; WILD RIVER begins with stock news footage of the damage ravaged upon a community by a flood, in particular a heart rending first hand account of a man who has suffered a great loss. In comes the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to save the day, a bastion of progress with Chuck Glover (Montgomery Clift) as its representative. The TVA, in order to complete its mission, must relocate all the residents within a particular area slated for water relocation but Mrs Ella Garth, an old hard-as-nails woman living on a small island in the middle of the valley, refuses to leave her land for any price. This is the context of WILD RIVER, but for director Elia Kazan, the TVA and its surrounding controversy are a microcosm for America&apos;s growing pains and the divisions between North and South that have persisted since the Civil War brought them to a head. Kazan contrasts rugged individualism, so much a part of the Nation&apos;s heritage, with an activist Federal Government citing the best interests of the community. The traditional attachment that the South has to &quot;the land&quot;, where &quot;the elements&quot; are an accepted part of life is contrasted with the North&apos;s reliance on technology to tame the elements. The sophisticated Montgomery, full of enthusiasm and conviction for his mission, is immediately jolted into reality first by the steadfast conviction of the old landowner (in a towering display of acting by Jo Van Fleet), then by overt Racism &quot;for a minute I forgot where I was.&quot;, and finally by his own mixed emotions. His passions are aroused by Carol (Lee Remick), Mrs Garth&apos;s stepdaughter, who is suffering from under stimulation, both physically and mentally. Widowed for over two years, she lives with her two children and the old woman on the island. When the handsome, educated Chuck arrives on the scene, she finds in him a source of combustion to feed a very deep well of passion. Once ignited, the fire threatens to envelope Chuck&apos;s controlled existence and intensify Carol&apos;s feelings of displacement. Rarely has confusion, vulnerability and molten sexuality been rendered more effective by an actress. Remick completely dispenses with any pretense about her sexual and emotional hunger and sets the screen on fire! While still smoldering, she manages to convey her separate, but equally passionate emotions for man and child during a tender scene between Clift and her daughter."

      "reviewBody": "Such occasions are not unlike great arias in operas: the stage lights softly dim and follow spot brightens as all cast characters (and audience) lean forward to focus on the delivery.\n\nSuch a moment occurs in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; as Paul Muni as Zola steps to the platform to deliver his courtroom defense speech.  Against all the odds of a jeering mob and negative press, he proceeds to offer a seven minute oration.\n\nThe scene is a set-up for Muni, and the camera, editing, and staging are all designed for the actor to deliver his thespian goods.  He doesn&apos;t disappoint.\n\nTwo other cinematic courtroom speeches are comparable: Alec Guiness as Benjamin Disraeli in &quot;The Mudlark&quot; (1950) enjoyed the rare opportunity of having his six minute, uninterrupted speech done in a single, slow tracking shot; and Gary Cooper as Howard Roark in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949) held a courtroom breathless for over five minutes, defending his act of poetic, if not Randian-judicial, justice.\n\nIn Muni&apos;s case, his defense scene turned out to be a highpoint of an intriguing acting career.  From Yiddish theater to worldwide stardom--with fewer that two dozen films to his credit--Muni constantly enthralled some while leaving others doubtful.\n\nWhat&apos;s undeniable about Muni is that he achieved stardom on his own power. He was able to convince a goodly number of people, both peers and public alike, that he was indeed not just a good but great actor.\n\n While some held a sneaking suspicion that he was a wee bit of a poseur, having never formally studied his craft, it really doesn&apos;t matter.  Muni didn&apos;t win his lucrative acting contracts--or his Academy Award honors--for nothing.  \n\nPersonally, I enjoy his general work, being more partial to roles more close to his own than those of his elders.  In latter cases I felt he often tended to go a bit over-the-top with &quot;stereotypical mannerisms.&quot;\n\nAs Zola, though, his earnestness and determination proves convincing, and the film itself is peopled with a powerhouse cadre of Warner Bros. character players.  \n\nTo the film&apos;s credit, a pre-enactment inscription admits to the intermingling of fiction with fact for dramatic purposes.  This also relieves the production of accusations of historical inaccuracy.\n\n All in all, &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; is  a most engrossing biopic of a courageous literary giant who placed the pursuit of justice above the receiving of worldly accolades."

Over the top acting, insane set design, lots of puppets and a giant poisonous frog! The filming is fast and cheap so some of the editing and continuity is haphazard. The martial arts are silly most of the time but the last big fight scene is very good in it&apos;s own weird way. If you like films with some sort of serious subtext then run fast from this one. Nothing is serious here. At one point early on, the Drunkard sinks into the stone floor until his feet are by his face! No explanation on what&apos;s going on or why he&apos;s doing it! If you can&apos;t stand a film this weird, you&apos;ve been warned.\n\nThe same team did Taoism Drunkard and Young Taoism Fighter. All recommended.",

But it didn&apos;t appeal to me at all. For one thing, these young women have particularly unattractive personalities. For another, contrary to what others have written, they&apos;re pretty plain-looking and not much of a turn-on, even nude and trying to pose seductively.\n\nI think it really began to irritate me when four girls in a boat, even when equipped with a very nice paddle, couldn&apos;t seem to get their boat the last 100 feet to the shore. Nope...got to strip (literally) and swim to shore.\n\nAs for the final resolution and climax of the story, if you can&apos;t see it coming from a mile away, you don&apos;t watch many movies.\n\nBetter than &quot;Birdemic,&quot; but not by too much. Still, watchable in parts."

I am not going to run you through the entire movie, as that has been done several times on here already, but I would like to clear up a few misunderstandings and harsh words that I have read in previous comments.\n\nFirst and foremost, I have not seen or read the play (although I am looking forward to it) and I was perfectly able to understand all of the so-called &quot;high-brow&quot; concepts like fate, time, freewill, self-awareness, and the light peppering of existential musings (my favorite of which is the &quot;...well at least I&apos;m not dead.&quot; speech).  The first time I watched this film I was very fascinated, amused, and slightly confused.  These Pythoneon nonsensical scenes that some of you are reffering to were a bit difficult to understand, but after a second viewing they all made perfect sense.  It does not take a genius to see the multiple layers and metaphors being used in this film.  As for being totally lost without first seeing the play, that is rediculous.  It took a bit of thinking and rewinding, but it is comprehensible, and after you figure it all out for yourself it is very rewarding and adds to the enjoyment, and genius, of the film.  For example, the first time i watched this movie I was very confused by the pages of manuscript randomly floating around after R&amp;G encounter the players for the first time.  But once you realize that the lead player is fully self-aware, has been through these scenarios (the play &quot;Hamlet&quot;) several times with a full consciousness and memory of the events (demonstrated rather obviously by his full knowledge of future events, the play that his troupe rehearses in front of R&amp;G wich is an exact copy of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, etc.) it makes for a wonderful metaphor demonstrating what has happened to the original play (Hamlet) now that some of its more flat characters are starting to think outside the script, so to speak, and become a bit more round.\n\nWell, I could go on forever about this masterpiece, and maybe I will at a later date, but for now I just wanted you know that this film is anything but simple.  If you can manage to put a little thought into what you are seeing and hearing you will find that it is perhaps the most complex, multi-layered, intuitively rewarding film ever created.\n\nP.S.  I am afraid this film is not widely accessible to the majority of movie watchers, which really saddens me because it is truly an amazing work of art.  I would very much like to remedy this.  So, if you have watched this movie at least 2 times, and are still puzzled by some of the scenes, please feel free to email me and I would be happy to explain anything that might heighten your understanding of the film."

It does bear the signs of a movie that was conceived primarily to capitalize on the popularity of its predecessor, and as a result it is hardly as carefully constructed. But as light entertainment, it works well enough.\n\nThe first part of the movie connects things up pretty efficiently with the original story, and it&apos;s kind of fun to go back to André&apos;s wrecked lab, which looks just as it should. Brett Halsey plays André&apos;s son Philippe, who is determined to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps. While the setup could have led in a number of different directions, the story that actually follows puts an emphasis on action, and it uses the special visual effects rather more freely than in the original &quot;Fly&quot;.\n\nFrom a scientific viewpoint, the whole premise of both movies is far-fetched at best, but in the original, you rarely thought about it because the story was so tightly constructed. In the sequel, the implausibility of the whole thing is harder to ignore. It doesn&apos;t detract that much from the entertainment value, but it is a noticeable difference from the first movie.\n\nExcept for Vincent Price, the cast is new, but solid. While the production might have a couple of rough edges this time, most of it still looks good enough. Overall, with the right expectations this is a generally entertaining light feature."

I was ready to be whisked away to a magical underwater world with filmmaker Rob Marshall&apos;s highly anticipated live-action retelling of this classic Disney movie. My grandkids were excited to see the remake of their favorite &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; movie but became bored after 20-minutes after the movie started. The movie was unusually dark and foreboding and unsuited for a younger audience in my humble opinion.\n\nNot sure I like the trend to make poorly written remakes of classic, beloved movies. I will have to rethink going to future Disney and Pixar movies since the characters were unappealing and plot dragging on.",
