        "reviewBody": "I have not yet made the jump to tubeless, and have run Conti Grand Prix for 30 years prior to this. The latest TLR models are impossible to get on/off my HED or Zipp rims, so I switched to Pirelli&apos;s. After well over a year, in all conditions, and multiple sets, these feel fast and have excellent grip. Mileage has been very good (not quite as good as my last GP5000s), and while they seem quite durable on our typical trash roadways, it always feels like they aren&apos;t quite the Conti&apos;s I had before, and therefore 4 stars.  Yes, they cost a bit more, also, but I&apos;m willing to pay that to be able to get them on/off the rim without worrying about either damaging another carbon rim, or having to cut the tire.  \nI also love the 26 size, since my bike will not fit 28&apos;s.",

I purchased the vest AND the similar vest pack. I like the overall design and fit very much. I also like the options for managing a net. I’m disappointed in the details. The trim around the rear closure, the black tape, is starting to peel up. The elastic strings on both sides are awkward and in the way. I’m tempted to cut them off. I like to slip my tippet into an accessible pocket, but neither outer pocket is wide enough. There was a missed opportunity for elastic outer pockets on the lower pockets in the front. It would also benefit from a few loops sewn into the seams along front center for attaching tools or other things. I like the concept. It’s pretty fair. The quality and design elements fall a little short.",

The bag is a little thin (I think I expected it to be thicker because it is waterproof), but otherwise should keep water out no problem based on the material used (haven’t had to test that yet). Love the external pocket though for anything you need to quickly access outside your bag. Also, to note, the straps aren’t detachable.",

        "reviewBody": "Most of my rides are a mix of pavement, gravel, and a small bit of single track with larger rocks and roots.  My bike is a Carver All-Road gravel bike, which does not have suspension components.  I use an alt handlebar, which is supposedly less optimal than drop bars when it comes to initiating travel in the stem.  I am a larger rider, 230lbs, which likely offsets some of that geometry challenge.  The Redshift stem provides much needed &quot;give&quot; for the bike&apos;s front end.  The company advertises 20mm of compliance and I believe that to be a true figure.  You don&apos;t notice the stem &quot;travel&quot; on most surfaces, but my shoulders sure figured out something was going on to improve ride quality.  My worst case scenario, washboard gravel, is more bearable with the Redshift stem.  The stem would clearly be overmatched with true mountain bike terrain, but for gravel riding it noticeably improves ride quality.  Setup was relatively easy.  I made the mistake of going too firm with my elastomer choices on my first attempt.  Swapping out elastomers for a softer setting made a huge difference and the bars are still plenty stiff on pavement.  I installed the +30 stem, which might be a little too much rise.  A choice of a +20 stem would be nice to have.  All in all, I believe the RS stem is worth the added costs.",

        "reviewBody": "This did exactly what I was looking for ? reduce uncomfortable, fatiguing shocks through the handlebars while keeping the sure-footed compliance.   A month ago I purchased a new bike and knew I wanted to take it on and off road.  I did not want a fully suspended bike, but rather something to absorb those shocks from potholes, rocks, sharp transitions.  On my motorcycle I had found bars with elastomer absorbers, so I set out hoping the same existed for my gravel bike.  When I came across this stem from redshift, it seemed to tick the boxes.  I bought it to test and have never looked back.  Riding around LA our streets arent always in the best shape.  This has been amazing.  Not soft but a firm shock absorber.  I&apos;ve got about 400 miles on it so far and have recommeded to many others.  It is worth experimenting with the various elastomer inserts.  I ended up going with a little softer than recommended and it works for me.  I used the same geometry as my original stem to maintain riding position ? a colleague opted for the higher version as he was looking for a more upright riding posture.  I have since also purchased their shockstoper seat post.  together they have made my riding more comfortable, less painful and therefore allowing me to go a little further and on more challenging surfaces.",

Riding both road and single track and I really dont feel it when I ride which i like as I dont feel like it impacts my energy transfer very much at all. I am sure it does but minimally as I have installed the stiffer polymers (not the factory default). On long rides (50+ miles) my shoulders dont get sore which they still do on my other road bike also I can defintley ride faster over rough patches. I am setting PR&apos;s all the time while feeling better after my rides. It was dead easy to install. Stats: I ride a roughly 3-4K miles a year, 6&quot;2&apos; tall 210 and I am almost 60 so not out to kill it but i do ride hard. This is mounted on my Trek Checkpoint 6. I like it a lot!",

I have two buddies who?ve had it since it first came out and both swear by it so I should taken their advice immediately. It makes a huge difference even though you don?t really notice the stem moving except on the biggest hits. It makes my arms, shoulders, neck and lower back feel a lot fresher than normal after a long gravel ride. It softens the chatter and pounding making it feel like I?m running larger-volume tires at a lower PSI. I had to flip my stem which required some moving around of the elastomers but it was easy even for a mechanically challenged fool like myself. Go ahead and buy this. It?s well worth the money.",

The durable canvas material holds up well to daily wear, and the synthetic insulation keeps me warm without being bulky. The wool flannel lining traps heat, while the smooth sleeves make layering easy. With three pockets for essentials, this jacket combines style and practicality. Highly recommend it!",

They wash/hold up well, the colors are great and they keep my kids warm. Gotta say, I love the new bright colors. (My kids instantly gravitated to the bright green/blue and the red/blue stripes.) They are used a lot. From an everyday medium jacket, mid layer under warmer jacket or rain shell, camping, hiking, anything outdoors really. As long as nothing changes I will continue to buy these and recommend them to all my mom friends, who now buy them for their kids too. Seriously... we are all walking around looking like a Columbia Ad lol! Thanks Columbia for making a great product.",

This fleece fits odd, the sleeves aren’t as long as other fleece I’ve bought from here and the seam under the chest area is high, so if your larger chested the seam rises up across and looks very odd. I’m glad I didn’t pay full price for this product and wish I could return, but it’s been worn and washed. Maybe if you average height it would work? \nIt did keep me warm, I work outdoors in rain and it helped keep me cosy though.",

I have gotten a ton of compliments and always feel cheerful when I put it on! The best part tho is this cut is perfect for my body. I&apos;m a 5&apos;8&quot; XL (38C cup) with some extra tummy and was worried it would be too tight in the waist. I also find a lot of sleeves are too short or shoulders are tight. But this shirt fits like it was tailored to my body! I&apos;m so appreciative of OR designing their clothing that is proportional for larger bodies instead of other outdoor brands that use S or M as a template and then just add inches. I also think the cut of this shirt would look great and be comfortable on anyone, regardless of size! It&apos;s also warm but temp regulating and has a neat mesh pocket so you don&apos;t loose keys and other small things.",

Unfortunately a seam on the front of the trousers between the thigh and the knee that causes discomfort when walking uphill or climbing stairs makes it a very poor choice for me. By manually reducing this thigh length of the trousers, the seam is then placed sufficiently above the knee and no longer causes discomfort. I am 1m73 tall, size 32 Regular. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this product for anyone under 1m75.    Without that seam, The trousers would probably be a 4 or 5 stars :-(",

I see a tripod blowout in the future. The dangling drawstring on the back is a little obnoxious. The clever folks at PD could have done better with that. It’s a little expensive.",

Currently being used as a daily commute via train to work (in Sydney AU) to carry a 16&quot; laptop and lunch (in a Decor Microsafe Oblong). Sits well with everything in it. Super flat when lunch is taken out. Very comfy shoulder straps (also sits well for my broad frame). Well worth investing into adjusting to the many compartments where you can store things. Will be tested and used for travelling next year!",

This lightweight pack accommodates my 16&quot; Lenovo laptop, though not in the designated sleeve.  I can quickly load and unload the computer and store peripherals like a charger and mouse.  The backpack is well-constructed, very comfortable, and straightforward.  It gives me the capacity and flexibility I need without a lot of unnecessary pockets, dividers, and add-ons. This is the second Peak Design pack I&apos;ve purchased, and like my previous travel backpack purchase, it is an excellent product.  From my experience, Peak Design makes well-thought-out, adaptable products that can be tailored to an individual&apos;s needs and preferences.  Highly recommended, even if a bit more costly than competitors!",

Grippy and supple, and different options give you light and supple or more protection when riding. I adore these tires, and they look incredible.

On the same rim, compared to a Bruce Gordon rock n&apos; road tire, listed at 43 mm, the Rutland 42 is close to 1/4 narrower. It is also narrower than a Schwalbe G one 40 mm.

I loved them otherwise so much that I might have to try again.  They&apos;d be perfect if you can find the right size.",

There are two screws that hold the tab for the heel cup stripped out when I initiated a toe side turn. \n\nThe design does not allow the screws to back out, the bottom of the binding would prevent that. These screws pulled out of the metal on the pucks.  I attached a photo where you can see missing threads. \n\nI would understand if one screw somehow backed out or if they were loose after the end of the day. Truth is the screws blew out when I initiated a carve. \n\nWill not trust this system going into the backcountry again. You probably shouldn’t either.\n\nGuess  I’ll go back to Spark R&amp;D bindings.",

They were a bit finicky to get them to stay on and properly under her jacket so they did fall off a few times, but they were easy enough to get on and off and did keep her hands dry and warm.\n\nIf you have a toddler you know getting each finger into a glove is a nightmare (her mountain bike gloves make me want to cry) so this mitten comes in clutch.",

I&apos;m 5&apos;11&quot; and 175 lbs with a 41.5-in chest and 31-in waist. I tried the MEDIUM, but it was just a pinch too tight around the chest and around the armpits. I was skeptical about upsizing to the LARGE as I worried it would billow out around my midsection and look sloppy. However, the waist synch pulls things in just enough to keep this looking good. Would be a 5-star item if it had fully taped seams and was 100% waterproof.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had this bag since 2019, now over 5 years on it&apos;s still my everyday bag for laptop/work as well as light travel/carry-on or riding my bike around town. It&apos;s showing almost no signs of wear despite the regular use and I&apos;m thrilled with it! The only small complaint I have that I&apos;ve been dealing with since the beginning is the strange decision to recess the clips on the front flap so I can&apos;t actually grab them to snap them. I still find myself clawing at them from the sides and pushing sideways just to get enough purchase on them to provide resistance for the snap. Such a strange design. But, like I said, the durability and functionality of the bag in every other way overshadows that minor issue.",

        "reviewBody": "I bough this bag for college in 2018. Little did I know I&apos;d keep the bag this long or that it would become my personal travel companion. I frequently fly across the US for work (think an average of 30 flights per year) and this bag has never let me down. No matter how much I stuff it, it fits in the personal bag checker at my chosen airline and allows me multiple days of clothing and supplies. No other bag compares. When I need to replace it, I will purchase another. It is truly waterproof and stain resistant. The only thing that has broken or shown wear is a plastic buckle that has broken an inner snapping point. I think metal buckles would be an upgrade, however, I plan to attach one myself to repair my bag. It does get heavy when full (as to be expected).",

        "reviewBody": "Have had this bag for my three years in college. It&apos;s amazing! My first pro is the quality of material. It has yet to show any wear or tear. I thought that the plastic buckle clips might break after a lot of use but haven&apos;t to this day. The bag is great for a laptop, books, pens, cables, and a lot more. You can fit more in it than you think. \r\n\r\nI&apos;ve also used the bag a lot of travel and if you have extra items that don&apos;t fit in the bag, the cover flap can be used to store those larger items securely. \r\n\r\nOnly negative thought I have is, like many others have said, it&apos;s very difficult for the bag to remain upright freely. This is something you get used to over time as you simply lean it against a chair leg or wall, nothing serious. \r\n\r\nOverall, very satisfied with this bag and would recommend to anyone in school or constantly on the go for business.",

It holds my smaller work laptop and papers with nice pockets to hold water bottle, passport, business cards, and all my cords and earphones.  It is getting a little worn on the main pocket release snap but otherwise holding up very well.  It travels nice and is typically the only carry-on I bring when I check a bag.  It is getting close to my birthday (the big 49) and my wife is badgering me for some birthday ideas.  Since it was getting a little worn I was on this site looking for a replacement (that I really dont need) and saw that this pack is still a model.  I do not write reviews but since I saw it was still hear and I really like the product I thought I would take a few minutes to give it my endorsement.  I would 100% buy this again.",

Hauling laptop and books to classes, messenger bag for day-long cycling adventures around the city, personal-item airport travel bag, road trip &quot;essentials&quot; bag, and a daily bag for commuting to-and-from work. I&apos;ve used the bag in so many ways without any issues with zippers, material/fabric, velcro, buckles or straps. It&apos;s remarkable that the bag is just now beginning to look like it has been well loved.\n\nI&apos;m a sucker for purchasing new bags for my gear closet, but this one is so versatile and such a great UX I can&apos;t come to terms to replace it as my daily bag.",

        "reviewBody": "I was looking for a backpack that would look sleek for work and that could work out as a 2-3 day trip backpack. After looking all around and ordering backpacks from other places, I finally found the one with the Subterra.\n \nPros:\n- Good quality material\n- Super comfortable, the back is super padded which is amazing\n- Lots of pockets which was something I was looking for\n- Easy access back pocket which was been super useful in the subway to get my Kindle out or to quickly get your laptop out \n- Design. I love that it looks pretty thin and sleek if you don’t put many things on it (for work). Other backpacks would keep a bulky structure even if they were basically empty\n- Big opening zipper is great for packing it up for travel\n- Pretty expandable and big of you really fill it up (I think it is more than 25 L)\n\nCons\n- I’ve realized it is sometimes hard to buckle it while closing.\n- It only has one outer pocket (i.e. you need to unbuckle it to reach all the other pockets). Would be great if the Velcro flap in the front could be used without having to unbuckle the top.\n- As mentioned in other reviews, the outer pocket opens to the outside, which in certain positions feels as if the inside could fall. Never happened to me but I understand it could.\n\nI think the pros definitely outweigh the cons given the research",

This pack is great for any type of hike from a short day hike to a long trek and beyond. It&apos;s very comfortable and sits well on the shoulders. The weight distribution is great and it is very easy to adjust as you&apos;re moving. It is very easy to secure your trekking poles and you&apos;ll be checking to see if they fell out because you don&apos;t notice them - don&apos;t worry, they&apos;re still there. \n\nAbsolutely great pack for all types of hiking and treks. However, this pack truly shines on moderate-hard trails that require some climbing and meneuvering. You have to try it.",

        "reviewBody": "I did my homework before purchasing these boots and despite the not so stellar reviews left here I went ahead with them. I DO NOT regret my purchase at all! \n\nThe break-in period was about a week or so. They are leather boots so they are going to be stiff right out of the box. Be prepared to wear some good quality crew socks with them to prevent rubbing. I wear Darn Tough socks with them and they are a perfect match. I also wear skinny jeans tucked into the boots.\n\nAs far as sizing goes, I went to the Danner website and used their online sizing tool. I ordered a 6.5 which is my usual boot size. Just to give you an idea, I wear a 6.5 in Twisted X Driving Mocs as well as Nike Metcons and I wear a 7 in Brooks running shoes. I would say the Danners are true to size. \n\n I have had them almost a month now and I have oiled them up once to soften them a little.  They are broke in pretty well and fit my feet wonderfully. I wear them daily. I work in an office but I walk a good bit during the day too. I have stood for long periods of time on concrete floors and never had any foot or back pain. These boots are comfortable all day long. I was dealing with foot pain before but I have not had any issues since switching to the Danners. I love them so much I even wore them in our fall family pictures. \n\nBackcountry had the best pricing on these boots as well! Standard shipping was also very quick.",

I wear an 8.5 ordered a 9 they feel like a 7.5!!! They also are very narrow and I don?t have wide feet. Im really disappointed that they didn?t work out. Because I do love they way they look.",

They are physically impossible to get on because the wrists are not very stretchy and they have no opening mechanism like Velcro, they are just a band. I have very small hands. I got the medium due to the &quot;small&quot; reviews - and while I can get them on I am afraid I would have to cut them off after riding. Think about putting on something the circumference of your wrist, but having to get it over your hand first. That is how this glove is designed, impossible to get on if you can&apos;t fold your hand into it.  They did not think this one through - I would give it 0 stars if I could.",

        "reviewBody": "I made the switch from my old leather Vapor Vs to the Instinct VSR in the same size. They were an amazing upgrade. The softer rubber on the VSRs sticks like glue and the sensitivity is unreal. It has great smearing capabilities for having such an aggressive downturn. The heel is snug but not painful.  Whereas, the heel in my old Vapor Vs had quite a bit of slop (the newest Vapor V&apos;s have an improved heel.) I&apos;m now more confident in my heel hooks. Very little break in stretch, but the shoe has become easier to put on (maybe the layer of chalk helps.) The shoe has great power to the toe.\n\n The only place this shoe does not give me confidence is on micro edges. I do not feel locked in and feel more as though I&apos;m smearing on tiny edges. Good thing they make the same shoe with an edging rubber outsole, the Instinct VS.\n\nAll around outstanding performance, comfort, and style for people with feet on the wider side.",

I replaced that pump with a Lezyne floor pump but I&apos;ve transferred this to chuck to the new pump. Just screwed it into the schrader connector and voila!\n\nOh, I bought this because I was inflating my back tire to 100psi and the default Silca chuck didn&apos;t work at that pressure (they don&apos;t tell you that, of course). This chuck, however, worked every time. I&apos;ve dropped down to 90psi four years later and it&apos;s still working flawlessly.",

I recently switched my wheel to 29&quot; and bought this tire in the 2.4&quot; size as that&apos;s all that will fit. Unfortunately the tread isn&apos;t as big/chunky as the plus size tires so while it&apos;s still a fast rear tire it doesn&apos;t grip as well in wet conditions. It&apos;s more likely to slide out in mud and wet roots so I&apos;d consider something more aggressive for wet riding.",

It&apos;s a little big - only noticeable on windy days, but thankfully the neck string prevents it from flying away! It is a very straight brim (if that makes any sense) so I find it works really well when the sun is directly overhead, however, during the rest of the day you will get sun on your face (e.g., tip of nose, chin, mouth area), so you&apos;ll want to ensure you&apos;re wearing sunscreen. Happy I got this on clearance (lavendar colour) as I wouldn&apos;t be as impressed if I paid full price (due to the stiffness/straight brim that doesnt provide the full coverage I prefer in a sun hat).",

This latest version is definitely narrower and I&apos;m hoping they will stretch out over time. These feel like the regular version to me, even though they are clearly marked as the wide version. This is disappointing that they would change the fit like this,  and I hope they stretch out a bit over time.",

I experience pain after an hour or so on my bike.  I had to resort to a podiatrist for injections in one foot.  I finally read about these shoes with the wide toe box.  I was somewhat reluctant to buy shoes online but decided to try them.  I am so happy and relieved I did!  They are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn for biking.  I am riding for hours with no pain.  They are pricey but well worth it.",

The ankle retention is perfect. After trying most of the higher end brands (Sidi, Specialized, Giro, Lake), I would say that this so far are the best fitting shoes. The carbon sole is plenty stiff and doesn’t cause me hot spots like the Sidi shots.",

        "reviewBody": "These seem to be nice shoes and well made. For $450 they should be! Also for $450 I would expect the wide version to be available in half sizes. I tried the shoes on and walked around on the carpet. They felt a little large (long) with a little extra toe room but even this wide version was a bit narrow for me. No amount of tightening would stop the heel slip - a sign that the size is too large. If I went down a full size I know even the wide version would be too narrow. Maybe a half size smaller would fit, but it isn’t offered. I purchased a size 41W, my street shoe size is 7.5. I don’t feel that the Shimano size table is off, just too much of a compromise to offer only full sizes in cycling shoes that demand a precision fit.\nThey do feel comfortable when cinched tight, a good sign of a well made shoe. I can’t comment on ride feel since I’m sending these back and not taking a chance on the full size smaller. Going back to a more familiar brand. \nMy experience - cycling for 34 years. I’ve gone through quite a few high end shoes but these were my first try for Shimano.",

It works great and holds solid. They didn&apos;t have these when I had a bike like 15 years ago so it is a great feature. Definitely recommend.",

They are my go to cycling bibs for any occasion (road or mtb, race days, 100-mile events, social rides, etc).\nThe compression is great, they are durable, chamois is a good fit, and the mesh fabric is comfortable.\nThey are worth the price! 5 stars...\n\nThen they changed...\nI recently bought one of the new design (navy blue), with the different fabric. Although the chamois is comfortable, the new stretchy fabric on the legs does not provide the same level of compression and the legs ride up as you pedal. Only used a handful of times, because I&apos;d rather use my old stretched out bibs.",

The other one did not have sticky tape on the leg but was the actually length stated so they stayed down, the blue was much shorter on the leg and rolled up at every stride. I was very disappointed as I really loved the blue color. Had to return them.",

The size small was way to big so I exchanged it. They only had XXS for me, I was nervous because sometimes XXS are too small but this one fits great and is long enough! Thank you Backcountry for being so great with the exchange process!!",

I did not get wet inside but there&apos;s no way I would trust this jacket on a rainy hike. In comparison, my last 2 rain jackets were Columbia &quot;Wet Dry&quot; series and they were amazing... Ahhhmazing. I could do hard labor in pouring rain for hours &amp; nothing got through. My whole body soaked except where that jacket was. Sadly for some reason, when I tried to get a new Wet Dry jacket, they only came in a horrible black that looked like a trash bag, eww, vomit. So, this is disappointing because the &quot;Hikebound&quot; jacket was a nice price, pretty, fit well, had a hood that actually fit &amp; covered my head.. If all you need is to stay dry from the car to the door, I guess this is your jacket. If you want to battle mother nature face to face? Keep shopping. Sad :( \nDear Columbia... Please bring back more colors in Out Dry... My Tangerine one from 7 or 8 yrs ago needs to be retired.",

The fabric, and dual pockets of old has been replaced with a thinner fabric, open ring snaps, and as pictured - one pocket. Everything feels cheap (but it&apos;s not a cheap shirt).\n\nBut my real issue is the fabric. The smoke/stone is a non-starter. It is very thin and feels like it won&apos;t hold up, and also has a fuzzy/shiny sheen that sheds on anything you would wear over or under this. I tried this on over a dark t-shirt and had to either wash, or run a fabric roller over it. So if you can stand how terrible the plaids look, perhaps that is a better fabric. For this price, this is a non-starter.\n\nOn fit - I would say it&apos;s generally true to size. I wear a medium in a lot of brands, Patagonia for one reference. If you are a medium in that, the medium will be good. It is fitted, so if you are wide or have a barrel chest, size up. But it&apos;s no more fitted than the older versions of this product.",

I could live with it, but it is uncomfortable. The biggest problem though, is the strap over top of the ankle. It is WAY to long. I ordered the right size by length, and, to strap them even slightly snug, there is barely a quarter of an inch of active velcro. The reasons I want to love them? The upper is super soft and comfortable, and the foot bed feels very good. But I like my shoes to be secure underfoot, and not be able to move all about on a whim. The upper strap just doesn&apos;t allow for that, unfortunately.",

The beaches are really muddy and wanted a shoe that was a hybrid sandal that I could go into the water. These shoes took some time but I now really like them - the things was that I needed to develop calluses on my foot before the shoes became comfortable enough to walk all day around in - this took less than a month before i could walk around with out my skin rubbing against the shoe. I would first wear them loosely then eventually tighten them up. i went to California for some hiking and swimming they were great there , went to gulf area in Mississippi where it is muddy - true the sand does get into the shoes but one just needs to wash the shoes out really thoroughly, then you are ready to go. my area floods when there are thunderstorms - these shoes are great while walking in those conditions.",

        "reviewBody": "These fit great, but combining the laces with the boa is somewhat redundant and cumbersome.  The shoes are hard to get on unless you completely loosen the laces and boa, and then the point of the boa is seemingly only to hold the laces down unless you want to crank down the top of the foot and cut off your circulation.  I just think this design is a miss.  Returned these and went with a full boa shoe.",

        "reviewBody": "I love these shoes. They are stiff for pedaling efficiency (especially for my platformless eggbeater pedals) and have great traction for navigating rocky hike-a-bike sections. Most importantly, these fit my wide feet well. I have worn them for daylong rides with no problems whatsoever. I found the shoes to be more waterproof than anything I&apos;ve worn before. This is generally a good thing to keep your feet dry but I&apos;d be wary about wearing them for a long ride that involves many river crossings as they don&apos;t appear to drain well. Overall, these are the best shoes I&apos;ve worn in terms of fit and performance in the 15 years I&apos;ve ridden a mountain bike.",

The fit length is as expected, but these are definitely more narrow than typical MTB shoes.  I expect many road shoes to be narrow, but was disappointed that these are as well.  My feet were killing me after 20 miles and I had to cut the ride short.  If you have narrow B width feet, you might love these shoes.  If you are a D width, they will be too narrow.",

This is a great shoe if you have to climb over obstacles like tree trunks and rocks.  The soles are very positive for walking and that is a big plus.  If you need a shoe that delivers maximum power this is not that shoe, but between fit and comfort this shoe is excellent. This is a biking shoe you don&apos;t have to take off right after you finish and change into something else.  If I know I am going to not have to walk a lot during my ride I&apos;ll wear my Recon 3.0&apos;s since they are stiffer, but for a lot of rides where we have to get off and walk this is a great shoe.",

After about 45 minutes into the ride I started to have some discomfort around my ankle which continued to get worse. Since it was my first time wearing them I just figured they needed to break-in a little. The next day I spent a little more time adjusting the fit with the laces, but that didn&apos;t help. Pretty uncomfortable the whole ride. Started thinking maybe I needed different socks, but I&apos;ve had no problems with my other riding shoes. So I returned them",

The Cloud Shadow has met my needs. It has some insulation but is still quite dextrous. The GoreTex liner kept my hands dry during a 2 hour storm. The pleather palm is good for grabbing the occasional rock or tree. The touchscreen compatible material on the thumbs and index fingers works as advertised.",

Got tired of refilling sealant and wiping off sealant from frame and the back of my jersey after rides. \n\nTypical training rides are rugged and over sections with large sharp rock so not surprised the rear tire only lasted 1,500 miles.

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve now ridden all three sizes of the Pathfinder Pro – 700*42, 700*38, and, most recently, 700*32.  They all roll really fast and I have never flatted on them.  I&apos;ve ridden them tubeless and with tubes, mostly for training but also for events and races.  I currently have wheels with the 42&apos;s and a matching set with the 32&apos;s and I swap them regularly.  The 42&apos;s are wide and can really go anywhere – they&apos;re just enough bigger than the 38&apos;s to make it worth putting them on for extra assurance in rougher gravel and singletrack.  I most recently rode the 700*42&apos;s at the Vermont Overland without any problems – they handled the class 4 roads with relative ease. They&apos;re fast on roads and reassuring on trails. They inflate to 42mm wide exactly on &quot;gravel-specific&quot; rims and have not gotten wider after a year of riding them.  \n\nThe 700*32: Wow – these are awesome!  I got them as soon as they were released and they are perfect for that sweet-spot of mixed road riding and lighter dirt roads and gravel trails.  They feel a lot faster than the 42&apos;s, which I really like for rides when I&apos;m mixing paved and dirt roads or when I&apos;m riding a lot of paved to get to dirt roads.  While the 38&apos;s and 42&apos;s are close to each other, the 32&apos;s feel much faster on the road and on trail.  I think the quickness comes from them being noticeably lighter and maybe more aero. It&apos;s enough of a difference to make swapping wheels worthwhile. They inflate to 32mm on gravel rims after a few months of riding them, making them perfect for cyclocross frames, too.  I think that all sizes of tire are one of the best value out there, too.",

Zero flats even using various pressures on my 65-70lb loaded bike.  \n\nUnnoticeable resistance on pavement.  I kept up with others on urban tires without any issue. When we hit sand or small gravel patches, you could feel the tire slide slightly to the left or right before grabbing and keeping you upright, doing exactly what you would expect from this style tire.\n\nI highly recommend these. If you are bike packing, I recommend going with the high viz models that they offer. That’s the only change I’d make. I will be using these for BWR gravel race this October.",

I liked the idea of Velcro to prevent any slippage. Unfortunately the Velcro is on a very elastic strap so it does next to nothing. When standing, the curve of the pad pushed the whole thing down my leg. I was also able to slide several fingers up under the lower edge of the pad. Returned as I wasn’t confident they would stay in place. It’s possible that sizing down would help.",

I was looking to replace a set of Fox enduro pads which I&apos;d worn for a couple seasons, and which were beginning to stretch out. These POCs look decent and have good protection (they are much more protective than my old Fox pads, and while you wouldn&apos;t want to use them for DH, they are perfectly adequate for most enduro or trail style riding). I do find the fit a bit funky while riding. They slide on very well and fit fine when standing, but while I&apos;m pedaling I find them to be a bit abrasive and &quot;pinchy.&quot; As a result, they are less comfortable for medium to long term rides than my old Fox pads, and in fact I can&apos;t wear them for multiple days in a row without getting abrasions that I have to let heal before riding again. Hopefully this will change after a few more rides and washes.",

I need a utility shoe for light hiking, schlepping kids and equipment to/from ski racing, etc. I ordered the same 11.5 as I wear in EVERY OTHER Salomon product (classic and skate Nordic boots, a dozen pairs of running shoes over the last decade…and the last just is not the same. These shoes are shorter and narrower/lower volume than every other Salomon product I’ve ever owned. Unfortunately, I hoped they would pack out or stretch a little or something, so I went ahead and wore them. But I sure wish I had swapped them for a 12. :(",

This pair I bought through the website without trying them on. Mistake. My feet were uncomfortably hot, and for the first time my socks and the insoles had a sour smell after walking. I had to remove the insoles after each use and hand wash them. Not convenient while traveling abroad. I would not recommend this shoe for weather above freezing.",
