        "reviewBody": "This is a great small pack, but it is really large for a &quot;small&quot; pack. I could easily go into the woods for a day trip and have more than enough room for the items I want to take. With a little extra padding that could be added by the user, this is a great size for a point-and-shoot or bridge size camera (or a DSLR with one lens). I really like that the straps match the bag color but only one zipper (front pocket) matches. The top zipper is a lighter brown shade, close to the zipper pulls in color. The compression straps work very well to stabilize the items inside and there are webbing loops on each end to add a clip to attach extra items (like gloves). A 27 ounce Kleen Kanteen or a 32 ounce Nalgene will fit inside with room for more gear. The grab handle on the back is a nice touch in a waist/sling pack. The back panel is well padded. I would have preferred if the waist/shoulder strap were about 4 to 6 inches longer. All in all, a superb small pack that works as much larger than it appears.",

In my opinion, it should have a third zipper compartment behind the main compartment as it feels like too much room.  but, otherwise the quality is good and the bag is comfortable as a hip pack.",

Maybe even lock strap adjusters where you lengthen and shorten the strap. Other than that, amazing. Would highly recommend.",

However, the upturned front of this Ultra 100 shoe, combined with a stiff upper due to the Gore Tex lining, made this shoe about a half-size shorter than my Alpine shoes. My toes hit the end. Had I known, I would have ordered these in a 12.5. But Backcountry.com doesn&apos;t carry the 12.5, only the 13. I returned them for a refund and purchased a pair of Scarpa trail runners that I hope fit my skinny, narrow feet.",

I purchased the 54-gallon, silver version before a party weekend and it delivered just in time. We filled it with three bags of ice and a bunch of mini sodas and water. Almost (5) days later, I was asked to bring cold drinks to another school event. I was shocked to find a fully frozen ice bag still in the cooler along with several drinks, still ice cold. I drained the water and carried the cooler with a few more added drinks to the event and it was all perfectly ice cold. Amazing how well this cooler works!!! And it looks great too. :-)",

There simply isn&apos;t much padding and it looks cheaply made. I&apos;ll return with feedback.\n\nWell... I went for a long 87 mile ride (to NYC) today and these shorts were good for the first 35-50 miles.  The last 30+ miles, was a bit uncomfortable in the saddle.  The bib shorts fit fairly nicely, but my fears were confirmed.  I&apos;ll probably look at one of the other or more expensive POC bib shorts.",

        "reviewBody": "The Outdoor Research Deviator Hoodie exceeded expectations during my recent 6-mile run in 24-degree Fahrenheit weather. Despite the cold, the hoodie, paired with a single polyester t-shirt, kept me comfortably warm throughout the run. The fabric&apos;s ability to regulate temperature was impressive, as I noticed a slight chill when pausing for photos but quickly warmed up again once I resumed movement. The hoodie&apos;s design also proved practical, with a spacious chest pocket securely holding my Samsung S22 Ultra and deep lower pockets providing warmth for my hands. The medium size fit perfectly, ensuring optimal comfort and performance. For those who tend to run warm, the Deviator Hoodie is an excellent choice for cold-weather activities, offering a balance of warmth and breathability without feeling bulky or restrictive.\n\n I found the combination of hood and beanie to be excessive once I fully warmed up. However, the hood itself is well-designed and provides a snug, comfortable fit without restricting movement or vision. For those seeking a versatile and well-fitting hoodie for cold-weather activities, the Deviator Hoodie is a solid choice.\n\nReference:\n5&apos;6, 175, Chest roughly 38&quot; , size: M",

I&apos;ve had this Jacket for three months and had to wash it after almost every use due to the smell that is retained in the Jacket. I&apos;ve had plenty of other soft shell jackets that have not had to be washed near as often, even after heavier. multi-day use. While I love the fleece on the inside for warmth and comfort, this jacket is not living up to my expectation as an everyday use jacket. Heaven forbid I visit a friends place after an activity, or they visit my house before I can wash the jacket. Great concept, poor delivery for use.",

        "reviewBody": "This thing rocks. Originally, I purchased this to do winter trail runs in, but have since used it to paddle, ice climb, mountain bike, backpack, and travel. I have found the Deviator to be one of the best if not the best light, active piece for me when it is chilly outside. The front/hood fabric has a good DWR and sheds light wind/rain well, while keeping just the right amount of heat in. I have found that it needs to be under 25F while running to keep myself from sweating, but with the other activities, I find it to be very comfortable in the 30-45F range (when I am moving), even if it is windy. The zippers are a little fragile, BUT it is meant to be a lightweight piece. I have found that being patient with and keeping the zippers clean and waxed go a long way. I am a Medium/Large and bought a medium, which worked for me well. Overall, I love this piece. While it is not a replacement for a puffy, It retains way more heat than I expected for such a light jacket, especially when moving.",

Super light with a very satisfying positive click. Easiest biner to clip a rope into. Great for both racking and alpine draws. 2 downsides. 1. Fat nose makes it hard to do things like unlock an atc in guide mode. 2. The colors. For the love of god please fix this. The colors are super desaturated in real life and only the silver biner matches any other piece of gear. Best biner but is one of there worst looking. How cruel!",

Weighs roughly 14g heavier than a BD MiniWire (making it about 37% heavier), but that difference is outweighed by the larger, easier to handle size, the slightly larger gate opening, and the bent gate shape. Comes in all the colors you&apos;d need for your rack.",

My first priority is to lighten my rack, starting with my collection of carabiners.  It&apos;s a splurge to fill your rack with &quot;color-coded&quot; Helium biners, but considering how long they will last, it is a worthwhile investment.  And for my rack of light weight locking carabiners, I am a longtime devotee of the highly-rated &quot;Petzl Attache 3D Screw-Lock.&quot;",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love this top... except for the ugly and obnoxious logo in a contrasting color (white on black) right in the front center of your chest. I wear IB because it transitions seamlessly from activewear to casual wear. However, the logo screams &quot;workout top&quot; and makes this top unwearable for anything else. IB has added their logo in contrast colors to nearly everything this year (always from/center) and I&apos;ve passed on buying SO many items as a result. Sad. I even tried steaming the logo off (it is NOT removable), and then I colored the white in with a Sharpie (it turned light purple in the wash so I&apos;ll have to re-color it every wash). I checked the new version of this top and now the logo is EMBROIDERED so it will probably itch. It&apos;s a shame since this top is absolute perfection otherwise. 34B slim on top and medium fits me well. The bra band is a bit tight but loosens slightly with wear, and it&apos;s encased in merino (yay!) . Comes with bra inserts. It&apos;s the perfect cropped length to wear with high waist leggings. Please get rid of the logo!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this with the intention of it being my main backcountry ski jacket, and not for rain so I can&apos;t comment on how well it is waterproof. But personally, it is somewhat of a heavy jacket for rainy warm weather. I loved it today in zero temps with a thin fleece hoody and wool shirt on underneath. I was a little concerned about how the stiff, tall collar would feel on my face, but it was great coverage and roomy enough so my neck gator fit underneath it just fine. I sized up in this jacket because I need to layer and went with XL which meant it was fairly long and covered my bum, but still surprisingly close fitting around the hips which is common for me in OR tops. It is a great weight for cold backcountry ski days, lighter than my older OR Skytour shell but heavier than the Motive. I am posting a photo. Love the color too. In the photo I also have on the insulated Snowcrew ski pants which were toasty on this bitter cold day!",

        "reviewBody": "I ordered US size 2.5 for my daughter. The Mondo size was 20.5 for the Nitro Droid BOA US 2.5. But I took out the liner to see how big it is, and it&apos;s the same length as a pair of toddler size 12 mary janes. (I attached a photo) I always order up a couple of sizes for my daughter because her feet are wide and picky, but for these I&apos;d have to order up 3-4 sizes for them to fit her. Right now she wears street shoe size 13ish, and the 2.5 made her toes curl. On top of that, it didn&apos;t hold her heel in, so I don&apos;t think these are the right boots for her. \n\nLuckily the size 2 Thirty Two boots I also ordered actually fit with room (they&apos;re a mondo size 21, which bigger than the Nitro even though the US size is smaller) so we will go with those. She says those hold her heels in too. To compare, she wore the Burton Junior Grom BOA last season in size 1 (but with the room to grow insert taken out, so essentially a size 2 according to Burton) and those probably fit similar to the Nitro 2.5. These are tiny.\n\nThey look quite cute though.",

All attached tags were removed and the product was in a hot mess, clearly the item was previously returned.   Not the quality I&apos;m expecting when paying $200 for a helmet.\n\nNothing wrong with the helmet or the iXS brand, but just plain carelessness on Backcountry on handling and reselling returned items. They don&apos;t have the decency to inspect and repackage returned items neatly.",

I wear a M in Smith, Kask, Lazer, and Abus, so I went with the S/M. This was a bit on the tight side. Other than the sizing, the helmet is wonderful. Great coverage and plenty of venting. I would recommend this with other top brands in the category for sure. \n\n+++++UPDATE+++++\ni adjusted the cradle on the back of the helmet and now it fits beautifully. changing my score from 4 stars to 5 stars.",

        "reviewBody": "Outstanding ski poles. I am a ski instructor and these are my third pair of Leki carbon poles.  I bought them originally for ease of use.  They clip on and off easily and there&apos;s no messing around with straps as you try to get on or off the lifts.  My first pair lasted almost 12 years of heavy use and abuse. They have been used as a teaching tool, skied over, used to help stop runaway skiers, slammed in the trunk, etc. \nI now own two pairs in different lengths depending on skiing conditions. (Leki does make an adjustable length pole but they are aluminum).  So, if you are looking for an ultra lightweight and durable pole that is much quicker to take on and off -- this is the one.",

The new version no longer has YKK zippers, nor the cool reinforced sleeve by the wrists. All of the pockets now have mesh instead of fabric. I understand these production cuts were likely due to inflation, but it is disappointing.",

The seams and zippers are too robust for the very light and airy fabric, and so it feels clunky. This fabric is amazingly breathable but the zips and seams thing was a dealbreaker. OR puts out lots of great pieces, this one just missed it for me!",

With a need for stability shoes to accomodate my wide feet, New Balance is always my go to when it comes to running shoes. I used to run exclusively in 680s but made the switch to Hierro last year. It was the best decision. They are super supportive with the Vibram shock absorption and even after 15kms of running each week for the past year - they&apos;ve still held up well - they last so long and are super durable. Hope the Hierro will always be a mainstay because this will be my go to running shoes from now on.",

        "reviewBody": "I have the Exos from like 7 years ago, I think 2 or 3 models ago. The ones that came out after my version had a mix of materials for the side and front stretch pockets. Mine is all stretch mesh which I prefer. I also have the hip belt pockets but I think they are smaller than the pockets on this new version. I am very happy with my Exos and love the vented back panel and having the option to remove the brain/lid to make it a smaller bag when needed. I have even used it as a day bag when the brain is removed. If you are on the fence between this 48L and the 38L, look at the dimensions, this one is only an inch wider. I am sure there are improvements on this new model but I am really happy with my old version. If you aren&apos;t someone that counts every ounce possible, this is a great pack. It is in a good price range for all you get with this bag. It is lighter than most packs in it&apos;s size range, has a lot of external storage pockets, internal frame, and has the best ventilated back panel I have used.",

Returned the item got a refund which was nice. \n\nAlso hate the one zipper-less side pocket. You still need two hands to get stuff out of it so why bother taking out the zips?\n\nNice and light though, but that",

        "reviewBody": "I bought the Exos Pro 55 last September, used it for multiple Fall trips in the Sierras, and loved it! At barely over 2 lbs, it&apos;s a real ultralight pack. With its frame, it really does hold the weight well, even up to 30 lbs though I usually carry less. The mesh back panel keeps me cool, and the whole pack fits like a glove. I&apos;ve had no sore spots at all. It&apos;s light enough to use as my summit pack, too, after removing the top lid (2.6 oz). My iPhone 13 fits fine in the hip belt pocket, and the side pockets keep my water bottles secure. I&apos;ve taken it through miles of trees, bushes, scrambling over boulders, etc... and the material has held up well. No tears at all. There&apos;s nothing I don&apos;t like about this pack. At 55L, it&apos;s plenty large for multi-day trips. I&apos;m so glad Osprey came out with this improvement to the Exos series (I also own an Exos 58, but like the Pro 55 much better).",

        "reviewBody": "I switched from the Exos 58 (M) to the Exos Pro 55 (S/M) - I&apos;ve had this pack for just over 9 months and really like that it&apos;s a lighter and easier to pack than the Exos 58 but am surprised by the updates as several are a step backwards and unnecessary (as they&apos;re not weight saving) - compression straps are on top of the side pockets, limiting pocket usability; attaching compression straps limits access to the front stuff pocket; the side pockets aren&apos;t waterproof and hold rainwater; the zipper belt pocket cannot be opened &amp; closed one-handed; they removed the extra (underside) brain pocket; the base of the backpack needs thicker material; the toggles to adjust shoulder straps dislodge regularly when taking the packing on &amp; off. I&apos;m also not a fan of the new Osprey sizing as I have a 20.5&quot; torso - at the cusp of being too big for the S/M, but the L/XL was huge on me and sat way too high!\n\nHoping that Osprey fixes these for the next generation of Exos Pro (as most were already on the Exos 58!)",

It&apos;s comfortable, light and breathable. Love the hip pocket without the zipper. Perfect for quick snacks. Cons: the edge seam running horizontal across the top of the large, stretchy pocket on the outside of the pack is starting to fray. This area has not gotten a lot of rubbing or abuse. It generally holds a visor. Also, the small toggle type fasteners that allow you to adjust the pack length came out of the slot a couple times when taking off or putting on the pack. I ended up taping them.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this jacket online in a size small so I could not try it on first. I already own an OR Aspire Gore-Tex jacket in size small and it fits okay thru the chest. I use the Aspire as a rain jacket in mild and warm temps so I rarely wear an insulating layer under it. This Carbide jacket is too snug in the chest so it is not possible to wear an insulating layer underneath it. I bought the Carbide jacket to wear during the cold, snowy winter months in Michigan. I will have to return it. Apparently OR has changed their size dimensions in recent years so a size small no longer fits me properly. I am 5&apos;4&quot; and 115 pounds. Be forewarned: this Carbide jacket is NOT a &quot;standard fit&quot; but rather a &quot;slim fit&quot;. Also, the front zipper is difficult to fit into the slot at the bottom so it takes several attempts to get it started so you can zip this jacket up. I would have loved wearing this stylish jacket to snowshoe and hike had it fit me properly as the pretty green color is one of my favorite colors.",

        "reviewBody": "I did a ton of research before selecting the Carbide jacket. I had to go up a size, the medium was smaller than expected, but I love the fit of the large! So many great pockets on this. The main zipper does take some effort and is not smooth. I&apos;ve worn this skiing twice in really really cold weather (insulated jacket under) and I&apos;ve been perfectly comfortable. I love the color, I got the lilac. I usually go with black because I don&apos;t want dirt to show, but I&apos;m so happy with the purple. The hood cinches are all great for modifying with or without a ski helmet. Also love the premium features like the snow skirt and armpit zips. This will be perfect for year-round use. I&apos;m so happy with my purchase.",

Last year returned a Flylow coat twice for a different size and still wasn&apos;t comfortable. I am a girl with bigger hips, thighs, and butt. The outdoor research coat fits my body well as a top layer and goes over my hips without looking tight. In addition, when layering the coat doesn&apos;t make me feel like a suffocated marshmallow. I also wear outdoor research bibs, so I knew I was going to be a fan of the non-insulated design, but I really like the thickness of the coat. Sadly, I haven&apos;t tested the waterproofness due to lack of snow, but when some flurries came down the coat didn&apos;t seem to care. Lastly, the color I&apos;m a big fan of. I was worried it would be too pink, but it&apos;s that perfect subdue pink that looks great with my black pants! Overall I&apos;m stoked with OR gear and I&apos;m excited to see what&apos;s next!",

I am an average skier staying in greens and blues. I have not worn this jacket besides those two ski trips as I live in a warm climate. There is so much pilling under the arms and on the back of the jacket. This is not normal wear and tear, especially with this type of fabric. I called customer service and was told this is covered under the &quot;lifetime&quot; warranty. After waiting weeks for a warranty response, turns out OR will not honor their warranty. I was told to wash it inside out (it&apos;s barely been worn and doesn&apos;t need to be washed), hand wash it, or use a pilling shaver! This is not a washing issue. This is a quality issue. Fabric should not pill this quickly, especially on a jacket that is meant to be worn for outdoor activity. I am so disappointed in this jacket and the lack of warranty.",

To my surprise these shoes turned out to be the best soft fitting aggressive shoe for my Greek feet. Fitting wise theses feel like the Scarpa Instinct VSRs with slightly tighter toe area and heel; widthwise. The toe rubber is a little more relaxed than the VSRs which took a while to break in for the big toe knuckle area. Forefoot area I would say it&apos;s about the same as the VSR&apos;s. Stiffness wise, they are softish shoes and somewhere between the Evolv Zenists and Instinct VSR. Maybe a little bit stiffer than the Dragos which I&apos;ve tried in US 9.5. The other shoes in my arsenal are Evolv Shaman, Zenists (US10.5), Instinct VSR(US9.5), UP Moccs (US9).",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been using this pack for a few years, and it&apos;s a solid lightweight option under the 3 lb. mark, but could also use some improvements. It carries weight fairly well for when your base weight is low, but you still have to hump 6 days of food and 3 liters of water. However I often do wish the hipbelt had a little thicker padding/structure. Also, sometimes the metal wire frame hits and rubs my back &amp; sides. Speaking of, the wire frame extends to the bottom sides, which is covered by a fabric, which despite being thicker, is showing quite a bit of wear from every time I set the pack down on its bottom. Could use a better design here, perhaps bending the wire frame in to meet behind the lumbar pad. \n\nThe back panel is nice and breathable, but the bottom of it is slick and tends to slide down my back when sweating. Adding the grippy silicone accents to the bottom lumber area (like on the Baltoros) should be a standard feature on all Gregorys. Shoulder straps are fine.\n\nThe packbag is simple and straightforward, which I appreciate. Gregory has too many models that all have the same sleeping bag compartment zipper and other access that just add weight and never get used (by me anyway). The fabric is lightweight and has held up well, though doesn&apos;t inspire as much confidence as some of their other packs. I really do wish they&apos;d use a better stretch mesh with a tighter weave as the current stuff scuffs through and can snag easily. I&apos;ve never used the straps across the bottom of the pack, and think those could be cut.  \n\nThe Polygiene odor control really works and is so nice to not have a pack smell like trail B.O. when you bring it home. I&apos;m glad the top pocket is removable, but do wish the zipper had a wider (L-shaped) opening. Due to the lighter fabrics and lack of structure opening it is a two-handed affair. \n\nLastly, I don&apos;t care for the neon blue color accents that make it feel like a little kids school pack. Stick to the classy more monotone or colorblocking, especially that Alaska Blue of the Baltoro. But overall it&apos;s been a solid lightweight pack option. Just look forward to a few improvements on the next gen.",

While this will not replace my bigger Osprey packs, I will be using this pack frequently for one or 2 night trips. The fabric is tough but light, the exterior pouch on the back is very large and stretchy and the hip pockets are awesome! The only complaint I would have is that the system they used to attach a pad or chair to the bottom of your pack is not as secure as a buckle/synch system. It is not the end of the world, especially since the side water bottle holders are capable of holding loads of things...you might just have to pack things a bit differently than some other packs you frequently use. Overall, if you are looking for an budget friendly option to get yourself into more of the ultralight backpacking space, this is a great option and a great pack!",

        "reviewBody": "Love my Gregory Focal 48. Been using it all summer and it helped me get my base weight way down. Great synch and release system for the main compartment (other manufacturers take note, that’s how it should be done). Thought I would miss having multiple compartments but there’s a simplicity to having just one. Nylofume bag at the bottom wrapped up for bedding and clothes, everything else on top.  Just have to be mindful when loading each day. Leave rain gear and shorts up top if needed.  Thought the Free Float system was just marketing hype, but I can feel a difference, no more hip soreness (although I’m also carrying less weight) and had good mobility when doing some lite scrambling. Back ventilation and side pockets for Smart water bottles are excellent.  I ditched the brain on the last few trips and again there’s a simplicity to keeping that stuff in a diddy bag instead. The Focal is so easy to open and close it’s no big deal to keep it near the top if you need to get into it. Hip Belt pockets are pretty small, and the pocket under the hip belt pockets for tucking belt straps is fairly useless (I ended up just trimming the belt straps) Overall highly recommended.",

I wanted something that would strike a balance between the two, and the Focal 48 delivered. It’s only a little over half a pound heavier than the HMG, but significantly more comfortable and supportive. I got the basic features back, like mesh back panel, accessible water bottle holders, and a brain, but nothing too excessive like many other traditional packs. \r\n\r\nI took the Focal out on a challenging multi-day trip in southern Utah, and it performed great. Carried like a champ, held everything I needed, and felt very intuitive to use. Not to mention, the pack looks awesome.  \r\n\r\nFor those choosing between the 48l and 58l, I have a base weight around 16 lbs. My gear is mostly lightweight and packable, and with a good amount of food, I had plenty of room leftover in the 48L.\r\n\r\nFor sizing reference, I’m 6 feet, 32 inch waist, 21 inch torso and the medium size fits great. \r\n\r\nThis pack is a home run from Gregory!",

Carries a stable load that is neither too high, nor wide. \nI’m not a huge fan of the Gregory-only water bladder system, but I use water bottles 99% of the time, so not a big deal for me. \nI like this pack so much, we bought the women’s version (Facet 45) for my wife.",

        "reviewBody": "Having used Motorex lubes for years on my KTM&apos;s, I bought this lube with the intent of utilizing it for light road lube.  Big mistake.  This lube is better suited to offroad use as it requires dust to cling to it and pull it off the drivetrain, similar to Dumonde Tech lubes.  If you use it on your road bike, it leaves a grinding film on the chain that basically ruins the entire drivetrain by creating a gritty paste. Even wiping this lube after application and after rides, it does not come off.  It cost me two Dura Ace chains and cassettes to learn the hard way.  Steer clear if you&apos;re planning on using this for road.  Can&apos;t speak to it&apos;s offroad use, but should perform similar to Dumonde Tech regular lube.",

I like the tight fit, and they&apos;re still comfortable to wear after moving around in them all day.  Not to mention they just look sweet.  Definitely recommend these shoes!",

I&apos;m keeping the cap because it&apos;s nice, I like it, but come on Marmot, take accurate color photos of your clothing!

        "reviewBody": "I do like this vest. It is lightweight but provides some warmth for cool days.  It is also quite packable.  The vest is not insulated enough for super cold days, but for me it works best in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s (F). The black looks nice and can even be worn as casual wear. I wish it had a drawstring on the bottom to cinch it tight around the waist to keep in the warmth. And a chest pocket would also be nice. However, overall it&apos;s a nice basic vest that feels well made. \n\nNOTE WELL: the sizing of this vest is off. I usually wear a large in Outdoor Research clothing (which I have much of!). However, this large fits like an extra-large.  So I had to do an exchange to get a medium. It&apos;s not the end of the world, but it&apos;s slightly frustrating.",

Great for days when I don&apos;t want to pack a full puffy but want something I can throw under a shell just in case I get a bit chilled, and it takes up no space in an alpine pack or even a running vest. I&apos;m 6&apos; - 170lbs and a medium fits perfectly.",

        "reviewBody": "I can think of use cases for this vest because it is very lightweight, but I have to strain to think of them. It is light in weight, but it adds very minimal warmth, degraded even further by the lack of sealing around the arm holes and waist. I believe the SuperStrand is marketed as an alternative to down, but with the amount of insulation actually present, that is a ridiculous comparison. The insulation in this jacket appears to be comprised of a single, very thin sheet. (I have a down jacket of about the same weight that is perhaps 5 to 10 times warmer.) Pro&apos;s ----- Very light (around 6 oz) Very thin Easy to wear under another layer because it is very thin and also doesn&apos;t have sleeves Takes up minimal space when compressed Interior drop pockets on each side Hand pockets feel soft Con&apos;s ----- Very little insulation (almost no loft) No elastic or seal mechanism around arm holes: heat loss. Best to wear a jacket over it to encourage sealing No drawcord or elastic around waist Would like it a two inches shorter in front so it doesn&apos;t bunch up when sitting Hand pockets blocked by backpack waist belt No chest pocket(s) Fabric is non-breathable Sizing: I think Outdoor Research sizing tends to run large compared to other outdoor brands.",

        "reviewBody": "They look great.   Stylish, well crafted, heavy-duty lug sole, a little heavy, high quality.  They have a very interesting and secure magnetic latch that binds the straps together.  A possible problem for me is the latch (where the red tab is) has a sturdy flat plastic bit (fyi, a leather bit rests between the plastic bit and the skin) about an inch wide and 1.5 inch long that hits the cupola of my foot very close to my ankle on one foot in a firm and slightly uncomfortable way.  Not sure how it will break in because its a solid plastic hardware bit.  Maybe if the strap it attaches too were longer so it could slide more to the side, rather than it being on top of the highest point of my foot?  But wow, it&apos;s a  good looking shoe and feels amazing otherwise.  Im still testing it/deciding.  I really like everything else about the shoes.",

The divider between the main body of the bag and front pocket is supposed to be able to hold a jacket. It’s simply too small unless you are probably an Extra Small size. Even then if you managed to get a jacket in the space you compress the rest of the main body that you can’t get anything in the main body. the front pocket has no stretch to it so it is very difficult to get a hand into it if anything is at the bottom of the pocket. \r\n\r\nShould I have bought the 28L version? Probably as the 24L is just too small it has become a very utilitarian backpack due to its design.",

        "reviewBody": "I previously have been using an older CamelBak Lobo, which works well but has minimal gear storage space, and I needed something bigger for road trips or longer rides. This pack is of excellent quality, you can tell it was designed specifically for mountain bikers. It has enough room for any tools I need to carry, plus holds an extra layer, snacks and my camera gear. The magnetic clip holds well; I&apos;ve never had the bite valve break loose yet. I run a gimbal and GoPro on my chest while biking, and I was concerned about the magnets being too close to the gimbal and messing up the electronics inside it, but the sternum strap sits way higher up on the chest than I thought it would, so this isn&apos;t an issue at all. A little pricey compared to larger, non-biking specific packs from Osprey, but it&apos;s worth it, as this pack sits tight on your back, doesn&apos;t get in the way, and doesn&apos;t move around much unless the trails get really rowdy.",

I wear Kavu shorts so I knew to swing a size up (normally a 36 but I ordered 38).  They are slightly too big but that’s what I expected as a 36 would’ve been too small.  There is no inseam but I’d put it at a 33-34”.  The cool thing about these pants other than the accent color of the corner reinforcements is the extra layer of material on the knee is open at the top making another pocket on both thighs.  Overall 👍👍",

Potentially making for a very embarrassing situation. \n\nThere are no belt loops to back up the incorporated waist band tie. \n\nI am 6ft, 183lbs and usually wear 32 waist and I have a runners build.  These fit skin tight across the hips and thighs.  Putting a pair of soft shell gloves in the thigh pocket was to tight and unconformable. \n\nThey ride low in the back.  Especially when you bend forward. \n\nI tested these in the mountains and they did not pass.  I am getting ride of them. \n\nRecommendations\n1.  Use a button of more durable fastener.\n2. Add belt loops to back up the integrated waist tie. \n3. Add about 3 cm to the back up the pant.\n4. Add more material across the hips and thighs to accommodate athletics built people.",

Windproof, waterproof, comfortable, longer in the back fit like other Mountain Hardwear jackets i&apos;ve purchased. Love it.",

It was meant to be a replacement to my last bad$&amp;@ shell from Mountain Hardwear, the Sharkstooth something or other, and so far it is doing just that!\n\nMy only hope is that Mountain Hardwear will be able to move away from Goretex soon so we can all stay dry without worrying about the environmental impact of it.",

        "reviewBody": "If your feet are narrow and low volume, these shoes will serve you better than any other.  My feet are super narrow but about 11.5/12 length, but also quite flat and low volume.  You know, like flippers.  Tenayas in general fit my foot type better than any other brand.  I spent 3 years trying different brands and models and could never find something that was both technical and comfortable.  Once I tried on Tenayas about 8 years ago, I haven?t looked back.  I didn?t think they could get better until they put this model out.  I?m on my third pair and cycle in between the Mundaka and Iati.  They are soft and sensitive- especially if you have larger feet, but I feel more secure heel hooking in these than any other shoe by far.  Edging is a bit harder, but you can feel more- so it?s a trade off.  It?s worth it for the comfort and overall technical prowess of this shoe.  If you have flippers, you should snag a pair.  I?m just slightly smaller than a 12 in street shoes, and I wear a 10.5 in Oasi LV.  They typically have a 2 session break in period where they?re a bit snug at first then hug my feet perfectly when broken in.  You?ll thank me for this review my freakish, flipper-footed friends!",

        "reviewBody": "On this site I found out that these shoes are in men&apos;s sizing. Additionally, they run large. I&apos;m a women so I downsize 2 sizes to get the shoe I actually need. So for me, my street shoe is 5.5 womens, so I buy a 3.5mens for a snug fit. (3.5mens =4.5 womens). \n\nI accidentally bought a 4.5 mens which = a 5.5 womens, thinking it was a women&apos;s 4.5 and had to return them because they are too big, even with socks. (there is a gap in the heel). \n\nI wish they would put the mens and womens sizing equivalents next to each other for maximum clarity on what you are getting. (amazon does this) Or add the EU or UK sizing.\n\nOasi&apos;s are awesome and are great once you get the sizing right. \n\nSidenote: You would think that &quot;A new version of the Oasi specifically adapted to the anatomy of the female foot.&quot; (Tenaya website)  would be in womens sizing, but the patriarchy wins again.

It is important to distinguish these two sizes so as to prevent snagging and tearing the rope&apos;s sheath.

So the very name of this product is totally misleading and contributes to overall misunderstanding of climbing terms. Please change the name of this product.\r\n\r\nThe “snag free” shroud has already become snagged in small bolt hangers and pitons repeatedly. I actually had to pound the carabiner out of a bolt hanger with a hammer to get it out. The shroud is just too big.",

          "Thank you for your review. Sorry to hear you found the product to be misleading. We sell these Alpine Quickdraws so that folks don&apos;t need to pick up the carabiners and runners separately. Securing the rope end would make it so the sling would need to be one length, making it less versatile for alpine needs.\nAs for the issues with clipping small bolt hangers and pitons, I have experienced this with older hardware at Smith Rock. In my experience, they are generally scenarios in which only one or two pieces have a small eyelet. Not a bad idea to carry smaller carabiners in the event that you&apos;re going to be clipping older hardware. Given that these are the smallest ones we make, you may need to look into a different manufacturer. In any case your feedback is appreciated!"

Between my carryon suitcase and this back pack, I have more than enough packing space! My favorite feature is the day bag that attaches to the front of the main back pack. This will be perfect for day hikes to store water and lunches in without having to carry the full backpack and add the extra unnecessary weight. Material seems to be durable and water resistant, which is exactly what I need for the type of traveling I will be doing.",

        "reviewBody": "Every centimeter of the Thule Landmark backpack is designed and crafted with intelligent thoroughness. All the people who brought this product idea to fruition deserves an instant bonus and/or promotion. There is no backpack I’ve owned that is as exceptional as this product. \r\n\r\nThe first brilliant innovation, the dual-pack system which can attach to both back and front, is not only aesthetically awesome, but also very useful for times I don’t need to carry many things with me. I love every aspect of the design. It is obvious upon the first few moments of examining the bag that a lot of effort went into this product, and the quality speaks for itself. The zipper locks, the hardtop case for electronics and sunglasses, the backpack strap pockets which buckles tuck into, the quality of materials, and the way in which everything seamlessly fits together is amazing to me. I’ve owned Osprey and Eagle Creek bags (which are not companies to scoff at), but Thule really outdid themselves with this product design. I am very satisfied with my purchase, and look forward to everything else they have in store for the future. Please keep up the phenomenal work!! Merry Christmas and may God bless your team.",

        "reviewBody": "I traveled for 3 months with this backpack.\r\n\r\nGood parts:\r\n\r\n- It has a nice muted style without too many straps hanging around, if that&apos;s important to you (it was to me).\r\n\r\n- It&apos;s roomy. I was able to pack for hot &amp; cold weather, for hiking and going out in cities.\r\n\r\n- Never a problem bringing the 40L on a flight as a carry-on, even when a gate agent would ask to inspect it beforehand.\r\n\r\nShortcomings I found:\r\n\r\n- The &quot;CashStash&quot; compartment inside the 40L is where you&apos;re supposed to fit things like your passport and your emergency money. It&apos;s impossible to get to and slide your hand into once your bag is packed. I ended up using the &quot;CashStash&quot; of the 20L exclusively, as it is accessible from the outside of the bag (this only works if your 20L isn&apos;t packed inside your 40L).\r\n\r\n- When laid horizontally on the ground, the part of the 40L that touches the floor is the same one that you wear on your back. Unlike the Osprey Farpoint, there is no cover you can zip up over the shoulder straps when not in use/as a floor protection. Now imagine wanting to change clothes in an airport bathroom stall when the floor tiles are a little bit wet...\r\n\r\n- A feature is the ability to tuck away the shoulder straps &amp; hip belts when not in use. This is too challenging to do when the bag is packed, as you&apos;re trying to jam the straps between two compressed layers of bag material. It&apos;s also difficult to fold/tuck the left &amp; right sides in the same manner, leading to uneven &quot;bumps&quot; in the bag surface (uncomfortable when worn). I ended up keeping the straps loose for 3 months as a result.\r\n\r\n- The main bag has an externally-accessible side pocket that Thule claims can hold a water bottle. The problem is that the pocket digs into the bag&apos;s contents, and if the bag is anywhere near full, the pocket can&apos;t &quot;dig&quot; and you can&apos;t use it.\r\n\r\n- The chest straps can&apos;t be attached securely to the shoulder straps (a very baffling design choice). Reviews had mentioned this- I naively thought I would simply pay extra attention to not losing them. Yet I did... on my second day traveling. As the backpack combo comes with 2 pairs (one for each backpack), I ended up stuffing away the remaining pair and only took it out when necessary (annoying).\r\n\r\n- The 20L lacks ways to organize your stuff inside of it. There&apos;s a laptop pouch, and that&apos;s it. Anything you put in there like clothes, cables, battery bank, etc. will get jumbled up.\r\n\r\n- The 20L backpanel isn&apos;t breathable at all. Expect to be soaked everywhere the bag makes contact with your body from the lightest 10-min walk.\r\n\r\n- The &quot;SafeZone&quot; compartment where you&apos;re supposed to stash your sunglasses and other fragile items isn&apos;t all that strong. I don&apos;t know exactly how it broke, but through the course of being handled by myself and bus operators, the top part became soft/not protective anymore. It feels like what happens when you fold a piece of cardboard and then try to straighten it out.\r\n\r\n- This isn&apos;t an advertised feature of the combo, but in case you are wondering like I was prior to purchasing, they are absolutely not waterproof. I quickly learned having to line backpack contents in plastic bags.\r\n\r\n- Last but not least, the material or construction quality doesn&apos;t seem high.

It was the perfect size for his iPad, headphones, water bottle, and collection of toys and souvenirs from our trip. It is in perfect condition after traveling across Italy for two weeks and it was so cute on him - definitely recommend and I’m glad we added it for this trip (and hopefully many more in the future!).",

        "reviewBody": "I used the Kohana 6 for two weeks of camping in Dinosaur National Monument two summers ago.  I experienced a couple days and nights of thunderstorms with high winds and pounding rain.  The tent was fully staked and guyed out with the fly properly attached including all Velcro pole attachment loops on the underside.    No leaks whatsoever.  The fly did a great job..  The only negative was  that the poles slightly deformed due to days of hammering winds.  Still very usable, but the tent is now slightly asymmetrical when set up.  I&apos;ve experienced this with other large two-pole aluminum poled &quot;x&quot; dome tents under similar circumstances in the past, so it&apos;s probably a weakness of the simple pole structure design when mated to a large tent with big winded surfaces.  That said, there&apos;s a lot to like about the simplicity of setting up and taking down a two-pole tent that would be lost by the addition of additional poles for greater rigidity.",

It started raining a little before midnight and rained off and on until 2pm the next day. It wasn&apos;t torrential but steady with short breaks. By the morning, the tent was leaking in multiple spots, all of them where something was sewn to the fly, like the toggle for the vestibule door or the velcro straps to hold fly on.

        "reviewBody": "After doing much research online for a new 6 person tent, I decided on the Kohana 6. My decision for this tent was: \r\n1) Wanted a tent with a full fly. Tired of tents with the fly not going down all the way on the sides of the tent and water leaking in.  Kohana has a full fly.\r\n2) With the full fly, I still wanted ventilation on a hot night when it is raining and I have the fly closed.  The Kohana has great ventilation with it&apos;s two vestibules and it&apos;s two fly vents.  Can breath in the tent even in a down pour.\r\n3) Easy to set up.  Very easy for one person to set up. I watched the video and did a practice run in my yard before my camping trip.  Once I went camping, I had it set up in 20 minutes by myself and that was taking my time.\r\n\r\nSo I went camping with it the third week of July 2021.  After I got it set up, the rain was brutal.  Continued for 24 hours.  The inside of my Kohana was totally dry.  Very impressive.  And I was still able to breath in it due to the great ventilation.\r\nAbout 2 am, I heard a large noise and my tent collapsed on me.  My first thought was &quot;I can&apos;t believe that my new tent collapsed from the weight of the rain&quot;.  Wrong.  A massive tree limb broke right above the tent and fell on it. And me. The tent held and the limb touched me at first but the tent &quot;pushed&quot; it back a foot off of me so I was able to push it off from the inside.  Basically the tent kept me from getting crushed.  I checked the next morning, and it was a BIG tree limb.  No tears in the tent but one of the poles was slightly bent.  The pole did it&apos;s job.  It bent but didn&apos;t break so I did not get hurt.\r\n\r\nI called Eureka when I got  home and told them what happened and asked if I could buy a new pole.  Customer Service paid for me to ship the whole tent back and they sent me a brand new Kohana 6 for the cost of a new pole.  A tree falling on the tent is obviously not covered under warranty so this was Eureka Customer Service going above and beyond. Obviously, I recommend both the Kohana 6 and Eureka Customer Service to my fullest with all sincerity.... \r\nThanks...H.",

        "reviewBody": "I normally don&apos;t write reviews but after a 6 day camping trip, must say, this tent deserves some love. For the money, it&apos;s really fabulous. Some excellent features: \r\n1. Well-placed interior pockets that are edge banded (not purely mesh like on my Big Agnes tent).\r\n2. 2 large doors with D zipper pattern.\r\n3. Great vestibule. Symmetric design with front &amp; back vestibules. Large vestibules areas when fully zipped - could hold a ton of gear under the rain fly. Nice open entryway with extension poles. (see photos with custom poles from broom handles.)\r\n4. Exterior pocket on both front and back!  At first I thought an exterior pocket was weird. I was wrong. It&apos;s extremely handy as a staging area to collect items you want inside the tent at a later time, but perhaps you don&apos;t want to let bugs in or wear down the zipper for each item.\r\n5. Color. The orange - mint - dark turqoise combo is gorgeous. \r\n6. The carrying bag is unique. It has separate zipped compartments for the main tent and rain fly and smaller interior compartments for the stakes + guylines. I would have preferred two handles for carrying, rather than the single strap, but it&apos;s a cool idea overall.",

The top center height is actually less than 72 inches and that is right in the center. there is about a 36 by 36 head area for standing and it is less than 72 inches. I have been use to camping in the past with people in the past with larger and higher conditions. I bought this tent for mainly now camping alone, since my camping people have passed. So I was not aware of the dimensional conditions of this style. nevertheless, it is easy to put up and the design of the fly should keep me dry. I love that I can put up the front and back vestibule flaps on poles. There are plenty of pockets inside for storage. Over all it is a superb tent worth the price.",

This is my first experience with tubeless tires and I hope it’s not an indicator on how poorly they hold up. These tires only lasted last a few months and the back tire is ready for the garbage can. Not worth the money at all wish I had bought a gator skin or something different.",

Bought this for my XC rocket due to light weight and on sale for a killer price so wouldn&apos;t be too hurt if it was junk.  Paired with a Wolftooth trigger and it works great.  It is smooth and has zero play (other 4 droppers have slight play).  People complain it isn&apos;t &apos;as fast as other droppers&apos; but it hasn&apos;t been noticeable riding. At the sales price this is a steal for XC weight watchers programs. Fit the bill for me.",

I don’t even understand when to use a dropper post so it’s of little use to me but I didn’t want the groms laughing at me having a rigid post. Anyway, this post is light with no play so I am very satisfied with that. It does seem to extend slowly but I’m ok with that since I don’t really use it.",

        "reviewBody": "These are great, and super lightweight and comfortable out of the box! They even performed great on the trail. Also that white and orange color scheme looks absolutely fire, and I love the polka dotted shoelaces!\nI&apos;m not usually into maximally cushioned shoes, but I honestly really liked these. They are super light, but have tons of support too as another Gearhead mentioned - a nice stiff sole with a cushy footbed. They were even supportive enough for my feet and ankles to hit the trail. Not rock plate needed with that thick cushioned, protective sole! On Cloud has extensive tech in their air light sole - they are known as a top designer in this space for a reason and where they get the name from! The cubed sole you&apos;ll see on nearly all of their shoes is made of a special firm EVA (On Cloud calls it the Zero Gravity foam) with an open air pocket in the middle of the midsole and hollowed out cubes that are cut down the line of the shoe, which adds flexibility than most typical shoe soles.\n\nFor my couple hour run, I encountered some snow and mud and rocks. My feet never got too hot. These Monsters ventilate and breathe super well, which is important for me. They are also very responsive, so I was able to be precise on the trail. Also great for just strolling around the neighborhood. Did I mention how fire they look? I mean, just check out the pics! Also run true to size for my size 10 foot.",

        "reviewBody": "I have loved the Cloudmonsters ever since they came out. I got a chance to try these new Cloudmonster 2s early and love them even more than the original! On the original, I was right in between sizes and ended up wearing a 9.5 instead of my regular 9, but in this model, the 9 fits me perfect! I&apos;m not sure if the length was changed or if there&apos;s just more fabric in the top toe area, but either way, I&apos;m a pretty true 9 in running shoes and the 9 in these is perfect. If On shoes are typically too narrow for you, these are the exception with a wider toe box that will fit a much broader range of people. Other than the fit being better for me, I also appreciate the improved lacing system. The footbed in these is absolutely perfect. They are so plush and comfortable, but not TOO soft. I&apos;ve tried other running shoes that are plush but have too much cushion and feel like marshmallows and end up hurting my calves, but these are the perfect balance of being comfortable yet supportive. I couldn&apos;t dial them in any better if I tried. I rate these at a 10/10 as they check every box for me. If you have any questions about these or any On products, feel free to reach out to me at amcclary@backcountry.com or 801-204-4562.",

        "reviewBody": "It always should be said to choose the proper tool for the job.  With respect to traction in turns and on the damp, these tires are legit.  I doubled up and ran DHR II both in the front and rear.  Still getting a feel for it but so far I think it is just as good as a DHF/DHR combo.  I push about 25psi/26psi front to rear (195lbs).\n\nI am notorious for being rough on tires and tend to slice side walls in the chunky stuff here in CO.  I switched to Bontrager SE4 and they stood up well.\n\nSo why come back to Maxxis and if you are rough on tires why go with a tan sidewall which is less durable...\nBecause it will lighten things up weight wise,, but really because it looks dope as hell.\n\nI&apos;m working on line choice this summer and sparing my bikes trauma.  I&apos;ll look good while doing it.",

First, the waist has become significantly larger after wearing them, and I wish they had drawstrings or some way to tighten it. While I have hips to keep them up, they might slip down for other women with slimmer figures. Additionally, they tend to pill a lot, especially in areas where the seatbelt rubs or around the backside where they come into contact with my backpack. A fabric shaving is helpful but I have not figured out how to tighten the waist yet",

What I soon realized is that they are designed for standing and not for sitting.  After 3 hours on the water I needed to quit (and I was on the bite too!) because the pants were SO tight in my crotch.  Before buying the Endurance Pants, I made sure I spent some time seated in a kayak at the shop.  Much more comfortable and it gives me pleasure to see claims of ?designed for paddlers? really is true.  These are worth the investment.",

BUT this pack makes it worth it with the difference in comfort and support. I find the stiff back panel and multiple cinch points at the shoulders, hips, and along the back panel really help you distribute the load perfectly… which makes it seem like you are carrying less weight! After maybe a dozen big outings with this pack, I have found it might be the best weight distributing pack I have owned - even for loads up to 50 lbs. \n\nThis pack is a quiver-killer, it is like the child of an UL pack and a modern backpacking bag, taking the best features from both. Highly recommend.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve been using my Scarpa Goldengate 2 several weeks for my daily trail walk/hike and I love them! My route is up and down hills over exposed tree roots and rocks as well as gravel and dirt. These shoes handle all surfaces equally well. The fit in the heel is solid and stable and the toe box is roomy and wide enough for my forefoot to move naturally. This is my first pair of Scarpa shoes, I am impressed with how well they are working for me. I chose the size based on their recommendation, I normally wear women’s 9.5 and bought the 41.5. The 41 probably would have been fine as well but I am happy with the 41.5.",

My only complaint is that the waist strap needs to be several inches longer -- the reason I sized up is that it was a struggle to get on without completely unbuckling. I don&apos;t have particularly wide hips, and the S is almost too big in the waist, but that&apos;s the tradeoff.",

It feels like a great quality and is very comfortable to wear. The quick adjust on the leg loops is super easy and nice. My only complaint is that I felt like the padding, while providing comfort, also didn&apos;t breathe as well and therefore found myself getting warmer and sweatier than I have previously experienced in other harnesses. Otherwise I think this is great and I&apos;m pumped to have my first harness! (couldn&apos;t beat the price on this in the outlet either)",

The finish inside and out feels high quality.\n\nThere is elastic to tighten the hood around your skull, but there is no longer a way to cinch the hood opening. I like to be able to fully seal out the cold and wind and would use this feature especially when not wearing the hood to seal the neck.\n\nThe waist elastic is only able to tighten via an adjustment slider in the right pocket. If you like it cinched tight like I do, the cord will be very long in your pocket.",

The &quot;rip&quot; opening is convenient and a great design. I&apos;d say closing it is a little cumbersome, you have to do it in two separate pulls for each side - you can see the guy in the video fumble a little, too - but the easy access is nice. I thought I would want a real, full closure instead of just the magnets, but so far so good.\r\n\r\nBurly - almost over-reinforced, which doesn&apos;t seem necessary for such a little pack, but will likely last forever and I always appreciate over-engineering for longevity.\r\n\r\nPerfect size - fits more than expected. My 16&quot; laptop and a tablet in the sleeves plus a days worth of layers or extra clothes, binos, camera, whatever. Great little daypack.",

The best feature is obviously the “rip” of the main compartment and how fast you can get access the problem is that closing the lid takes a lot more time and precision than normal backpacks as the lid has to be lined up well. I think perhaps a different, stiffer material than Robic around the zipper area would have been better. There’s also only the outside slip pocket and one mesh pocket inside. That’s it for organization. I wish there was a few more organizational features. Overall, I really like the bag and think it looks cool, but would have liked to see those improvements.",

        "reviewBody": "Glad that I bought the 15L second gen model just before the third gen came out, which looks too space age-y for me. Love the streamlined look of second gen. Have no issues with only one bottle sleeve. Would&apos;ve liked wider inside sleeves for small books or pouches. My main complaint is that the Robic fabric is not robust enough. Dropped my bag sideways and my laptop (with blunt corners) ripped through the unpadded part of the back panel (highlighted in blue in picture). This happens more often than you&apos;d think. I have done this with four bags including this one. The only one that didn&apos;t cause an open rip is another MR with Cordura fabric. So now I put my laptop in another sleeve not to protect the laptop, but to avoid another rip. Short of changing the fabric in future iteration, I&apos;d suggest at least lining the inside of that panel, like the bottom of the bag. A bigger change would be to pad the whole of the back.",

Mine does not have the laser cut Mollie grid on the front instead it has one row of Daisy chain fabric zone to one side that you could clip a few things to I would say it has just the right amount of internal organization, the front pocket is fairly decent even though it is a sideways pocket thing stand there fairly well and it&apos;s a great quick access spot and there are two small pouches on the inside on the sides that are also very handy. The one place I got a little irritated. There was nothing was the top flap lid where you can feel that there&apos;s enough fabric between the two layers to put in a small pocket for sunglasses or something like that to seem like a wasted opportunity to put in a pocket that pretty much everyone would love.\r\n\r\nBut all that said you know you deal with the fact that it&apos;s not USA made but if you can get around that this is a great pack and oddly enough fits my 16 inch MacBook Pro",

Small enough to be maneuverable and a personal item for air travel but big enough to pack for a day trip.

Double zipper main rip-zip panel access entry can be a bit cumbersome/finicky to open without using one side zip at a time, perhaps bigger zipper would help?  Love the magnets!

It just POPS out of the deep stuff. Killer graphic and you have the total package. I’m 6’1” 215lbs and the 156 crushes for me. Highly recommend you throw one of these in your kit, but beware, you may not ride anything else in your quiver the rest of the season!",

The directional twin shape makes it easy to ride and land switch whether on groomers or in deep snow. That being said, it is very wide and as such, not super quick edge-to-edge on hard snow.

Rain would come and go, so the jacket would be off and on, which made it difficult to keep the inside dry, but that&apos;s not the fault of the jacket. The hood was nice a secure and the pit zips were a lifesaver for the muggy heat that came with the rain. After being packed up damp several times it had a funky smell that was easily remedied by a bake in the sun. When I did wear it for an extended period of time, I noticed a little moisture coming inside the barrier but again, for the most part, stayed dry. Would buy again and am glad to have in my gear collection now.",

It&apos;s the livability details such as the Air Stream inflation system having it&apos;s own compartment in the stuff sack, 2 stage inflation, deflation port and consistency of the baffles that makes a very thin pad sufficient for any sleeping position. The included repair kit is basically industry standard but it&apos;s better than almost all other brands included system. It&apos;s light, it packs small the only downside is the 1. 5 season use. On a 40F night it felt like my shoulder season sleeping bag was holding heat the same above and below me. I would not take this pad for any cold ground endeavors. It is a summer+ pass exactly as advertised and as several reviews state. Durability seems to have good reviews but I&apos;ll have to follow up.",

        "reviewBody": "Workmanship, material, weight and feel of these pants is great for the price I paid ($40). Nice for everyday casual, travel, work or outdoor activities so very versatile. Fit could be an issue and I wish people had fully explained in all the many reviews I read before buying. The size guide is very misleading so I would say they run small and here&apos;s why. These are true to size with regard to waistband measurement HOWEVER, they sit a little lower in front and higher in back and they are very short-waisted pants so, for me, the waist buttons 1.5 - 2&quot; below my waist which means the waistband is a little snug and I have a little back/hip squish that wants to bubble up over the waistband but, if I size up, the booty and legs will be a bit looser. If I wear them closer to my natural waist that reduces the waistband snugness but then there&apos;s a bit of a wedgie/camel toe situation that happens. Thankfully, it&apos;s not really noticeable to anyone but me and remarkably, they&apos;re still pretty comfortable because of the lightweight material and the little bit of give that it has so I&apos;m keeping the pair I just bought. I may try a size up at some point to see if I like the fit and feel of that better. I would say these work best for people who are slim in waist and hips but have a decently wide and full booty and thighs to fill them out, lol. They are designed to fit more snugly so if you like a looser fit and have your heart set on this exact pant, definitely size up one or maybe even two sizes depending on how loose you want them. For reference, I&apos;m 5&apos;4&quot;, 140#, 37.5&quot; hips, 18.5 - 19&quot; inseam, athletic build, flat stomach but a lil&apos; bit of squish in the back hip area and a full booty but not a wide booty. I typically wear a size 6 or 8 in pants and I bought an 8R in these. The 8R mostly fit pretty well and they do look nice but for a little more comfortable fit, I might also try a 10R at some point. I&apos;m right on the edge height-wise and have neither a long torso or long legs, I&apos;m split pretty evenly for my height but I did not and would not try the short version because I&apos;m afraid they would be just a touch too short with certain shoes and I don&apos;t like the flood pant look for myself.",

The Thru-Hiker 1 provides approximately 33&quot; width for 1 person, Thru-Hiker 2 provides approximately 26&quot; width per person where as the Thru-Hiker 3 only provides approximately 21&quot; width per person, adding only 14&quot; to the width for an additional person. In my experience, 26-28&quot; is the minimum width for me to be comfortable (depending on side wall slope), so the Thru-Hiker 3 is unrealistic for average adults, but may be doable for some.
