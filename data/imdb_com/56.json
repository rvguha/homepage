      "reviewBody": "In certain parts of modern-day Japan, there are state primary schools where the majority language is Portuguese. The historical reasons for this go back to large-scale immigration to Brazil from Japan at the beginning of the 20th century. That Japanese diaspora were cleaved in two at the end of WWII, with many fanatically believing that Japan had won the war, leading to murderous internecine strife with those who accepted the truth of Japan&apos;s defeat, surrender, and the Emperor refuting his divinity. It is a fascinating tale, little known, and deserves to have a great film made about it. Unfortunately, this is not that film.\n\nA raft of great Japanese actors fail to lift this flat, plodding narrative that has a made-for-TV aesthetic. Takako Tokiwa is the ostensible protagonist, a loving wife who watches her husband descend into a killer. Except &apos;descend&apos; is not the right word, as a switch seems simply to be flicked. And the wife&apos;s response is, bizarrely, to take vengeance on chickens. Tsuyoshi Ihara never really evokes anguish or guilt. Eiji Okuda as the militarist driving force is slightly more plausible. But Kimiko Yo, who since Departures has hardly put a foot wrong, squeals and mugs her was through this in embarrassing fashion.\n\nThe direction never really lets the story grow. Ihara&apos;s moment when he realises his own gullibility comes and goes without pause. The break-up of the marriage largely takes place without the husband and wife sharing the same frame. The Brazilians seem to inhabit the town and then disappear completely as convenience for the scene dictates. The sense of the period, of Brazil, is absent, and any contextualization of why these immigrants are there, and how torn they might be between motherland and adopted homeland, is missing.\n\nSome tales are so fascinating it is tempting to think they can tell their own story. But they can&apos;t, and the writers and directors on this project might want to bear that in mind.",

I hadn&apos;t read anything about the movie (actually it wasn&apos;t actually on IMDb not so long ago), but went and watched it in Berlin, at the Film Festival (Berlinale), where they showed it.\n\nThe documentary itself, showing people (mostly women) and how they get by everyday life, including their jobs (which in this case is boxing), is very interesting. The people in it don&apos;t act, but portray themselves, which comes off very authentic. The political range of the documentary is also very exciting. A well done movie then, but not perfectly balanced in my eyes. There are too many &quot;low&quot; (or slow moving) moments for my taste. If the pace would have been a bit better, it would&apos;ve helped the movie (then again, maybe they didn&apos;t show the final version at the Berlinale)",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a &quot;12 months earlier&quot; scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn&apos;t that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn&apos;t hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.\n\nThe plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here – although I think that was artificial, I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film, which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall, how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn&apos;t one escape sequence after another, I didn&apos;t feel this so often – although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation – visually and stylishly; just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum, so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.\n\nVisually the film remains a feast – although, befitting the time of year, it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and, as good as it looks, it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas &quot;if we can do it then we should do it&quot; school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs – I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much – Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles (shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!).\n\nThe Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster; lots of action, a decent story and strong special effects – this is not the same as saying it is a great film though, but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free (but very seriously presented) action, which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I&apos;ll be there for the final film, but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise."

She seems more relaxed than some of the other more experienced actresses. I have seen other models try screen acting with disastrous results. Tom Sellick plays his part well; that of a man so besotted with this heavenly creature that he finishes up doing silly things. That happens to many men in the same situation.\n\nA good movie topped off with a divine woman."

Back when the war against Vietnam was being waged by LBJ, this Emile de Antonio classic connected the dots on what had actually been happening in Vietnam since the Japanese occupation forces of World War Two left. In fact, a few years later HEARTS AND MINDS used much of the same material (that time in color) but not with nearly as much historical background as de Antonio does here. This is a harrowing collection of fact, a heartbreaking showcase of official ethnic disrespect, and one of the few true staples of the &apos;60s counterculture that neither originated from its own ranks nor is dated in its technique (black and white cinematography notwithstanding)...",

The filming is beautiful and Frank Langella&apos;s performance is mesmerizing - reminding me of his soulful and darkly troubled Dracula. It starts off slowly, but the story quickly begins rolling as the mysteries pile up, and Erica is drawn into investigating them. I am a big fan of Ancient Egypt, Egyptology and Archeology. This is in no way a documentary, but it perfectly captures and evokes the mystery and beauty of Ancient Egypt and the excitement of hidden treasures - it&apos;s certainly more than entertaining enough and has some interesting twists. Definitely worth watching if you get the chance!",

      "reviewBody": "This wonderful Czech movie is based on Alan Marshall&apos;s novel &quot;I can jump puddles&quot; and tells the story of a young boy contracting polio. Although a drama at heart the filmmakers keep a good sense of humor, which adds enormously to the story&apos;s charm.\n\nEven though this film aims at a younger audience it is just as moving and entertaining for grown-ups. The story is engaging from the get-go as we see young Adam admiring his father&apos;s talent with horses. Like father like son, he too wants to learn how to ride. Unfortunately polio gets in the way and we now follow Adam&apos;s fight with the disease.\n\nThe shots of the rural landscapes are beautiful and build a sharp contrast with the hospital where Adam is sent. The characters are believable and the relationship between Adam and his father is quite heartbreaking.\n\nWhen Adam suffers from fever dreams the movie slips into moments of surrealism, which I found quite exceptional for a children&apos;s movie. Some good use of slow-motion and different color patterns keep this film also visually interesting. I wasn&apos;t too crazy about the music though, which was a little annoying at times.\n\nOverall this is a really good film for kids and the whole family.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie without any expectation that it would be good. But it turns out to be an artful and skillfully developed movie that is comical on the surface but carries deep down a tragic undertone. Nils Jørgen Kaalstad, who plays Rino, is a much better actor than first appears on screen. His acting is superb in subtle ways.\n\nHe plays an over-sexed nerd who is hooked onto pornography but has not developed the skills required to actually lure women to bed. His innate shyness and inexperience make him a lonely, socially (and sexually) ostracized person. But Rino has a good heart and is a kind and responsible person. The anecdotes on his translating &quot;boring&quot; user manuals of tools and widgets from the German to Norwegian is actually funny and very true-to-life. I know people who do such work for a living.\n\nI can see that this movie may not appeal to viewers who don&apos;t not want to think. Rino&apos;s failure to live a &quot;normal&quot; sex life is a veiled condemnation of the dark side of Internet sex. Rino elicits sympathy. One hopes he will eventually finds the right woman who rescues him from the dungeon of cyber sex obsession. The movie is deeply honest and real-to-life.",

So what is wrong with him being tempted as every man is? There is a huge difference between being tempted and actually committing the sin. The miracle of Jesus is that he did not sin. He did not succumb to the carnal desires that all men must invariably do. Yet his struggle to resist temptation as well as find out who He really was makes him all the more human and the story of Christ so much more inspiring.\n\nScorsese&apos;s vision coupled with Willem DaFoe in the best performance of his career capture that struggle and that humanity. And as a result, I&apos;ve never been more proud to be a Christian."

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s what I felt after seeing this film, Freddy Vs. Jason.  Right when they introduced the characters I knew them so well, their personalities, emotions, motives and all, that not one human character could have (or would have tried to) surprise me with ingenuity in their performances.  So, that&apos;s the downside to Freddy Vs. Jason, a downside that will either poke the viewer harshly in the ribs, or will just remain as the typical, expectedly lame backdrop for the match-up.  I felt a little of both, though I tried to be confident that the main show would be worth the Hollywood-ish mish-mash.\n\nThe main show, however, is the only reason to see the movie:  Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund), the old gent from Elm Street, is down in hell wanting another grab at &apos;his&apos; children, so he implements a sort of decoy in the form of lake-boy Jason Voorhees, who begins slaying far more than Freddy could want to see for someone other than himself.  So, he decides that it&apos;s time to kick some a**, and that&apos;s when the fun begins.  \n\nTo die-hards of both series (I like a few from each series, and personally, I&apos;m more for Freddy than Jason in the genre because at least Freddy can give some funny dialog in terrifying moments while Jason stares blankly, except for when his mother calls him) this is like seeing two legends standing up in the ring for a prizefight.  Each one has their weaknesses, but they each know who to throw their punches with style, and (we hope) that they can stay invincible until the last round.  I won&apos;t reveal who wins (they&apos;re enough skeeves on the message boards doing that), but what I can say is that if it only wasn&apos;t for the people in the movie (I&apos;ll exclude the Jay rip-off since he garnered the most laughs) acting so blandly, strategically like how they&apos;re told to do in such a piece, this would&apos;ve been a near excellent horror movie.  Never-the-less, that could be considered moot, since that&apos;s what&apos;s to ALWAYS be expected for these gobledy-gook slasher pieces.  The point is, I didn&apos;t leave the theater feeling swindled by the hype of the matching (unlike how I would if they ever, EVER decide to make a Superman vs. Batman piece of drek).  C+",

The visual presentation of the movie is spectacular and the lovely endearing yet perverse story line only further adds to the experience of watching. The characterizations are wonderful and the manic nature of most of the characters brings an energy to the story. My favourite scenes were the &quot;kidnap&quot; ventures and the wonderful shots of the water - the colours are breathtaking. I will certainly have to see this one again before it disappears!!",

      "reviewBody": "Renowned Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, mostly known in North America for his leading role as Jacob in the original Est German/Czech production of Jacob the Liar (Jakob, der Lügner 1974) gives us a last brilliant performance as a 80 year old prankster who refuses to admit that he is about to die.\n\nJirí Hubac&apos;s screenplay is exquisite.  Funny, moving and well-developed. It explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters that are precariously strong and fragile, happy and unsettled.\n\n Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are up to all types of shenanigans and are making sure to make the best out of their dying days.  Meanwhile, Frantisek&apos;s wife is preparing for their death, saving up for funeral money and chastising Frantisek for his endless childishness and irresponsible attitude.  Their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home, but Frantisek doesn&apos;t want to hear any of that.  He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh.  He wants to help and love and give... but at what cost?\n\nSure to captivate adults of all ages, this fine piece of film by talented director Vladimír Michálek is both touching and funny.  It makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the forefront and allow us to reflect and feel what life is all about.\n\nAfter an active career lasting more than 40 years, it is somewhat sombre to know that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer in the grip of terminal cancer.  It is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode to joyful old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in North American repertoire cinema.\n\n After the international success of Jan Hrebejk&apos;s &quot;Divided We Fall (2000)&quot;, it is starting to be clear that Czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world.  This film at least is a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "Although - as many people do - I generally prefer Pixar films to the animated fare created by other companies, I can&apos;t deny that a film like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very hard not to love. Although it isn&apos;t particularly complex, thought-provoking, beautiful or masterful, it&apos;s a very entertaining, funny, cute-as-hell and effective animated film. Children with definitely love it, and adults... well, that actually depends on the adult in question. Although I certainly enjoy all kinds of movies, there&apos;s always - for me - some satisfaction to be had when watching something so obviously goofy and kiddy. Meatballs is kiddy, and that&apos;s precisely what I loved about it. It may not be this year&apos;s best animated movie - that honour goes to Pixar&apos;s Up - but it certainly is better than the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens.\n\nThe film tells the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), a young inventor who dreams of, someday, creating something that will be loved by everyone and make him more popular and, most importantly, improve the lives of everyone in town. Unfortunately, he hasn&apos;t been able to do so, and his technofobic father (voice of James Caan) doesn&apos;t really help at all. One day, though, he manages to invent something that will change the lives of everyone in town forever: a machine that makes food fall from the sky. Everybody seems to be happy with him now - including mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) and the by-the-book police offer, Earl (Mr. T) - but, predictably enough, something goes wrong: excess amounts of food start to overload the island where the town is located, and now Flint, along with TV reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to try to solve their problem.\n\nYes, the plot is pretty predictable, and it certainly won&apos;t make anyone above the age of 5 be shocked with surprise or anything of the sort, but it certainly is very imaginative, and it should work in a very &quot;oh, it&apos;s sort of nice&quot; kind of way. I liked the way Flint was portrayed - Hader&apos;s wacky and not-so-recognizable voice is perfect for the character - and the fact that, although most characters are either archetypes or stereotypes - consider, for the example, Bruce Campbell&apos;s greedy and - eventually - obese mayor - they are all voice so professionally and characterized in such an naive and cute kind of way, that one just doesn&apos;t care. I rooted for Flint the whole way, and I actually thought that the romantic sub-plot between him and Sam was cute and funny.\n\nVisually, I don&apos;t think the movie is on par to the likes of Wall-E or Up, but I think that comparing it to those productions would be a bit unfair. Wall-E had a sort-of realistic kind of look, and Up, while a little more cartoonish, had a very realistic flair to it. On the other hand, there&apos;s something very old-fashioned in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&apos; look and the way it is animated. Characters behave and move the way old TV cartoons behaved forty or more years ago, and I like that. They jump a lot, are very &quot;agile&quot; and are just... cartoonish. Clearly, the animators didn&apos;t want the movie to give a palpable sense of realism; in a way, they were trying to craft an old-fashioned cartoon with the latest technological tools, and they have done it very successfully.\n\nWhat else can I say about the movie? It certainly is very naive, and it doesn&apos;t explore any deep themes or moral problems, but that&apos;s just OK. While this year&apos;s mediocre Monsters vs. Aliens was terribly simplistic, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just simple, and there&apos;s nothing wrong with that. Of course, there&apos;s nothing wrong with movies like Wall-E having very significant messages and complex love stories and such, but if a parent wants to go with their toddler to see a movie that isn&apos;t very complicated but that isn&apos;t stupid or boring either, then Meatballs is an excellent choice. After all, even if there isn&apos;t much beneath the surface, I can&apos;t imagine a single adult maintaining a straight face throughout the film&apos;s runningtime. The movie is hilarious, - just remember Flint&apos;s father&apos;s eyebrows! -, it&apos;s inventive, it&apos;s imaginative; it&apos;s also pretty gorgeous and it features some effective voice acting and interesting, wacky characters. It&apos;s not dumb and it doesn&apos;t pander to the least common denominator. Most interestingly, though, it made me hungry. That&apos;s not a quality many movies posses.",

I don&apos;t watch a lot of European films because they usually don&apos;t open in Portugal, but I try to use this opportunities to watch different movies and this time I wasn&apos;t disappointed. It&apos;s a story of two comedy actors in Berlin in 1939. One of them plays Hitler and the other Stalin to a room full of Nazi officers. The beginning is absolutely great and I could&apos;t stop laughing. With the war both comedians have to run and trying to reach Hollywood they end up in Moscow. At this point the film looses a bit of its initial vigor but I enjoyed it anyway and although the end is a bit predictable, it is still a very enjoyable movie and totally worth the time.",

The story, characters, and songs were pretty cute, I must admit. The underlying message, that sharing is good, may seem juvenile in scope simply because it is a Sesame Street production and includes blue and red fuzzy monsters and talking turnips, but applies to everyone. Being a 21 year year old, I particularly liked the scene where Vanessa Williams emerged in a pretty provacative outfit made of trash (yeah!). Nevertheless, EIG contains a valuable theme that I wish more people would follow.        Teletubbies and Pokemon have stomped their way into our culture, but are a mere fad, and the more reserved and prestigious Sesame Street has not lost a step. Oscar, Elmo, Big Bird, and Maria (woo-hoo!) will remain long after the Teles and Pokes have run their course. That&apos;s what makes SS so unique."

The same guy who did the script for CRASH also did the script for MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Both won the Oscar for best picture. I must be pretty out of touch to criticize this guy, but here goes. The main problem is that every character is &quot;invented&quot;. That is, each character is so obviously the product of a fertile (and I am using that word kindly) imagination. In CRASH the politician and his wife are absolute stereotypes. They speak the most inane lines, like from a comic book or low-grade soap opera. The two cops are similarly contrived. One is a good guy and one is a bad guy. One is an idealist. One is a cynical veteran. I imagine such categories of cops do exist, but to give them life it takes someone who knows the genres, like Joseph Wambaugh. (In fact, to see how really bad CRASH is, just compare it to THE ONION FIELD). We also have the two foul-mouthed gang-banging black youth, hell bent on insanity. Big deal. Anyone can produce such characters. There is the misunderstood, good-guy Mexican plumber, who just happens to love his young daughter oh so much. Etc. Etc. Each character has the depth of a comic-book creation. They all speak in litanies of clichés. The plot too is just a clever manage of intersections. It is so obviously the product of the next cup of coffee or cigarette. It is cleverness without depth or substance. Christ, that this film won best picture just begs belief.\n\nWhile I am getting in my two cents here, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the same cliché-riddled mess. It is obvious that the guy who wrote knew nothing about boxing. The characters are pathetic, lifeless creations.\n\nWhat has Hollywood come to that such movies walk away with top prize?"

If he listened to his team it would have been fine.\n\nBut there is no soul searching. He is just gutted his personal numbers now look bad.\n\nHis team all believe in him which get some shot.

Then it turns and the situation set pieces come along and the film becomes amusing than downright funny, but all in a &quot;quirky&quot; gallows humour that some people will either love or hate.\n\nThe best way to describe this film is to pretend its in the same universe as Napoleon Dynamite or Fargo. The film has some very dark humour that often revolves around death but at the same time it has superb insights like the tomfoolery of tax shelter shell companies and PO Boxes.\n\nWhat I liked about the characters is that they are oblivious to their own idiocy and Yolande Moreau (Louise) and Bouli Lanners (Michel) bounce off each other superbly.\n\nOne of the best comedies I have seen in some time.",

Samuel L. Jackson was great as always and even Bruce Willis actually showed interest in performing for this film.\n\nMy issue was that the writing was all over the place and the 129 min length felt like 180 mins. Maybe it was the pacing, or more needed to be edited/cut to shorten this film to a more acceptable 100-110 length. The directing was decent but nothing spectacular.\n\nI expected more but sadly was disappointed. It&apos;s not a flop, nor is it a 10/10 like all these fake reviews. It&apos;s a well deserved 6/10.

However insurance investigator Roland Copping begins to look into the case looking for fraud. He eventually finds a fraud by Beth&apos;s husband Jonathon and begins to blackmail the couple in a game where the stakes continually rise.\n\nThis is an Australian comedy - oops! immediate turn off for me. And it stars Phil Collins - double oops. Whenever I see Phil Collins in a film my immediate assumption is that they couldn&apos;t get Bob Hoskins. This really needed to do something special to win me over. And for the first half it does - the robbery scenes are good and then Collins uncovering the fraud is very interesting. However the second half is all a bit daft - Collin&apos;s living in an unlikely toy-store house with a range of gadgets and Jonathon being drawn into a deadly game. It has it&apos;s moments but the second half is a bit silly.\n\nThe cast are mixed. Collins is not a great actor and hams it up - however here the film so overdone that his style almost fits.....almost. His childhood is not well enough explored and instead we are treated to fancy sets and fantasy sequences that aren&apos;t set in any context. Byrnes is good as the harassed wife but Hugo Weaving is lost with a stretched role where he has to jump from gentle husband to being on the same level as Collins.\n\nOverall the first half is quite interesting - you don&apos;t totally know what&apos;s going on in every situation. However the second half is a bit silly and Collins loses any believability as a character. It&apos;s a little entertaining but the colourful child-like set takes away much of the dark mystery of the first half."

Sure, the story has numerous big holes (Gere knows the operating technique of his opponent so well and down to the last detail, you&apos;d think they used to live together from the moment they were born - total exaggeration, another example are the lame effects when he&apos;s between two trains), and Gere&apos;s dialect is way off (for some reason it didn&apos;t bother me at all), but the rest is pure action and entertainment extravaganza. Bruce Willis was a perfect choice for the Jackal and Sidney Poitier was as always amazing and really helped the atmosphere of the movie with his role. The ending was a bit short, but in my opinion necessary, because I knew what was going to happen, so why delay it. Nicely done, and great music. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Bettie Page was a icon of the repressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her acting career went nowhere, but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field. Photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in New York, this made-for-TV (HBO) film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast. The problem is, it&apos;s emotionally rather flat. It&apos;s difficult to form an attachment to the character, since Bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in. The self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time, which slows down the film towards the end. But it&apos;s definitely worth watching for the history of the time, and to see the heavy-handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "`Bend It Like Beckam&apos; is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl&apos;s search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like `Fiddler on the Roof,&apos; `Beckam&apos; deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.\n\nJess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a world-class soccer player.  However, Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys, show her legs in public, or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family.  We&apos;ve seen this kind of set-up countless times before and `Bend It Like Beckam&apos; will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality.  It does, however, have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can&apos;t help but captivate even the most diehard, coldhearted cynic.  Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character.  She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess&apos; father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess&apos; mother, who doesn&apos;t understand why her daughter can&apos;t be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules&apos; mother, who proves that Indians don&apos;t hold a patent on tradition-obsessed parents.  In its quiet, gentle way, the film also confronts the issue of racism, particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as second-class citizens in British society.\n\nAs directed by Gurinder Chadha, `Bend It Like Beckham&apos; is a light-on-its-feet `feel-good&apos; film that never takes itself too seriously. The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules&apos; parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers.  The plotting, in addition to being predictable at times, often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic (the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender).  But this isn&apos;t enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.\n\n Thus, if you&apos;re looking for a film that is easygoing, uplifting and comfortably old-fashioned in its demeanor and theme, `Bend It Like Beckham&apos; is for you."

      "reviewBody": "Count Tolstoy&apos;s massive novels, &quot;War and Peace,&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; are personally quite challenging.\n\nHere are breathtakingly crafted literary works in a spiritual context of unconstructive energy.  It&apos;s quite easy to become as entranced within these &quot;worlds&quot; as are many music lovers within the skewed terrain of Wagner&apos;s Valhalla and Nibelungens. \n\nTolstoy&apos;s words pull in the reader almost hypnotically as he spins his titanic, subtle tales of societal mores conflicting with human emotions. \n\n Many of his characters are self-absorbed and vain, and his social environments repressive and stolid, with false values that tragically dehumanize and destroy. \n\nSo it&apos;s an ultimate challenge to attempt to separate these energetic downers from their dazzling technical counterparts.\n\nIn the case of &quot;Anna,&quot; after stripping away the polished veneer, I find characters trying to cope with their testy emotional choices while being thwarted by inhuman societal standards. \n\nYet &quot;Anna&quot; is a favorite of filmmakers, having been done countless times, with the Garbo-Selznick version the most notable.  Here Vivien Leigh gives a creditable performance of this distraught heroine, with Director Julien Duvivier joining Jean Anuith in script adaptation. \n\nRalph Richardson and Kieron Moore are both completely substantial, and general production values are attended to with solid professionalism.\n\nAlas, the enactment seldom tugs heartstrings and, in fact, a strangely turgid pall seems to hang over the entire production. Condensing a 900-page novel down to 2-hour running time doesn&apos;t help matters.\n\n As for Leigh, my feeling is that she gravitated too often to &quot;fallen woman&quot; roles.  While she portrayed them very well, they may have failed to bring her the uplift her personality seemed to desperately seek. Hers was pretty much a career of depressingly joyless female characters, which perhaps worked not to her personal advantage. \n\nThat&apos;s another matter, though; Leigh was forever the consummate, fine actress, and her legacy is one of great artistic achievement.\n\n This version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; remains a thoughtful, worthy attempt at a near-impossible task."

      "reviewBody": "I was extremely fortunate to obtain a ticket to the very first screening of &quot;My Name Is Bruce&quot; during the Ashland Independent Film Festival in Southern Oregon. Bruce appeared there in person and he was as charming, funny and charismatic as his alter egos on screen. It was a real privilege! Before and after the show, Bruce talked a bit about how making a film in one&apos;s hometown, how great it was for him to &quot;be able make a film and sleep in his own bed for the first time in 10 years&quot; and that you don&apos;t need a big Hollywood studio and a big blockbuster budget to make a good movie everyone can enjoy. \n\nHe proved his point completely with the screening of this film. &quot;My Name Is Bruce&quot; was filmed entirely on located in the Rogue Valley, casting locals in many of the major roles, who all did a wonderful job. No big celebrity names, exotic locations or blue screen studios were necessary in making this a real good movie. \n\nBut enough patting on the back. \n\nIf you love any of the Evil Dead movies, if you&apos;ve ever loved him as the dashing king of thieves in Xena: Warrior Princess, or if you&apos;ve just been charmed by his delightful cameos in the Spiderman films, you will LOVE &quot;My Name Is Bruce&quot;! Even if you don&apos;t know that much about Bruce Campell and you just happen to be a fan of B-Movies, I still think you will enjoy this movie. Everything we love about Bruce is played so well over the top you can&apos;t help but laugh yourself silly! Bruce takes no mercy in making fun of himself - in this film, he&apos;s a washed up, boozing, C-movie actor, who&apos;s just finalized his divorce, making horrible alien movie sequels while treating his devoted fans like crap (the scene where he kicks a fan in a wheelchair down a hill - PRICELESS - but just one of many)! This, of course, all done in comedic good taste. None of this could be considered is autobiographical, and it&apos;s far from some cheesy Lifetime channel oh-pity-me &quot;the Bruce Campbell story&quot; special. As Bruce beats himself up, we all laugh our bums off. \n\nThen, there is of course, the evil monster, Quan-Di, who&apos;s chops peoples&apos; heads off in a cool, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style. I would also like to add by the way that this Chinese God of Bean Curd has his own folksong sung by two humble guitar players, and it&apos;s a rather catchy-tune. Quite frankly, if you don&apos;t leave the theatre singing: &quot;Quan You, Quan Me, Quan Di...&quot;, well then I just don&apos;t know what to say to you. ;) The violence in this movie is very much like what you may find in the Evil Dead movies. There&apos;s much homage from that. \n\nSomething else in this movie that&apos;s uber-cool and cult fans will enjoy: Ted Raimi... Is... EVERYWHERE in this film. He has (as far as I could count) three different significant roles, which are both delightful and hilarious to watch. \n\nThe movie also takes some of its strength from the two main supporting roles, the plucky fan boy who practically worships Bruce Campell (whose name I can&apos;t remember at the moment) and his mother, played by Grace Thorsen. \n\nI should note that what I saw was a rough cut of the film, not entirely finished, so I don&apos;t know the names of all the actors because there were no opening and closing credits. So, sorry for now, plucky fan boy who worships Bruce Campell. I thought you were very good, but I can&apos;t remember your name. And kudos to the actor who played Quan-Di, who&apos;s physical characterizations behind the mask made him more than just another monster. \n\nIn conclusion, when there is a final cut and it lands in theaters in October, do go see it. It was quite an entertaining film and well worth seeing it on the big screen. I would write more, because this movie ROCKED in practically every detail, but I fear I&apos;d be giving too much away. Just take my word for it: it&apos;s groovy, baby. Go see it.",

Quite a varied cast of working women have managed to form a little community complete with dress codes, rules of behavior, factions, and an oral tradition.  A most enjoyable glimpse of an unusual community.",

      "reviewBody": "Although the last Wäckerli-movie was made as late as 1966 (directed by nobody else than Werner Düggelin), the first one - and at the same time the first feature-long movie by Swiss director Kurt Früh - was an anachronism. Although the TV broadcasting of &quot;Polizischt Wäckerli&quot;, which preceded almost immediately the movie, was a road sweeper, and the public liked both versions, most critics went against Wäckerli as the impersonation of the allegedly typical Swiss family father: with &quot;tough shell and soft kernel&quot;. The 60ies were obviously visible at the horizon. Comparing Früh&apos;s three movies &quot;Polizischt Wäckerli&quot; (1955) - &quot;Es Dach Überem Chopf&quot; (1962) and &quot;Der Fall&quot; (1971) we easily get a socio-gram of the earthquake-like changes that happened at that time in Central Europe in the relationship between parents and children. While in 1955, the suppressed son, forced by his father, the almost almighty police-corporal of Allenwil, to hire out in a bureau-job which he hates as one can just hate, he is unable to free himself and needs for that purpose the help of his 10 years older girlfriend Mary, the owner of the local bar. The daughter and the mother have simply nothing to say. When they try to open their mouth, they are cut brutally (&quot;but justly&quot;) down by Wäckerli&apos;s &quot;natural authority&quot;. But only 7 years later, we see the 18 years old daughter Sophie Caduff in Früh&apos;s &quot;Es Dach Überem Chopf&quot; taking her own rights with conviction, spending whole nights with the then so-called generation of &quot;Halbstarken&quot; (mostly rockers). Although Sophie&apos;s father still tries to exercise his influence on her, the audience sees his might crumbling apart like Blue cheese. And again a decade later, in Früh&apos;s last film &quot;Der Fall&quot;, we see a youth completely liberated from their families. When detective Grendelmeier by chance stumbles over the lost daughter of one of his clients, he sees her lying between one the stairwell, hypnotized by drugs. To his recommendation she might go home because her parents expect her, she answers in a flower-power drivel: &quot;I don&apos;t believe that at all&quot;. This is the time-horizon from which &quot;Polizischt Wäckerli&quot; has to be judged: It basically describes a time which was already over when the movie was made. The mood that should be broadcast to the public was about that of the title-score of Früh&apos;s other movie &quot;Oberstattgass&quot;: &quot;In Allen Gassen Wohnt Das Glück&quot; (&quot;All The Alley Inhabits The Luck ...), in other words nothing else than the Gegenwelt of the Romantics. However, this is not Kitsch but Seelentröstung: consolation of the soul, of the wounded soul.",

Much to my delight, the film is far better than Weisser&apos;s brief synopsis implies. Lucky Johnny (as a child) is rescued by an undertaker just as a rattlesnake is about to pounce. The two of them go about their ghoulish business until they decide it&apos;s time to strike it rich. There are two intriguing subplots involving a pair of down on their luck stage robbers and a black cavalryman who is victimised by greedy bounty hunters. The film was originally shot in Panavision, and even the crummy pan and scan TV version I caught couldn&apos;t obscure some outstanding cinematography. Topped off with a fine score, highlighted by an excellent (uncredited) 70s soul song over the end credits, Lucky Johnny is another obscuro film waiting to be rediscovered by our good friends at Anchor Bay. I&apos;ll be first in line for the DVD.",

I don&apos;t want to sound like I&apos;m overstating here--but he has a rare gift of being able to communicate contradictory emotions simultaneously. As he was courting an older woman--actress Fanny Ardant--I sensed his disdain and his insincerity together. He made me feel his conflict, and let me know that this was manipulation, not genuine caring. Brando could do that but to get me so lost in his work, Lastella must have some new magic or else I am hallucinating. I was fascinated by how easily he played people to get his own way and how later, when his deceptions became clear, how he was able to suspend me between panic and the belief that he was ruthless enough to make it all come out the way he needed it to. In ruthlessness, I seldom find hesitation, once the dye is cast--and Lastella plays it that way. I hope he has a body of work because I want to see more of him.",

      "reviewBody": "Séverine (Catherine Deneuve) is a bored, affluent housewife. We meet her first when she is forced to dismount from a carriage. Her husband Pierre ties her to a tree, whips her, then leaves her to be raped by the two carriage drivers.\n\nSéverine is prone to fantasies. She is in a conventional marriage. Pierre is a handsome young surgeon. They sleep in separate beds. An older friend, Henri, keeps hitting on her, but she tells him to keep his compliments for himself. He is attracted by her blonde perfection, her virtue and her icy disdain.\n\nTaking fantasy a stage further, Séverine gets a daytime job at a high class brothel. At first she is prudish and wants to pick her clients. Then she is shown &apos;a firm hand&apos; - which the masochistic side of her nature relishes.\n\nRe-released almost forty years after its original cinema exhibition, Belle de Jour still has the power to shock. Not through explicit nudity (it is a highly erotic work without being titillating) but by the shocking images, and the superb performances that contrast the aloofness of the bourgeoisie to the practicality of sex, of elegance to depravity. Scenes of Séverine having mud thrown at her stick in the mind no less than the tentativeness with which she approaches the brothel for the first time, dressed in black, and ready to take flight at any moment. Couture by Yves Saint Laurent and lush photography drown us in luxurious chic. The stylish settings arouse our aesthetic senses, and the languorous pacing and emotional complexity keep us trying to figure it all out long before we realise just how difficult that is going to be. \n\nAnalysing it in Freudian or purely sexual terms is less than satisfying. The characters are convincing - the posh conservative elite, the matter-of-fact but certainly not coarse madame, the pervs who visit the brothel, and the psychologically conflicted Séverine through them all. It is hardly a plea for sexual liberation - the men, even one that Séverine takes a fancy to, are pretty lowlife. Their strange fantasy requirements mete out the most fascinating tableau of perversions but even more fascinating is what we don&apos;t see: such as what is in the box brought by the Chinaman. We are forced to identify with Séverine - she is the most normal character - and yet the most convincing way to approach the film is one suggested by Buñuel himself, as a parable attacking the decadence of the bourgeoisie. \n\nOn a more elevated level, it is a forceful artistic statement that viewers addicted to linear storytelling may find hard to accept. It seems to anticipate Eyes Wide Shut in its treatment of hidden sexuality, but cinematically it is more linked to the surreal Mulholland Drive. Buñuel&apos;s friend from University and at one point collaborator, Salvador Dali, could be similarly perplexing when it came to alternate realities. He said, &quot;People love mystery, and that is why they love my paintings.&quot; The mind is drawn to interpret a piece of art in a specific concrete way, but the artist may wish to express a concept that transcends specific examples. In Belle de Jour, Buñuel claims that there are not two endings, just one ambiguous ending. When you have finished watching the film it is not hard to decide which scenes are reality and which are fantasy, but when you run it through your mind again it is equally possible to make alterations. Do we want to know what is in the box, or do we love the mystery?\n\nThe name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on &apos;lady of the night&apos;, since Séverine only worked in the day; everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter Séverine&apos;s feverish imagination and you might see something else.",

The net effect of today&apos;s copyright laws are self serving to the corporations and rarely benefit the original creator. As mentioned previously the original creator is lucky to receive 10% of the final selling price. As with everything else today corporate property rights have higher priority than almost anything else including our democratic freedoms.\n\nBut I do agree that some protection must be there so that one is rewarded for their hard work. My suggestions: Time limit such as with patents. Too much great creativity is rotting away because some greedy person (most likely not the author) wants more. Don&apos;t allow copyrights to be sold. Only the original creator can benefit from his/her work.",

Due to the increasing demand for the leather and cashmere of Tibet antelopes, poachers drove the once 1 million antelopes to the edge of extinction (less than 10 thousand). A retired military officer volunteered to setup a mountain patrol to protect the antelopes and hunt the poachers.\n\nWhat is touching is not the survival or dying of the antelopes but that of human beings above the 4000 meters (over 12,000 feet) high land. Wind, snow and deserts took away food from people and they could not make a living. Lots of people turned to hunt antelopes for their own being. Meanwhile, the team members of the mountain patrol were fighting for their own life while hunting the poachers. The volunteers had no government funding, no food, and no weapons. They were at great disadvantage when facing well equipped, out numbered and brutal poachers. Without any alternatives, they had to sell the skins of the antelopes they captured in order to support their duties of protecting the extincting creatures. The movie presents the brutal facts right in front of you and make me hard to breath.\n\nThe story was set in the period of 1993 to 1996, however, I highly suspect that it was an on-going cat and mouse game, and the situation of today may not be much better than what was described in the movie.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "This is going to be somewhat of a difficult review as my rating is based on hypotheticals... let me explain that:\n\nThis movie is very familiar in the sense that the &quot;groundhog day&quot; concept has been beaten to death, then you wake up and it&apos;s beaten to death, then you wake, etc... however I felt ARQ did an amazing job of realizing this, and ushered us into the story line of continuous time-loops relatively fast and efficient, while still keeping me intrigued to the background story taking place. There is a lot of information and history left to the imagination which will definitely turn viewers away, though I personally found quite refreshing. They stuck to the main story line without jam packing a compendium of background knowledge into the film. The acting was great, the set was limited to a house which really created an intimate environment for the viewer, and the film pulled off a cliché story while maintaining a certain level of uniqueness. \n\nThis is where the hypotheticals come in to play: If this was the pilot episode for a new TV series setting up a story line for an entire season (one in which the time-loop was resolved early and didn&apos;t play-out all season) then this would be flipping fantastic, and would have every viewer intrigued and ready to watch the next episode. As you would expect in a really great pilot episode, the ending left me smiling while simultaneously giving the finger to my TV screen. If a second episode was out, no way I&apos;d be choosing to write this instead of finding out what comes next. However, this wasn&apos;t a pilot episode, it was a movie. Which kind of changes my tune a bit, and leaves me still giving the finger to my TV, though without the accompaniment of a smile. I really hope they somehow expand on this with a sequel, or turn it into a TV show, but those are hypotheticals. \n\nI still choose to give this a higher rating, because it could be the beginning of something awesomely awesome. If I were you, I&apos;d give it a watch and see for yourself... Here&apos;s to OPTIMISM!!",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the noted critic Pauline Kael&apos;s unreasonably negative review of this film, it&apos;s a lot of fun and a good vehicle for Joan Crawford&apos;s talents. Kael described it as overwrought, but in truth it&apos;s good old-fashioned melodramatic story-telling with a smart, literate script, and refreshingly quick pacing. The only flaw that bothered me was a musical score that is, at times, laughably incongruous. (The music swells bewilderingly and ominously when Crawford benignly offers Reynolds&apos; Political Boss something for his hangover.)\n\nSure, you can quarrel with the casting of Shakespearean-voiced Sydney Greenstreet playing a Southern Sheriff, but he&apos;s so unrepentently vile and villainous that he&apos;s convincing in every role he plays. It is a joy to watch two such formidable actors as Crawford and Greenstreet squaring off in big confrontations.\n\nIt&apos;s not surprising that, some 30 years later, this became the premise for a night-time soap opera starring, I believe, Morgan Fairchild. It has so many jealousies, manipulations, secret ambitions, double-crosses, plots for revenge - it&apos;s just great fun if one doesn&apos;t take it too seriously. And clearly, Crawford, Greenstreet, and the director, Michael Curtiz, didn&apos;t. They recognized the material for what it was - pulpy entertainment served up with wit and style.",

Then they meet the strangers Bill Masters (Lee Marvin) and his partner Clete (Donald Barry) and Bill tells to the couple that Ben is tracking down the seven men that robbed the Well Fargo office in Silver Springs and killed his wife that worked in the office. Annie gets close to Ben, who feels responsible for the death of his beloved wife. During their journey, they have moments of tension with an attack of Indians and the interest of Bill in Annie, and Ben asks Bill and Clete to leave the couple. When they arrive in the boundary of Flora Vista, John discloses a secret to Ben.\n\n&quot;Seven Men From Now&quot; is a solid western, with story and characters very well developed and outstanding performances. Randolph Scott performs a lonely rider thirsty to revenge the death of his wife, and Lee Marvin performs a great villain, as usual. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;7 Homens Sem Destino&quot; (&quot;7 Men Without Destiny&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I waited a long time to see this movie, now I have and I must say I found it better than I had reason to expect. It is a fast moving comedy with many really funny scenes. Could it be this was the first movie that made fun of the Cold War? Could it be it was shelved for years for that reason (maybe the war in Corea made it inopportune to laugh about such matters)? Josef von Sternberg, steeped in German Expressionism, would be the last director you&apos;d expect to helm a movie that at first sight seems to be an older version of Top Gun. But things are set straight very soon as it becomes evident that this is supposed to be a comedy in the vein of something by Ernst Lubitsch or Billy Wilder. Ninotchka comes to mind, and in a way - a hilarious way - Janet Leigh as the (intentionally?) grounded Russian jet pilot is in the footsteps of Greta Garbo here. So John Wayne as American jet pilot is a reticent, rather shy Melvyn Douglas. In his part you&apos;d rather expect Cary Grant, and Wayne does seem to be slightly embarrassed throughout the movie.\n\nVivacious Janet Leigh&apos;s physical assets are highlighted as much as possible and with great success. There is a nice striptease scene in which she gets out of her cute white overalls, and each time she starts peeling off a new layer of clothing - woooosh - a jet plane is heard diving down. It&apos;s really a hoot. Soon she reappears in the American&apos;s war room in a neatly pressed Red Army uniform, full of medals and fruit salad (she must have stashed it somewhere in that jet plane of hers). Soon she and Wayne are off to Palm Springs, so that she can see what the Commies are missing. Wayne, in turn, gets a whiff of Socialist reality later on, as he accompanies the Russien pilot he sort of married back home. It&apos;s grim and Stalag-like, of course.\n\nThere is a lot of aerial footage in Jet Pilot and it is high quality material that still fascinates. A lot of elegant acrobatics is performed and filmed from different angles. But even the jets are well embedded in the comedy this movie ultimately is. One of the scene I liked best: Janet Leigh escapes. She runs to a jet with its  er  engine already running, pushes away the ladder and dashes of as if it were a little sports car or some getaway after a heist in a gangster movie. It&apos;s unparalleled and one of many laughs Jet Pilot offers.",

      "reviewBody": "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on, I&apos;m having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book, because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of Atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I&apos;ve ever seen, it would probably not have mattered.\n\nI&apos;m trying to figure out what the cause is, and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton&apos;s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.\n\nIt&apos;s not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie, which is why, since I started reading the novel, I&apos;m feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it, I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it&apos;s not so much that some novels don&apos;t deserve to be a movie; it&apos;s more like some books just can&apos;t make the transition. Ms. Minton&apos;s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, I feel, not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton&apos;s work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.\n\nI cannot yet report that Evening, the film, does not represent Evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since I&apos;m only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I&apos;m writing this because I feel that if you&apos;re going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don&apos;t make it something else that it&apos;s not. I&apos;m not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else&apos;s work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway, and we would not have Evening, in its distressed form, if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it&apos;s too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.\n\nThus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.",

      "reviewBody": "Battle For Brooklyn is a sweeping chronicle of the highly divisive Atlantic Yards plan and one man&apos;s unyielding refusal to conform under insurmountable pressure. Filmmakers Galinsky and Hawley chronicle the narrative spanning nearly a decade, as the strife over what&apos;s best for the community unfurls. Complete with desirous politicians focused on exploiting the neighborhood&apos;s potential to become a basketball court for the Nets, resident Daniel Goldstein&apos;s interminable endeavor to protect the land, and the manifold positions assumed by residents and reformers alike, the film emerges like a Greek tragedy. Although this particular story is set in Brooklyn, NY, the central theme is germane to everyone, everywhere: when large amounts of money are on the table anything can be bought, including your home right out from under you. Goldstein is indefatigable as he grapples with both the dubious techniques invented to diminish the relevancy and even existence of the community and his neighbors who may have been lured in with assurances of a better world to come. As the ground is excavated around him, posited to become a basketball-mall supercenter, he and his family hold out for an equitable outcome while his neighbors slip out of sight and celebrities surface to champion both sides of the dispute. Notably, those who live in the area are opposed to the project, while those who reside far away rally for the demolition. Also pertinent is the story of the media and its undemanding adoption of the prefabricated packages handed to them by developers, while the local voice went largely unheard and/or unpublished. Battle For Brooklyn is as enthralling a film as it is an imperative message which merits ninety-three minutes of the viewers time. Goldstein&apos;s plight speaks an exemplar lesson in the preservation of community and the valor of both truth and follow through.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in April 1988 after a screening at Cine 42 on Manhattan&apos;s 42nd St.\n\n&quot;Brain Damage&quot; is an overly ambitious but nonetheless rewarding low-budget horror film using the monster genre as a timely metaphor for drug addiction and its ills.\n\nUnfortunately, pic has been poorly promoted and instead of a careful launch it preemed at the sleziest theater on 42nd Street in Manhattan.\n\nFilmmaker Frank Henenlotter showed promise with his 1982 pic (shot in 16 mm) &quot;Basket Case&quot;, with many of his collaborators encoroing on this 35mm followup, which includes a funny camro (with basket) byh the first pic&apos;s lead Kevin Van Hentenryck.\n\nRick Herbst stars as Brian, a youngster who&apos;s bitten by Elmer the Parasite (film&apos;s working title), a centuries-old eel-like monstr being kept alive on animal brains by goofball neighbors Theo Barnes and Lucille Saint-Peter. As Brian quickly learns, Elmer gives his host a periodic jolt of &quot;juice&quot;, blue fluid injectged into the brain which provides a psychedelic high.\n\nBrian becomes addicted to this pleasure and carrying Elmer around under his shirt gives the monster access to human victims, whose brains Elmer dines upon. Pic climaxes when Elve4r goes after the heroine, Brian&apos;s pal Barbara (Jennifer Lowry).\n\nAt every step, Henenlotter makes clear the analogy between Brian&apos;s plight and drug addiction, including going cold turkey and radical behavior changes as a tipoff to family (Brian&apos;s brother Mike, played by Gordon MacDonald) and friends, etc. Horror format is useful in this regard, heavily leavened by outbreaks of black humor.\n\nElmer, created by Gabe Bartalos and David Kindlon, is an admirable achievementg, a mobile puppet-like monstr that pays homage to films ranging from &quot;Fiend Withoutg a Face&quot; to &quot;The TIngle&quot;. With a wisecracking voice (uncredited, but sounding like tv horror movie host Zacherly) and cute eytes, Elmer is funny as well as scary in context.\n\nActing is over-the-top and film could have benefited from the casting of name talent in order to cross over to mainstream audiences with its timely thematics. As it is, Henenlotter, cinematograher Bruce Torbe and their team have maintained a harsh, cheap, underground look that fis the picture&apos;s cult ambitions. Overuse of blue filters is one drawback, however. Keyboards musical score by Gus Russo and Clutch Reiser is extremely effective."

Very few movies have done that for me... this is right up there with movies like Willow, Labrynth, and The Neverending Story.

      "reviewBody": "Man, I pity those poor fellows who end up being Mafia bosses. Must be a really stressful job. You&apos;ve got to uphold the exterior &apos;upstanding citizen&apos; routine so that hotheaded cops can be shouted down by their superiors, you make high pressure drug deals with other high-level guys, and worst of all, your employees are all nasty criminals by default, so the ever present threat of one of them double crossing you must be a terrible strain.\n\nLook at the fella in this film, Don Whatsisface. He sets up a nice deal with German guy to supply him a whole lot of dope, then someone turns around, guns down the dealers, and still steals the blow. You just can&apos;t get the employees. Get this though - someone then double crosses the henchman that double crossed the mob boss, which ends up in a whole heap of corpses for the cops to clean up.\n\nOne of those cops in Luc Merenda, and he&apos;s just arrived in Naples from Milan to find that the pizza is a lot better, but the crime is just as bad as everywhere else. Luc and his Neopolitan sidekick set off to figure out what the hell is going on with these shooting, with a little help from a mystery grass who keeps sending him hand drawn pictures of crime that are about to happen.\n\nSo it&apos;s business as usual for this Eurocrime film, but there&apos;s loads of action, car chases, and Merenda beating up bad guys, so who&apos;s going to complain? That actor playing his sidekick is rather good too, giving a bit more humanity to the blossoming bromance between the two cops. There&apos;s also a fair amount of violence with one particular gangster whacking rather a lot of people, including one guy who get blown up by dynamite.",

      "reviewBody": "If The Big Broadcast of 1938 is remembered today it&apos;s for the fact that it introduced Bob Hope in his first feature film and at the same time gave him his theme song Thanks for the Memory. Hope was billed fifth in this production behind W.C.Fields, Martha Raye, Dorothy Lamour, and Shirley Ross. \n\nIt was in fact a Fields film, but it was also to be Fields&apos;s last film for Paramount and everyone knew it. Though there are some flashes of typical Fields humor, basically Fields staggers through the role, a dual role in fact of two brothers, owners of a transatlantic steamship line.\n\nThe very thin plot of this film is the fact that two big luxury liners are in a race from New York to Cherbourg with a lot of money in various bets on the race. In fact that&apos;s where Bob Hope&apos;s money is, tied up in wagers. If he loses, his three ex-wives are going to clobber him with alimony, the three former spouses being Shirley Ross, Dorothy Lamour, and Grace Bradley. \n\nAll three are on board one of the liners with Hope who&apos;s a broadcaster and will be broadcasting the race on a worldwide hookup.\n\nOf course the plot is simply a convenience to allow a lot of talented people to show their stuff and they do. Besides Thanks for the Memory, Dorothy Lamour has a very nice song in You Took The Words Right Out Of My Heart which she sings to aspiring inventor Leif Erickson.\n\nThanks for the Memory is sung here and later recorded as a duet by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross. Ms. Ross&apos;s part in introducing what became the Oscar winning Best Song of 1938 is usually forgotten. Shirley Ross is also undeservedly forgotten herself today. She had a pleasing screen personality, a bit like Alice Faye and a good way with a lyric, just like Faye. Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger wrote Thanks for the Memory, probably the biggest hit that songwriting team ever had.\n\nThe Big Broadcast of 1938 was the last in a series of Big Broadcast films. By then I guess radio wasn&apos;t such a novelty gimmick to weave a film around. The first Big Broadcast gave Hope&apos;s lifetime rival, Bing Crosby, his first feature film starring role.\n\nThe film is part of an era of wonderful nonsense on the screen that was never concerned with any message of significance, just with providing the public with good entertainment. And with the cast of this film, it&apos;s guaranteed to be good entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Shohei Imamura was one of the directors in focus in the 2007 edition of the Japanese Film Festival, but his vast filmography means that we continue to see some of his masterpieces in this year&apos;s edition as well. A Man Vanishes examines the concept of Johatsu, tackling the phenomenon of people missing in Japan over the years. It picks one such person from the list, someone who had seemed to disappear from the face of the earth due to embezzlement from his company, and the filmmakers begin an investigative documentary into the reasons behind and attempt at tracking him down.\n\nThe presentation of the documentary runs like an investigative drama predominantly filled with police interrogative type of questioning. The filmmakers take great pains to locate friends and family of Tadashi Oshima, and interviews them on camera – at times needed to mask their eyes to protect identities - to provide us a vast and hopefully objective opinion of the man we get engaged into looking for. This provides an opportunity for Imamura to touch upon themes such as relationships, as well as the general attitudes of people in Oshima&apos;s generation. At one point the occult is also pursued as an option to try and obtain answers to the million dollar question as to his current location.\n\nAnd you may find that the film does get a little long-winded with no end in sight in its discussions and interviews, crafting a story quite unlike how it will be done in today&apos;s context, since the tale here come in pieces from the series of interviews, perceptions formed, and the memories of subjects that we know will be tainted inevitably by time. If done today, it&apos;ll be more in-your-face and to-the-point (though there&apos;s a reason why this was avoided) with a clear narrative guiding hand to point us where it wants us to look. This one spirals a little out of control where the interviewees and subject craft most of the talking points, and as a result we get a potential for a murder-mystery, involving two sisters who seem to be equally involved, and possibly guilty as to the outcome of Oshima&apos;s location.\n\nBut when the rug gets pulled under our feet through the sudden breaking of walls and the audience being engaged at a different level, we then realize how in effect the film may set out to make us understand how near impossible it is to solve cases of this nature, on how it&apos;s mind boggling to know where to begin, nor know whether time invested in investigations will lead to a successful outcome. It has to rely on the faulty memories of people insistent that they&apos;re right, and as events unfold show how stalemates are so easily reached when either party fervently believe what they see as experience as the truth, and in so will contradict the accounts of others. On the other hand, the line between reality and fiction, truth and lie gets blurred beyond recognition, so whatever you thought you knew becomes something you don&apos;t anymore.\n\nIn the last 2 scenes which are quite similar in content, one in a room and the other in an outdoor street location, one will get dizzy following the entire dialogue exchange, because it beats around the bush, never ends, and contains never ending bickering that you&apos;ll be exasperated enough to root for someone giving up. Thank goodness that the camera pulls out in time, though still leaving you perplexed over",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; is one of those semi-name oddities that always stood out on video store shelves when I was a youth (lamenting the &apos;parental lock&apos; on all horror movies I so badly wanted to rent), what with the darkened figures congregating around a manhole, eyes glowing white. Years later, I have finally gotten a chance to see the film, and my response is pretty mixed: it lies somewhere between the Land of Campy and the Dominion of Creepy, with some elements of the Retro Rest Area thrown in for good measure. &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; takes a formula familiar to anybody who&apos;s seen a &apos;50s &apos;Big Bug&apos; flick: Evil Guys In Suits are dumping toxic waste where it doesn&apos;t belong (in this case, the sewers below Manhattan), thus inspiring some unexpected and unpleasant side effects in the homeless people living under the city--they transform into C.H.U.D.s (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers), reptilian-looking monsters with a taste for human flesh. While the premise is extremely cheesy, director Douglas Cheek teeters the line between camp and horror rather well--not all-out serious nor a straight romp, it strikes a fair balance (the creepily minimalist, synth-driven score helps, too). The cast of semi-name actors (John Heard, Kim Greist, and a wonderfully wiggy Daniel Stern) treat the material at face value, but never wink at the camera, thus engendering a bizarre charm to the events that transpire. Unfortunately, even for a film that plays as fast and loose as &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; does, it leaves a few too many unresolved plot points for my liking. But if you want something a fair distance from the mainstream radar, greased with the grimy spirit of the 1980s, look no further than &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman (Kurt Neumann, 1946) - This is a touch better than Amazons, with plenty of action (quite well done) and a lively performance by Weissmuller, who&apos;d looked a bit out of sorts in the previous entry. The plot, by now following a path through the jungle wilds so well-trodden it resembles a motorway, sees the Ape Man battling a weird cult with silly leopard costumes that&apos;s really into robbery and human sacrifice. Considering the movies were aimed at kids, their marketing is curiously sexualised, with the poster art invariably flagging up the boobs of whichever minor character was most well-endowed. Here it&apos;s Acquanetta, who gets shared billing. Her leopard bikini is at least a bit better thought-out than those ridiculous capes the other cult members are wearing.\n\nI rather enjoyed the film, particularly its adherence to near wall-to-wall action, but it provides quite a bit of unintentional hilarity. That comes partly from its incredibly low opinion of natives (who are all duplicitous, hateful savages) and partly from the barely-choreographed dance the leopard men do around the fire. They look like drunk clubbers wearing their wives&apos; coats. One interesting element of the film is &quot;half-native&quot; Edgar Barrier, a Western-educated cultist who denounces the decadence of the imperialists and leads the fight against them. All the RKO series regulars return here: Brenda Joyce is still somewhat one-note as Jane, Boy is entering puberty (giving him an all-new voice and face) and Cheeta hogs the limelight once more. I&apos;m going to be an old cynic and suggest that it&apos;s not really him playing that music on the trumpet, though."

      "reviewBody": "As we all know, Eliza was blessed with the gift of talking to animals when she freed an injured animal who turned out to be a shaman. On safari with her family, she goes out to play with her lion friends when poachers pounce and steal one of the cubs. Eliza is determined to get her friend back but first has to escape from the English boarding school that her Grandmother has insisted she attend to make her more ladylike.\n\nIn my defence it is my inability to sleep on airplanes during the day that led me to watch this film  not just my desire to see a cartoon. I am vaguely aware of the series but have never cared enough to actually ever watch an episode  nor will I ever be likely to! However, as a way of passing 90 minutes, I was happy to have it and quite surprised to find that, although not aimed at adults, I was not put to sleep by it. The plot is very simple but has enough going on to keep the interest and keep the screen busy. It is rarely funny but it is quite amusing all the way through. It is simple stuff but I did enjoy it.\n\nThe animation is not that impressive but it is professional and colourful and I never felt that corners had been cut  it all looked big and fun. The cast and characters are good  hardly difficult or complex but still good enough to do the job. The main family are funny enough with their mix of accents (love that monkey!) from Curry, Chabert, Kane etc and the support cast is good with enjoyable little roles for Woodard, Redgrave, Tomei and Everett- who takes to the role with a bit of relish and his tongue in his cheek.\n\nOverall, hardly a great film but one that I&apos;m sure many parents will have to watch due to their kids watching the series. As such it is actually OK. The plot is simple but not simplistic or dull, the film is busy with a good amusing tone and the whole thing works well throughout. Young children will enjoy it and, while there is not much for adults in the way that Pixar delivers the goods, parents will not be bored senseless by it and may, if they are in the mood find it enjoyable if childish."

This is one of the rare exceptions.\n\nThe makers succeeded well in capturing the complexity of the book&apos;s characters. Julia Ormond does remarkably well as the moody, unpredictable Smilla Jaspersen. So does Gabriel Byrne in the role of the rather secretive Mechanic. The brilliant Richard Harris is in here too, one of the many movies he probably said that it would be his last. The rest of the cast fits in well. Nice to see that they didn&apos;t try to get all big names, but rather actors who can fill a role appropriately.\n\nOf course the movie isn&apos;t perfect, but in order to give that book full credit, they would have had to make a 4 hour film. Especially the second part, with all the events on the ship and in Greenland, is rather condensed. Those scenes could have used a bit more air to breathe, less pace.\n\nNevertheless I really like this movie, I have been watching it several times already. And now I think I am going to read the book again... (8/10)",

Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.\n\nThey found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you&apos;ve seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There&apos;s no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.\n\nI love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations. This was by far the adventure movie I&apos;ve seen in years. Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart."

      "reviewBody": "First of all, this film has definitely the best (German) movie title ever. It loses much of its power when it&apos;s translated but in German it is absolutely fascinating.\n\nOn the other hand, Fassbinder&apos;s movies and especially this one are not untranslatable, which is positive. The story about a love (is it?) between two people of different age and origin is universal and, though set in a very xenophobe and intolerant Germany, should be understood by everybody all over the world. Fassbinder is a master in guiding his actors so they can they play naturally and believably without using a particular local accent or slang that is probably more realistic.\n\nI do not completely agree with the film&apos;s utterly pessimistic view on practically all the characters in the movie; I think his portray of contemporary society is a little bit exaggerated (and it was even twenty-five years ago). However, I acknowledge that by means of exaggerating like this, Fassbinder makes his criticism clear and evokes a particularly bad feeling (of guilt?) in the viewer&apos;s belly. While the story is rather sad, it includes a lot of (sarcastic) side-swipes on society as it is.\n\nAngst essen Seele auf (oh, this is a marvellous title!) is maybe a more silent version of Harold and Maude; more silent but not less interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "In compared to movies that have a beginning, middle and an end, &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; barely qualifies as a real movie. On a bad day it&apos;s a crass, sluggish, desperate and entirely unnecessary entry in what was a pretty well-worn series featuring the irreplaceable Peter Sellers. \n\nCo-writer/Director Blake Edwards, whose 80&apos;s pendulum film-making talent swings from the very great (&quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, &quot;That&apos;s Life&quot;) to the deplorably awful (&quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;A Fine Mess&quot;, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot; among other casualties) goes back to the well to fashion the barest of linking &quot;plot&quot; segments to bring to life trims and deleted scenes from the previous entries in the long-running series. \n\nThese links are rather sloppily matched/handled and pretty obviously shot: a lumpy double for Peter Sellers in long walking shots, David Niven&apos;s awful looped vocal by Rich Little (!) of all people, the trials of matching the costumes of films more than six years previous (watch those lapels, guys!). \n\nThat said, what other movie has your very last chance to see Peter Sellers as Chief Inspector Clouseau at work? It is, in a weird way, a cheapjack &quot;tribute&quot; to the genius of Sellers and a ghostly valentine to the entire series - the very same set-ups, the former castmembers - and is best seen as such. \n\nFeel free to turn the film off after the first 45 minutes, and then resist the urge to watch either &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983) or &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; (1993). But, if you&apos;re a die-hard &quot;Panther&quot; fan, that warning probably comes too late.",

This film was way ahead of its time , it was from an era in which people actually spent time and effort on actually writing a good script. Vijay Anand (who also directed &quot;teesri manzil&quot; ) once again showed that he is the master of suspense . He is also ,in my opinion, one of the BEST at filming Song sequences, be it the sensuous &quot;raat akeli hai&quot; or the elaborate &quot; hoton mein aisi baat&quot; . This movie was on par (if not better) than many of the suspense thrillers which came out of Hollywood in that era.I really hope the Indian Film Industry finds more directors like Vijay Anand, who Value the importance of a good script.",

      "reviewBody": "At times during this film, I wondered if Téchiné had set out specifically to construct a world in which conventional gender expectations were turned upside down. I have appreciated across Téchiné&apos;s body of work a sense that, because heteronormativity is not assumed, alternatives to heteronormativity are, well, normalized. Although this analysis makes Téchiné&apos;s work sound didactic or agenda-driven, it is not. It&apos;s a breath of fresh air to spend time in a filmmaker&apos;s universe that doesn&apos;t adhere to gendered relationship conventions so commonplace and routine that we don&apos;t even notice or question them. When filmmakers construct a universe (in which some things exist and others do not exist), it is frequently the case that the only female characters who inhabit the constructed world are, on some level, concubines, whether outright prostitutes, objects of desire, wives, or girlfriends. In this common construction of the writer/director&apos;s film universe, the woman (or women) possess very few assets of worth: sex, youth, and beauty. The story, to the extent that it concerns the female characters, is about how women deploy their limited set of assets to attract male attention and the attendant benefit: material security. (In these constructed universes, women are uninteresting or irrelevant if they have the means to achieve material security without its being conferred as a consequence of their attachment to an entitled male character.) Given the popularity of this particular constructed universe in film stories, it&apos;s interesting to occasionally encounter film universes that deviate from this tired formula. Why is this conventional constructed film universe so popular? Perhaps because it caters to the a male fantasy of desirability as an extension of power? Téchiné&apos;s Hôtel des Amériques is so radical in its construction as to explore the possibility of a world in which expected roles are almost completely transposed. As a thought-experiment, it is fascinating and merits close watching.",

If I had seen this movie first i would have definitely liked it more than twilight. I love the psychological play in the movie, i liked the story, but I really really really loved Saoirse Ronan in that role. She played it marvelously well, and the director did a great job portraying her two personalities. I can&apos;t tell you what it was missing yet; I am not getting payed for this so i am allowed to not know. I encourage you to see it, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a solid 7/10 for me.",

Alstrup was in a similar situation and died the year after. However he had been in the acting business for a long time, mostly in theaters, and he contributed to some early danish silent movies. In Peter Andersen there is paid attention to a lot of details in the character and his surroundings, and Svend Methling Sr. perform a fine job directing this excellent movie filled with nuances and subtlety. You are reminded that he the year before directed &apos;Sommerglæder&apos; where he managed to capture equally subtle emotions and details in a similar moody production. The film did not cause much attention, but it was appreciated by a number of reviewers, and the low key tone alone makes it stand out as something special compared with most other movies of the time.",

There are more holes than plot here. The acting is so bad that the lines seem to have been ad-libbed. It is an amazing feat to have a cast so good in a movie so bad.\n\nThe initial premise is decent enough, but there is almost no character development. All the characters seem wooden, and little connection is made to any of them. The facial expressions and mannerisms of the characters is more annoying than anything else. Lynn Whitfield&apos;s character is more than a little creepy. Woodbine seems to have been ad-libbing his lines, and sounds unnatural in the role.\n\nAs I watched this movie, I found myself wishing grisly ends upon every character. This is truly a wretched effort at film-making.",

      "reviewBody": "THE INVINCIBLE FIST (1969) is a lesser swordplay film from Shaw Bros. director Chang Cheh (ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, BLOOD BROTHERS, HAVE SWORD WILL TRAVEL, etc.) starring Lo Lieh (FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH) as a sword-wielding bounty hunter, Master Tieh, who goes under the nickname, &quot;Invincible Fist.&quot; However, despite the title, there are no fists on display in this film. The action strictly involves swords and such nifty exotic weapons as the Golden Abacus,which shoots out little golden balls, goose-shaped flying stars, and a tube which shoots out a chain with a sharp projectile at the end which embeds itself into a victim enabling a fighter to pull his opponent in close. There are many fight scenes involving multiple combatants, often played out in fields of high reeds (built on Shaw Bros. studio sets) which offer convenient cover to the various parties stalking each other.\n\nThe plot is a simple one, involving the efforts of Master Tieh and his band of fighters to apprehend a skilled band of robbers and their numerous henchmen who have struck four times within the past two years, robbing and killing prominent families in the province. Ku Feng (THE MAGIC BLADE) plays one of the four lead robbers, who disguises himself as &quot;Cripple Peng&quot; when not robbing. Chen Sing (SHAOLIN MONK) plays another of the robbers and has one excellent fight scene early on where he wields a metal spear. David Chiang (THE NEW ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN), in an early major role, plays Master Tieh&apos;s brother and chief lieutenant and distinguishes himself in many fight scenes also. Future kung fu star Cliff Lok (KUNG FU GENIUS, RING OF DEATH) is visible as one of the bad guys. The robbers ride around in a carriage which holds six-to-eight men, but is pulled by a single poor horse who clearly has a hard time lugging it uphill as it&apos;s called on to do here.\n\nThere is a subplot in which a wounded Lo Lieh is nursed back to health by the virtuous blind daughter (Li Ching) of the head bandit, played by Fang Mien. This whole sequence might have slowed the film down, but it&apos;s thankfully short and comes too late in the proceedings to do any serious damage. A scene between the two men in front of the blind woman foreshadows a very similar scene played out between Danny Lee and Chow Yun Fat in front of a blind Sally Yeh in John Woo&apos;s THE KILLER (1989).\n\nAgain, this is not one of the great martial arts films from Shaw Bros., coming out at a time when Chang Cheh was putting greater effort into films like GOLDEN SWALLOW, HAVE SWORD WILL TRAVEL and RETURN OF THE ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, but it is polished and well-staged and offers plenty of action. Fans of this genre will not be too disappointed."

I could not really detect a plot, but my guess is it has something to do with naked she-barbarians with masks and bearskin strings. The film seems to be shot through some kind of filter, giving the effect of a constant fog hanging in front of the camera. The splatter is not as abundant as in Fulci&apos;s better-known zombie-films, but there&apos;s still the occasional bloodletting.\n\nWorthwhile, but only of you&apos;re into cinematic curiosities."

See the movie for the writing, stay for the dance in the nightclub where Tommy Davidson busts out the best dance moves on reel until Rush Hour :) If you&apos;re even remotely a fan of outrageous trash talking and completely random lines (&quot;Was ya gonna wait till I turned into a butterfly?&quot; and &quot;You need a cigarette to bring you down?&quot; LOL!) then this movie is a must see.

      "reviewBody": "An utterly routine military film, minus anything that might distinguish it from the many other recruiting posters of the time, e.g. The DI (1957), Battle Cry (1955), et al. Except for the first few minutes of combat in Korea, the remainder is taken up with Basic Training at Fort Bliss, TX. Widmark gets the stereotypical role of an emotionally crippled drill sergeant, while Malden is wasted as his straight-arrow assistant. Third billed Stewart is the required love interest, who unfortunately is all hair and little talent. The remainder of the cast fills out the ranks of recruit trainees, with the usual array of witty or problem personalities. The movie&apos;s one notable feature turns up in the multi-racial ranks of the trainees, a relatively new updating for Hollywood.\n\nAs a guy who went through Basic (at Ft. Bliss in the 60&apos;s), I have to agree with reviewer bkoganbing. Many of the incidents portrayed in the film would never have occurred in real training, especially Malden slugging Widmark in front of the trainees. But I guess the screenplay needed more action at that point. Then too, the language was really cleaned up for public viewing. I had to laugh every time Widmark benignly called the recruits &quot;young people&quot;.\n\nWhat surprises me is the movie&apos;s director, Richard Brooks. How he got the job of supervising this sort of pablum is a puzzle, having built a reputation for highly serious work as a screenwriter, Brute Force (1948), Crossfire (1947), et al. Anyway, the movie is fairly typical of the sanitized type of military drama of the 1950&apos;s, before the stark realities of Vietnam sank in. (Contrast Basic Training here with it&apos;s more starkly realistic counterpart in Full Metal Jacket {1987}.) All in all, Take The High Ground is little more than a bland period curiosity."

      "reviewBody": "Some people can consider Paradise Now as propaganda, however, in my humble opinion, this movie is much more than a story about the situation in Palestine. It&apos;s a movie that shows how human beings can do horrible things when they are oppressed and how this behavior even seem to make sense when you&apos;re taught from the childhood that doing such things is the only way to get freedom. \n\nIt&apos;s obvious that suicide bombers are murderers, but it&apos;s also obvious that they are victims from Hamas, Hezbollah, Israel, USA and everyone that gets profits with the violence in the Middle East, so this movie wasn&apos;t special to me for showing some kind of sympathy for terrorism if it does. The role of this movie for me was to show a humanized version of a group of people that I usually only take acknowledge by the TV as people whose only objective is to kill the highest possible amount of people. \n\nHere in Brazil we don&apos;t have ethnic or religious wars. Here, Palestinians and Jews live sometimes in the same neighborhood and there&apos;s never been a terrorist attack. On the other hand, we&apos;ve got extremely serious problems with violence caused by the oppression that poor people suffer from the Police, that seems only to exist to protect the rich. In May, a criminal organization called PCC (Capital&apos;s First Command) attacked more than a hundred of places (most Police stations) in São Paulo, killing approximately one hundred people. \n\nAre these criminals originally bad or their acts are just the consequence of an extremely unequal society? Well, on the TV we only see the criminals and the terrorists, but thank God we have movies like City of God, Carandiru and Paradise Now to show us the human beings.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been meaning to watch Adam for quite some time now and the film matched my expectations. The good thing about small independent films is that the stories are usually very personal and rich. That&apos;s the case with Adam, a film with substance and meaning. The film begins with the 29 year old Adam attending his father funeral and then returning to a lonely empty house. Beth, a writer damaged from a past relationship moves into the building where Adam lives and soon they meet. Adam is handsome but he&apos;s also odd and awkward. He suffers from Asperger syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder that causes difficulties in social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Despite this, Adam is very bright and Beth takes an interest in him. This leads to a relationship but, is it right? Are they fit for each other?... Adam is not so much a romantic comedy but more of a character study as it shows Adam and Beth learning and growing from each other and stepping into unfamiliar territory. Hugh Dancy is tremendous as the lead character Adam and his portrayal never appears as a caricature. Instead he relies on small gestures and certain facial expressions which results in a very moving and impressive performance. Rose Byrne was very good as Beth as well, although I wish her character had been better written. I say this because sometimes, she is extremely sensitive to Adam&apos;s condition but on a few occasions she almost seems to forget about it. Peter Gallagher, Rose Byrne and Amy Irving compose the supporting cast with Gallagher doing a terrific job (as usual) as Beth&apos;s father. Adam doesn&apos;t have the clichéd happy ending so usual in Hollywood, instead it presents us with an authentic and realistic conclusion that felt very satisfying. Adam is a breath of fresh air, it&apos;s a genuine film with a very moving and well written story.\n\n8/10"

      "reviewBody": "Marcia (Tatiana Saphir) is a heavy-set woman who is stuck in a dead-end job selling underwear in a lingerie shop that attracts few customers. Rejected by her fiancé after a two-year courtship, she goes through the motions of living. Her world is turned upside down, however, when she is kidnapped at knife point by two sullen, ice-cold, look-alike lesbians named Mao (Carla Crespo) and Lenin (Veronica Hassan) who tell her how much they want to have sex with her.\n\nBased on the novel La Prueba by Argentine writer Cesar Aria, Deigo Lerman&apos;s Suddenly is a fascinating examination of power struggles in relationships that takes us to unexpected places - suddenly. Filmed in 16mm black and white by cinematographers Diego del Piano and Luciano Zito and reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch&apos;s episodic style, Lerman&apos;s first feature has, according to the director, &quot;contradictions reveling in contradictions&quot;.\n\nThe film contains moments of comedy but these are undercut by a mysteriously sinister air that keeps us guessing as to where the film is headed. Marcia is scared but does not attempt to run away and seems curious about their overtures. The tough young women hijack a taxi and drive Marcia to visit Lenin&apos;s seventy-year old Aunt Blanca (Beatriz Thibaudin), who lives in Rosario, a seaside town near Buenos Aires with her two tenants, the shy Felipe (Marcos Ferrante), a Biology student and Delia (Maria Merlino), a painter and part-time teacher. Aunt Blanca in a fine performance by Thibaudin, is one of the few sympathetic characters in the film and her unconventional warmth allows Lenin to connect with the value of relationships.\n\nWhen Marcia tells Mao that she enjoyed being with her, she tells Marcia to shut up and go to sleep. Mao is an unpleasant bully who, after consummating her relationship with Marcia, neglects her and rudely shifts her interest to Felipe. Passive to the end, Marcia does not stand up for herself or try to leave. Felipe seems bewildered by the girls but supports Mao in a shoplifting spree without considering the ramifications. Suddenly is a strangely involving film that shows great promise by the director but the lesbian butch women are caricatures that detract from the film&apos;s message, which after all is quite simple - when people are finished playing ego games with each other, what is left is love.",

I actually think the film was great the main premise of the film which I feel most people have completely missed is a bond between two guys that is as strong as a brotherhood hood. The alpha one who has the confidence to take over the world and the quiter one both who would die for each other in an instance. And maybe it was just me but I really did feel the emotions that they feel throughout the film. It seems like a lot of people hate the film so maybe I&apos;m missing something but i think its a great film. The film is not totally accurate but films don&apos;t need to be and I film is long which is the reason I suspect it gets so much hate.",

This is Pre Hip - Hop, Pre Rap, and before Break Dancing took over the youth culture of the Bronx. It is right before the advent of Graffiti writers/bombers and Break Dance Crews that took off and became the new black culture a few years later. The film takes place in the summer of 1979. Shockingly realistic interviews with gang members of the infamous Savage Nomads and the savage skulls. Amazingly this authentic documentary does not contain any of the normal pitfalls that befuddle today&apos;s more exploitive investigative reports on gangs of the &quot; 60mins.&quot; type. Filmmaker Gary Weis of SNL and &quot;Ruddles&quot; fame manages to let the kids speak for themselves. Most of the footage are real interviews. A few scenes are reannactments of stories as told by some of the younger street kids. A rare glimpse into late 70&apos;s New York towards the end of the infamous South Bronx Gangs. Anyone who is a fan of &quot;The Warriors&quot; would appreciate this film. The documentary shows many sides of the mainly Puerto Rican / Lation community of the South Bronx including. reformed gang members, current gang members, the police, and the community leaders who try and reach out to them. A film like this is simply unable to be made today !",

      "reviewBody": "This was the first filming of Enid Blyton&apos;s famous first Famous Five foray from &apos;42, in 8 weekly parts lasting over 2 hours in total but still retaining the zeitgeist as nothing subsequent ever quite has. The times have gone now as surely as good old British Pluck has been replaced by good old British Trepidation Due To Fear Of Litigation. Totally throwaway and probably not very satisfying to the adult actors and most serious adults watching it really wasn&apos;t meant to be leisurely dissected in the armchair 50 years later  but I can&apos;t help it! Originally produced by the always-cheap-and-worthy Children&apos;s Film Foundation and later thanks to Rank and Norman Wright it was first made available in the mid &apos;90&apos;s.\n\nIt sticks pretty well to the story of the location of shipwrecked treasure (gold ingots) being hunted down by 4 children George, Julian, Dick and Ann (sic) and their dog Tim up against a couple of machinating baddies, only occasionally veering into using bits from other Five books or original screenplay. Some points: If Aunt Fanny was changed to Margaret to lull the huge, vast American audience who would be watching why was Alf/James the fisher boy changed to Jan? Did Uncle Quentin the poor property-rich scientist think his island was worth next to nothing? A little difficult to arrange but Tim appeared a bit of a dolt compared to the books, which made chunky baddie Robert Cawdon&apos;s non-Blyton order at a tense moment to keep him quiet or he&apos;d &quot;blow his brains out!&quot; a bit rich. The classic view of Kirrin Island in the bay on a sunny day is seen repeatedly as the Five keep running on the shoreline in front of a superimposed image of it, Eileen Soper should have appreciated that touch. It made me wonder if they&apos;d caused any damage running and squeezing into every nook and cranny of Corfe Castle, you get the feeling you know every inch of every window arch, stairway and blade of grass by the end. Apparently Blyton actually saw and enjoyed some of the filming at Corfe but I don&apos;t know what she thought of some of the liberties taken with her story.\n\nEither way, it captured the spirit of the adventure, and with all faults and without rose-tinted spectacles it&apos;s still memorable and something I can watch shamelessly every few years wishing they&apos;d filmed a few more of the books in the same carefree vein just after this one.",

It didn&apos;t suck. Man, was I relieved. \n\nI have never been able to put a finger on Mr. Mathers&apos; rapping skills, I think his technique is amazing. His rhymes are sharp and intelligent and he always performs them with pure justification. But could he take this to the big screen? He succeeded. In his debut movie he managed to play it real and natural. He had good on screen chemistry with pretty much all the characters, but especially with Brittany Murphy (Uh, gotta love that sex scene... That was hot.)\n\nThe final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now!\n\n\n* Some might say that it must be easy to play yourself, and it&apos;s not a secret that this movie is somewhat autobiographic. But it sure takes guts to put yourself out there like that, well done.\n\n\nSo 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Now I have witnessed the third truly great film to have come out of America in 1994.  One that can hold its own, and more, against such films released that year as &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; and &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street.&quot;  It&apos;s called &quot;Fresh,&quot; and I&apos;ll go out on a limb to say it&apos;s as powerful an urban drama as any other I&apos;ve seen in my life.\n\nThere are no fancy cinematic magic tricks going on in this film, aside from an instance of superimposed images that is so simple it almost seems like a throwback to old silent dramas.  There are no choreographed gun fights, no switching film stocks to produce psychedelic effects, nothing like that. Not to say that these things cannot be used appropriately and judiciously to enhance the effect of a particular film, but &quot;Fresh&quot; is stripped bare, and must depend on its performances, direction, and writing alone.\n\nFor starters, a young Sean Nelson delivers a performance that puts the lion&apos;s share of veteran actors to shame.  He&apos;s completely lacking in self-consciousness, almost like he&apos;s unaware that the camera is on him for nine out of ten of the shots in &quot;Fresh.&quot;  His character, for which the film takes its title, may be the smartest youth in motion picture history for whom genius is not a gimmick or a joke (i.e. &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; &quot;Real Genius,&quot; stuff like that).  Watching him, you see a wise old actor in a teen&apos;s body; he does not &quot;act&quot; any emotions or thoughts, but merely feels them and thinks them.  He seems to embody bits of screen legend:  a little Bogart stalwartness there, some of Jimmy Stewart&apos;s quiet charm here, and most of all Morgan Freeman&apos;s ability to communicate much while doing or saying very little.\n\nThat&apos;d be just enough for most movies, but Nelson is backed by a choice supporting cast: the two most recognizable names are obviously Samuel L. Jackson (Fresh&apos;s chessmaster/alcoholic father) and Giancarlo Esposito (the slimy, high-living drug dealer Esteban), and both are perfect in award-caliber performances.  Two lesser known actors, N&apos;Bushe Wright (Fresh&apos;s junkie sister Nichole) and Jean LaMare (as Jake, the hot tempered low-man-on-the-totem-pole employee of Corky) are also terrific in key roles.\n\nThe screenplay, by director Boaz Yakin, is doggedly unpredictable, but in retrospect it all makes perfect sense -- nothing in the movie pushes the bounds of credibility.  I&apos;ve seen truckloads of thrillers, most of them are wearily proficient at making you guess what&apos;s next.  None but a few, however, kept me guessing WHEN to guess, or surprised me with such affecting emotional developments.  None but a few moved along with such self-assured grace and style.  &quot;Fresh&quot; knows its territory, the time and place it&apos;s set in, and it provides characters who talk like they do in real life -- not ones that sound like they&apos;re in a movie where they talk like they do in real life.\n\nThe use of violence is admirably restrained.  Most of it takes place off camera, silhouetted, or cut away from quickly.  The two scenes of bloodletting, when they are shown to us, are literally heartbreaking.  Not only does &quot;Fresh&quot; keep us off guard on a psychological level, but on an emotional one as well, something few films ever think of doing.\n\nIf I were to offer one criticism, it would be that the chess metaphor was pressed just a bit too hard by Yakin (though the final scene is devastating):  we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist, we don&apos;t need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room.  That&apos;s a small quibble, though, because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate, and Jackson&apos;s early speech about the game is an ingenious device."

Unfortunately we don&apos;t have actors of the quality of James Mason anymore whose presence here is completely convincing as the otherwordly Dutchman of the title. The photography, clever placing of prop statues on moonlit beaches and raised camera angles viewing the coastal location in a surrealist style all help to create the fantasy illusion that echoes the art of the time....(Dali) etc. More than anything the film works precisely because it was made then.....if it was remade today it simply wouldn&apos;t work the people aren&apos;t around anymore who would make it work in the &apos;digital&apos; age. Incidentally the &apos;voiceover&apos;narration works very well..(as it also did in the maligned original version of Blade Runner....now never shown) In all a great film with a haunting quality....not as well known as it should be.",

I don&apos;t compare it with Felix Feist&apos;s DONOVAN&apos;S BRAIN, because this kind of topic is not really my cup of tea, so I won&apos;t give my opinion to say which is the best. Both movies are from a Curt Siodmak&apos;s novel. Watch it mainly for Von Stroheim&apos;s character. But not only."

      "reviewBody": "My 3 year old loves animal movies, even Beverly Hills Chihuahua (which let&apos;s face it was pretty average at best). She didn&apos;t like this movie at all.\n\nIt&apos;s not cute, it&apos;s not adult, it&apos;s not a lot of things and the most important thing it isn&apos;t is entertaining.\n\nThis film is a horrible adaptation from a beloved cartoon - the characters are not really likable, there is a confusing mish-mosh of adult aimed humor and situations involving the dogs, and then just horrible parts featuring the humans. William H Macy is sinister and extremely creepy as the dog food company owner - he could have been kooky and funny, a little zany perhaps, but no, he comes across as aggressive, pushy and sinister.\n\nThe story itself is stupid and lacking in any real interest for the young kids this movie is really supposed to be aimed at. The adults forced to take the kids won&apos;t find anything better in it either.\n\nI would advise anyone not to even both renting it for a dollar, it&apos;s not worth it, and I don&apos;t say that about many movies.\n\nCGI may be very clever and way better than it used to be, but this movie over uses it to the point of boredom on the part of the viewer.\n\nCGI isn&apos;t enough if there is no real, interesting story - I for one could care less about Phil and his new job at the pet food company.\n\nNothing about this movie is appealing!",

      "reviewBody": "For a movie maker of the caliber of Shayam Benegal is, it goes without saying with his invite to Sajjanpur comes along a bouquet of expectations. The only other movie of his that I’ve seen is Zubaidaa and I was amazed at his story telling quality! This time, the setting is rustic with characters from a usual random village. The film is presented as a slice of life from the perspective of the protagonist than a story with a beginning and end.\n\nMahadev, the only degree holder in Sajjanpur nurses ambitions to be a novel writer someday, but fate has sealed him to writing letters for the illiterate village folk who come to him not just for his knowledge of the letter but also for his ability to write with that extra zing and passion that makes the letters work. Playing the protagonist, Shreyas Talpade gets the largest of movie pie that he executes with brilliance without going overboard.\n\nOur writer’s clientèle takes us through the minds of the varied village folk. It ranges from his childhood crush Kamla (Amrita Rao) who writes to her far away husband, a mother (Ila Arun) worried about her vibrant daughter’s (Divya Dutta) horoscope, a compounder (Ravi Kishan) who is deeply in love with the young widow Shobharani (Rajeshwari Sachdev), the villainous ex-Sarpanch Ramlal (Yashpal Sharma) and a Eunuch too.\n\nThe next couple of hours, which at times feels somewhat stretched, give us a glimpse of their lives. Mahadev is good at heart and does well to others, but he secretly tries to misread letters to Kamla thinking that he may have a chance if her husband went away. Ramlal tries his best to connive against the Eunuch Munnibai to ensure it doesn’t win the local elections. As is life, in the end, it’s happy for some sad for others.\n\nThroughout the movie, its poignant moments are interspersed so delicately that you don’t feel any character being out of place. The best in my opinion is when Mahadev learns the truth about Kamala’s husband’s life, where Shreyas’ flowing emotions are so well portrayed. Then there is the scene of Munnibai getting a letter written seeking protection. For one, the music is not memorable and the seeming length may bother.\n\nThe characters of Sajjanpur are both simpletons at times and wise in the ways of the world when necessary. The movie makes a point on various serious social issues including land acquisitions for industrialization, struggle of the poor and fall into organ trade, widow remarriage, superstitions, job worry for the educated and many more. If you don’t mind the lack of typical stories and climaxes, this story is surely worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Alex (Matthew Perry) is a hotshot construction supervisor who works for a company based in New York City. He loves Manhattan and wants to live there indefinitely. However, management needs him to travel to Las Vegas and oversee the production of a new casino. As the assignment will last a few months, Alex is less than enthusiastic but makes the trip. Things begin to look up, however, when he meets beautiful Isabel (Salma Hayek), a photographer, in a trendy bar. They are instantly smitten with one another and the result is a hot one night stand. In the morning, Isabel sneaks away with no forwarding address, perhaps because of a touch of shame. However, a month or so later, she comes once again to Alex&apos;s condo to announce that she is pregnant and that, yes, Alex is the father. Alex is thrown for a loop, especially since Isabel is adamant about having the baby. Casting caution to the wind, Alex decides to marry the lovely Isabel on the spot. But, there are complications. Isabel is a Mexican-American with a Catholic family who is terribly upset that the marriage did not take place at a church. As for Alex&apos;s parents, they are whitebread, uppercrust America and they are equally appalled at their son&apos;s choice. Then, too, Isabel loves the desert Southwest but Alex can only imagine living in the Big Apple for the rest of his life. Will they be able to survive their first year? This is a very funny, very romantic film about unlikely marriage partners. Perry is a talented comedian whose humorous delivery is priceless, especially in this movie. Hayek, although known more for more serious roles, does a nicely comic turn here, too, and she is utterly gorgeous. The rest of the cast, including Jill Clayburgh and Jon Tenney, are very good as well. Then, too, the scenery in Nevada is of the put-your-eye-out variety and the costumes, script, and production values are sharp, also. If you are a fan of romantic comedy, you should definitely rush out to see this one as soon as possible. It is worthy of many a &quot;top ten&quot; list. But, even if romcoms are not your cup of tea, this one will charm you with its funny situations and delivery. You will not be foolish at all to give it a try.",

Nelson (Who resembles a spaced out Tarantino, and plays the film&apos;s hero.) reportingly lost the dialog track to the film, but replaced missing talk with a narrator for driver safety films. Highlights include the carpet guy attacking a high school dance (Monster makes sure he doesn&apos;t wreck tables and chairs) the army is called out in one scene (This &quot;army&quot; consists of five guys in helmets being transported in a pick-up truck!) 80 minutes of mindless fun.

The Project&apos;s plus column, however, is far longer than the minus one, as the very fabric of the improvisational techniques employed holds together an authenticity virtually guaranteed to send shivers down the backs of all but the most road-hardened horror vets.  The interplay among Donahue, Leonard, and Williams is refreshingly funny in the early stages, which only ratchets up the intensity when doom seems to be knocking (or howling or scratching or leaving creepy tokens outside the campers&apos; tent).  The Blair Witch Project has all of the necessary sequences to assure its cult status (I love the stick figures) and the mysterious, dread-filled ending will most certainly set fans arguing -- once they catch their breath."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Down to the Bone&quot; follows in the tradition of classic addiction and rehab movies (such as &quot;Clean and Sober&quot;), but it doesn&apos;t stoop to any clichés. \n\nThe key to the story&apos;s credibility is the director&apos;s documentary style, the use of authentic, working class locales in Upstate New York, and terrific acting.\n\nDebut director Debra Granik and co-writer Richard Lieske don&apos;t follow the typical trajectory of horrific addiction experiences (&quot;Lost Weekend,&quot; &quot;Leaving Las Vegas,&quot; &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; etc.), though there&apos;s some frightening close calls, but quietly build an accretion of how a drug habit affects a mother and her family in her daily life as a cashier and living in a house her ne&apos;er do well husband never finishes renovating. With no explication or back story, &quot;Irene&quot;s life plays out for us completely through what we see in grainy digital video and the characters&apos; inarticulate interactions. \n\nRehab is only the half-way point in a continuing struggle (and we have seen the 12-steps many times but perhaps not this drearily matter-of-factly) and the film is brilliant at demonstrating just how difficult it is to quit when everywhere there are not only triggers for physical need but how those around her benefited in some way from her behavior when she was high and keep encouraging her to indulge. Lapsing is cynically referred to as &quot;the 13th step.&quot; None of these insights are hammered home redundantly as we see her frustrations and resiliency. \n\nI&apos;ve noted Vera Farmiga in various TV series, but here she reveals guts, strength and range below her fragile beauty as she very believably, step by step, gives &quot;Irene&quot; backbone. Her chemistry with a seductively magnetic Hugh Dillon is terrific as their relationship goes from attraction to risk to independence.\n\nThough at one point New York City is a bit tritely used as a tempting source for drugs, the primary settings in snowy Kingston and Ulster County, with its downscale stores, weatherbeaten houses, high unemployment and desolate highway scapes set the characters in a very believable, multi-racial setting.\n\nThere is a bit of heavy-handed symbolism with a pet snake, but the young children are terrifically natural, especially in their whiney-ness and physical reactions.\n\nThe soundtrack unobtrusively includes an interesting selection of indie rock, including by Dillon&apos;s band.",

Packaged in a &apos;nifty&apos; kids&apos; format (as so many others in the genre) this film does just that. From the head-phone-less 777 pilot who reads a &apos;newspaper&apos; in the cockpit (folded, read from the hand with less than serious attention, an en-route flight chart is hardly a suspect here; and taking off his glasses in the direst emergency during the film doesn&apos;t help) to the ridiculous time-segment distortions, children are given the impressions that not only does everything happen in slow motion in the world, but that 1) professionalism, 2) today&apos;s technology, and, 3) emotional stability  among countless other real-world scenarios requiring mature judgment - can be plucked out of the air and bent for their own use simply because they think it so (Hollywood: guilty as charged).\n\nParents, try this at home: give your offspring a good dose of REALITY during the viewing of this flick (put the recorder on &apos;pause&apos; at the appropriate moment and MAKE IT SO). It may consume some precognitive time --- on your part. There&apos;s nothing wrong with fantasy, just make sure your kids know the difference. And, FYI, it&apos;s one of the main reasons English-speaking children fall so far behind many nations of the world in high-school and college aptitude. We&apos;re not only losing our engineers, teachers, artists  and yes, dreamers  for the same reasons, we&apos;re losing parentage.\n\nFANTASY: 10 --- REALITY: 1, for an HGN rating  Hollywood Gross Negligence. PS/yes, I&apos;ve raised children (5)  they&apos;re all out of college, doing well and having payed their own way; they know &apos;the difference&apos; and I didn&apos;t pay a dime, just a lot of attention"

      "reviewBody": "Alright, I recognize that this movie is not good and has several problems. However, it was the product of a time when nonsensical parodies were in vogue. I remember that the &quot;Police Academy&quot; franchise was one of the successes of that years, having continued to have acceptance on TV throughout the 90s. It is a familiar and educated comedy that tries to have fun without slang or dirty jokes, that has been more popular with young people nowadays. Despite the film&apos;s problems and flaws, which are undeniable, perhaps the way we look at humor and what makes us laugh also helped to bury this film in the oblivion.\n\nThe screenplay is based on Joe, a tough, independent detective&apos;s complicated relationship with his elderly mother, Tutti, who came to visit despite his unwillingness to do so, and who intrudes heavily on her son&apos;s personal and love life, subjecting him to deeply embarrassing situations, such as showing everyone photographs of his childhood and picaresque stories that he preferred to keep to himself. The film shows us how that mother is truly in love with her son, and she stubbornly resists acknowledging that she no longer has to take care of him like she used to. It also reveals how, deep down, he likes his mother, caring about her and accepting her help when he sees that she is right in what she says. For many people, the movie is pure nonsense, but the truth is that I know many mothers like that, for whom their children never grow up, and who like to have an active role in their lives, even if that&apos;s not what they want.\n\nThe movie is funny, in a polite and moderate way. He&apos;s not flashy and knows how to parody the cop action movies that were successful in the 80&apos;s. Despite this, he has a far-fetched story involving a situation of insurance fraud and arms trafficking, villains that never deserve our respect nor threaten, cliché characters loaded with almost every possible stereotype and a total lack of direction.\n\nThe cast is weak and doesn&apos;t get decent material. The spotlight naturally turns to an excellent performance by Estelle Getty, who achieves the most popular performance of her career in this film. The most resounding name, however, is Sylvester Stallone, who offers us a work that almost satirizes some of the action works that made him popular. The actor would later admit that he considers this film the worst he has starred in, and I can see why: there are many bad scenes, and some of them are particularly worthy of regret (the diaper scene, I confess, was something I would refuse). Nevertheless, and despite being far from his usual record, Stallone guarantees an impacting and charismatic presence.\n\nThe film has heavily dated cinematography that reeks of the 80s, with washed out colors and low contrast, but I think that&apos;s part of the nature of the film, which can&apos;t go against what was in use when it was conceived. There are a lot of action scenes, highly predictable but well done, where the special effects work reasonably well. The rhythm is very good, it doesn&apos;t get into tiring melodramas nor does it really tire us.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is certainly not a comedy as some reviews claimed. This is a documentary-like shot movie about being old, lonely and dying. Dehumanization and absence of compassion are also two of the themes treated here. The story is focused on the context of Romanian hospitals, but this could be generalized to most social systems globally, i think. And my own experience of old people dying in hospitals here in Belgium is of course not so awful, but somehow related to Mr. Lazarescu&apos;s experience. And even the nice characters, who really try to help, don&apos;t really change anything to the poor guy&apos;s fate. So this movie is really deeply pessimistic. In my opinion, it was also a bit too long (about 150 min.) and definitely not easy-watching. But interesting and thought-provoking (and a bit depressing too...)",

And a couple of years later they take away your house and leave you with a great debt that also ruins your life and may even cost your life. More and more people are not able to cope anymore and commit suicide and sometimes even kill their own young children to &quot;spare them&quot;. The people that come to collect or sell your stuff can be compared with the repo man. They can do it, until they&apos;re a victim themselves ... What I didn&apos;t like about this representation of how the system has become way more important than what is was for ... is the amount of blood. Still, it makes it all the more horribly and painfully clear what we&apos;re dealing with here ... What I liked about the story, is how it&apos;s presented that the bond between two people ain&apos;t all that clear.

      "name": "Yet another Eastwood gem",
      "reviewBody": "I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about &quot;Gran Torino&quot; based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be &apos;badass&apos; again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. &quot;Gran Torino&quot; is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it&apos;s a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I&apos;d go as far as saying that it&apos;s one of Eastwood&apos;s finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.\n\nI&apos;m not going to argue that &quot;Gran Torino&quot; has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn&apos;t. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn&apos;t being captured well enough in advertising. It&apos;s absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood&apos;s tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.\n\nWhether or not &quot;Gran Torino&quot; will hold up as one of Eastwood&apos;s great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood&apos;s beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won&apos;t discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it&apos;s really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood&apos;s image. I don&apos;t mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film&apos;s strength as a character study.\n\nIt&apos;s a more intimate film than Eastwood&apos;s other film this year, &quot;Changeling&quot;, and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it&apos;s just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of &quot;Gran Torino&quot; I had forgiven any flaws it might have, and was completely satisfied with the film, which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a &apos;minor&apos; Eastwood film by some), will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood&apos;s filmography."

I disagree with someone who wrote that this movie is not as good as A Fistful of Dollars. This movie is way better than a fistful of dollars. The reason is (as i pointed out in my other post) is that Clint&apos;s role or character is better when he has a good supporting member because it gives Clint&apos;s character more depth as well as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent in his role, i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising to see him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their own styles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth to this one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In a fistful of dollars Gian didn&apos;t have much depth at all and some of the characters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the characters into each other in this one, having all of their stories somehow play a role in the other ones. If you haven&apos;t seen this movie i suggest you watch Leone&apos;s films in chronological order with A fistful of dollars first, this one second, and finish it off with the good the bad the ugly. You&apos;ll be glad you did.",

That&apos;s what I go to an Adam Sandler movie for.\n\nI can&apos;t give a rationale for why this movie delighted me so much. Can&apos;t do it. I just know I thought it was hilarious. And the audience I was in (a small town with a large university) laughed and whooped throughout. And for what it&apos;s worth, many of the guffaws and whoops were female, as near as I could tell.\n\nI see one or two movies a week. Lately we seem to have a movie dry spell (in my view). I left the theater tonight actually smiling a huge silly-ass grin. I was uplifted, energized, and felt really, really good.\n\nIf you can find this kind of humor funny, check this movie out. This is a particularly well done rendition of whatever it is we should call Sandler humor. I LOVED it!",

But it´s only about a few guy and girls, hanging out, joking and crying, flirting and hurting. I felt touched and amused like watching nick Cassavetes Jr. doing a remake of one of his grandpa´s &quot;everybody gets drunk except the d.p.&quot;-kind of &quot;Pre-Dogma&quot;-movies. You can see in Leo´s acting, that he´s not very concerned about &quot;real&quot; acting... He plays an arrogant but hurt young guy, blaming everyone for the mood he´s in and seems to be interested in nothing but f**king. I felt so old, nearly everyone in the plum is about 20! And I´m 26. So afterwards in the subway-station I read the press-notes and I couldn´t believe my eyes: &quot;If you are over 25 you might not like this film&quot; they say. I hate and love you guys for that!"

Far ahead of its time, the film tells how haunting the truth for most Germans must have been after WWII and that it might have been even more haunting for their children to uncover what their parents desperately tried to forget or to cover up. Story telling and craftsmanship at their highest!",

I can&apos;t think of a more soulless horror film. It&apos;s the bare minimum needed for a plot, character arcs, and themes, along with the typical horror tropes, yet nothing is remotely original.

      "reviewBody": "The efficient and skeptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by the publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) might be. After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in the readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, &quot;Horror in Hobb&apos;s End&quot;. There is a mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a strategy of marketing. John follows his instincts and travels with Cane&apos;s editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to New Hampshire seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb&apos;s End. While driving along the night, Linda reaches the Hobb&apos;s End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town, and his twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those that read his novels.\n\n&quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; is a journey to fear and madness through the darkness of a twisted mind of a writer. This story follows the style of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and actually shows how a writer with the support of the media is able to manipulate hearts and minds. Further, there is a certain criticism in the values and standards of the society where those who think differently or have a different behavior are outcast or even considered crazy. John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors and Sam Neil is perfect in the role of a skeptical man, used to find schemes and con everywhere, having difficulties to accept what is happening. The conclusion is very dark and without perspective to mankind. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;À Beira da Loucura&quot; (&quot;On the Edge of Madness&quot;)\n\nNote: On 23 June 2015 I saw this movie again. Note: On 20 September 2020 I saw this movie again.",

In true war there is no &quot;good guys&quot;. There is no John Wayne who is always right. This movie shows ugliness of war on all sides. But it is still very pleasant and happy movie to watch sometimes. It is not history lesson, it is fantasy. but still it tells truth about war which Hollywood has never done because Hollywood always shows good guys vs bad guys. Even though this is fantasy it is more real than any war movie I saw. I urge you see this movie regardless of what country you from. Pretend you take no sides. You will enjoy this movie.",

First of all, the two protagonists are women. Joan Crawford, hanging on to her saloon, waiting for the arrival of the railroad, and Mercedes McCambridge, looking absolutely possessed, getting every man in town to follow her to the point of hanging people. Then there&apos;s Sterling Hayden, Jack Ripper from Dr. Strangelove, a puzzling character of great complexity, the gunfighter who can&apos;t stay out of the business. Add a few character actors and a relentless effort to ignite a fire and keep progress away, and you&apos;ve got a really engaging film. It&apos;s obvious this was made with a higher budget, good camera work and some excellent settings. I&apos;m sure someone has addressed all the symbols in the movie. Green dresses (envy), white dresses (purity), red dresses (time to kick butt). There are lots of scenes framed for effect as well. I recommend this film.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Only Yesterday&quot; (Universal, 1933), directed by John M. Stahl, marks the movie debut of stage actress, Margaret Sullavan. Capitalizing on the recent success of the first of three screen adaptations to Edna Ferber&apos;s romance drama, &quot;Back Street&quot; (1932), also directed by Stahl, and featuring Irene Dunne and John Boles, &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; improves over its predecessor in mood and drama, holding a viewer&apos;s interest even during its 108 minute length. In 1934, Universal and Stahl scored box office gold again with &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; starring Claudette Colbert and Warren William, followed by the 1935 version to &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor. With the exception &quot;Only Yesterday,&quot; all the movies mentioned above remain memorable mainly because of its latter remakes, for that &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; not only never got remade, it&apos;s hardly ever reissued either television or revival theaters, making this a real curio for classic movie lovers.\n\nThe story opens during the stock market crash of October 1929, causing many stockholders to go penniless and to blink of suicide. James Stanton Emerson (John Boles) has become one of the victims of the crash. He returns home where his wife, Phyllis (Benita Hume) is hosting a dinner party. Not wanting to tell the guests about the stock market, James locks himself in the other room, takes out his gun, writes a suicide note to Phyllis informing her that he cannot live on. But as he is about to do himself in, he notices a letter addressed to him left on his desk marked &quot;URGENT.&quot; After opening and reading the letter, Jim thinks back twelve years ago when he was a young lieutenant who meets Mary Lane (Margaret Sullavan) in a party in Virginia. They dance, leave and disappear into the night. Upon their return, the couple find the party to be over. They bid each other goodnight and plan to see each other again. Later, Jim receives orders to report to France with his troops. Afterwards, Mary learns that she is pregnant, and to avoid a possible scandal, she leaves her family to go live with her Aunt Julia (Billie Burke) in New York City. After giving birth to a son the very day the World War ends, Mary tries to locate Jim to tell him the news, but when their paths cross again, on two different occasions, he fails to recognize her, thus leaving Mary to go it alone and raise the boy herself. After finishing reading the letter, Jim realizes there is something more important than himself to think about.\n\nThe large cast listed in this photoplay include many familiar faces such as Reginald Denny as Bob; Edna May Oliver (mispelled Edna MAE Oliver in opening and closing credits) as Leona Maynard; Jimmy Butler as Jimmy Jr.; Marie Prevost as Amy; with Louise Beavers, Franklin Pangborn and Berton Churchill. During the course of the story, nostalgic tunes are heard, featuring: &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; (sung by Billie Burke); &quot;Remember&quot; (by Irving Berlin, played on piano by Reginald Denny); and &quot;Tip Toe Through the Tulips&quot; (sung by Billie Burke). \n\nAlthough Universal could have easily reunited Irene Dunne and John Boles, stars of &quot;Back Street&quot; into this collaboration, since many supporting players from that film were reunited here, including George Meeker, June Clyde, Walter Catlett, Robert McWade and Jane Darwell, the introduction of the youthful Margaret Sullavan gives this story a whole new different outlook, making this a worthy beginning to a fine actress in a very sensitive performance. Sullavan would star in other Universal dramas, especially the 1941 remake to &quot;Back Street,&quot; but she is best remembered for her numerous films produced at MGM, particularly &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940) with James Stewart. While John Boles is usually works well in light musicals and comedies, and often type-cast as a neglected but caring husband or &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; in other films through most of the 1930s, it&apos;s sometimes hard to accept him playing a man of the world on furlough who seduces innocent young women and unintentionally forgetting about them, a kind of movie role better suited for the Warren William-type of actor. After seeing this production in a very rare TV showing (WNET, Channel l3, New York City, in 1983), two things come to mind: The youthful Margaret Sullavan&apos;s unforgettable performance, the other being the question as to why &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; remains to this day a very obscure film.

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t been since I was a kid. I therefore had zero expectations for this movie, and even groaned that I had to come in at 6 this morning to preview it for my theater. That said, I was completely blown away and entertained from beginning to end. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. He sang all his greatest hits, even from the J5 era, which really hit a soft spot with me. And people might be complaining that this isn&apos;t a typical concert movie...in truth, that is a big plus here. Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you&apos;re in a concert, but like you&apos;re witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was (to every little detail of production and planning). There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through (with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times). This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man, who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me, I&apos;ll be the first to admit. And a side note, his female guitarist (her name escapes me) had me picking my jaw up off the floor, and not just her looks. You&apos;ll see what I mean.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie consists almost entirely of documentary news footage of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&apos;s crusade for racial equality from the 1950s up to the time of his assassination in 1968. It features a wide diversity of gripping footage... interviews, sermons, marches, press conferences and speeches by Dr. King as he gradually secured basic rights and dignity for his people (and thereby for ALL people). As we sit here today, with prejudice remaining far too abundant in American society, it is nonetheless hard to believe that so much struggle and sacrifice was needed to secure what our Constitution and laws had already bestowed on all of our citizens long before Dr. King began his heroic effort.\n\nDr. King&apos;s inspiring oratory is a potent contrast to the hatred, bigotry and unrelenting brutality he and his followers faced time and again. Scenes of police violence and jeering white racists are sprinkled liberally throughout the film and are truly horrifying. The patience and nonviolence of the African-American protesters in the face of their oppressors is remarkable.\n\nThe film ends with Dr. King&apos;s funeral, an event that is foretold by Dr. King himself time and again in this film as he muses about the possibility of his death at the hands of his racist antagonists. In one such prophetic moment contained in the movie, Dr. King says:\n\n&quot;You know when I say &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid&apos;, you know what I really mean - don&apos;t even be afraid to die! But I submit to you tonight, no man is free if he fears death. But the minute you conquer the fear of death, at that moment, you are free. You must say, somehow, &apos;I don&apos;t have much money - I don&apos;t have much education - I may not able to be able to read or write - but I have the capacity to die!&apos;&quot;\n\nThe DVD is available from the distributor, Kino Lorber... don&apos;t even hesitate to buy it. This is a must-see film for anyone even remotely concerned about social justice or history.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched the DVD of &quot;Whity&quot;, Fassbinder&apos;s German Western.  After seeing it, the fact that all the character&apos;s speek German despite the Spanish locations didn&apos;t seem out of tune at all with the overall movie.\n\n For the record the commentary on the DVD is one of the greatest I&apos;ve heard. However, Ulli Lommel and Michael Ballhaus both agree that this is Fassbinder&apos;s 5th movie.  That would mean this amazingly photographed, sweeping epic--which boasts by far the best production designs of any of Fassbinder&apos;s first movies--followed the crude looking excruciating black comedy &quot;Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?&quot;  I find this a bit hard to believe. Judging by the fact that Lommel and Ballhaus make a few factual mistakes (this was not the first Fassbinder movie with Günther Kaufmann, &quot;Gods of the Plague&quot; was), maybe they&apos;re a bit off.  My guess is probably number 8 or 9. If it is number 5, that&apos;s amazing.\n\nAnyhow, this is easily the most polished of Fassbinder&apos;s first movies. It&apos;s also probably up there with &quot;The American Soldier&quot; in terms of perverse bizarreness.  You&apos;ll find lots of flaggelating, KKK, incestual undertones, homoerotism, prostitutes, bleached eyebrows and eyelashes, bad hair, greenish-white cakey makeup, and some severe mental retardation all in these frames.  The odd thing is, none of it seems to be played for laughs, which only adds to the perversity.  Fassbinder thought this movie was so personal to him that he didn&apos;t want anyone else to see it, or any movie theaters to show it.\n\nAlso of note, the ending of this movie is highly unusual for Fassbinder. No suicide, no crying, no corpses?  I guess for the final shot, Fassbinder had his convertable engine running so he could drive off forever into the distance the second it was completed.  It just seems directors don&apos;t have that type of dedication or personal anguish attached to their movies anymore.  All the more reason to keep watching Fassbinder&apos;s I guess.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&apos; was yet another sequel to be released in 2013. The first one was a good solid animated film, not the best but it was different and I liked it. I didn&apos;t watch this with high expectations because the 1st one was just a good 7/10.\n\nAs in the first film, the animation is excellent with lots of bright colours etc. Characters are well designed just the same as the 1st. Everything looks good. The voices are mostly the same but it&apos;s a shame Mr.T didn&apos;t return to voice Earl Devereaux.\n\nThere are some funny moments throughout the film but the storyline in general just wasn&apos;t as good as the 1st. The original setting has changed because Flint&apos;s machine is still running and the town is being over run with food-animal hybrids. This was just a bit silly in general and didn&apos;t have the magic of the 1st film.\n\nOverall it was just a bit unnecessary and a sequel that wasn&apos;t really needed. The title could&apos;ve been more imaginative as well. I found it to be much like &apos;Despicable Me 2&apos; where it was OK to watch for the 1st hour but then I was getting bored where it was just tedious. It&apos;s OK for a one time watch but the first one is definitely better. I&apos;m sure the youngsters will enjoy it but the first one was more of a film that all ages could at least enjoy in full.\n\nAlso if Chester V is Flint&apos;s hero, why wasn&apos;t this mentioned in the first film? \n\n5/10."

Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others&apos; misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.\n\nWhere the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzac&apos;s novella. Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters. Nevertheless Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society: the Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peerage, his wife (Ardent) comes from a lowly birth and when she was married to Colonel Chabert they achieved their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their objectives are in conflict with each other.\n\nIt also feels very modern: money is critical to buy status to reach power, but someone can go down as quickly as they go up. Derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst of people he says to Chabert when he takes the case. This speech&apos;s original place is at the end of the novella as Balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony.",

Exotic settings, captivating performances, and extraordinary cinematography power this thrilling tale of courage in the line of fire.&quot; \n\nThe story isn&apos;t as substantive or engaging as the presentation, but quality certainly permeates the production. &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; helped Mr. Cooper become Quigley Publications&apos; &quot;World Box Office&quot; male star of 1936. In beautiful form, Madeleine Carroll (as Judy Perrie) certainly helped. Of five &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; possibles, Akim Tamiroff (as General Yang) received the &quot;Oscar&quot; nomination.\n\n****** The General Died at Dawn (9/2/36) Lewis Milestone ~ Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, William Frawley",

      "reviewBody": "2LDK is an exceptional short film that combines the prodigious talents of two little-known actresses (Maho Nonami and Eiko Koike) with that of a marvelous director (Yukihiko Tsutsumi) in what turns out to be a surprisingly powerful, sometimes hilarious, and always provocative thriller.\n\nI found the first half of the film, in which there is a lot of one-on-one conversation between the two women--combined fluidly with each woman&apos;s private thoughts--to be an absolute riot to watch. 2LDK offers marvelous insight into human nature and even the Japanese culture, reminding one that regardless of social conventions few people say what they -really- mean. Nonami and Koike both play their parts extremely well and with complete credibility. Amazingly, the film was shot in only a week&apos;s time despite the fact both women developed high fevers during the filming but carried on during the most physically demanding scenes without a break. I also found it fascinating to hear both actresses express having felt a certain amount of real-life animosity and antagonism towards one another during the making of the film. Great stuff.\n\nIn the second half of the film things become much darker as niceties are set aside and the two women let their true feelings show. Small disagreements become egregious offenses and events escalate rapidly to a remarkable, if not entirely unpredictable, ending. The &apos;weapons&apos; the two use against each other are for the most part household items and as such make the battle even more engaging and intense.\n\nI don&apos;t believe there is anyone who can&apos;t appreciate--or even completely relate with--the feelings both expressed and provoked in 2LDK; if you&apos;ve ever had to live with someone you didn&apos;t much care for but tolerated in the name of keeping the peace--all the while letting your retributive fantasies &apos;evolve&apos; from time to time--this film is guaranteed to produce plenty of smiles. \n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Yesterday was my birthday and this was the film my wife and I decided to go out to watch, even if it seemed almost all the other screens at our &apos;Plex were showing &quot;Spider Man&quot;. I think we made the right choice. It probably helped our enjoyment being from Glasgow enabling us to play &quot;Spot the Location&quot; as you invariably do in these situations and of course our familiarity with not only the &quot;types&quot; portrayed in the film but also their what I&apos;ll politely term vocabulary and vernacular.\n\nWhat it is at heart is a caper film involving four young offenders who as part of their &quot;community pay-back&quot; sentences get taken under the wing of a good-hearted middle-aged &quot;minder&quot; well played by John Henshaw and learn that they have a penchant for whisky-tasting after a sponsored visit to a distillery. From there, they hatch an unlikely plan to steal for a private collector extracts from a rare cask which takes them up to the islands on an intrepid mini-&quot;Mission Impossible&quot;, which after some ups and downs ends happily for all.\n\nThe film displays Ken Loach&apos;s by now usual mix of naturalistic realism with everyday settings and improbable plotting with attendant unlikely coincidence along the way. The film starts with a couple of violent scenes to fully convey the tough environment from which the protagonists are seeking a way out but changes into a different film altogether when the four decamp to the Highlands to carry out their ingenious theft. That dichotomy in retrospect seems a little forced at times and the coincidental nature of the plotting which affords them their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity stretches credulity as it settles into almost Ealing-esque territory but it&apos;s carried off with some flair and conviction with a nice human touch at the end to send everyone home out of the cinema with a &quot;feel-good&quot; smile on their faces.\n\nThe ensemble acting is as usual with Loach of a high standard. Paul Brannigan as the brains behind the misfits shines but each of the four comes across with their own personality. The dialogue is sharp and up to date with some funny set-pieces thrown in too, particularly those involving the wrong bike and how a recovering junkie slaked his thirst.\n\nOverall, once you suspend disbelief at the plot development and denouement, this is an easy film to settle down and enjoy. My wife and I certainly did, happy birthday to me!",

Each friend has a distinctive personalitry trait: Ashim (Soumitra Chatterjee) is successful, slightly dominating and slightly narcissistic, Sanjoy (Subhendu Chatterjee) is shy, conventional and neutral, Shekhar (Robi Ghosh) is the funny one, and Hari (Samit Bhanja) is rash and impulsive. While they almost forcefully settle down in the guest house much against the caretaker&apos;s request (as it will cost him his job) and observe the surrounding locales, they come across three different women: Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) an enigmatic confident and smart young lady, her widowed sister-in-law (Kaberi Bose) who is welcoming and cheerful and a tribal girl named Duli (Simi Garewal) who is ready to offer services in exchange of money. It is this encounter in the forest that leads to a development that will change the lives of Ashim, Sanjoy and Hari while Shekhar remains his own funny self. Ray proves again that less can be more if done properly. The lyrical story is told with sheer subtlety and profound depth. The sexual chemistry, the underlying themes such as class differentiation, poverty, loneliness and love are displayed with a skillful quietness. His fluid direction and the actors performances draws the viewer into this little forest of quiet enigma. It is no surprise that Ray has worked with the best actors and &apos;Aranyer Din Ratri&apos; is no different in that respect. The two Chatterjees, Ghosh and Bhanja are superb. It really felt as though we were watching four close friends. Garewal provides some comic relief. She may be an unusual choice for Duli but she pulls it off quite well. Sharmila Tagore excellently downplays the part of Aparna. Ray&apos;s films have a timeless quality as they never feel outdated. Needless to say, the terrific &apos;Aranyer Din Ratri&apos; is one such movie."

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been a favorite of mine since i was a kid--i was very into Greek mythology during grade school, so i loved this film, even though i&apos;ve seen it about two dozen times (it continues to be a Sunday-afternoon staple on TV). There are a number of mythological inaccuracies in this film (the Kraken wasn&apos;t a mythological monster; Perseus didn&apos;t have Pegasus, but actually borrowed Hermes&apos; winged sandals, etc.), but it&apos;s still a good kids&apos; introduction to ancient mythology. While the actors playing the &quot;mortals&quot; are definitely inferior to those playing the Gods, i suppose it works in the sense of their being the Olympians&apos; puppets and, well, a little limpness in the thespian department is somewhat de rigeur (as is the wise/comic sidekick of Burgess Meredith and the &apos;little and cute&apos; factor of the mechanical owl) for the kind of classic matinee swashbuckler that &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; is.\n\nBut all these complaints that the Harryhausen effects are crap and it would be so much better done with CGI... well, that&apos;s pure craziness. Sure, the monsters don&apos;t look convincing, but they look a hell of a lot more convincing then they would as cheap computer animation--can you honestly imagine the Medusa sequence being done any better with some cartoon computer program? (Why? So it could look like the crap in &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;?) I&apos;ve always felt that Harryhausen&apos;s stop-motion technique and the resultant odd way in which the monsters moved added to the sense of their mythic status, their unreality, the sense that these are creatures from another world, another plane. (The recent Asian fantasy/action film &quot;Onmyoji&quot; paid tribute to the master by having a CGI demon army move in Harryhausen stop-motion style and damn me if they didn&apos;t look scarier, more unearthly for it.) In my opinion, CGI looks even less &quot;real,&quot; more like a painted-on cartoon. There&apos;s a depth and detail to creatures that have actually been created in the three-dimensional real world that those who have only existed on a computer screen don&apos;t have. Also, no matter how good an actor is, there&apos;s a difference between someone who&apos;s in the same room with the monster he&apos;s fighting, or who at least knows what it looks like, and someone who&apos;s just trying to &quot;act scared&quot; in the general direction where something will be inserted later. (Imagine the &quot;Alien&quot; movies made with a hyped-up animated creature: you know that even motionless and plastic squeezed between light stands, that giant H.R. Geiger monster gave everyone on set the creeps.) Maybe people like CGI because they feel safer with obviously fake monsters, things that never even existed as a three-foot high model next to the ham sandwich in someone&apos;s shop."

      "reviewBody": "Joey Lauren Admans &quot;Come Early Morning&quot; seems almost like a continuation of the film that made its star, Ashley Judd, famous, Victor Nunez&apos; &quot;Ruby in Paradise.&quot; Both pictures are about girls trying to make a life for themselves in small southern towns, but Lucy, the protagonist of &quot;Early Morning&quot; is at least a decade older than Ruby. That is why it seems almost to be the next chapter in Ruby&apos;s story.\n\nThe decade has not treated the protagonist well. Where as Ruby was a sort of wide eyed innocent, Lucy is now a woman whose journey through life is encumbered by a lot of baggage.\n\nShe has problems relating to men on a romantic level, seeing them as either cold and unresponsive like her father or just mean and domineering like some of the other men in her family and the slugs she picks up in local bars.\n\nSo, somewhat predictably, when she meets a nice guy, she rejects him enough times that he eventually moves on.\n\nAshley Judd is such a fine, appealing actress that she keeps you glued to the screen, despite the somewhat predictable plot twists. But there is something about the screenplay which fails, for I never had much faith in her character, who in many ways seemed as emotionally bottled up as her father.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the film&apos;s failure. &quot;Ruby&quot; ended on a hopeful note, if for no other reason than that the central character was smart, resourceful and had her whole life ahead of her. &quot;Come Early Morning&apos;s&quot; protagonist faces a cloudy future and while the film showed guts in admitting that, it didn&apos;t leave you wanting to see more of Lucy the way the earlier film made you want more of Ruby.\n\nNice try by everyone involved, but it was just too dark a picture in many ways.\n\nOne final note. So many films these days have no significant subplot. Lucy had some kind of construction business, but it was so downplayed that in the end, when she takes over the business, we don&apos;t exactly know how big an achievement that is, or if it really means more to her than just taking on harder work for no real pay off. \n\nThis film could have been more effective had her career or some other aspect of her life been more fully developed so that she faced some real test there as well. Subplots are important in that they give stories and their protagonists depth. And of course, the stakes always need to be higher for the protagonist, to make us care."

The eccentric judge is irrelevant. The only pertinent piece of data is that He got away with it. Scott free. If it wasn&apos;t so cynical, Polanski&apos;s gall in seeking to clear his reputation would be comical. Mr.Polanski should thank his luck that he avoided incarceration; his apologists should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nThat said, Ms. Zenovich is a talented filmmaker. Her execution is steady and workmanlike. However, she clearly has an agenda. This isn&apos;t a bad movie, but it&apos;s a disingenuous one. Don&apos;t take my word for it, but if you watch it try to look objectively at how the two sides of this case are presented, how the victim is trivialized and how her advocates are villainized, and make your own determination."

It was my favorite film at the festival (out of 10 that I saw).\n\nYes... as others have noted, a lot of the comedy stems from a group of major characters fitting a checklist of the most common gay stereotypes. But it&apos;s all done in a way that&apos;s non-offensive, lighthearted, well-written, well-acted, and just funny as heck. I think you have to want to be offended to have a problem with it. And the main character (Ecki) is about as &quot;normal&quot; as can be. (...not to mention adorable and lovable.) Anyway, the film-making was excellent. The pace was perfect, and the plot struck a good balance of levity; it was serious enough that I cared about the characters, but stayed upbeat and fun as well.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Acting? Oh hell yes! Just pay attention to Jon Voight and his over-the-top performance and prepare to be amazed. On top of that, one thing to consider: the writing for J-Lo&apos;s character, her lines, are totally out there making her sound useless and fragile, helpless side-hero for at least 45 minutes. Luckily this will change slightly towards the 2nd half, but...really, Mr Writer? Good thing that the anaconda steals the show. Finally, the overall rating here is unfair. This should be around 6.5 and is a much better monster-munch film than many others in the 00&apos;s and 10&apos;s...8/10, pure fun.",

While at times being a bit slow and predictable, the film features some fine talent. It stars Richard Denning as the heroic scientist hero--a role he was certainly no stranger to performing, the lovely Lori Nelson as one of the atomic blast survivors-Louise Maddison who is as far as the two leading men(Rick &amp; Tony-played by Mike &apos;Touch&apos; Connors)in the cast and even the mutant monster in the film are concerned the most desirable woman alive as far as they know. The Mutant Monster is another Paul Blaisdell brought to life on screen by Blaisdell himself. Despite looking a bit rubbery, it does have a real menace about it. Mike Connors is decidedly unsympathetic and uncaring as the two-bit hood Tony(who only wants to take and is concerned only for satisfying his own twisted desires). Paul Birch and Adele Jergens are also quite good as Maddisson(the concerned father who tries to maintain the safety of the group and fend off Tony) and Ruby(Tony&apos;s loyal kind-hearted girlfriend with a shady past). For a low budget film effort, this one is really quite good.",

This art film will not please everyone -- not for the shoot &apos;em up, blow it up, special effects craving crowd with a short attention spans.\n\nThis film is art, not just entertainment.  It moves slowly at it&apos;s own dream-like pace. It&apos;s iconic campy fantasy is unique and the precursor of the artists mentioned above.  The Pink refers to the gay sensibility, the camp stance and the prettier than life advertising imagery.  The Narcissus of the title refers to Kendall&apos;s obvious self-love and the obsessive quality of his fantasies: himself as a sexy matador, himself as a sexy Greek slave, himself as Beauty and a voyeur&apos;s delight.  The searingly bright color adds to the dreamy feeling. This is eye candy for those who appreciate art and beauty-- confection for the mind.  Rarely do high style and content meld as beautifully as in this film.  There is no dialogue.  It would probably ruin the dream. This film is a &quot;must see&quot; for anyone interested in contemporary art, the pre-Stonewall sensibility or the history of underground film."

      "reviewBody": "Working from a screenplay by Adam Resnick, director Nora Ephron diverts from her usual domain of romantic comedy to skirt the perimeter of Scorsese territory with `Lucky Numbers,&apos; a black comedy of errors starring John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow.  Travolta is T.V. weatherman Russ Richards, something of a local celebrity in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he also owns a snowmobile dealership.  Kudrow is Crystal Latroy, who works for the same station as Richards, as the `Vanna White&apos; of the state lottery show; she&apos;s the girl who pulls the ping-pong balls from the tube and calls out the winning numbers.  In their world, everything is pretty much jake until the weather stays too good for too long; no snow means no snowmobile sales for Russ, and pretty quickly he&apos;s in it up to here, financially.  With his back against the wall, the usually honest and upright Richards is coaxed into a plan that will put an end to his woes and worries.  All he has to do is convince Crystal to help him rig the lottery, and they&apos;ll walk away with upward of six million dollars.  And, as it usually goes with a plan for the perfect crime, it isn&apos;t long before Murphy&apos;s Law goes into effect, and things go south in a hurry.  And life for Russ Richards, a guy with his own table at Denny&apos;s, just isn&apos;t what it used to be.  But, like they say, when things look dark, it&apos;s probably only going to get darker... \tFor Travolta, the character of Richards is somewhat different than any he&apos;s done before.  To pull it off (which he does), he has to play down the charm and stifle his natural charisma, leaving Russ with just enough polish and ego to make him `local celebrity&apos; believable.  This is a good guy at heart, reasonably intelligent, but not exactly the brightest bulb in the overheads. And Travolta manages to put it all across admirably.  He&apos;s not someone you&apos;ll easily relate to, but you&apos;ve got to like this guy.  He&apos;s kind of a, well, he&apos;s a goof-ball.  Kudrow has a character in Crystal that is different for her as well; as the lotto girl, on the show she exhibits a somewhat dense persona; but Crystal is anything but.  She&apos;s the sharp one of the bunch, externally charming when she needs to be, but tough as nails on the inside and ready to play hardball as soon as the opportunity presents itself.  And Kudrow plays it all beautifully.  Crystal is not someone you&apos;re readily going to embrace, but it&apos;s hard not to like her.  Is it her fault there&apos;s more than a little larceny in her heart just waiting for the right circumstances to be unleashed? \tEphron seems to enjoy taking these characters, who are just a shade darker than what she&apos;s used to, through their paces.  It&apos;s a satirical walk on the wild side for her, and she manages to mine laughs in some of the darkest places along the way.  But when you have characters with names like `Gig&apos; (Tim Roth) and `Dale the Thug&apos; (Michael Rapaport), you&apos;re going to get some chuckles no matter what, especially when one of them is wielding a baseball bat for all the wrong reasons. \tThe supporting cast includes Ed O&apos;Neill (Dick), Michael Moore (Walter), Michael Weston (Larry), and, in a small, but highly effective and hilarious role, Bill Pullman (Lakewood).  This is a funny movie, though not uproariously so; things happen that you will laugh at in spite of yourself, while at other times there are moments that are genuinely side-splitting hilarious (one in particular, near the end, that involves an eighteen-wheeler).  This may not be Ephron&apos;s crowning achievement cinematically, but nevertheless, `Lucky Numbers&apos; is entertaining and good for some laughs.  For Ephron, it&apos;s definitely the road less traveled; but in the end, it&apos;s a trip worth taking with her.  I rate this one 7/10.",

He looks like he did some sort of fluid and food fast (bodybuilder stuff) before shooting. I gasped every time he came on screen.\n\nMy real problem isn&apos;t with this, but with the fact that we, as the audience, are supposed to find this emaciated appearance to be sexy.\n\nI like him as an actor, but this was really hard to watch. What happened to that adorable man from Schitt&apos;s Creek?\n\nThis movie shocked me more than I&apos;d like to admit, for reasons I never expected.",

Without Allan&apos;s reaction to the old gentleman who admires his car, the movie would otherwise be a one note comedy with jokes and rather nice scenery. The poignancy of the gesture however, allows Allan to quietly and magnificently overcome his obsessiveness, which though amusing at times is also wearing. This, along with the beauty of the English countryside, a component as important as the characters themselves, makes this movie an absolute charmer. The final shot replete with damp mist and fog added the ultimate British ambiance to its delightful conclusion."

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Dostana",
      "reviewBody": "Dostana scores a number of firsts. One being set entirely in Miami, with the glorious shots of golden beaches and opportunities for the cast to show off their toned bodies (for the first few minutes, John Abraham seemed too eager to get rid of his singlet every few minutes). And the other first scored was that this is the first Bollywood film to have a focus on a gay relationship, albeit a faked one, between its two leading men. For an industry that&apos;s still sans on-screen sex, where kisses still bring upon rage, and nudity a no-no, is it any wonder why this premise, together with its A-list stars, will draw in the crowds without a doubt?\n\nSome 4 years ago, Abhishek Bachchan was busy chasing John Abraham as hero and villain in the action-adventure Dhoom. In between they only shared credits in Kabhi alvida Naa Kehna, and it is not until now that the two alpha-males get put together in the same film, share plenty of screen time together, and the joke&apos;s clearly on their effeminate behaviour and gay relationship. Imagine two muscular jocks having to turn girly at a wink of an eye, and that itself sets up a tsunami of laughs in plenty of situational gags that will leave you genuinely in stitches.\n\nI shudder to imagine how real gays would, or would not take offense at the portrayal here, given that most of the time, gayness is equated with being hip and in with modern culture, which I think some would clearly dispute. Nonetheless it is the attempts at debunking the myths and prejudice that surrounds the condition that warrants some merits at least, even though it&apos;s still an outright comedy, and I guess all could be forgiven since there are two eye-candy male leads to serve up some compensation.\n\nAt first one would imagine a plot that would be similar to I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, given two obviously straight men having to pose as a gay couple to further their own objectives, which of course runs contrary to any romantic notions they have for the opposite sex. Here, Sameer (Bachchan) and Kunal (Abraham) start off as two strangers in Miami who bump into each other after their individual one night stands (with opposite members of the sex of course), but thereafter find themselves eyeing the same piece of affordable swanky rental apartment, which comes with a crucial string attached - no guys, because the occupant is a lady (Chopra) whose aunt refuses to let tongues wag should her housemates be two hunks.\n\nSo you know the drill, faced with time constraints and the prospect of staying with Neha the hot chick, both guys pretend they are gays, thus setting in motion plenty of comedy as they have to maintain their cover 24x7, and to make matters worse, have to cement their relationship legally as a means to keep Kunal from being deported. And if that&apos;s not all, each of them still harbours the thought of hooking up with Neha, which of course poses a challenge given their known &quot;status&quot;. One of the best scenes in the movie involves almost everyone, from mothers to bosses to even an immigration officer who converge in their apartment in a free for all, where bluff goes against bluff, and the two chaps have to be at their best to satisfy the law, as well as to stave off a very interested magazine editor. I can&apos;t remember the last time I laughed that hard and loud.\n\nBut of course things slow down a little in the second half of the film when Neha&apos;s new boss (Bobby Deol) comes into the picture to woo Neha, which Sameer and Kunal try to fend off with their wits in what would be co-opetition at its very best. Scheming and conniving all the way, you&apos;d come to expect lies becoming bigger lies, with questionable methods being put into use in order to drive the new competition away. Which brings it quite nicely to an ending that I guess is a fair outcome.\n\nDostana speaks of friendship, and sometimes, relations are best left at that given the numerous enjoyable moments everyone shares, without complicating matters. Dostana, despite its theme, still plays out to be an enjoyable, entertaining movie brought to life by its excellent casting. Songs and dances were pretty much standard fare, save for that convergent scene which I mentioned was the highlight of the film. Do look out too for the very cheeky wordings on the T-shirts that both Bachchan and Abraham don.",

The agents are successful but Knox turns out to have more sinister motives and the angels find themselves fighting to protect Charlie and Bosley.\n\nYet another in a line of film remake&apos;s of old TV shows, in the words of LL Cool J `yet another remake of an old TV show&apos;.  However this just about succeeds for one simple reason  it never tries to take itself seriously. This works because it can be camp, silly and OTT because we know it&apos;s meant to be.  The plot is OK and has some reasonable twists but really the jokes and action move it along.  The silliness can get a bit much at times and is a little tiring.\n\nFor example we have far too many shots of the girls tossing their hair, and too many scenes that mean nothing.  Eg a high speed car chase ends on a bridge but it has no reason for happening and nothing happens as a result. The fights are very OTT and are very much a matrix rip off  they are only just saved by the tongue in cheek attitude of the film.  But even then they still silly.\n\nThe cast are OK but really they are just playing daft.  Rockwell is really good and Bill Murray saves the whole film by being really funny.  Tom Green is in it because his girlfriend felt sorry for him and wanted him to be in a film that got shown in a cinema outside of the US, however his character is stupid and pointless.  Wilson is good and LL Cool J makes a good cameo, but Tim Curry has been better.\n\nOverall it&apos;s enjoyable if you&apos;re in the mood for silly popcorn trash.  If you&apos;re not in the mood this will only serve to irritate you at how poor Hollywood blockbusters can be."

      "reviewBody": "The above words are said in this brilliant film, and it sums the film up for me. They come just after the burning of a couple of paintings and &apos; The Magic Mountain &apos; in of all places a Canadian wilderness. I will give no other spoilers, because this film transcends propaganda, and when the plot of the film is described it sounds like a typical WW2 story. It is not. It shows a group of rotten people crossing a civilized landscape ( maybe to some idealized ) who learn nothing from the experience. Only one does, but is ruthlessly killed by the others with him. The said others have been made rotten by an ideology that still lives today and still threatens us, shifting from one country to many other countries in the current world we live in. Beautifully filmed with sequences that take one&apos;s breath away and images that burn into the mind I consider this film to be one of the best ever made. Powell and Pressburger made a number of fine films, but this excels probably with their &apos; A Canterbury Tale &apos;. As I was watching I thought of the two sources of all our artistic heritage; Homer&apos;s &apos; The Iliad &apos; and &apos; The Odyssey &apos;. Both of the above mentioned films draw upon the latter book in their search for meaning and transformation. As for the acting I have a few doubts, but none can subtract from the 10 I give the film. Lawrence Olivier is frankly terrible imitating a French Canadian and Eric Portman lacks nuances in his performance and too heavily emphasis the &apos; evil &apos; in his character. Who stands out most as giving the greatest speech is Anton Walbrook and for those who have not seen the film watch out for the part of the film he is in. It is everything that tolerance and goodness should be and his delivery of words and his presence in the film glowed like a beacon in the darkness. I am ashamed I have not seen this film before.",

Those aren&apos;t my words but the words of Anthony Hopkins. Russell Crowe and Martin Scorsese agree. And he is fantastic in this small country independent film. I have seen all of his films and this one along with The Manor ranks among the best. In both, he exhibits the phenomenal wit and timing of a master and knows more about delivering a punchline than anyone I have ever seen. And just listening to his booming voice always keeps everyone honest. In both this film and THE MANOR in which he plays Greta Scacchi&apos;s husband, he is a magnet for your attention and your eyes. He totally dominates.\n\nWoolyMonkey",

      "reviewBody": "The beginning intrigued me. What is the entity in question, and why is it tormenting Lilith, and her parents before her? Why do the parents blame Lilith when she is clearly a victim? This is the main thing Case 39 has going for it: you won&apos;t know at first what type of movie it will end up being. Later in the film, though, it has chosen its bag of clichés and sticks to them. Which bag? Ah, that would be telling.\n\nThis being said, the common devices director Alvart chooses for the film still work, and Ferland (Lilith) does a good job in a demanding role for a girl who was twelve or thirteen years old when the movie was completed, on 2007. It was finally released in October of 2010, the month of Ferland&apos;s sixteenth birthday.\n\nWhy you should see it You enjoy things, other than your annoying upstairs neighbor, that go &quot;bump&quot; in the night. You still find Zellweger to be as adorable as she was the first time she said &quot;you had me at hello,&quot; and not nearly as annoying as that line became upon its 300th repetition. You like your paranormal phenomena to surround pale, creepy kids.\n\nWhy you shouldn&apos;t see it You&apos;re terribly afraid of hornets, heights, shotguns, ovens, carving knives, bodies of water, forks, and blunt objects, and you don&apos;t feel up to confronting all of these phobias within the space of two hours."

      "reviewBody": "Une corde, un Colt (AKA: Cemetery Without Crosses) is directed by Robert Hossein, who also stars and co-writes the screenplay with Dario Argento and Claude Desailly. Starring alongside Hossein are Michèle Mercier, Anne-Marie Balin, Daniele Vargas, Guido Lollobrigida and Serge Marquand. Music is by Andre Hossein and cinematography by Henri Persin.\n\nAfter being forced to watch the lynching of her husband by the ruthless Rogers family, Maria Caine (Mercier) asks her inept brothers-in-law for help in retribution. Getting no joy from the pair, she seeks outside help in the form of fast gun Manuel (Hossein), a loner living in solitude out at a ghost town...\n\nIt&apos;s dedicated to Sergio Leone, who directs one of the best scenes in the film, contains the Argento factor, so it&apos;s not really a shock to proclaim that Leone&apos;s influence is all over Hossein&apos;s movie. \n\nIt&apos;s a Pasta Western that operates in the void between the real and the spirit world, deliberately ethereal in tone, even sprinkling dashes of the surreal onto the hearty portion. Dialogue is used sparingly, but not to the detriment of film&apos;s quality, and Hossein the director dallies in black and white staging, slow zooms and excellent usage of sound effects.\n\nMuch like the dialogue, the violence is pared down, there&apos;s no Blunderbuss infused blood laden approach to the evil that men do here, it&apos;s all very controlled and in keeping with the tonal flows that Hossein favours. The cliché&apos;s of the sub-genre are adhered to throughout, thankfully so, while the finale is suitably melancholic.\n\nThoughtful, sombre and ripe with blurry ambiguity, Cemetery Without Crosses is comfortably recommended to the Euro Western fan. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Japanese film industry has built up a strong reputation for its chilling horror movies, and many of them have been remade by Hollywood studios whose philosophy goes something like: &quot;Why create something new when so much good stuff has already been made!?&quot; The Ring, The Grudge, and Darkwater are just three examples of Japanese horror films that have been adapted for that Western English speaking market who would otherwise be unable to enjoy the originals. Reading subtitles can be tough.\n\nReincarnation has the same foreboding atmosphere as the previously mentioned movies: it&apos;s a slow-burning, thought-provoking, piece of supernatural horror. The storyline centres around a young actress who wins an audition to star in a movie based on a real-life hotel massacre. Her role is of the last person to be murdered - a little girl - who it turns out has been spooking her for the last few days. When shooting begins, she starts experiencing the murders as if they are actually happening. Do you follow!? \n\nAnyone familiar to supernatural mysteries such as The Sixth Sense (not mentioning Takashi Shimizu&apos;s previous movies) will be familiar with some of the plot devices, and fully prepared to expect the unexpected. Still, the revelation at the end is a good one and is not simply there to say: &apos;LOOK we FOOLED you!&apos;. Though I&apos;m sure it will.\n\nThose hoping for an unremitting orgy of blood, guts and violence will be left disappointed. Nonetheless, there are still a few scenes here not suited to the squeamish (well, a child DOES get stabbed). This film is more about subtle scares and the power of suggestion, which is usually one of the most effective ways of cranking up the tension, but here they are guilty of over-using the ploy in a predictable way. For example, how many times does a character need to be unsettled by something they&apos;ve seen out of the corner of their eye? What really does make this film work is the combination of very good storytelling, and a direction that lends it a very dark and intense feel which never lets go. The characters are mostly just an extension of the general mood and atmosphere of the movie. Under Shimizu&apos;s guidance it is the supernatural that takes centre stage.\n\nReincarnation seems longer than its 95 minutes running time, but it&apos;s worth sticking with it for a satisfying conclusion that you may want to re-live again.\n\nMark: 7/10 \n\nMel Dixon",

I guess you could say she was the 1990&apos;s Zoe Bell.\n\nFull of high octane action (Mostly melee) this is another weak addition to the franchise which is insanely disjointed and I simply don&apos;t get it.\n\nStarring industry veterans Lance Henriksen and Kris Kristofferson it&apos;s mediocre stuff and demonstrates that even the greats have blotches on their records. Henriksen inparticular is really quite awful here.\n\n3 movies in, not impressed.\n\nThe Good:\n\nScott Paulin\n\nSome okay choreography\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSimply really generic stuff\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nLance Henriksen has done some absolute stinkers",

The original movie was great, the series were a bit different, but still making the viewer think about the nature of self and the direction technology takes us in. All of that was enabled by great stories and wonderful music.\n\nWhile &quot;The New Movie&quot; is a good piece of animation and with an interesting story, it doesn&apos;t quite catch the magic of the original. Also, as a continuation of the GitS:Arise four episode series, it makes it difficult for newcomers to understand what it is all about. But probably what bothered me most was the soundscape. While not bad, it is a far cry from Kenji Kawai&apos;s work.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that, in attempting to reboot the franchise, they went too soft. Less blood, less killing, less subtlety and instead just a modernized corporate Yakuza fight that is easy to understand from the perspective of the Japanese viewer. Ghost in the Shell was never about the present, though, it was about the future, its role to make the viewer think things forward and see the predictions of the anime come true in the years to come. &quot;The New Movie&quot; doesn&apos;t quite do that and so I feel a slight disappointment with it.\n\nStill, a flawed GitS movie is a lot better than no GitS movie and I was glad to watch it. The excitement of the original, though, I didn&apos;t find it here.",

Although Wong Jing was infamous with his not-too-good movies and dirty jokes. This one is a totally show off that proves he is one of the most talent writer/director in 80s Hong Kong.\n\nCasino Raiders was released prior to &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; (also written and directed by Wong Jing), where the later has a better treater income. Personally speaking, the success of GOG is somehow related to the lead actor Chow Yun Fat, who was the hottest star at that time, and the story was filled with funny moments and local jokes which results a more releasing viewing experience, and more suitable to HK audience in 80s. In comparison, Casino Raiders features a more serious atmosphere, almost no local jokes at all, plus a better structured screenplay and twists. It is more suitable to call it a &quot;gambling drama&quot; (GOG is a cult movie instead).\n\nWong Jing is well known to HK audience that he likes all kind of gambling games: horse racing, casino games, cards, dice etc. I believe that is the reason why he could come up a script with so many gambling twists (and tricks).\n\nAnyway, Casino Raiders is my most beloved movie of its kind. And it is recommended to anyone who is looking for a dramatic ride. One of the best (probably the only) from Wong Jing.",

The story explores the human tragedy surrounding Miriam, as she grows up and witnesses the death of three generations of her Aboriginal family under the hand of white custodianship. Visual a beautiful film all the way down to the beautiful still photography of Mario Michael Bianchino.\n\nA sumptuous and compelling film adaptation of one of Australia&apos;s boldest contemporary operatic works by Andrew &amp; Julianne Schultz. Seen through the eyes of its central character, Miriam, an Aboriginal woman, whose son recently died in police custody and performed by the award winning mezzo soprano, Maroochy Barambah, the film portrays the tormented world of injustice; past and present perpetuated against indigenous Australians. \n\nSet in a police lockup cell surrounded by rising floodwaters, Miriam describes to her captive audience of judge, journalist and policeman the horrors experienced by three generations of her family. BLACK RIVER incorporates breathtaking cinematography and features powerful dance sequences by the Bangarra Dance Theatre choreographed by Stephen Page.",

Anyway, it was a good revisit as the movie still holds up.\n\n303 isn&apos;t a scary horror movie. Instead, it&apos;s filmed well, with a retro haze, and a great wistful yet ominous ambiance is created. The story, while not altogether cohesive, is at least interesting and original. The young and fresh actors are a mix of good and okay, but at least none are exceedingly bad. The only one to go on to fame is a young Ananda Everingham.\n\nMore importantly, I liked 303 for its unintentional (I think) homoeroticism, which is much better than sleazy intentional homoeroticism (see Voodoo Academy). It&apos;s set in a high school, and features all sorts of cute guys, from twinks, to lean fit, to beefy muscular. There are even not one but two shower scenes! If only this movie were scary too, then it would&apos;ve been perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1921, director F.W. Murnau set out to make a horror film based on Bram Stoker&apos;s novel, `Dracula,&apos; but was denied the rights to the property by Stoker&apos;s estate.  Undeterred, however, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,&apos; the name of the title character to `Count Orlok,&apos; then proceeded to make what has come to be considered nothing less than a classic of the silent film era.  An unsettling film (especially for the times in which it was made), it is a faithful adaptation of Stoker&apos;s story, and brings images to the screen, the likes of which at the time, had never before been seen.  And although by today&apos;s standards much of it may seem relatively tame, there is an innate sense of the sinister about it that is timeless.  For the same elements that so unnerved audiences in 1922 when it was released, are equally discomfiting now, most of which is courtesy of Max Schreck, who portrayed Count Orlok. \tIt was the first screen appearance for what is now the most famous vampire in history, and the German character actor Schreck brought an eerie presence to the role that has never been equaled.  Bela Lugosi may be considered the definitive Dracula-- his portrayal is certainly the most well known-- but even he could not match the sense of evil that Schreck brought to the character.  The scene in which Schreck&apos;s shadow is cast on the wall as he slowly negotiates a staircase, emphasizing his misshapen head and elongated fingers and nails, is an image that leaves an indelible impression on the memory, as does Schreck&apos;s overall appearance:  Lanky, though slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes.  It was Schreck&apos;s greatest screen role, and had it not been for a lawsuit by Stoker&apos;s estate that prevented wide distribution of the film, it would no doubt have made him a star. \tThe supporting cast includes John gottowt, Alexander Granach, Wolfgang Heinz, Max Nemetz, Gustav von Wangenheim, Ruth Landshoff and Greta Schroder. An air of mystery surrounded the set during the filming of `Nosferatu&apos; that became something of a myth, which began with the fact that Schreck, a method actor, was never seen by cast nor crew without his makeup and in character. And it was further perpetuated when it may have been implied by Murnau that Schreck was actually a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire, all of which goes a long way toward proving that `hype&apos; is nothing new to the entertainment industry.  One of the three most highly regarded German directors of the times, Murnau, whose philosophy was that `nothing existed beyond the frame,&apos; directed a number of films, but none achieved the lasting notoriety of `Nosferatu.&apos;  For film buffs everywhere, as well as aficionados of silent pictures, this film is a must-see, and a perfect companion piece to the recently released (2000) `Shadow of the Vampire,&apos; the film by E. Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of `Nosferatu.&apos;  A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.  This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

George Zuccio is good here as the doctor he is likable and played it straight Nat Pendleton is really funny and amusing here as the dummy he had me laughing several times i loved him! Molly Lamont does well in her role as she plays a grumpy mean hearted person and she does it well! Joyce Compton i couldn&apos;t stand i wanted to slap her silly!! i know she is supposed to  but she totally over did it! Gladys Blake is very amusing in her role as the maid and was one of the most likable as well she has some funny lines too.Roland Varno does his job well not much of a part though Douglas Fowley plays the nosy reporter well but at times was irritating.Overall a fairly entertaining flick one of Bela Lugosi&apos;s rare weak performances (still not bad though) that is worth the watch **1/2 out of 5"

      "reviewBody": "The total number of attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler has never been truly established but the fact that Hitler escaped them all is absolutely mind-boggling. He sustained minor injuries in what is undoubtedly the most renowned of these plots, that of July 1944. Had not the suitcase containing the bomb been moved behind a thick table leg seconds before the blast.....pure supposition of course. Following the failed attempt the gruesome fates of the well-intentioned conspirators and the subsequent purge of thousands have been well-documented. G.W.Pabst has chosen to depict the events in a clinical, matter-of-fact manner and although it cannot be faulted as a factual account, judged purely as a film it is regrettably rather dull. We are at least spared the spectacle of a ranting Hitler and just see the back of an actor&apos;s head. The film is of value as an historical document but could not a director of Pabst&apos;s ability have made it slightly more &apos;entertaining&apos;?",

Meanwhile a bounty hunter named Wolff intercepts a message and sets out to rescue the women,who&apos;ve been taken to OverDog, the tyrant who rules the wastelands of the planet. Along the way Wolff meets up with a young girl named Nikki and his ex-partner who happens to be on the same mission.\n\nThis movie has some well known character actors, Peter Strauss as Wolff, Molly Ringwald as Nicky, Ernie Hudson as Wolff&apos;s ex-partner,and Michael Ironside as OverDog."

I have been sharing the information with friends, relatives and those in my address book. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My thanks to Mr. Williams and Independent Lens for the production. Unfortunately, I haven&apos;t been able to find any future listings in our area. I would like to include a copy of the program in my collection of history programs. Banished, unfortunately, was publicized enough for the viewers to realize what was being shown and how it is embedded in America&apos;s history. This isn&apos;t just a program to be shown during Black History month but should be made available for students to see as part of their education any time of the year. Again, kudos to PBS and Marco Williams and ILP.",

It&apos;s more pxxx (that rhymes with corn), and it&apos;s not even art house material at that. When this came out, 47 years ago, it was a movie of drag queens giving voice to women&apos;s liberation that was just starting up, pointing out the inconsistencies of the roles women were trying to define during the years of social change. So, the sexual exploitation is supposedly not as offensive because the women were men in drag. In the &quot;metoo&quot; &quot;timesup&quot; era the satire is pretty trite and offensive on many levels. In retrospect, Warhol had his 15 minutes, and not one minute more."

When the prostitute is arrested for perjury, the pimp &quot;Accattone&quot; has nobody to support him, but he seduces the naive worker Stella (Franca Pasut) and she becomes a whore. However, Accattone has a crush on Stella and decides to find a way to support her, with tragic consequences.\n\n&quot;Accattone&quot; is the stunning debut of the great director Pier Paolo Pasolini. He returns to the theme of the misery of Italy in the postwar, explored in many Italian neo-realist movies such as Fellini&apos;s &quot;Le Notti di Cabiria&quot; (1957) and Visconti&apos;s &quot;Rocco e i Suoi Fratelli&quot; (1960), and magnificently shows the lifestyle of great part of the population in Italy, its lower class, with lack of perspective, starvation, prostitution and unemployment. Considering that this movie is also the debut or the beginning of the career of most actors and actresses, it is amazing how Pasolini was able to make such gem. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Accattoni  Desajuste Social&quot; (&quot;Accattoni  Social Maladjustment&quot;)",

The running theme is either firefights (which is good eye candy but poor storytelling) or the futility of war.\n\n&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; has a different take. First, Mel Gibson plays a colonel with a degree, allowing him to not only think like a soldier but an academic. He understands military history and why strategies have or have not worked, and why Vietnam is as pointless as Korea was.\n\nBut what really stood out was the focus on the wives. The story is almost always about the boys becoming men in the battlefield. We rarely, if ever, see their parents or spouses. Here is an exception... the wives are their own squadron, bonding together and keeping strong. And that&apos;s the reality of war: people don&apos;t just die -- someone else has to feel that loss.",

      "reviewBody": "Sappy? Yeah, I guess at times but this also mostly earns its big heart, and treats early teens with more far dignity and insight than most films. \n\nLucy Deakins is terrific as an intelligent, thoughtful 14 year old, who slowly grows to care for the autistic boy next door. He doesn&apos;t speak, but dreams only of flying away, a condition brought on by the deaths of his parents in a plane crash years before. Now he&apos;s in the care of an alcoholic uncle (the always wonderful Fred Gwynne), and the powers that be think he might be better off being institutionalized. \n\nAlmost all the acting is top notch, which is crucial in this character based story. Jay Underwood walks various fine lines as the titular boy, named Eric. By turns mysterious, locked in, charming he seems believable as an emotionally isolated adolescent as well as a possible source of magic. Colleen Dewhurst doesn&apos;t have a lot of screen time, but makes something rich and real out of a concerned teacher who doesn&apos;t want to see Eric locked away, knowing it will kill his spirit. And Bonnie Bedelia makes a touching warm and understanding widowed mom. \n\nThere are some scenes where the comic relief is more than a little forced, and a sub-plot about a little brother taking on neighborhood bullies seems grafted on from a far more Disney-ish film. But this Capra-esque gentle, bittersweet fantasy is a great 1980s film for tweens even today, and not a bad one for adults as well.",

Filmed on the small Island of Thirassia (belongs to Santorini), where life nearly hasn&apos;t changed since the 50-ies. And it&apos;s true! Walking around the paths there or peep into the small mini markets will make you understand how life used to be before the mass tourism invaded Santorini.\n\nSmall crime is a comedy but with a few messages and a serious touch to it. Great performances by all the actors, but mainly Aris Serace Vitalis is an expert to show feelings only by his expressions. \n\nEnjoy, laugh and get a feel of the amazing island Thirassia!",

      "reviewBody": "for me, an avid music fan, this documentary hit home from the opening credits. as a child of the 90s, i can still remember when i could turn on the radio, flip through 7 stations, and hear about 7 completely different songs being played. it was not a process to try and search out &quot;alternative&quot; stations because as you moved from station to station you could find something that sounded completely different than what was playing on the station before it. this all stopped around 1997 when i found that as i moved from station to station i could be guaranteed to hear the same song in a short period of time. sadly, around 1997, i abandoned listening to the radio all together and haven&apos;t gone back since. the radio used to be a place to hear what was new and upcoming. bands had a chance to develop on the radio and gain an audience; record companies instilled faith in bands and nurtured them to develop. it is these concepts that the movie focuses on. pop radio hasn&apos;t always been something to hate if you&apos;re a music fan! artists like stevie wonder, ray charles, dmb, pearl jam, THE BEATLES, aretha franklin, elvis, gladys knight &amp; the pips, eric Clapton, led zeppelin, and so on are all spawns of pop radio! in this movie branford marsalis has some of the best quotes I&apos;ve ever heard regarding the music industry saying: &quot;fans of popular music today aren&apos;t music fans...they&apos;re pop culture fans.&quot;, &quot;stevie wonder and ray charles would not have had a shot today...they&apos;re blind!&quot;, and has one regarding dmb saying that they would not have made it either since they are different and have a violin &amp; saxophone in the band! though this movie sounds like it would be quite depressing to the music fan viewing, it is actually quite uplifting because it shows that well respected people in the business are aware of the crap that is coming out. please check this out and spread the word.",

I am not sure who Stark Sands is, and I saw the movie a couple of times. But Martin Hancock as McGruff will definitely make you smile. I was enchanted by Prague and Venice, as presented in this movie while the two actors gave credibility to the two very improbable characters. I hope we will see Mathew Goode in many more movies in US. This one is a charming light movie and the chemistry between the actors makes it a pleasure to watch. For those who love to travel or did so as youngsters, or never did but wish they could have, this is a movie to warm your hearts."

      "name": "Again very little of Chekhov",
      "reviewBody": "When I recently compared &quot;Country Life&quot; with &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, The Chekhov play from which it was loosely derived, the connection was at least tangible. Margaretha von Trotta&apos;s Italian version of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; contains so little of the original as to be barely recognizable.  True, there are still three sisters and a brother, each unfulfilled in their various ways, but the Chekhovian leitmotiv of wanting to be somewhere else is never mentioned so that the main idea behind the play is missing.  So forget Chekhov - at least there is a very fine filmed version by Laurence Olivier.  Von Trotta&apos;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; therefore has to stand as something completely different on its own terms.  In actual fact it rather wobbles.  This is one of those respectable European art-house movies with a few big names such as Fanny Ardant and Greta Scacchi to help it along.  Its settings, a baroque university building and a misty flat landscape with sparsely planted trees give it a classy look.  Its score, string music rather classically poised with just a hint of romanticism also contributes to the respectable aura. It all adds up to what a friend of mine delightfully dubbed &quot;the Laura Ashley school of cinema&quot;.  &quot;Three Sisters&quot; is worthy, nice to look at but ultimately rather dull.  Only one character engaged my sympathy - the brother who is obliged to abandon his chance of a music career at the behest of his selfish wife and go into banking which he detests.  I thought him a dope at first but felt like cheering when he finally rounds on her.  For one brief scene this rather uninteresting film suddenly springs to life, but too late to prevent it from sinking is its inertia.",

I just try to understand why someone rejects what I like and that&apos;s why I read the &quot;negative&quot; reviews twice, trying (like Giovanni) to analyze reviewers&apos; characters. Certainly this is not a film for Hollywood/Marvel fans. European cinema deals mostly with real people in real life incidents and stories. Therefore they apply to completely different audiences than the above mentioned fans. So, for European mentalities the film is very good, believe me!",

      "reviewBody": "This film was shown as part of the 2002 French Film Festival in Sydney and it is certainly very French, being pre-occupied with the morality of the French revolution, here seen from the aristocratic point of view of Grace Elliot, the Scottish ex-mistress of both George, Prince of Wales (later George IV) and the Duc d&apos; Orleans, cousin of Louis XVI (who was a supporter, initially, of the Revolution).  As played by Lucy Russell, Grace is an unwavering royalist who goes on living her gentlewoman&apos;s lifestyle in and around Paris, regardless of the dangers, which are considerable for someone like her. She has no sympathy with the revolutionaries and is horrified by the execution of Louis and his Queen, which she observes from afar.\n\nHaving once walked out of an Eric Rohmer movie (`Clair&apos;s Knee&apos;) rather than die of boredom, my expectations were not high. This movie (taken from Graces&apos; memoirs) is mostly talk  - gentlewomen did not, after all, engage in much action  but she does harbour an aristocratic fugitive at one point, to the Duke&apos;s dismay. Grace&apos;s relationship with her ex-lover, the portly and rather pompous Duke (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), is an intriguing one. She is not able to exercise much influence over him, not because of any lack of persuasive powers, but because he is too weak and irresolute to follow her advice. As a foreign woman living alone (she was widowed a year or two previously), she needs a powerful friend or two, but the Duke, for all his courtly manner, isn&apos;t a lot of help. \n\nThe cast weave in and out of stylised (and digitised) backdrops and this production style fits in well with the historical setting. The sets are intended to be seen as backdrops, unlike, say, the Coliseum scene in `Gladiator&apos;). This has the effect of focusing the audience on the actors rather than be distracted by the set. It was brave of Rohmer to adopt such an innovative format, but it works well here. There are a few dramatic moments such as when Grace is hauled before the local revolutionary committee on suspicion of spying for Britain (naturally the most handsome revolutionary takes her side). It is however basically a talk show (`what I did in the revolution I hated&apos;), and often rather slow. Lucy Russell, though, is quite compelling as Grace, and this time at least I was not driven from the theatre."

Hill does his best to copy the original performance by Franco Nero, and succeeds. Director Ferdinando Baldi co-wrote this with Franco Rossetti (who also co-wrote the Corbucci film), and the result is an extremely entertaining film, with plenty of action, and enjoyable performances. This is nowhere the really great spaghetti westerns such as &quot;Keoma&quot;, &quot;Bullet For The General&quot;, and the works of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci, but fans of the genre will be more than pleased. The ending is the best bit, and was actually copied in the only official &quot;Django&quot;-sequel, &quot;Django Strikes Again&quot;. Extremely hard to find, but well worth the search.",

      "reviewBody": "The family man and school teacher Julien Auclert (Vincent Lindon) has his life turned upside down when his beloved wife Lisa (Diane Kruger) is arrested, accused for murdering her boss, and sent to the prison. Along three years, Julien raises their son Oscar (Lancelot Roch) alone and appeals to the court; however, the evidences against Lisa are solid – the motive, since she had and argument with her boss; her fingerprints in the murder weapon, a fire extinguisher; blood stain in her coat; and a witness that saw her leaving the parking lot - and her lawyer exhausts all the possible resources in justice. Julien believes in the innocence of his wife and interviews Henri Pasquet (Olivier Marchal), a former escapee from prison, to learn how to plan a prison break. Then he plots a scheme to release Lisaa and travel abroad with Oscar and her. However, he needs documents for the family; an escape plan; and lots of money. When Julien is informed that Lisa will be transferred to another prison within the next three days, he needs to raise a large amount and anticipate his strategy before the transference.\n\n&quot;Pour Elle&quot; is another great French thriller, with an engaging and dramatic story. Vincent Lindon has an awesome performance in the role of a man that risks his stable life to rescue his wife, who was wrongly accused of murder, from prison.\n\nA couple of days ago (02 April 2011), my wife and I saw the American popcorn movie &quot;The Next Three Days&quot; and in that occasion I wrote in IMDb &quot;a good thriller that could have been excellent with minor modifications in the screenplay&quot;. I have glanced the review of another IMDb User informing that the American movie is a remake of &quot;Pour Elle&quot; and I have just watched it. It is amazing the lack of creation of this former successful American industry that insists in the remake of great films.\n\n&quot;Pour Elle&quot; is realistic, without the exaggeration of &quot;The Next Three Days&quot; and for me better and better. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Tudo por Ela&quot; (&quot;Everything for Her&quot;)",

Why he wanted to cancel Christmas was really uninteresting and lacked any excitement or enjoyment. If anyone is still debating whether to watch this movie or not, they better have the determination not to mind falling asleep.",

      "reviewBody": "I am not sure what to make of THE LAST OF THE UNJUST. It tells the story of Theresienstadt, now in the Czech Republic, which was designated by Adolf Eichmann as a &quot;model ghetto,&quot; an idealized place which was deliberately designed to mislead the world about the ways in which Jews - especially the elderly, as well as children - were being treated. A propaganda film, released in the early Forties, shows a happy community of people contributing to the nation through regular work and ample leisure-time in which people were free to do as they wish.\n\nIn truth the &quot;model ghetto&quot; was just another death-camp in which Jews were herded together and either left to die or gunned down in cold blood. Benjamin Murmelstein, the last president of the Theresienstadt Jewish Council, was forced to negotiate day after day from 1938 until the end of the war with Eichmann. When the war ended he was ostracized by the Jewish population and forced into exile into Italy.\n\nThree decades later director Claude Lanzmann tracked him down and interviewed him in Rome. Like many of those involved in the Final Solution, Murmelstein protests his innocence as well as trying to justify his behavior. But of course nothing can ever redeem him from the guilt of what happened.\n\nLanzmann&apos;s footage remained dormant for nearly four more decades until Lanzmann, now an elderly man himself, decided to put it in a film. THE LAST OF THE UNJUST is a long piece of nearly four hours duration, wherein the Murmelstein interview is split up with historic footage, as well as Lanzmann talking direct to camera about the reminiscences of those unfortunate enough to be members of the community, both living and dead.\n\nThe message is a harrowing one, reminding us of the depths to which humanity can sink in its lust for power. What renders the film even more difficult to fathom, however, is our awareness that similar atrocities have taken place elsewhere in the world since 1945, and continue to dominate the headlines. It seems that no one really wants to learn from the lessons of history despite Lanzmann&apos;s laudable attempts to make us do so.",

But if they are together you rather find a place to hide.Each character has different properties that can make laugh you.In Turkey every young student knows the story of &quot;HABABAM SINIFI&quot; and they try to be like them.\n\nOlder films are the best comedy films i have ever watch.But i can not say it for these new editions.If you watched older films about &quot;HABABAM SINIFI&quot; then you think this is the worst &quot;HABABAM SINIFI&quot; ever. I think this film has made for money only. You can only laugh in two or three scene.The scenario is very bad.It is no sense.If you watch this film i guarantee that you will have a lot of questions in your mind that nobody can answer. I think the worst performance is belong to &quot;Mehmet Ali Alabora&quot;.Don&apos;t loose your time to watch this film. The only good thing for the film is the performance of Peker Acikalin (Sayko). Maybe we can never watch a good &quot;HABABAM SINIFI&quot; again without &quot;KEMAL SUNAL&quot;.",

Anyway, the inclusion of this film on the Video Nasty list would seem to be another huge error from the DPP. The &apos;women in prison&apos; genre has no shortage of vile, exploitative efforts; and many of those would deserve a place on the Video Nasty list. This one, however, is one of the least exploitative I&apos;ve ever seen and yet it&apos;s the only women in prison film on there! Furthermore, the film actually has a plot! It focuses on a diamond robbery; followed by the murder of the man that did it by his girlfriend, who is then sent to a women&apos;s prison where she is subjected to some mild exploitation. There&apos;s some lesbian sex and stuff featured; but nothing really that &apos;bad&apos;. The film does feel cheap and nasty in places; but the cinematography is decent and it feels like a professional production. It has to be said that the film is a little bit dull at times; but it doesn&apos;t overstay it&apos;s welcome at less than eighty minutes and just for the fact that it has some story, I&apos;d rate this among the better films of the genre.",

However, it is a little bit less of a documentary than it seems at first, it does take a bit of creative freedom in the narration. Which has been criticized by some reviewers, but makes it a better movie after all. Excellent performances by William Holden as the police chief and Franco Nero as the terrorist leader, whose motivation is explained remarkably well. He is not just the one-dimensional Hollywood villain firing bullets in all directions. That was important to make the film believable, as well as the discussions between the politicians. Even it makes the movie quite wordy, the reasons why and when and how the police fights the terrorists are explained well. &quot;21 Hours at Munich&quot; is a movie you should watch, first for the tragic history that hopefully will never be repeated, second for its solid story telling and acting which is above the genre average.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching director Rúnar Rúnarsson&apos;s feature debut now cannot circumvent this epithet &quot;the Icelandic version of AMOUR (2012)&quot;, only VOLCANO came one year earlier. Compared to AMOUR, it does&apos;t match the former&apos;s metaphorical conceit, but as a debut, Rúnarsson adeptly chronicles this slow-burner with unadorned humanism and uncompromising dedication. \n\nOur protagonist Hannes (Júlíusson), is introduced by his retirement party and begins to adopt his new life pattern with his wife Anna (Jóhannsdóttir), but his withdrawn personality and the deficit in communicating with his two children, Ari (Bachmann) and Telma (Gunnarsdóttir), creates a family gap, Ari and Telma can never understand why their mother marries a man who has never been good to her. Yes, there are only two people knows the truth of their marriage. \n\nAfter a leakage in Hannes&apos; tiny boat, and a make-up sex which is quite audacious for two elderly actors and the mastermind behind it, the unexpected happens, Anna has a stroke but survives, against the will of Ari and Telma, Hannes decides to take care of her at home, then we journey through Hannes&apos; day-to-day effort of attending to Anna, meanwhile I was thinking please don&apos;t let it be a reenactment of AMOUR, please don&apos;t! Yet eventually a tough decision must be made, but unlike Trintignant and Riva&apos;s bourgeois harmony, Hannes and Anna&apos;s marriage is more or less on the rocks, which prompts Hannes&apos; behaviour to look like a redemption for all those years of negligence, a remorseful realisation of not cherishing the beloved one until time is running out. Rúnarsson has no qualm of showing audience the cruelty but he also refuses to imprint his personal judgement on it, arguably, one can interpret Anna&apos;s whimpering as her final request, and Hannes merely executes it despite of all the unwillingness. \n\nLeading actor Theodór Júlíusson&apos;s performance is quietly powerful, incredibly engaging in betraying Hannes&apos; flux of mind under the introverted surface, and he is consummately believable to embody a lifelike character besides performing well in several pathos- rendering scenes. Margrét Helga Jóhannsdóttir, although her role is truncated to a vegetable halfway through apart from her unvarying moaning, is equally daring and admirable, for Anna, there is no clear indication of her condition&apos;s deterioration, so she is not so lucky as Riva in AMOUR. \n\nThe volcano is presented in the opening sequences with a sublime aria and from what I glean in the film, it signals as an abrupt changeover in one&apos;s life, it is the volcano forced Hannes and Anna to leave their hometown for relocation, which forever altered their trajectory, so is Anna&apos;s stroke, it will change the family eventually, it cannot be stopped. In the end, through a breathtaking shots of Iceland&apos;s unique terrain and sea view, Rúnarsson chooses to let nature speak, to impress, to marvel and to purify, while Hannes and his grandson are sailing on the muted sea, conveys the sense of succession, like the film per se, the spirit is also silent but tenacious.",

      "reviewBody": "Firstly let me say that this review is based on the full uncut 156 minute version of the movie.\n\nAfter watching this I can see why it was a financial failure when it was released and did not get more publicity. It is easy to see that the powers that be in the US and other countries featured would have preferred it never be seen. Just too close to the truth of what has happened on a smaller scale more than once.\n\nIronic that a virus created by the US that kills almost everyone gets labeled Italian Flu. Do some real research of Spanish Flu that killed millions and you will know what I mean.\n\nThis is a movie full of big name actors of the time, but you need to see the uncut 156 minute version to do it justice. All of the big names perform their roles well and while being very bleak the movies gets the story across with appropriate use of subtitles.\n\nDo not expect high end CGI or special effects, there are none, just a well put together movie that IMHO stands the test and is worth seeing some 35+ years later.\n\nProbably one of the best Armageddon movies you will see if you are prepared to sit thought it. This is not a hollywoodised movie in any way.\n\nSolid 8/10 for me, not sure I would watch it again though, a little bit too real for comfort.",

Unfortunately, much of its brilliance is lost in translation, and it may not make sense for viewers who are unfamiliar with Eastern European history after the Second World War. The general plot is as defined by other reviewers; it serves as a platform for a life tour under Soviet-imposed communism, covering various social strata-from the high-rolling, corrupt Communist Party minister residing atop the Palac Kultury to the inspiring boiler room staff, drinking their lives away while the tenants are freezing. The movie is about a disintegrating world guided to everyday acts of insanity and seeing them. The portrayal is a bit exaggerated, of course, but it&apos;s not far from that time&apos;s reality. Humor can be a mighty weapon.",

And to this day, I am still wondering what the subject matter of &quot;Devil Dan&quot; is, and why it was so much more of a winner program than &quot;The Happy Harringtons&quot;...\n\nGet the kids away from &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; for a couple of hours with this campy treat..."

It was pure racism.\n\nThe zombie action was good when you saw it, but that was sparse as most of the action took place in the warehouse.\n\nJanine Foster was the best character in the movie, and I look for more of her in the future.\n\nNeat ending, though.",

This is a story of the Finnish Screaming Male Choir, conceived I believe in the late 1980s and led by a man, Petri Sirviö, whose idea it is to harness the scream and make music out of it.  Petri&apos;s wry humor is omnipresent and the stunning photography, such as of the choir performing on ice with a massive ice breaker in the distance that they have just alighted from, make this a joy to watch.\n\n   --Dilip Barman April 3, 2004"

      "reviewBody": "Dog Pound is directed by Kim Chapiron who also co-writes the screenplay with Jeremie Delon. It stars Adam Butcher, Shane Kippel, Mateo Morales, Taylor Poulin, Dewshane Williams, Lawrence Bayne and Trent McMullen.\n\nYoung offenders Butch (Butcher), Angel (Morales) &amp; Davis (Kippel) are sent to the Enola Vale correctional facility and find that bullying, drugs and abuse are the order of the day.\n\nTo clear things up, since there seems to be a lot of confusion on internet forums, Dog Pound is to all intents and purposes a remake of Alan Clarke&apos;s seminal British Borstal shocker, Scum (1977/79). It&apos;s the same plotting, much of the same characters are recycled and all of the big scenes from Scum are recreated as well. Only difference is is that Chapiron has shifted the story to North America, to a fictional correctional facility in Montana. It&apos;s basically done what the Farrelly Brothers did with Fever Pitch. What should be noted is that Chapiron hasn&apos;t hid from this fact, he didn&apos;t make the movie thinking nobody would notice, he actively acknowledged his worship of Clarke&apos;s film, making Dog Pound very much the ultimate American homage. Claims of it being a rip-off etc are way off the mark, it&apos;s a remake and nobody has denied this.\n\nMuch like the original British version, Dog Pound is brutal, upsetting and has a loud booming voice. The director follows Clarke&apos;s template by keeping it grimy and raw, and by shooting it in semi-documentary style and using rookie actors and real life ex-offenders in the cast, Chapiron has gone, and gotten, gritty realism. He&apos;s also added a couple of his own neat touches to the narrative. The pressure the guards are under is scrutinised, how it affects home life, and there&apos;s a deft line about AIDS in the story, how people react to sufferers of the disease. The recreation of a young offenders facility is well researched, with laid bare dormitories and depressing corridors, while the cast, particularly a terrific coiled spring Butcher, can&apos;t be faulted for excellent serving up of the material to hand.\n\nMinor problems do exist, familiarity of genre is always an issue, and here for anyone who has seen either of the Scum movies, there is no surprise factor, it does feel a little old hat. This even though Chapiron appears to be making the comment that problems inside juvenile facilities haven&apos;t ceased since the 70s. The Angel character is badly under written in the context of him being one of the central characters, a big misstep since he forms a crucial plot development, whilst the use of music is also a very bad idea. These irritants stop the film from being up with the best of the genre, but it&apos;s still a potent firecracker of a picture. Very well made and still it has something to say, in that the cycle of violence continues inside, that juvenile institutions are still questionable tools for rehab, problems are there and Dog Pound ferociously makes its point. 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "... seems to be the question at the heart of this Turkish film about a simple man living a simple life until his world is turned upside down when he is suddenly exposed to the modern world in the service of his religion. Muharrem is at the center of this character study. He is a very nondescript looking man of about 40 who has been in the service of sack dealer Ali Bey and his family since childhood. He is called an apprentice, but he acts basically as a stock boy and runner of errands. He has been stuck at this point since he was a child with no hope of being more than he is, and he seems fine with that. He lives a simple life in simple quarters and rigidly adheres to his religious sect&apos;s rules without question.\n\nWhat changes everything is when the leader of his religious sect selects Muhareem to be the organizer of finances for the group. With absolutely no training in this area and no prior exposure to the modern world and culture, he is thrust into a position of authority wandering about town collecting the sect&apos;s rents. When he is handed a cell phone to call Rauf - his superior and adviser - in case he has questions during his rounds, he looks as though he has been handed a piece of biomedical equipment that he must somehow assemble.\n\nMuhareem finds himself morally challenged and psychologically troubled when he is exposed for the first time to power, money, and sex. The power comes in the form of regard that he&apos;s never had before from people who have previously treated him as though he was invisible. His new sexual temptations come in the form of things as simple as having to walk past a long line of female mannequins dressed in lingerie on his way to collect some rent moneys. Muhareem has never seen such sights before, and soon he is having disturbing dreams. Also, he begins to see an equally troubling change in his own personality that seems to be required for him to do his new job correctly, but goes against the grain of all he has ever believed to be righteous.\n\nThis film is set in Turkey and the sect in question is the Sufi branch of Islam, but it could easily be set anywhere in the world and involve any religion - the themes are universal. Highly recommended.",

Thus she has very interesting things to say about language, literature and life. Moreover, growing up in Kiev she witnessed, how her family and friends fell victim to the stalinist purge and the German occupation, while she herself was one of the very few eastern europeans actually being promoted by the Nazi regime with a scholarship in Germany.\n\nUnfortunately, this great material is presented in an unstructured an ill-paced manner. The only narrative frame is the historic one of the 30s and 40s. Everything else is shown in an arbitrary order. This is tolerable as long as the material is interesting enough to carry itself.\n\nBut what&apos;s really annoying is the passages, where we see here speaking in Russian to an ukrainian audience. Without subtitles. For minutes. Or we see here looking out of a train&apos;s or a taxi&apos;s window an speaking to herself in Russian. Without explanation or translation. For minutes. These parts, in total at least 30 minutes, convey hardly any information. In addition, the director very often fails finding pictures which would illustrate the narrated appropriately.\n\nSo if this documentary was re-edited, brought into a coherent shape and freed of all the superfluous crap, it would be quite a good one.",

The young &apos;Ntoni Valastro rebels against the economical situation of his poor family and convinces the Valastro to mortgage their simple house in the Fidania Bank in Catania to buy a fish boat of their own and never work again for the wholesalers. In a stormy day, he decides to fish due to the necessity of repaying the debt to the bank; however, the storm destroys his boat and the dream of his family. Without any support and job, &apos;Ntoni sees the disintegration of his outcast family. \n\n&quot;La Terra Trema: Episodio del Mare&quot; is a heartbreaking, bitter and cruel story of a family of fishermen that decides to change their poor economical situation facing the powerful exploiters. The Marxist &quot;Red Count&quot; Luchino Visconti directs and narrates this little masterpiece of the Italian Neo-Realism casting non-professional actors and actresses, actually fishermen and inhabitants of Aci Trezza. The abusive treatment of the greedy and idle wholesalers gives an idea of how workers were exploited in this period of history and the reason for the ideological fight of classes between Communism and Capitalism. In Brazil, this film was released on DVD by Versátil Distributor. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Terra Treme&quot; (&quot;The Earth Shakes&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This is a bizarre and rather creepy little film from 1938. It stars Bobby Breen--a 11 year-old singing sensation with a voice that sounds like a woman&apos;s! The effect is rather strange--hearing such a high-pitched and feminine voice coming from the boy. The effect is a tad creepy. And, speaking of creepy, the film also features a freaky little girl (Irene Dare) who appears to be at most 5 years-old (though IMDb indicates she&apos;s 7--she clearly does not look to be that age). Miss Dare is the combination of two odd sensations of the day--Shirley Temple and the ice skating actress Sonja Hennie. The effect of seeing such a tiny girl exploited (yes, I do mean exploited) is amazingly creepy--and even worse than people getting rich off Breen. And, in an odd twist, the plot is about Breen&apos;s character being exploited! The film begins in a Mennonite community in Pennsylvania. Breen and his mother (silent star Delores Costello) are living with Breen&apos;s incredibly rigid and moralistic uncle (Robert Barrat). Barrat is very religious but also seems to completely miss the meaning of his faith---and is very cold and unforgiving. Eventually, his rigidity forces young Bobby to run away to Philadelphia to make his fortune. In this pursuit, he&apos;s accompanied by a real ne&apos;er-do-well (Charlie Ruggles) who again and again exploits the boy&apos;s singing talents. When the boy is offered $25 a week to sing, Ruggles tells the kid he&apos;s earning $5--and pockets the rest. Nice guy, huh?! Eventually Breen makes good and returns home--only to be given the cold shoulder by his Hitler-iffic uncle. It seems that $20 accidentally disappeared and the uncle insists that Breen stole it. To get back in his family&apos;s good graces, he sets out to prove his innocence--which makes it all seem so very, very abusive and cruel. At no point does the boy&apos;s &apos;loving mother&apos; intercede and the whole film comes off as bizarre and exploitational.\n\nWhile I did not like the plot nor all the singing and skating (mostly because, as I said, it all seemed to exploit these tykes), I must admit that the acting was generally very good. Breen came off as a very sweet kid--natural and easy to like. And, Ruggles&apos; character, while a bit despicable, was also fun to watch--much like Frank Morgan in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; or W.C. Fields in pretty much all his films! The overall effect is quite watchable but weird--and probably something best seen only by insane cinephiles like myself!",

The Ghost is a grotesque satire may seem a bit out of date in the humor quotient, but it is a essential viewing for those who love absurd cinema. The story is of Jesus Christ has returned in Bavarian Monastery in the form of a rather palpable ghost and lives on bread and wine. He is the 42nd Lord wearing a crown of thorns that itches, mocks the mother Superior, also deals with drunken legionnaires and fulfils his chores as a waiter in the cloister tavern. It is a very tricky subject to bring it on the big screen and Achternbusch had and still has the guts to do it amidst the controversies, even the clips from this movie will come in handy for Blasphemous Black Metal bands. Brownie points for Werner Schorter&apos;s role, it is a must see for his fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Hangmen Also Die! (1943)\n\nThe best part of this movie is knowing it was made right in the middle of the war, not in some recreation of the events. It&apos;s a little hyperbolic, for sure, but really well acted (both the Nazis and the Czechs), and it ends up being a battle of wits and tricks between the two sides.\n\nFritz Lang was a refuge from Nazi Europe and made this in Hollywood, with an expected sensibility for the cruelties and barbarism of the occupying nasties. And they probably were this nasty--worse, in truth, though less comically so, as the movie sometimes pushes it a bit. Still, really enjoyable, in all. Yet, somehow, it was long. The twists from one scene to another started to sound familiar, and the tension was sustained rather than invigorated, if that makes any sense. \n\nBrian Donlevy is the leading good guy here, and he&apos;s always a little less than compelling, though he is not in most of the scenes so I suppose that&apos;s fine. The double-crosser was played by Gene Lockhart, whose presence grows as the movie gets on, and by the end he&apos;s really pretty amazing (far beyond the caricature of, say, the judge he played in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;). Walter Brennan makes an appearance, recognizable mostly by his voice. Two of the Nazi higher-ups were terrific, both the Pilsner guzzling brute and the slightly comical but scary gestapo head.\n\nLang is no fool, and he makes this movie not only a pleasure, but an important tool to remind viewers to be involved, to realize that you can fight oppression, even Nazi oppression, with enough wits and sacrifice.",

      "reviewBody": "Che: Part One felt very complete and fulfilling. I found myself looking at Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara as a very well rounded person. Not as an ideological self fulfilling man but as an articulate man with thought out rational decisions as well as a man with many useful talents.\n\nThe acting of the cast all around was very good but Benicio Del Toro took the movie by storm but he did this in a very subtle way. His performance displayed how Che&apos;s spirit was able to superseded the hardships faced in the Cuban Revolution. It did not display any brutality or recklessness but a devotion to a cause. Del Toro&apos;s perforations was that worthy of an Oscar nomination but I don&apos;t think Che Guervara cared to much about awards.\n\nThe directing by Steven Soderbergh was visually stunning at times with much of the scenes shot in the forest. What kept the movie upbeat though were the scenes of Che in New York giving interviews and addressing the U.N. It added an extra layer to the film allowing you to see another side of Che. The side in which he shows his political and speaking abilities. The writing was very good with the dialog always keeping you engrossed. The music, though not much of it, was very good and stayed within rhythm of the rest of the film.\n\nOverall the film succeeds in showing Che as a well rounded man never developing into oversimplified or unnecessarily complex portrayal of a man. The movie was very accurate and refused to take on a role of being inspiring or Hollywoodish which I enjoyed. The only problem with the film I had was that it seems to have a little too much of a feel of a war film rather than a biopic. Still I highly recommend this film.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this series for the first time in 1992 when it was on Polish TV but I have come back to it many times with great pleasure since then. THE STRAUSS DYNASTY shows the lives of Johann Strauss father and then his sons, the most famous of whom was Johann Strauss son, called Schani.\n\nThe whole story is shown with the focus on family life of the Strausses and their career. Their music, the unforgettable waltzes, can be appreciated throughout. I especially like the scene in Paris where Johann Strauss presents his new waltz &quot;An Der Schonen Blauen Donau&quot;. At first, no one seems to be keen, but later.... Other moments worth considering are the ones showing Schani&apos;s journey to Russia.\n\nBesides, you can find very good cast in this series. The main roles are played by Anthony Higgins (famous British actor) and Stephen Mc Gann (who can be found in many J. Chomsky&apos;s films). Among others, Alice Krige is excellent in the role of an insane Olga, Cherie Lunghi also performs very well as Schani&apos;s wife, Yetti and an unforgettable John Gielgud. He isn&apos;t given much time on screen as old Drechsler, but is equally unforgettable as in his great roles. Nevertheless, he is excellent, as always. John Rhys Davies gives a wonderful performance as prince Gribov: these facial gestures, the way he speaks (consider a funny moment he describes Russia to Schani just before signing the contract concerning Schani&apos;s journey). And Lisa Harrow as Mama Strauss is unforgettable. She appropriately presents a woman of strong will, ambition, and of a good heart. Definitely, the acting in this series IS of very high level!\n\nThere are many other factors that make this film worth watching. Many scenes are touching, especially the end when Schani is sitting on his armchair and coming back to important events in his life. He sees his father, his brothers, his childhood, the women he loved. When his memory comes to the current events, he closes his eyes and dies. I know that it may seem strange and longish, but Marvin J. Chomsky, most probably, aimed at showing people&apos;s belief - when we die, we see our lives.\n\nBut the most important factor that talks for the mini series, I think, is the music itself. The director makes a perfect use of it, entailing it in most of the scenes as a background. The lovers of the waltzes will absolutely love the film. \n\nThe effect of THE STRAUSS DYNASTY is similar to their music. As a famous orchestra director, Riccardo Muti, said on the 1st of January 2004 in Vienna: &quot;The music of Strauss unites the whole world&quot;. THIS SERIES DOES A SIMILAR JOB. Do watch it. You will not regret.",

      "reviewBody": "Although one certainly cannot say Gentleman&apos;s Agreement is not passionate in its aim to uncover the invisible cloak of anti-Semitism in post-war America, the execution of that objective could have used slightly more dramatic tension and immediacy.\n\nReleased the same year and touching on the same subject was Edward Dmytryk&apos;s Crossfire, which dealt with anti-Semitism at its extremes: murder with anti-Semitism as the motive.  Gentleman&apos;s Agreement takes a more humanistic and subtle approach--one that is too subtle at times.  Where Crossfire dropped the bomb of anti-Semitism into the laps of the audience, Gentleman&apos;s Agreement gives it to you in periodic shots in the arm in the form of a sermon, and each one says the exact same thing: anti-Semitism is bad.  (But we knew that.)  Yes, the message is an important one, but feeding it to the audience in a manner that is literally shoving it down our throats every few minutes doesn&apos;t help the digestion any.\n\nAlso lacking in Gentleman&apos;s Agreement is a three-dimensional protagonist. Peck&apos;s crusading writer who masquerades as a Jew is simply too zealous and unswerving for his own good.  He has no faults, no inner conflicts and no doubts about himself.  Whether he&apos;s being shunned by bigots or Dorothy McGuire, he&apos;s such a straight-shooter you know what he&apos;s going to do before he does: the right thing right away.\n\nThere&apos;s no real dramatic arc in the story, with the entire weight of the movie resting on the torrid on-again-off-again love affair between Peck and McGuire.  She symbolizes the hypocrisy and passiveness of the everyday American on anti-Semitism, and he points it out to her every chance he gets-and that&apos;s all.  It pretty much rambles on the same dramatic level all throughout the picture, dividing its time between love scenes and sermons, most of which are indistinguishable from one another.\n\nIn the end, the important message and the overall entertainment value of the picture suffers from this redundancy."

      "reviewBody": "Nathalie is most marked by silence and waiting. The husband does not talk about his extra marital dealings with his wife, and she does not ask about his. Neither of them speak to Nathalie about the truth of the relationship. I find this contrast to the &apos;let it all hang out&apos; philosophy of marriage to be refreshing. There are many moral questions raised in this film; is &apos;talking it out&apos; a good idea when the partners have been married this long, and will it change anything? Who is Nathalie&apos;s real customer? What would have happened if the husband and wife had had a row; would the husband have stayed until the end, when everything was revealed? These are good questions, not often dealt with; but the French seem to love having a go at them. Emmanuelle is well chosen as she does a lot of looking pensive, and her face is good for that: Fanny also stares a lot into the middle distance, and her bone structure is good for the late-forties woman she portrays; Depardieu is just such a nice guy underneath his philandery that you can almost believe he loves his wife and will wait to have her back. I liked the film. I like films that make one think."

Either remaking it as a period piece the way Billy Wilder did or updating it like this film and switching it to broadcast television journalism the laughs are there and the issues are the same. The Broadway play and first film adaption with also talked about bloviating politicians who campaign on law and order. If anything it&apos;s worse now.\n\nHoward Hawks saw the possibilities in The Front Page as a boy/girl romance by making the original role of the reporter as a woman. What he got was one of my favorite Cary Grant films. Switching Channels is a remake of His Girl Friday and the roles Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy played are now done by Burt Reynolds, Kathleen Turner, and Christopher Reeve. And of course Reynolds is now a news producer, Turner his ace reporter, and Reeve the handsome rich doofus she wants to marry.\n\nAgain it&apos;s an outrageously corrupt Ned Beatty playing the Cook County District Attorney who primarying the ineffectual Governor of Illinois Charles Kimbrough. He got a conviction on Henry Gibson for murdering a cop and he&apos;s looking to see that as Gibson burns in the electric chair, he can become  governor and more. Kimbrough is the kind who takes a poll before he goes to the bathroom. But Gibson escapes on the night he&apos;s to die and sets off a whole chain of events in which elected officials are toppled, romance gets redirected, and corruption exposed.\n\nIt is fascinating how on track Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur were when they wrote The Front Page. We could remake it again updating it with  internet journalism without too much of a change in the plot.\n\nStart thinking of who could be the stars in yet a 21st century remake of this classic.",

After portraying Buffalo Bill Cody in the way Cody would have liked to have been remembered it was only natural that Wyatt Earp be done the same way.\n\nWichita was the first town that Earp had a job in law enforcement and he was there one year, 1875-1876. Wichita is purportedly the story of that year and how he cleaned up the town and made law and order function in Wichita. It&apos;s certainly all been done before, but the story is in the hands of a capable cast.\n\nParticularly to watch is the double dealing role that Edgar Buchanan has and how a bad case of mistaken identity costs him dearly.\n\nTex Ritter sings a nice title song over the credits and while it didn&apos;t exactly have the impact that his same efforts had in High Noon, it certainly sets the tone for this film as well. After all back in the day Tex made a western or three.",

      "reviewBody": "The film begins a few days before Christmas. It follows what would happen if Santa Claus could not go to his Christmas Eve appointment with all the kids around the world. While doing a test flight with his sleigh, Santa Claus (Santiago Segura) gets into a cloud of pollution and crashes in the heart of Madrid. Seems Santa injures himself falling off and crashing in Alcalá street and later on, a daddy winds up putting on Santa&apos;s suit. Unable to fulfill his annual mission of distributing gifts, his only hope to save Christmas is to be replaced by Salva (Ernesto Sevilla) , a hustler with no job or benefit who, however, his son (Unax Hayden) adores. So Salva finds himself magically recruited to take his place. But as it turns out when you put on Santa&apos;s suit, you become Santa, and he has then to drive the sleigh with the reindeers and deal with the elves. This Christmas, the snow hits the fan !. What if your dad was Santa Claus? . It&apos;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas...!. You&apos;ve Never Seen Santa Quite Like This Before !. Salva must become Santa. No if or and...Just one big butt !\n\nAn endearing and soft comedy it is sympathetically starred by Santiago Segura and Ernesto Sevilla who create a competent couple in a low-energy film, where everything is in its place. Amusing , funny and cheerful film filled with silly sketches, noisy action , hilarious set-pieces, tongue-in-cheek and lots of humor. The premise is the following: What if Santa Claus couldn&apos;t attend his Christmas Eve date with the children of the World? Joaquin Mazón demonstrates a special touch for knowing how to find the point in different types of comedy, in different ways of understanding the same genre. The film thus becomes a clear candidate for success at the Christmas, by intelligently mixing all those ingredients and offering what he initially proposes. Something that is always appreciated , with a careful production, furthermore, that convinces in the visual section. This is what happens in this tender and fun family comedy in which Santiago Segura gives life to Santa and Ernesto Sevilla to his unlikely replacement. In addition to the always friendly Segura, the film also features the interventions of Pablo Chapiella (¨La que se avecina¨), Maria Botto (¨Risen¨) and the child Unax Hayden (¨20.000 Spices of Bees¨), adding a short and funny intervention or cameo by Joaquin Reyes (¨Capitulo 0¨).\n\nThe film follows the style of those films starring Tim Allen : The Santa Clause! (1994), The Santa Clause 2 (2002) of which it even seems to be a Spanish remake, it is the same plot here, we also have an irresponsible divorced father, a retired Santa Clause and a botched substitute.\n\nDirected regular but professionally by comedy specialist Joaquín Mazón, who has already done various films in similar genre. Director Joaquin Mazón is a craftsman who has directed several TV episodes from series such as Alli abajo, Con el culo al aire, Doctor Mateo and Cuerpo de Elite ; being second Unit director and assistant director in other series as Circulo rojo, Fuera control, Cuestion sexo, Los 80 and Manolito Gafotas. Directing films as La Vida Padre and De Perdidos a Río,. Rating : 5/10 . If you like Santiago Segura , you&apos;ll enjoy this light-weight holiday comedy about a divorced father and eight-year-old son. This one gives adults plenty of to smirk at while the kids are distracted by all the yuletide yahooey.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a reason this movie dominated the Korean box office over the holiday season. It was more popular than Night at the Museum and many other American films. It accomplishes many things that recent Korean romantic comedies have failed at. Basically, this movie is the star vehicle for new actress Kim Ah-Jung. She gives a great performance and fits the role perfectly. Even though the plot is simplistic, it is very witty and provides consistent comedy. The movie does not take itself too seriously like a lot of Korean movies that are all like &quot;OMG LET&apos;S BE FUNNY FOR THE FIRST HALF AND MAKE IT ALL DEPRESSING IN THE SECOND HALF!&quot; While it provides many laughs, the story is still touching and meaningful. And what&apos;s amazing is that Kim Ah-Jung did all of her own singing, despite never having sung in a movie before nor being a singer. The soundtrack for 200 Pounds Beauty has topped the charts in Korea and &quot;Maria&quot; is one of the most popular songs in Korea right now.\n\nSince this is basically my first review, I want to emphasize that I wanted to write it because no Korean movie has touched me this strongly since I saw My Sassy Girl.\n\nI highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a satisfying romantic comedy. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Leo (Vittorio de Sica) and Oreste (Paolo Stoppa), two small crooks eking a living out of small scams, have only a couple of hours to pay a debt to one of their (many) creditors. When passing by the premises of the Tuns company, a large business company, Leo and Oreste have the idea of mingling with the employees (in order to find a way to make money or to be hired), until Leo is mistaken for the owner of the company, Mr Tuns himself (after all, no one has ever met this Mr Tuns, but for a couple of people). The role suits him like a glove, especially when he is asked to attend a concert -- as our two crooks see it as an opportunity to trick more people out of their money. But Leo is supposed to escort a sweet young woman, Matilde Moscapelli, aka &quot;Titi&quot; (Maria Mercader), the daughter of an accountant who works for the Tuns company. Mr Moscapelli has indeed high expectations for his daughter who is herself hoping for a better life. Leo soon finds himself caught between his desperate need for money and his new power as wealthy and mighty Mr Tuns can make dreams come true... Has he any right to disappoint Titi?\n\nItalian filmmaker Vittorio Cottafavi is best known for his pepla and was regarded as a competent director by most critics, although none of his works really stands out. But don&apos;t expect wild wigs, heavy make up, exotic folk dances and men in leather miniskirts here as Cottafavi&apos;s directorial debut owes much more to Vittorio de Sica than to the Roman Empire. After a couple of years spent studying at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome (regarded as one of the best art schools of the time), Cottafavi graduated in the late 1930s and began working as a screenwriter. He then became an assistant director to Alessandro Blasetti and Vittorio de Sica. Hence his first film, &quot;I Nostri Sogni&quot; (&quot;Our Dreams&quot;) released in 1943, featured De Sica as the leading star and was based on a theater play written by Ugo Betti, one of the greatest Italian playwrights of that time. In other words, &quot;I Nostri Sogni&quot; was meant to be a popular success which goal was to distract Italians from their current problems and the harsh realities of WWII. Cottafavi&apos;s first work was born under the sign of the De Sica-Zavattini partnership, here actor and adapter – one of the most fruitful partnerships in the history of Italian cinema. Zavatini&apos;s ironical touch can be felt here and then, and De Sica, well into middle age, was at his best playing light roles like Leo. I was a little afraid of what to expect, given Cottafavi&apos;s latter specialization in sword-and-sandal epics (I admit that pepla are generally not my cup of tea), but there is a care for atmosphere and a good cast, including Maria Mercader as the blonde leading lady, with whom De Sica formed a romantic team both on screen and in real life (by that time, De Sica was still married to his first wife and there was no divorce possible in Catholic Italy). The film isn&apos;t flawless though: it is mostly uneven, still far from the style which, apart from the genre and production budget, distinguishes the mature cinema of Cottafavi. Since the film was produced in the last months of the Mussolinian regime, it sets out a defence of the working class, morally clean, the soul of fascism, counterpointing the snobbism of the fashionable rich and the extravagance of the main protagonist. However, &quot;I Nostri Sogni&quot; is nothing more than an enjoyable little comedy, very far from the neorealist masterpieces which would soon vault Italian cinema into the world spotlight, but also rather far from the fluff you usually have in the &quot;white telephone films&quot; (&quot;telefono bianco&quot; pictures – see for instance Mario Camerini&apos;s films).",

Shot in almost documentary style the story is told almost matter-of-factly. But the reality of the lives of the men in the story is not matter-of-fact; they are dying and dying in the prime of their lives. It&apos;s heart-rending.  In this, the movie succeeds very well, raising awareness of the effects of AIDS, and putting a human face to its victims.",

      "reviewBody": "I realise that Con Air is about as far from ground-breaking visionary cinema as you can get—Hell, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which speaks volumes about the artistic integrity involved—but as a thrilling slice of slam-bang popcorn action fun, it works a treat.\n\nNicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, an honourable army ranger who is sent to a maximum-security federal penitentiary after accidentally killing a man while protecting his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). After serving eight years, Cameron is finally given parole, and scheduled to fly home on a C-123 Jailbird aircraft, along with several other prisoners whose number include evil criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and Poe&apos;s likable diabetic cell-mate O&apos;Dell (Mykelti Williamson). Poe&apos;s freedom is delayed however, when Cyrus and his equally vile cohorts take over the plane by force, and O&apos;Dell&apos;s life is placed in jeopardy...\n\nUnlike The Rock, which was an overly dramatic and rather jingoistic affair, Con Air is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish. To try and analyse the plot or apply logic to proceedings is futile, the script conveniently glossing over details as and when it suits (for example, we never learn what Cage&apos;s cell-mate O was jailed for; as a result, he becomes a sympathetic character, when the guy could have been a child killer for all we know!). Director Simon West sure isn&apos;t concerned about his film making sense, &apos;cos he&apos;s too busy having the time of his life inflicting maximum damage on everyone and everything in the most spectacular manner possible. In this film, the rules are &apos;don&apos;t just have a car crash when you can drag it behind a plane on a hook for a while before smashing it onto a runway?&apos; and &apos;Don&apos;t just kill a man when you can kill him and then drop his corpse from several thousand feet onto a moving vehicle?&apos;.\n\nIt&apos;s stuff like this, coupled with a formidable cast and excellent stunts, pyrotechnics and special effects, that elevate Con Air from the ridiculous to the sublime. I give Con Air a rating of 8 delightfully ruthless maniacs out of 10, making it the second best Nicolas Cage action flick of 1997.",

      "reviewBody": "My girlfriend said she&apos;d never seen a porno film, so she dragged me into the cinema to see &quot;Stille Dage i Clichy&quot; in Copenhagen, when the film was new. To say it&apos;s a bad film is to overvalue Warhol&apos;s &quot;Flesh.&quot; It was worse. The only good bit was right at the beginning, with the play on &quot;Gray Day.&quot; After that, it was downhill all the way.\n\nThe acting was abysmal. The plot... well, what plot? The &quot;Germs won&apos;t attack a starving man&quot; scene was memorably sickening. The bonking was overdone and hugely &quot;in your face.&quot;\n\nFor a poetic film, See &quot;Last Year in Marienbad.&quot; Spot the difference.\n\nIMHO, Miller wasn&apos;t a particularly good writer. His books did, however, mark a turning-point in censorship. This film, though, has about the same artistic qualities as &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and &quot;The Toolbox Murders.&quot;\n\nWhen the film ended, though, it was interesting to note that, while the women in the audience stood and put on their cardis and coats, the blokes sat quite still for a minute or so :-) .",

(and believe me, I&apos;ve seen a lot of films). \n\nThere is just something about the way this film starts and moves like an unstoppable force towards its conclusion. It&apos;s almost like all the characters around the Wraith instinctively know who he really is, and what is going to happen to them ultimately (you can see it in their eyes), and yet somehow, they seem to be irresistibly drawn into his web, lost in their own pride, entangled in their own rules of engagement, and misguided by their own sheer foolhardiness. and so the film goes from one inevitability to the next, with each person remaining true to himself/herself.\n\nThere are also some really memorable-crazy characters in the film, who add some light relief to what I think is a very serious film about human destiny; how we each help to create our own reality and then have to deal with it. To anyone who hasn&apos;t seen this film, give it a try (if you can find it) and keep an open mind. This not a high-tech blockbuster movie, but it&apos;s definitely a high-intelligence movie."

You remember the scene where Doc Brown is trying to get two electric cables to connect?\n\nIt reminded me a lot of the superb low-budget &apos;Primer&apos; which covers some of the same ground. In that movie, some geekie guys accidentally discover time-travel and have to decide what to do with it. Also, Almanac had some good jokes, which many movies seem to leave out.\n\nSeriously, did you see any jokes in Man of Steel? Sadly the shocking camera work ruined the whole experience.All the jumping about, whirling, juddering and flicking etc. It just made me feel ill.",

The special effects are really &quot;special,&quot; too. Much of it looks like something you would see in a video game. In fact, I wonder if they didn&apos;t just film some shots from a video game to save money.\n\nI enjoyed the film, however, for the laughs. It keeps you wondering just how bad it can get. Just when you think it can&apos;t get any sillier-- it surprises you and does.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how bad it is-- the main character is supposedly obsessed with getting back to the zone where he left his wife and daughter, yet he quickly drops his gloom when this British chick sheds her clothes and joins him in the shower. Only moments later, he is clearly hitting on the German chick. Of course, we know he is sensitive and caring, because every now and then he drops his gaze and supposedly thinks of the family he abandoned.\n\nThis was a German co-production. I thought the Germans were smarter.",

To me, it seems to tell the story of anyone who wants to be an actor whether it is in India or in Los Angeles. It has cute girls and boys. And the dance is good, the music is pumped up with energy.\n\nToo bad, not many people have seen it. If this movie was made by Hollywood, it could have been very popular, because it has all the elements.\n\nShahid Kapur doesn&apos;t look like those Indians I typically see, he looks like a mix, he could easily be mistaken as Italian, Hispanic, etc. His dance moves are good, he has a nice body. No wonder he is so popular in India.\n\nI won&apos;t mind watching it again just to see those dance sequences.",

      "reviewBody": "PRESQUE RIEN \n\n(USA: Come Undone /UK: Almost Nothing) \n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound format: Dolby Digital\n\nWhile visiting his sick mother in Brittany during summer recess, a teenage boy (Jérémie Elkaïm) falls in love with a local youth (Stéphane Rideau), but their relationship falters as Elkaïm is cut adrift from all that was once familiar to him, with near-tragic consequences.\n\nSébastien Lifshitz&apos;s intimate drama chronicles the sexual awakening of a naive teenager over the course of an idyllic summer, recounted in piecemeal fashion as the director cuts abruptly between timeframes, from Elkaïm and Rideau&apos;s love affair to the former&apos;s subsequent hospitalization following an off-screen suicide attempt, rendered &apos;naturalistic&apos; by hand-held camera-work and some improvized dialogue exchanges in key scenes. The results are confusing, to say the least: Just as the boys begin to strike out from their families and forge a life for themselves, Elkaïm slips into depression (why?) and appears to reject Rideau (why?), after which he goes looking for him again, only to find solace in unexpected quarters.\n\nAnyone hoping for a rose-tinted love story will come away feeling more than a little disappointed, though Lifshitz refuses to compromise the sexual aspects of his own screenplay (co-written with Stéphane Bouqet): Elkaïm and Rideau are completely nude in several sequences, and there&apos;s a memorable, full-on sex session amongst the sand dunes which should satisfy all but the most ardent porn-watcher. But the boys&apos; attachment is complicated by their relationship with their respective families, especially Elkaïm, who feels unable to declare his burgeoning sexuality because of a recent tragedy which has driven his father away and confined his mother to her sick-bed. Sad, complex and not a little frustrating, the movie works its magic in quiet ways, but it&apos;s a little too cold and dispassionate to satisfy all tastes.\n\nNicely produced on a modest budget, the film also stars Dominique Reymond, Marie Matheron and Laetitia Legrix as the three women in Elkaïm&apos;s life (mother, aunt and sister, respectively), along with Nils Ohlund as one of Rideau&apos;s former boyfriends, who figures heavily in the narrative&apos;s closing stages. The two leads are fine in difficult roles, and both have become iconic figures in European gay cinema: Rideau starred in such well-regarded Queer movies as WILD REEDS (1994), FULL SPEED (1996), TRANSFIXED (1997), SITCOM (1998) and THREE DANCING SLAVES (2003), while Elkaïm - who looks like a Bel Ami porn beauty - also appears in the gay-themed drama YOU&apos;LL GET OVER IT (2002) as the love object of handsome Julien Baumgartner (SEXY BOYS). Director Lifshitz made his feature debut with the French TV production LES TERRES FROIDES (1999) following a series of short films with Queer themes, and his latest entry is WILD SIDE (2004), another perceptive exploration of omnisexual angst.\n\n(French dialogue)",

I am thinking of &quot;Garden State,&quot; &quot;I Heart Huckabees,&quot; &quot;Closer &quot; etc. The consensus, so to speak, if these movies are to be taken as a mirror of reality, is that there is no purpose to be found, and the only grounds for relating to other human beings at all is sexual attraction, or its concomitant sexual competition. In fact, I watched this film and &quot;Thirteen&quot; together, and found them strangely parallel. I mention all this because Knafayim Shvurot is different from all the others in a small but fundamental respect: here the characters have not quite given up the search. Perhaps this reflects a difference between Israeli culture which, jaded though it is, is indisputably younger, and American culture which seems to be declining into both hedonism and vicious religiosity. I didn&apos;t realize it while I was watching, but was somehow not surprised to notice afterward that the &quot;family&quot; of characters is played by a real-life family. I couldn&apos;t help wondering how the experience affected them...",

Instead of being inside the prison another man has bought the rights and is taking it global. Fighting in his crew and other deals being made make this a harder race then usual. I have to admit that I do like these movies as cheesy as they are. I loved the first one and enjoyed the second one OK. I may have to re-watch that one though because I was a little confused to start this one. I thought some of the people that were in this died and the plot lines didn&apos;t seem to match up. Then the race started and I realized that it didn&apos;t really matter, the plots of these movies are just background to the racing and violence. To me that is OK. Much like the other two this is not an award winning movie and acting is iffy at best but it is still very entertaining and well worth checking out if you have seen the others. Overall, not as good as first but fun and exciting to watch still. I liked it. I give it a B+.",

      "reviewBody": "Perfect cinema. That was my reaction when I first saw Pygmalion, the first of 50 viewings and counting, and I still think so. Who could not fall in love with Leslie Howard, one of our greatest actors, so tragically assassinated in the Second World War? Wendy Hiller IS Eliza. The cast is flawless. The script... words fail me, for George Bernard Shaw was a genius, he did not simply adapt his play for the screen, it is so good that it is like it&apos;s happening before your eyes. My God, after seeing this is there anyone out there who thinks &apos;My Fair Lady&apos;, the slowest film musical on record, is the best screen version of Shaw? If they do, they are mad.\n\nThat film moves me not one jot, everything is so clean, so smug, so unreal. Here we see poverty, but also hope. These are not actors and actresses moving through the sets garbed in Cecil Beaton, but real people, real suffering, but humanity lights every scene like a beacon. The unbearably moving scenes of Eliza capturing society at the ball, the irresistible waltz, watch this with no tears in your eyes, I dare you. Halliwells Film Guide calls this &apos;one of the most heartening and adult British films of the thirties&apos;. Too right. I cannot fault this film, it is priceless. By the way, I saw &apos;My Fair Lady&apos; on stage recently, and it&apos;s miles better than the film version. Warner Bros really let Shaw down, and it&apos;s impossible to put it right. But this...well it is a big compensation. And I don&apos;t miss the songs one little bit.\n\nThere are so many classic scenes I can&apos;t pick any out. Of course viewers will spot that it was &apos;updated&apos; to 1938, and the original play set in the Edwardians. That doesn&apos;t hurt it at all, &apos;polite&apos; society didn&apos;t change much in the intervening years and gives the play an added &apos;contemporary&apos; edge. Please, please, please see this film. You will be gripped.",

      "reviewBody": "Rock &amp; Rule was put out of print back in 1985 shortly after its first video run. Since then it has not really seen the light of day, other than on ebay auctions, random TV sightings, and most recently on Bit Torrent. Now, with a two disc special edition DVD being released, it is finally time for this film to get the attention it deserves.\n\nRock &amp; Rule most likely failed because it was released in a time when animation was still dominated by the Disney/Children&apos;s market. Ralph Bakshi had a few successful films in the 70&apos;s, but as the 80&apos;s came along, he failed. Transformers (another PG animated film) failed. There were so many experimental animated films coming out, but none of them were successful, just because of its more adult-like content. Rock &amp; Rule isn&apos;t as extreme as say some of the Bakshi film are. But, there is a strange use of drugs (with orb-like balls) in the film, sexual innuendos, language, etc., But, nothing a young teen couldn&apos;t handle.\n\nOur story begins with some information about a war that is long passed. Humans don&apos;t exist anymore. What we have now are mutant evolutions of street animals (dogs, cats, rats, etc.,). We are introduced to Mok. He&apos;s an Iggy Pop/David Bowie sort of character. His music career is somewhat going under. It isn&apos;t as strong as it used to be.\n\nHe stumbles unto a secret code that can only be un-locked with a certain key. That key is the perfect voice. Once this code is unlocked, a beast will come and destroy all that Mok wants to be destroyed.\n\nHe stumbles upon a struggling band in his local town led by Omar and Angel. Omar sings the first song. Then Angel sings the second. When Mok hears this, he discovers the perfect voice. So, he does a little heist and kidnaps her and takes her to &quot;Nuke York&quot; to perform. After Omar and his friends wake up from a drug-haze, they travel to Nuke York to try and save her.\n\nAnimation is splendid for its time. Crazy visuals. Especially during the &quot;Triumph&quot; scene. It&apos;s almost like a psychedelic trip. The music is also great, featuring Cheap Trick, Earth Wind and fire, Iggy Pop, etc.,\n\nI suggest any fan of animation check this out once it comes out on DVD (whenever that may be, but it will be soon). It ain&apos;t a cult classic amongst true animation fans for nothing!",

      "reviewBody": "It seems fitting that in the wake of the excellent Lord of the Rings films, that we should have a look at just what started director Peter Jackson on the road to being one of the worlds greatest visionaries. Before LOTR&apos;s, Jackson&apos;s biggest financial hit was the Michael J. Fox horror comedy &apos;The Frighteners&apos;, and his biggest critical success being the haunting &apos;Heavenly Creatures&apos;, starring a then not-so-famous Kate Winslet. But it wasn&apos;t an easy ride getting to be the director of the most anticipated trilogy since Star Wars. Jackson started small, very small, and clawed his way up the movie ladder using nothing more than pure determination and a raw talent for film-making.\n\nJackson&apos;s first feature was Bad Taste, a low, low-budget horror comedy movie made over two years about aliens killing humans for their fast-food business back in space. No real plot, no real actors, no real crew. Only an insane imagination and devoted friends willing to help out. There&apos;s not even much of a script, because what Jackson sets out to do is sicken his audience with some of the most gruesome deaths ever seen and make them laugh until the back of their heads fall off. And he succeeds.\n\nNarrative and plot structure are not on the vile menu here. Instead, Bad Taste is a testament to sick jokes, low-budget gore and technical brilliance on a shoestring. Jackson made his own steadicam, crane and other camera rigs to create the impression of a bigger-budgeted movie (he fails to do so, unfortunately) and even undertook the task of making all of his own make-up and prosthetic effects, including mechanised masks and realistic machine guns. This is an even greater achievement when you consider just how much gore there is in the film, but the finale, in which a huge mansion is rocketed into space, defies the rules of its low budget and minimal crew.\n\nEven the cast were so minimal that the same aliens can be seen, if you look hard enough, being killed over and over again throughout the film, and Jackson himself takes on two roles; the unstable Derek and a mad alien called Robert. In one scene, Derek and Robert engage in a cliff-top fight with each other, balanced precariously on the edge and with no indication that one is a body double. Jackson&apos;s creativity and knowledge of movie trickery is undoubtedly on display here, but the low-rent sickness and bloody gore on display would suggest otherwise. At first it is hard to imagine that Jackson would go on from this to directing one of the best films of all time, but when you look closely, examine just what Jackson could do with no money and no crew, you begin to realise that a true genius was at work here.\n\nBad Taste is a delirious testament to the &apos;just-get-out-there-and-do-it&apos; school of film-making, as that is literally what Jackson did. Shooting whenever he had the money for film stock and making props and special effects in his parent&apos;s garage. Apparently, one of Jackson&apos;s greatest problems was keeping his actors consistent in appearance over the two-year period, making sure haircuts remained the same and that one actor had a permanent five-o&apos;clock shadow. Bad Taste is true to the spirit of independent film-making, one man making the film he wants, when he wants and with whom he wants. In fact, it would never and could never have been made under the supervision of a studio, and even if it had the spirit would have been killed off.\n\nBad Taste works for me because I admire the way in which it is made. When I first saw it I was in my teens and I liked it because it was a demented, gruesome, funny film, so maybe the teen crowd is the right one for Jackson&apos;s brain-eating, vomit-spewing, chuck-up-a-thon, or maybe it&apos;s also for twenty-somethings after a night on the lash. Either way, Bad Taste should be seen as an example that if you want to make a movie and know how - there is usually a way",

The reason I wanted to watch is I want to enjoy Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Justice League to the fullest. You can do that too, as I&apos;m sure this won&apos;t completely disappoint you. It was a little dark, but pacy enough and not slow. The movie wasn&apos;t spectacular but Brandon Ruth definitely was. The story was on the average side, however, since it had its moments, it can&apos;t be considered poor!",

Not only does this film have a strong message behind it, but it also strips away every defense that people can possibly have for inner-city life (some city areas, not all), and shows the unbearably real lives of teenagers today. The characters are real. Usher Raymond (Lester) gives a believable performance of a young adult, simply doing whatever it takes for Ziggy (Robert Ri&apos;chard), a perfectly portrayed teen, escaping from his father and himself through his talents. Forest Whitaker (Officer Dante Jackson) seems to have captured the confusing officer, who was only out for himself at first. Sara Gilbert (Lynn) is without a doubt perfect in her role as an outcast teen who only wants to be wanted, and silently begs for understanding. Stephanie and Rivers (Rosio Dawson and Clifton Collins, Jr.) are well played and well rounded characters. Stephanie, counting the days until graduation and Rivers, who&apos;s motto is &quot;the rules are meant to be broken&quot;. The only character flaw in my opinion was Rodney (Fredro Starr), a painful stereotype. As the movie goes on and the plot becomes more intense, we are slowly exposed to the raw lives of the teens. Ziggy (Ri&apos;chard) is severely abused by his father and has taken refuge in the attic of the school. Lynn (Gilbert) only wanted a kiss from the jerk who got her pregnant. He never kissed her or talked to her after. Lester (Raymond) witnessed police officers shoot his innocent father to death. And Officer Jackson (Whitaker) lost his wife and son. The messages in this movie are clear. Stand up for what you believe in. Give everyone a fighting chance despite their age or race. The darkest people have the darkest secrets. These are messages our country desperately needs to hear, especially now.",

Fellow addict Snake rats out Joey.\n\nThere are good actors doing solid work. This material could be given a more grim style. This represents a slow slide in the quality of director Michael Caton-Jones. This should be a more intense thriller and a more heart-breaking tragedy. I keep thinking that this movie should be better. The biographical nature does muddy the story. There is an overall lack of intensity.",

      "reviewBody": "Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia.  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project.  While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable.  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.\n\nSince film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  I don&apos;t use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance.  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful.  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  Maybe it&apos;s just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer."

      "reviewBody": "These &quot;The Smurfs&quot; movies seem to be nothing more than one of those childish animated, live-action hybrid adaptations of classic cartoons/comics that are obviously made for cash-in and distraction for little(r) audiences, but this sequel kind of hooked me. There is something behind the story that might help this being a little more than another juvenile family fare. We&apos;re not expecting it to become deeper or darker, but the film would&apos;ve think that kids need to earn better lessons or genuine heart in their entertainment other than just feeding them with endless slapstick comedy and pop culture references. The Smurfs 2 had some good potential, but the rest stays mediocre.\n\nThe existence of the film itself was never promising, it still centers in the real world even though there are better things to explore in their magical world. But there is a sense at the first act that may have an actual story to tell. The plot mostly concerns about Smurfette&apos;s true identity, if she really belongs to the Smurfs or go back to her origin as a Naughty. It&apos;s not really meant to be complex, but there would&apos;ve been at least something that could fill the audience&apos;s heart. The best parts are when they are talking about its heartfelt themes, and that is a mild benefit for this film. However, the storyline is still kind of the same by throwing away plenty of childish gags. Aside of its family subtext, some subplots give each of the characters their own random situations. I presume they&apos;re meant for laughs, but they didn&apos;t go anywhere in the end. It&apos;s still a mediocre storytelling which outweighs the bigger picture.\n\nDespite of its superficiality, the filmmaking is as energetic as it has always been. The director once again brings the film&apos;s cartoonish quirks, and the actors are having fun with their roles which also brings it to life. You can see that in Hank Azaria who seems really enjoying playing the evil wizard, Gargamel. The special effects are as good as it gets. I guess there isn&apos;t much else to talk about the technicalities.\n\nThere are things in The Smurfs 2 that could have worked, but the filmmakers stick to their usual way of entertaining kids. It&apos;s nothing new, but this sequel has a better message compared to the first movie, though how the film delivers it didn&apos;t actually help making the whole experience any satisfying or worth telling. In the end, I think children will mostly focus the cute stuff and the characters&apos; random antics than the thematic stuff about family, because at all, those are what this movie is more interested in. Again, The Smurfs 2 doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s destined to be a great film, but diminishing the premise that was set up in beginning can be a disappointment.",

I don&apos;t understand the complaints about Bowie ... he&apos;s cliché, and the accent is horrid, but his scenes are the only ones offering any semblance of entertainment. \n\nBut it&apos;s the dialogue, story, and main actor that kill the film. The main characted give his lines in English, but has clearly been dubbed by a native speaker (unfortunately, not an actor). To call the result &quot;wooden&quot; would give ply-wood a bad name. Attempts to reclassify it as a some sort of intentionally pastiche cult comedy are wishful thinking. Not that the film doesn&apos;t inspire a degree of laughter ...",

      "reviewBody": "In the near future, corporate customers can save time on air travel by jumping into other bodies for short periods of time.  Despite being unwilling, Toffler jumps into a body in order to attend a meeting in San Francisco.  However, when it comes to returning to his old body he is told that his body has been stolen by the terrorist who had been in the body he jumped into.  Toffler jumps into a clone in order to escape and, with a temporary body decomposing over 54 hours, he sets out to find Fisk and reclaim his body.\n\nIn the near future, body switching is possible for the rich, id badges tell everyone who you are, High Fidelity is playing at the cinema, but yet nobody has ever seen the film Face/Off.  Yes - this is the future as seen in a low budget movie.  Alarm bells rang for me when the credits revealed that this was, yes, a film who&apos;s main cast were Baldwin, MacLachlan and Coates! Happily though, it wasn&apos;t actually that bad, just rather unexciting and uninspiring.  The plot has promise but it doesn&apos;t deliver it well enough. Face/Off had the same basic plot but it moved much quicker and slicker than this.  The problem is that the plot feels too baggy and ill thought out with too much that isn&apos;t fully expanded on.  This wouldn&apos;t be a major problem if the film moved slickly and with a lot of energy.\n\nSadly, it doesn&apos;t.  The film has the odd exciting moment but generally it lacks tension and is a bit too slow and talky.  Three times the film falls back on needless sex scenes in an attempt to give the audience what it came for.  The conclusion of the film is obvious and, for that reason, lacks punch.  It&apos;s a shame because, even with a low budget and less-than-perfect effects, the film could still have been exciting if the director had done a better job with the pacing of the film; as it is he delivers it too slowly.\n\nThe good ideas flicker up along the way - the best being near the end as Toffler&apos;s disregard for his cloned body becomes useful, but generally it is quite lacklustre.  Even though the cast suggested worse, they were actually reasonably good.  Coates is always watchable and, don&apos;t worry, after a brief spell as the good buy he soon changes to the bad guy role.  MacLachlan seems to have taken the role just as a cameo and a chance to have a sex scene. Baldwin is slumming and it shows a bit too often.  He is OK for the film but he didn&apos;t have that much in the way of charisma; sure he played more than one character, but he still wasn&apos;t all that hot.\n\nOverall this is not as bad a film as I have maybe put across here.  If you have rented it as a cheapy video or are watching it on a low rent cable station, then you probably know what&apos;s in store.  As such, it works OK but it is still hard to overlook a plot that could have been tighter and a film that really needed a lot more in the way of tension and excitement to keep it going.  Worth watching if you&apos;re in the mood."

      "reviewBody": "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge directed by the prolific Shohei Imamura follows the life of Yosuke Sasano played by Koji Yakusho. The film has many rich layers and mythic qualities. After losing his job, Yosuke seeks advice from a vagrant wise man name Taro, played by Kazuo Kitamura. Taro ultimately sends Yosuke on a quest to find a hidden golden budda statue. Itfs not so much the statue thatfs important we learn when Yosuke travels to a small fishing village to a house beside the red bridge where we meet Saeko Aizawa who befriends Yosuke to releases her body of water from her very strange condition.\n\nThe filling water in Saeko body symbolizes her loneliness and her heaviness of heart to find someone in her life. The gag where Yosuke relieves Seikofs water is fun the first time but soon becomes repetitive. The characters in the story are disjointed from each other but this is not nessearly a bad thing since Imamura has so much to show us. For instance there is a subplot involving an African marathon runner which is used clearly  for comic relief but and has nothing to do with the rest of the story. But its characters like this that adds multiple dimensions to the story that really make it memorable.\n\nOne thing that confused me was that there was a scene of Saeko almost drowned in the river when she was small and it makes audience imagine that it was probably the cause of flood in her body. However, in the end of the movie we will know that her grandma also had the same sexual predisposition contradicting the river scene.\n\nOverall the film is worth watching for the quirkiness of the characters. A man who just lost his job, homeless people, fishermen, a senile old lady, an African marathon runner, there are a lot of unique characters in this movie. They are people at the bottom of the Japanese social pyramid and something we usually do not see in the movie. The story is a kind of silly, erotic, and funny. Although not a perfect film the fountain spewing sex scenes will be remembered for a long time."

      "reviewBody": "Laugh your arse off. This hilarious documentary is a real eye opener if you don&apos;t your history of the war on marajuana. The long and stupid war on the weed is just one of many misteps by the U.S. government that the mainstream media seems to ignore!?! I saw this at the Music Box theater downtown Chicago which only added to the fun. As a documentary though it missed a couple of things. It forgot to mention William Randolph Hearst&apos;s deep involvment with the war. He did after all run the huge media conglomorate that supported Anslinger&apos;s view. Hearst went on to be portrayed unflatteringly in Citizen Kane. There is barely a mention of Reagan/Bush/Clinton the trio of presidents who have more to fight this unwinnable war then any of their preddosessors. No mention of the fact that Hemp plants were indeed grown by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Andrew Jackson. The last three grew it on the White House lawn!!! As a documentary however it seems a bit one sided and therefore guilty of the very thing anti drug people are. But then again Freedom is a one sided thing, you either have it or you don&apos;t. The movie is also a bit biased in that it puts marajuana on a pedistal and ignores the fact that even though harsher drugs like cocaine and heroin are harmful, laws against them are completely and totally unconstitutional. Makes you think though, if the U.S. government is so eager to abuse their power like this, is it really a great idea to repeal the second amendment or limit it in so many way? Now I&apos;m sounding preachy. Go see this movie with some friends, have a jay outside, and laugh at highlights from old movies like Reefer Madness, and Up In Smoke. Laugh at the directors keen sense of ironic humor. And remember that what you know just might kill you."

      "reviewBody": "Scott Howard is on a basketball team of no-hopers (himself included), is outside of the &quot;cool pack&quot; at highschool and can&apos;t seem to even get close to the girls he is interested in. He also is going through some &quot;changes&quot; in his life – with his body doing odd things. The nature of these become clear to him when he transforms into a werewolf. Horrified to find that this runs in his family, Scott tries to control it but when he loses his temper in a basketball game he changes – to the stunned silence of the crowd and players. When he then wins the game he wins everyone over (well, most of them) and finds that the attention, acceptance and coolness that he craved are now his to have. However can he have this without it going to his head or becoming a novelty more than a person?\n\nMy girlfriend insisted that we watch Teen Wolf Too recently because neither of us had seen it. Having suffered through that I then rewatched the original film as it had been about twenty years since I last saw it. This should be kept in mind because, my enjoyment of the first film was unquestionably influenced by how poor the sequel was – indeed I need to keep this in mind while writing because I should not be praising Teen Wolf simply for not being as bad as the film that followed it. So, Teen Wolf is not a great film. It is a basic story that mixes teen coming-of-age films with the sports cliché and throws in the werewolf legend to make it a bit different. It does what you expect it to, ending with the moral lesson and sporting climax that you know is coming from about 10 minutes into it. Unlike the sequel though the film does have scenes that link the various stages of the film, so it feels like a story rather than squares on a board game where you are either in one or the other, never between. This gives it a better flow and makes it feel like we have something to go along with rather than making jumps.\n\nThe film is never really hilarious but it does have a certain charm to it that makes it quite fun to watch. It badly needs laughs but the set-pieces and the moments of plot do help keep it engaging. A big part of this is Fox himself – he is a personable actor and he brings that easy charm to this film. He works well and is well supported by the cute Ursitti, while Levine&apos;s Styles works a bit better than his counterpart in the sequel – ie he is less annoying even if he is not really funnier. Holton is just a comedy fat guy with no comedy to deliver while Hampton is just solid as the father. Nobody si brilliant but they are OK, with Fox leading the way well.\n\nNot a great film by any means, Teen Wolf does have a certain charm to it. It needs more laughs to it but there is fun to be had and the plot at least flows rather than stutters and, in Fox and Ursitti, the cast make it a bit more engaging than the material should be."

It&apos;s something like the experience of looking into the fire in the fireplace on a cold evening. But it is more like doing that along with someone special while listening to a sultry version of &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot;; just completely different though.\n\nSee it! When I saw this motion picture with the &quot;Movies 101&quot; group in NYC, it was plain from the audience reaction that lots of people adored it with me.",

      "reviewBody": "Ten years ago, after being accused of a hideous murder of a mother and her twin daughters, Sean Veil (Lee Evans) became paranoid, filming himself along twenty-four hours a day to have an alibi if necessary. The small time psychologist Saul Seger (Ian McNeice) became a famous forensic profiler and writer with the case and every now and then he accuses Sean Veil of the crime. The reporter Katie Carter (Rachel Stirling) believes in Sean&apos;s innocence. When the body of the missing Mary Shaw is found, Sean has to prove where he was five years ago. However, the tapes that can prove that he is not guilty have mysteriously disappeared from the storage shelf and Sean suspects that Saul has stolen them to incriminate him.\n\nThe dark, intriguing and original &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; is a great surprise. This low-budget movie has a very weird and confused beginning, with a bizarre character and an eerie but stylish cinematography, but it is worthwhile watching it if the viewer likes independent movies. The interpretation of Lee Evans is great with his paranoid character following his own rules of behavior. There are many twists and a surprising end. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Cena do Crime&quot; (&quot;The Crime Scene&quot;)",

And what an opulent setting they are placed in! Lester and his cohorts have created a film in which almost every frame resembles a museum painting come to life (and gone berserk.)\n\nLester is better with style than relating a narrative. I found it impossible to completely comprehend the story line here, and I think if you asked most people what the movie was about, they&apos;d tell you there was a lot of swashbuckling and general mayhem and lunacy, but I doubt they&apos;d give you much of Dumas&apos; story. When the style is this good, however, a little fuzziness on the substance is not a fatal flaw. Still, it might keep this picture from being an all-time classic rather than &quot;just&quot; a most enjoyable film.\n\nLester is such an auteur that his direction is the main focus of this film even with such an all-star cast. It was a wise decision (actually it seems like a no-brainer) to divide what was originally shot at one time into two films, this one and &apos;The Four Musketeers.&apos; There really can be too much of a good thing, and even at under two hours, &apos;The Three Musketeers&apos; threatens to be overwhelming. But on balance this film is great entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "This less well known &apos;60s Italian Comedy is the attempt to translate into a movie one of the greatest books Italian contemporary literature has to offer: Luciano Bianciardi&apos;s &quot;La Vita Agra&quot;.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Luciano Bianchi, an intellectual coming from a provincial area of Italy, moving to Milan after a mine accident killed some of his friends and co-workers. Milan in the is the symbol of the economic growth and increasingly wealthy lifestyle that characterised Italy&apos;s in the 60s, and Luciano&apos;s life changes dramatically: he leaves his wife and kids behind, gets a new job and falls in love with Anna, a young and lefty journalist.\n\nCarlo Lizzani modified the story told by the book in many crucial parts, and making it more suitable for a movie, he took away the most touching and extraordinary features of the book: the cruel irony, the sense of disillusionment, the struggle between personal ethics and the real world during the economic boom.\n\nA decent movie, but I definetly recommend to read the book (it&apos;s available on translation). It&apos;s my favourite book ever, by the way.",

      "reviewBody": "Any movie that takes place over the course of just one day can tend to drag unless it&apos;s filled with non-stop action. This film is no exception. If you love Acting with a capital &quot;A&quot; over Action, this is your film.\n\nWhat makes this a movie worth seeing are the actors; Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Harris, and Jack Ward all turn in supreme performances. Even the bit parts are well-written and equally well-acted. The dialogue is sharp, witty and sadly comic. \n\nDustin Hoffman plays a highly successful songwriter who suffers from insomnia and the dementia it brings as he looks back on the relationships he&apos;s had throughout his life, hoping to break his loneliness. \n\nHoffman does an excellent job of portraying a creative genius, one whose creativity is so abundant he seems unable to turn it off. In most of the scenes, Hoffman is strumming a guitar, singing under his breath, presumably writing a new song with each emotion he feels at any given moment. Because the music that flows through him occupies so much of his brain, he seems unable to focus on human relationships and by middle age the loneliness catches up with him.\n\nHoffman drifts in and out of reality. Deciding which scenes are real, and which are his imagination is up to the viewer. Or as Hoffman tells his psychiatrist &quot;Why should I come back to reality? What&apos;s it ever done for me?&quot;\n\nIt should also be noted that as much as Simon and Garfunkel did for &quot;The Graduate,&quot; so does this film&apos;s soundtrack accentuate the overall feel of the movie with music from Ray Charles and Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show."

I can understand why most of you people didn&apos;t like it because he made this especially for his children who are under 13. I loved his little Italian accent and I thought he looked so cute. I went with my dad (who&apos;s in his 40&apos;s) and my 10 year-old sister and they both laughed! My sister was laughing out loud and there were some parts that I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. I think I laughed the hardest at the Turtle Guy part. I really liked the guy from India who was charming the snake. I loved the voice he used. Yeah, this movie ain&apos;t nothing like the work he did on Saturday Night Live but he does use his talent here and I just enjoyed it. I laughed and that&apos;s what Dana wanted the people to do when they saw this movie. It was so great.  Oh, and I will own this movie when it comes out on video!!!"

      "reviewBody": "South Africa as it Lives and Breathes This film was written, directed and shot in and around Cape Town. Most of the scenes take place on location in a black township called Langa, where a young boy seeks to connect with his dead father by learning about his life as a very successful jazz saxophone player. Despite his mother&apos;s determination to keep him away from the bars and the liquor that is so much of the jazz world, young Felix fights back and finds support in the community. The film is notably written, directed and edited by women and offers a happy production that can appeal to family audiences and those who are just curious about the world of South Africa now, twenty years since the election of Mandela. Both the child actors and the older musicians offer amazing talent and the film has already been recognized for several international awards. Note that some of the film requires reading subtitles, but the youngsters in the audience I saw it with, didn&apos;t seem to miss a beat.",

There are resemblances especially the school setting and the Elvis haircuts but this is based on another manga.\n\nThe film, which takes place in the present day, follows several young men as they enter as first year students in a secret Samurai School that trains the elite of Japan&apos;s society. The students are tormented as part of their training and any defiance against the teachers is punished by weird tortures. Some of the people in the school have incredible powers, one for example can cut stone in two from a distance with his sword. Several of the new students start to create a bond with other when an expelled student from the past returns with an army of super-fighters who defeat all the older students and several of the teachers. It leads to a death match where only the new students are left to defend the honor of the school. \n\nAs much a spoof of Japanese stock characters as about Japanese notions about &quot;being a man&quot;, the film is fun and moves along at a good pace. The production is very good looking and the actors are all over the top. The action is decent and the humor works for this westerner. It&apos;s a little over long as the final battle starts to resemble a TV wrestling match where the fighters are hamming it up for the audience but you might like it.",

Although this is seen as a detraction from the whole by some who have seen it, I believe that Welles&apos; deft directing and penetrating acting is what makes this a Welles film for my taste.  He was never a facile actor - but he uses his usual wooden countenance here to the advantage of this role.\n\nAnother thing that fascinates me is the underrated status of this engrossing thriller.  The action and suspense builds and builds to a peak of excitement that few movies can reach without lots of special effects and Foley work these days.  This movie fascinates at every turn without ever seeming as if we are watching art.  But art it was in Welles&apos; direction and gentle handling of the unravelling.\n\nEdward G. Robinson is the subtle but welcome prize we receive from this outing.  The undercurrents of the horrors that have just come before this movie was made and its actions can be seen seething within his duty to find hidden Nazis.  He is methodical and intelligent, it so difficult to see the difference between Robinson the man and Robinson the actor here.  He is such a talent that we often mistake his ease for something else but acting -- and of acting he was a master.  Plainly seen here as a gift to all of us.\n\nWhat I like about this and many other good films is how facts are revealed slowly, layer by layer.  \n\nLoretta Young was good as the innocent young girl who believes that marriage is a sacred institution, that life has a course to follow which will not be derailed and finds it hard to accept the truth of the horrors behind her marriage.\n\nIt was mildly amusing to see a very young Richard Long as the open-minded young man with whom Robinson&apos;s character confides certain facts.\n\nI recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers, mysteries and of course, of Mr. Orson Welles.  So sad that the studio heads were such disingenuous towards this utter genius of a man who deserved more earnest accolades in his life.\n\nTHE STRANGER is not glittering masterpiece but it&apos;s a hell of great story that I do not tire of watching...and seeing each piece of the puzzle fall into place.\n\nWhat MORE could an intelligent person want from a movie?",

However, you may want to do it in bits, and ponder what you&apos;ve seen. That it&apos;s a German film will not enter into the equation since there is virtually no dialogue. Sound.\n\nFREE ONLINE -- Yes.",

This is another one of those teen as secret agent movies which are aimed at kids yet this doesn&apos;t have the tone of a kids movie due to the profanity and deaths. There is a scene involving a payed escort! Just what age group is this for? Its too silly for older kids but clearly not kid friendly. It seems to be an attempt at a send up of James Bond movies based on the score which must be the worst I have ever heard, its one man on a cheap sounding synth playing an obvious 007 rip off. It has no excitement, tension or humour to speak of. Not sure that the MST3K guys could have made this one watchable. Seriously just avoid.",

Some kind of a poor man&apos;s Peter Cushing or even Christopher Lee, I nevertheless love this actor in such lousy but so good looking psychotronic stuff from the early sixties. The inspiration from KING KONG is so obvious that I won&apos;t insist on it. It is fun, amazingly entertaining, the perfect non intellectual time waster that you can wait for; but of course the new generation of movie buffs will hardly appreciate. Me, on the contrary, am always a bit attached to this poor chimp, this innocent little animal who will become some kind of evil beast.... The contrast between both of those images move me, it is so sad, despite the quality of this assumed B movie."

      "reviewBody": "A genuinely lovely comedy. Very enjoyable. The way this film deals with racism is softened by its lightness. Probably, as a drama, it could have been almost painful to watch. The actors are all superb. The tempo never sags. The issues at hand are quite explosive: Irrepressible adultery, interracial couple, violence against women, outdated macho mores, women dominated by men--nowadays!!-- and more.\n\nBut all this, as said before, treated as a light comedy. Fast and witty dialog, interspersed with some French and an African language that I, shamefully must confess, don&apos;t know its name.\n\nSome very funny moments, like the one most remarkable to me when we see the black help working in the kitchen, having heard what it&apos;s all about, laughs openly, utterly delighted by the whole conundrum going on in the living room.\n\nTop notch! \n\nIt&apos;s fantastic to see how, even when nowadays we consider ourselves SO modern, the knowledge of a wife or husband having an extramarital affair, can bring down our confidence in seconds and practically destroys us.\n\nWhy in the world can&apos;t we understand that maybe --MAYBE-- the other half of the couple has some needs that we cannot fulfill? \n\nSome need that he or she finds in another human being that fits perfectly into that void and completes, as a triangle, a situation that wasn&apos;t perfect to start with? Neither this man or this woman desires to leave their official family.\n\nThey would be contented with having their respective affair parallel to their marriage. But that is not possible. The humiliated &apos;half&apos; cries vengeance! And this way the whole structure collapses under so much pressure from all sides. \n\nThe end of the movie is very good. Life is something that we experience only ONCE, so, you better live NOW, before it&apos;s too late!",

Anyway, this is one heck of a forgotten romantic comedy from the early nineties, that definitely deserves more attention, because it still stands strong to this very day.\n\nIt&apos;s a romantic comedy the way the French would make them, meaning that there is lots of subtle play and wit. The story: French citizen Gerard Depardieu needs an American working permit and tries to get it by getting into a fake marriage with the lovely American Andy McDowell.\n\nThe good: it&apos;s simply splendidly acted and directed. With lots of energy and flair. Any bad? There is a bit of a dull middle part of the story in which nothing much happens, but the end is wonderfully enticing again. Gives me goosebumps and I am usually not someone who is easily charmed by romcoms. Highly recommended!",

But even that has a sour taste, because while they do look ordinary, most of what they do cannot be called ordinary. You also get to see issues that actually aren&apos;t really problems or shouldn&apos;t be handled the way the are being handled in the movie.\n\nThere are some other issues too (some weird acting choices amongst them, comedy does not always work, cardboard cut out side characters and some other things). There is always the issue with the ending. It&apos;s not only over dramatized to a point, where some might go &quot;come one&quot;, but also more than just predictable. Which is all in all a shame, because while I listed some negatives, there are some refreshing things going on and you can feel how much fun the actors had doing this ...",

      "reviewBody": "Robert Taylor doesn&apos;t ace every scene but he gives a more than credible performance as Johnny Eager, an inventive pragmatic and violent when called for gangster trying to open a legit dog track from behind the scenes. In order to avoid being a parole violator Eager pretends to drive a cab while he masterminds the track deal paying off cops and officials to smooth things. Some officials can&apos;t be bought however and a judge (Edward Arnold) with a deep seeded resentment of Eager whom he refers to as &quot;Thief&quot; and humiliates blocks his license. The coldly practical Eager circumvents the problem by compromising the judge&apos;s daughter (Lana Turner) but loses his balance on the tightrope he&apos;s walking when he falls hard for her dame.\n\nEager has a crisper look than most noirs and director Mervyn LeRoy deftly handles the storyline and avoids run of the mill by injecting minor but telling incidentals that indicate Johnny&apos;s slow transformation. Suspense scenes are well edited and mise en scene is busy and filled with pertinent detail.\n\nWhile Bogart might seem an apt choice to play Eager I doubt he could have played it with the same nervous authoritative energy or insecurity Taylor does here. Most of all he lacks Taylor&apos;s good looks which are crucial to romancing Lana Turner. The glamorous Ms. Turner is at first a little hard to believe as a student studying social work but she does acquit herself well in some powerfully dramatic scenes with Taylor. Paul Stewart, Glenda Farrell and Edward Arnold chip in fine supporting performances while Van Heflin delivers a magnificent one. Heflin as Eager&apos;s alcoholic sidekick and pickled conscience is not only effectively moving but also lends a droll sense of wit to the film with his sardonic observations.",

They may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know that it is animated, but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike.",

During the Musulman invasion of Italy, Flavia becomes the lover of their Muslin leader Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) and uses him to revenge against the nuns that have humiliated her and her father. \n\nI was curious to see this 1978 movie of nunsploitation, not because I am fan of this subgenre of exploitation film, but because of the Brazilian Florinda Bolkan. &quot;Flavia, la Monaca Musulmana&quot; is a brutal nunsploitation, associating the usual themes of sexual repression and religious oppression with revenge. There is no historical background and most of the situations are only pretext for nudity, torture and violence. Now I am satisfied but this film is only recommended to very specific audiences since it is very offensive specially for religious viewers. In the Extras of the DVD, there is an interview with Florinda Bolkan. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Flávia, a Freira Muçulmana&quot; (&quot;Flavia, the Muslin Nun&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "What&apos;s the first behavior rule when you&apos;re visiting a faraway continent  particularly Asia, Africa or South America  that culturally speaking differs a lot from your own? Duh, don&apos;t interfere with local religious movements and/or voodoo cults, because they WILL come after you and they WILL find you, even when you consider yourself to be safe back home again. &quot;Cult of the Cobra&quot; is a charming and fairly entertaining 50&apos;s occult thriller, but it&apos;s certainly nothing special or unique. In fact, the plot is quite derivative of the Jacques Tourneur/Val Lewton classic &quot;Cat People&quot; (undeniably one of the greatest horror milestones ever made), since both stories revolve gorgeous women living with the ability  or is it curse?  to transform into a deadly animal. Six American members of the same Air Force unit spend a few touristy days in an Asian country (my best guess would be either India or Malaysia) and bluntly pay a snake charmer big money to secretly attend a gathering of the infamous Lamian cult, of which the members supposedly change themselves in snakes and back. Naturally they get caught, when the dumbest boy of them all takes a photograph, and only narrowly escape. Unaware they&apos;ve been placed under a curse, the six friends start being killed off one by one when back in the United State. Moreover, the mysterious accidents began simultaneously with Tom acquaintance with an introvert exotic beauty living across the hall. &quot;Cult of the Cobra&quot; benefits the most from Faith Domergue&apos;s performance as the oddly seductive Lisa (she&apos;s a lot better here than she was in &quot;This Island Earth&quot; or &quot;It Came from beneath the Sea&quot;) and a couple of imaginative camera gimmicks, like for example snake POV shots and nice use of shadow effects. Unfortunately, there are also several overlong and tedious scenes and not a single one of the male protagonists deserves any of your sympathy. Especially Tom is a pretty loathsome guy, since his behavior is obtrusive and aggressive towards women and jealous towards his own friends.",

The documentary comprises interviews, the interviewees&apos; lives, and their live performances. While the interviewees do not know each other, their experiences are similar: born and raised in a predominantly white neighborhood, being only one black person in a local punk scene, dating almost exclusively white boys/girls due to the interest proximity, admiring legendary black punk band Bad Brains, and trying to establish and maintain their ties to the black community. \n\nAccording to the director, the film has been appreciated by both the mainstream black audience and the mainstream (mostly white) punk audience, as well as by comparatively small black groups in the alternative art scene. But you have to be neither punk nor black to appreciate the film; it has universal appeal to anyone who feels that they are different from what they are supposed to be.",

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s one of those films that wears you out. By the end, you&apos;re exhausted. I really liked this the first two times but three viewings were enough. By then, the absurdity of the whole thing had fried what few brain cells I have left.\n\nRay Liotta is excellent as the psycho serial killer who puts on a charming Ted Bundy-like appearance for a short while before publicly showing his insanity. He&apos;s fascinating, start to finish here, even providing some very humorous lines. \n\nI wish I could say I enjoyed the other people in here but, except for Ben Cross, I couldn&apos;t. Lauren Holly, the female star of the film, is decent for much of the &quot;ride&quot; but becomes annoying and totally non-believable in the final phase of the film, becoming out-of-character profane and nasty herself. (Of course, her flight did turn out to be a tiny bit stressful which might have affected her patience. ha ha)\n\nOf course, with a film like this, there are going to be some severe questions with credibility, but when did that ever stop filmmakers? Other reviewers in here have already detailed some of the non--sensible parts, so no need to dwell on that. This is not brainfood: it&apos;s just escapist entertainment for a night, something to show your girlfriend so she&apos;ll hold onto you during all the suspense!\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the special effects, especially with the plane smashing a few buildings, and the sound was awesome, at least on the DVD. For much of the flight, they are flying through a storm and the rumbles form the shaking airliner, was dramatic.",

      "reviewBody": "This picture illustrates everything wonderful about the confidence, expertise and narrative power of Hollywood films near the end of the classic period: it is entertaining, intelligent and carefully made in every department. A smooth celebration of scientific theory and of the romantic partnership of two scientists.\n\nThe first third of the film is in many ways the best: a very funny and sensitive depiction of the courtship of two gauche scientists. Often filmed in long-shot on beautifully detailed, cavernous sets, we see Garson and Pigeon sometimes isolated in space, sometimes haltingly moving through crowds, tentatively finding their way to each other. Though Mervyn Leroy could be a stolid director, here he shows great delicacy and judgment and he perfectly sets a mood of gentle comic romance.\n\nThe middle third deals with the engrossing scientific mystery that led to the discovery of radium. The lightness of touch and the humor of the first third are not entirely abandoned here, but there is a greater seriousness and a kind of reverence for knowledge and scientific endeavor that is virtually absent from films today (the exception would be A BEAUTIFUL MIND, which I kind of hated). There are some striking visuals, including a tracking shot across hundreds of bowls of evaporating chemicals and a haunting image of a glowing dish of radium in a large, dark shed.\n\nThe last third is the dullest and most conventional portion of the film: fame and celebration for the Curies and a renewal of their love just before Pierre died prematurely in a traffic accident. The high point here is what surely won Pigeon his Oscar nomination for Best Actor: the speech to a jeweler in which he describes the beauty of his wife just before his untimely death. There is also the evocative image of a wet umbrella broken under a wagon wheel.\n\nOf course, what you think of this idealistic, creamy and sure-footed vehicle (which must have packed &apos;em in at Radio City Music Hall) depends entirely on what you think of Greer Garson, as well as your opinion of the popular Garson-Pigeon screen team. Their looks and personalities were perfect matches, templates of feminine and masculine &apos;virtues&apos;. There was nothing sexy about them but they suggested a platonic ideal of what every child would wish their parents to be. They were the last stars to make middle age look glamorous and desirable.\n\nAs for me, I like her. Her mannerisms are kept to a minimum in this restrained performance. The famous tinkling laugh, the arched eyebrow, the flaring nostrils -- so overused in some other films -- are not much in evidence here. But her best qualities are: the sense of intelligence, of quiet watchfulness, self-possession, dignity and tact are all here. The source of her screen personality has always seemed sane and tranquil, relaxing to watch and finally, to me, admirable. I can understand why some people (like critic Pauline Kael) felt that Hollywood&apos;s ladylike stars presented an outdated, oppressive ideal for women. But from this distance, Garson&apos;s confidence and ease, her capability, her self-containment all strike me as civilized and even sophisticated traits. She played grownups, and we have never had enough of those on screen . . ."

      "reviewBody": "History teacher Mrs Tingle seems to have it in for student Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship. She receives another low grade from Tingle, which doesn&apos;t help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag, Mrs. Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it, but he&apos;s not available. So before she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. However due to Tingle&apos;s stubbornness, that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out.\n\nWasn&apos;t fan of it when I first saw it, and after another viewing, I&apos;m still not one. Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; &apos;Scream (1996)&apos;, &apos;I Know What You did Last Summer (1997)&apos;, &apos;Scream 2 (1997)&apos; and &apos;The Faculty (1998)&apos;. He was riding the success (also not to forget the TV show &apos;Dawson&apos;s Creek), but this project would be the final bump. The difference there, compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay, he was also making his debut in directing. The strange thing though, was that I found his direction to be competently done, but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. It seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller, without making it gel. The script is cluttered with quick-wit, on-going gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films, but the problem is that it&apos;s too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. The fractured script had to be more strong and potent, since it&apos;s a small-scale production that feels like you&apos;re watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. It tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to only serve the story&apos;s poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. The film&apos;s ending takes the cake. Williamson&apos;s polished direction is sound, but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. You eventually feel it after the halfway mark, and it shows up how minor the story is. The performances are tolerable enough, although if it weren&apos;t for Helen Mirren&apos;s classy, icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as Mrs. Tingle and a buoyant Marisa Coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack packs enough energy, but I found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices.\n\nWatchable, but mechanical all round.",

Army of Darkness was funnier than the first two Evil Dead films, and had a lot more comedy. It was a slam bang from the opening scene, and a perfect ending to this amazing trilogy. Bruce Campbell shows that he is the man and now on the list of my favorite movie heroes. Sam Raimi knows how to make the perfect horror/comedy and he does not fail to deliver yet again a horror film that is perhaps funnier than most comedies out there. All in all, another spectacular entry into this trilogy, and I think even better than Evil Dead 2 and on par with the first for different reasons."

      "reviewBody": "THE PRINCESS COMES ALONG is a comedy/mystery that unfortunately splits itself in the middle rather than being a mix of both genres throughout the film. It stars Carole Lombard as a girl from Brooklyn who while in England somehow manages to persuade film producers that she is a Princess Olga of Sweden, is signed to a contract and on her way to America to make movies. The movie opens with the excited passengers and press eager to see the Princess board the ship (just how this ruse is successfully pulled off strains credibility, Sweden, after all is a major nation, and surely any allegations that a Princess was going to enter pictures would have quickly been denied and disproved).\n\nFred MacMurray is a popular bandleader who is also on board and takes a shine to the Princess, attempting to romance her. She is indifferent but when a blackmailer is found dead in her room she becomes warmer to MacMurray&apos;s offer of friendship as he and buddy William Frawley remove the body. That still means a murder is loose on board and there&apos;s more mayhem in the works before the killer is revealed.\n\nThis movie starts out an engaging 1930&apos;s romantic comedy with Lombard deliciously parodying Garbo as the faux Royal Highness. Alas, the movie literally turns deadly after the murder and it&apos;s pretty much a straightforward murder mystery with a surprise that isn&apos;t much of a surprise if you&apos;ve seen movies of this nature. Nevertheless, the cast does very well with the material, particularly the young Fred MacMurray, quite dashing in his late twenties, and the delicious character actress Alison Skipworth, here cast as the Princess&apos; haughty traveling companion but in truth another unemployed actress and of course the always great Lombard. Months after their triumph in MY MAN GODFREY, Lombard is reunited with Mischa Auer with the latter in a small role as the Russian detective, one of several international detectives who just so happen to be all traveling on board. THE PRINCESS COMES ALONG is not one of the better Lombard films but it&apos;s a pleasant 90 minutes and worth at least one viewing."

      "reviewBody": "One is always keen to seek out productions that class themselves as low-budget and high quality. Clearly shot on DV, Song Of Songs has its unwatchable phases and some watchable - I am guessing its partly to do with style/mainly to do with lack of lighting...but thats just one of the uncomfortable aesthetics. Am certain that this is a film aimed at the core audience strong on the Jewish contingent and will of course stir some controversy given its subject matter. However, when dealing with such subject matters, it is important to consider having more subplots and strands so as to be more engrossing rather than off putting which it clearly is...maybe its far too cerebral/intellectual for its own good. The performances are generally okay but nothing write home about. The producer and director must be congratulated for embarking on this brave step and am certain that if more attention had been paid to two or three more integral characters, this film would beat with a stronger heart and express a more emotive cinematic atmosphere.",

The scenery is stunning, the colours of Morrocco vibrant and the glimpse into another culture is well executed.  A fine film to watch if you want visual stimulation, but don&apos;t wish to concentrate on a complex story.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot;, like most comedy films, creates a sort of alternative reality dimension in which the characters are more bumbling and strange, behave completely unlike anybody would have in real life, and produce jokes that only the audience finds effective. And unlike others I can think of, &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; does this very well. James Garner plays a take-it-easy man &quot;on his way to Australia&quot; who stops to take his first job ever as a lawman in a boomtown somewhere, sometime in the Old West. And right from the beginning, things really start to get awkward.\n\nGarner shares the screen with other popular and talented actors such as Jack Elam, Harry Morgan, Walter Brennan, Joan Hackett, Gene Evans, and Bruce Dern. I felt the performances were very well-done, most noticeable for Harry Morgan as the town&apos;s loud-speaking, acting-before-thinking mayor and Jack Elam as Garner&apos;s reluctantly appointed deputy, having been &quot;promoted&quot; from &quot;shoveling horse...working around the stables.&quot; Walter Brennan did a sort of parody on some of his other villainous characters, still maintaining a good performance and still being a comical character without making any of the modern &quot;funny&quot; tactics such as acting out of the ordinary.\n\nThat goes for the entire film. Even though it&apos;s a comedy and nothing in this film would really happen in a sane world of sane people, it makes it look as if it COULD happen. That&apos;s the problem with comedy films nowadays: they don&apos;t make things look like they MIGHT happen. This film does.\n\nBottom line, I recommend &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; for its outstanding way of blending two quite contrary genres and still making a very effective and entertaining film. I found myself laughing several times and this is definitely the kind of film to suit an entire family just looking for a good, non-serious film that does not taking cliché or distasteful tactics in order to try and make us crack up.",

He is chosen to participate in an experiment and is given treatments to boost his IQ. Alice Kinninan (Claire Bloom) plays one of the scientists who helps Charly to learn. Charly is based on the story Flowers For Algernon and the screenplay was by Stirling Silliphant (In The Heat of the Night.) Cliff Robertson won a best actor Oscar for Charly. The film is intelligent, poignant, and extremely moving. You&apos;ll need a box a Kleenex with your popcorn for this one."

He learns to survive in a different culture and he learns to deal with discrimination. First Alou has to learn to speak Spanish, and then he learns how to navigate himself around the new land without being caught by the police or cheated by others.  Alou makes friends; they are mainly other illegal aliens who survive by helping each other out.  He also finds romance with a Spanish girl.\n\nAs Alou struggles to make a living, he writes positive letters to his parents at home about his new life in Spain.  LAS CARTAS DE ALOU can be the story of many faceless and nameless illegal immigrants in any country.",

The drum&apos;s spirit makes sure the band members keep their vows towards their group and that the tradition coming back from generations would be preserved. It is up to one young man, who manages to create a special bond with the spirit, to honor all those who give their lives for the music.\n\nIt is a simple story full of color and traces of beautiful music. You really start caring for the characters while they make efforts to keep themselves faithful to the band and, at the same time, wishing for better days. It is also a story of love and loyalty with transitions of violent and bloody scenes which, strangely enough, feel natural to the melodic pace of the movie.\n\nThe movie is not perfect and has several flaws and weaknesses but it is, in the end, a really nice, original and enjoyable film.",

So tired of watching homogenized films about stealing the groom from the bride; cheating on the bride-to-be while on a road-trip in wine country; the sad/depressed bridesmaid/maid-of-honor tragically gets dumped by her escort; blah-blah-blah. What this film offers us instead is something in the eyes of four Af-Am buddies who get together before one of them ties the knot. And there are no race cards pulled. The film does not zero on one of the characters and their drug/alcohol problem, or gang-related problemos, or any stereotypical stuff like that. No- what Malcolm Lee did instead was deliver us with an ensemble cast who just happen to be black, mix in a smooth R &amp; B soundtrack with it and a give us a fun premise.\n\nIt&apos;s simple: Harper (Diggs) is on the brink of publishing his first novel with characters loosely based on his friends from college. He flies to New York to get together with his buddies before attending his friend&apos;s wedding. During that time, he encounters an old flame that got away; the changes in ideology and values with others. But on the night of the bachelor party, Lance (Chestnut) gets his paws on a copy and reads it, puzzling together the composites while blaming Diggs for cheating with his fiancée.\n\nTaye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Terrence Dashon Howard, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun, Sanaa Lathan, and the rest of all the cast get the fattest props because without their acting, this would&apos;ve been a train wreck. What makes these characters so unique and human is that they&apos;re not stereotypical caricature&apos;s and each of them all evolve their own style. Taye Diggs is the quiet pragmatist of them all, yet he&apos;s no dork. Morris Chestnut is Lance the football &quot;player&quot;/groom-to-be. Harold Perrineau is the hopelessly, pathetically whipped brother-man with heart and Terrence Dashon Howard (from this year&apos;s &quot;Crash&quot;)steals every scene he&apos;s in as the cynical but cool cat musician buddy. Nia Long is the former flame of Taye Diggs with Sanaa Lathan as his girlfriend.\n\nYeah, the story is a little predictable. Yeah, it&apos;s a little lewd and sexist (the scene at the poker table, but I love those lines: &quot;Bite it!&quot;, &quot;Grow it!&quot;). The very ending is something we&apos;ve seen before, yet it&apos;s funny anyway. Only problem was that this film was probably labeled as a &quot;black film&quot; at the time and that was probably why it received such poor box office (a&apos;la &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;). Perhaps Hollywood wasn&apos;t ready to see that and preferred a movie about a suburban, white, dysfunctional family instead. Oh, and gave it Best Picture, too.",

      "reviewBody": "As the years have gone on I have come to realize that this, not the original Star Wars, is my favorite movie. And, having just re-watched it for the umpteenth time, I decided it was high time I left a review somewhere. I am a cynical person, I don&apos;t believe in a lot, I don&apos;t believe in love at first sight, or the power of the human spirit, or in humanity in general really. My brother tells me that makes me a misanthrope, and I don&apos;t disagree. If I sit down to watch Star Wars for example, I can&apos;t help but loudly and frequently pick apart its many flaws: the hammy acting from the extras, the dated special effects, the story as a whole, yadda yadda. But every. single. time. I sit down to watch Stranger than Fiction I find it akin to slipping my aching body into a warm bath after a looong day, my jaded personality submerging beneath the gentle and comforting weight of the familiar story. Will Farrell is a clown most days, making such masterpieces as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby (that was sarcasm), but in this movie he stands shoulder to shoulder with cinematic giants like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and he SHINES as Harold Crick, his performance subtle and low key, but poignant and introspective. This of course stands in contrast to Maggie Gyllenhaal&apos;s &apos;Miss Pascal&apos;: so vibrant and full of life, with a kind and warm personality that is undiminished by an occasionally fiery temper. Whenever she comes on screen with her passion and femininity I can&apos;t help but empathize with Harold, because with each touch and sigh from Maggie I inevitably want her as badly as he does. The two of them coming together is like that bath we talked about, or a hug from someone you love after far too long apart. But setting aside the love interest, the story itself is so much fun to experience: that of a character who is not supposed to know about his impending demise, yet does, and how that knowledge spurs him to embrace his life, however long it shall be. Sentimental? Absolutely. So what? 10 Stars. People more cynical then myself will throw shade at this film, and I strongly urge them to go and eat a cookie.",

This film was exactly what I was hoping it would be at the time. Sure, it certainly wasn&apos;t as charming or as funny as the films I loved as a kid, but it was a lot of fun. I loved the action scenes, the look of the monster was crazy to me, and the plot was simple enough for a first time viewer to get right into. Seeing it again 10 years later, I had the same reaction. My opinion of this film hasn&apos;t changed one bit. I guess everybody&apos;s complaints stem from how this has no charm or any kind of attempt at being cute or original. I guess that&apos;s understandable, but I still don&apos;t see what everybody&apos;s problem is. This was supposed to be a fun, exciting, and action packed thrill ride. That&apos;s all it is, no more, no less. I personally think that it succeeds at what it achieved to be perfectly. Matthew Broderick may not exactly be an action hero, but his character sure was quirky and funny. Jean Reno was as good as usual."

I&apos;m a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it&apos;s not really high-speed children&apos;s pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character&apos;s depth, it&apos;s just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.\n\nKermit the Frog is just an awesome character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he&apos;s popular--&quot;he can sing and make jokes too!&quot;--but more appropriately why he&apos;s so endearing--he, without any effort, inspires everyone to search for their dreams. In the meantime, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family movies.\n\nIt also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (I think Mel Brook&apos;s part was just a bit overplayed, do you?). Some parts of the film are just kind of odd. But it&apos;s highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction.\n\nMoving right along...\n\n--PolarisDiB",

Ayn wrote Shrugged in such a cinematic way, it was great to see the sweeping landscapes, witty banter, and some steamy scenes come to life on the big screen. It was really great to see some beautiful scenes of the rail and steel industry.\n\nThe actors were excellent, especially the main characters. Bowler and Schilling nailed it.\n\nNow, I&apos;m a huge fan of the book, so I&apos;m a bit biased towards the story, but I thought the movie was entertaining, paced well and held true to key aspects of dialogue and scenes. I think people will enjoy it even if they haven&apos;t read the book, and hope it inspires people to read the book.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, Part 2 and 3 are a go and will be released Tax Day 2012 and 2013.",

Her sister Kamla(Nirupa Roy) dies and now for the sake of her sister&apos;s kid, she is married to Barrister Ashok(Ashok Kumar). Later Meena and Rajendra meets again and the story takes a turn and eventually becomes a thriller in the end.\n\nThe first half of the movie was plain, with only the music and story going flat. It&apos;s the second half where the movie scores and mainly the last half hour of the movie is a classic romantic thriller.\n\nMala Sinha excels in this movie and this can be called as a Mala Sinha&apos;s movie completely. Sunil Dutt is fine and does what a role demands of a tormented and frustrated lover. Ashok Kumar is charming and looks good in his role.\n\nThe story may seems very flat on a paper but its the execution and the performance that sets the film apart and makes this a great watch.\n\nBR Chopra is commpletely in top form in the second half and this film is one of his best directorial movie.\n\nMusic is another strong point of the movie and all the songs are completely soulful and evergreen.",

      "reviewBody": "American Perfekt is a disjointed yet darkly compelling little nightmare of a road movie, a dusty ode to bowers of the American southwest left unchecked and decayed, populated by wayward souls with perpetual heat delirium, vixens, psychopaths and hustlers alike, who saunter through lurid story lines that often end in bloodshed and madness. In the vein of stuff like Oliver Stone&apos;s U-Turn and Kalifornia, we once again pair up with some extremely off colour characters as they navigate both the tangled web of highways that lace the States as well as the human capacity for greed, lust and heinous physical violence. The characters, and actors for that matter, who populate this stretch of highway are an especially bizarre bunch, starting with Robert Forster&apos;s vacationing criminal psychologist Jake Nyman. Forster is quite the unpredictable guy, usually found in calmly benign protagonist roles, yet just as capable of stirring the pot with evil antics. Here&apos;s he&apos;s opaqueness incarnate, driving from one place to another until he runs into two sisters played by another couple of acting hellcats, Amanda Plummer and Fairuza Balk. Jake is basing each decision of his trip upon the flip of a coin a-lá Harvey Dent, a tactic which simultaneously causes trouble and indicates how unhinged he might really be.\n\nPlummer is weird and Balk is weirder, but neither as weird as David &apos;Professor Lupin&apos; Thewlis as an awkwardly placed character who seems to exist just to jump into a scene and throw the mood off kilter. There&apos;s others running amok too, including Geoffrey Lewis, as well as Paul Sorvino and Chris Sarandon as a pair of state troopers who serve as comic relief. Forster is scary here, playing a guy who is psychologically hard to pin down or get a read on, and he&apos;s got some dynamite scenes with Balk in the third act, the two talents lighting up the frame. It&apos;s pretty far south of coherent though, mostly just these freaks terrorizing each other and engaging in puzzling romantic flings that only make sense to them, I suppose. If feverish, borderline abstract, sun-stroked neo noir is your thing, go for it. You can certainly do worse than spend a certifiably bonkers ninety minutes with this terrific bunch of actors.",

      "reviewBody": "Most people are unaware that some of the best performances actors deliver are in the smaller budgeted lesser seen films. Being Flynn is one of those that got limited release and was getting some good reviews, but kind of just came out of nowhere. Sporting a great cast including Paul Dano, Robert DeNiro, and Julianne Moore, could this be another of those rare gems that get lost on the shelf or will it be one that&apos;s clear to why it got such a limited release.\n\nBeing Flynn follows a father and son who haven&apos;t been in contact with each other in years. When the father reaches out to his son, he realizes he cannot outrun his fate and realizes that he has the chance to make a life for himself as well as for his father. This drama is filled with some interesting characters and great performances, most notably DeNiro who seems to be letting it all out in one of his strongest performances in some time. Paul Dano does a great job carrying his own weight alongside DeNiro playing off of each other to bring this troubled relationship to life. The story takes a deeper than expected journey into human emotion and the thin line of genius and madness. Everyone gives great performances delivering a powerful film that works really well. The biggest issue is the pacing. At times it comes off as really slow and long, and others will keep you interested. With an emotional film like this it&apos;s important to maintain a sense of cohesion so the heavier moments don&apos;t get lost in a sea of useless moments. That&apos;s not necessarily the case here; it just runs a bit longer than it feels it needed too.\n\nWhile not a film that will really deliver anything all that new, it does sport a great performance from DeNiro that is worth checking out. This film does sport some drug use and racist moments that while nothing you haven&apos;t seen are necessary due to the direction of the film. If you decide to give this film a shot, just make sure you are prepared for some heavy content.\n\nhttp://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

They know how to make some damn funny songs (infinitely funnier than Weird Al and Adam Sandler)  AND they have mad talent musically as well.  I wish they had more stuff out.  JB&apos;s pretty good on Mr. Show too.  If anybody out there likes the D they&apos;d probably like Mr.Show too.  BUY THE DVDS",

      "reviewBody": "This film is nothing like I anticipated. Crazy as it seems, I actually expected that with Jack Benny in the lead that it would be a comedy...and that, sadly, was not the case. Instead, it&apos;s a musical with a lightly comedic touch--but NOT a comedy. If you&apos;re looking for laughs, you&apos;re more likely to find them in an Ingmar Bergman film! &quot;Artists &amp; Models&quot; begins with Benny owning his own advertising firm. He&apos;s a total failure and one step away from bankruptcy. However, rather out of the view, a young millionaire (Richard Arlen) approaches him to run a million dollar campaign. Arlen would like to feature some society woman in his advertising and Benny&apos;s girlfriend, Ida Lupino, is disappointed. She&apos;s a successful model and is angry that she won&apos;t even be considered. So, she sneaks off to where she heard Arlen is headed--determined to convince him that she is this society dame.\n\nAlong the way, there are a bazillion musical interludes--some pretty good and many very bad. The worst comes late in the film where Martha Raye stars in a Black musical review--and she&apos;s in black-face (uggh) with the likes of Louis Armstrong. I cringed as I watched this one.\n\nOverall, the film is a rather tedious musical. Nothing terrible but nothing particularly good, either. It&apos;s a shame, as with this cast, it should have been a lot more interesting.",

Not only was it better than the first in every way - the story, the acting, the screenplay - but it managed to have more of an edge without sinking into the pitfall that movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean have slipped into.\n\nMeaning that unlike the Pirates sequels (don&apos;t get me wrong, I love Pirates, but this is something that bothered me a little), the makers of Prince Caspian did not believe that to make it better and more exciting, they had to gore and bloody it up. Instead, while it is darker, the blood and gore is kept to a bare minimum considering this is an action flick.\n\nAnyway, that now aside, I highly recommend this! It&apos;s a great movie - great action scenes, a tad bit of romance but not overly so, and a good plot. Plus the young cast are even better in this film than they were in the first, and Ben Barnes - well, it&apos;s right that he is the title character,because he very nearly would have stolen the floor from underneath the original kids if they were even the slightest bit less perfect (William Moseley was the weakest of the five, as he was in the last movie, but he still stepped it up quite a bit).\n\nGranted, I&apos;ve not read the books, so I don&apos;t know if this is as dedicated to the book as many fans would like it to be. Then again, most movies adapted from the books never are. However, if they can find it in them to accept changes for theatrical purposes, I&apos;m sure even the most die-hard fans will admit it &quot;wasn&apos;t bad.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t usually like Loretta Young, but I admit when actors or actresses I don&apos;t care for give objectively good performances. Loretta plays a deaf woman, ill with meningitis, and she&apos;s very good. Her eyes are glued to her fellow actors&apos; lips, and when they turn away from her for a moment, she gets a bewildered look on her face until they return to face her. She wipes the fear and shame away and asks, even though it humiliates her to do it, them to repeat themselves. It&apos;s very realistic and natural.\n\nWhen she falls ill, Loretta breaks her engagement to Barry Sullivan, so that his quality of life isn&apos;t diminished for having to care for a sick person. Alan Ladd, a new, unknown doctor, wants to experiment on Loretta to see if he can cure her, and in the many months of the treatment, Barry falls in love with Loretta&apos;s sister, Susan Hayward. \n\nAnd Now Tomorrow is very similar to Dark Victory, so if you liked one, there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll like the other. Part medical drama, part love story, and chalk full of beautiful clothes from Edith Head, this is an overlooked classic that&apos;s great to watch with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy afternoon.",

During the course of his investigation, he encounters various old connections, ultimately confronting the criminal responsible for Shame&apos;s expulsion from the force. He must also deal with two women, Angela, a beautiful old flame, and Peaches, his energetic but annoying sidekick.\n\nThis is easily my favorite Keenan Ivory Wayans directed film. This combines action and comedy very well within its story. The cast all play their roles very well, especially Keenan and Jada Pinkett Smith who delivers some of the funniest lines of the movie. The jokes don&apos;t feel forced and help drive the story forwarded unlike a lot of comedies these days who like to repeat the same joke over and over again. I wish more comedies nowadays were more like this.\n\nOverall, A Low Down Dirty Shame is a very underrated action comedy that delivers on the laughs, action, and has s good straight forwarded story That holds its own. Check this out if you haven&apos;t seen it, you will not regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "Universal made a number of these modestly budgeted Technicolor westerns during the 1950&apos;s, usually starring Audie Murphy. Here, it&apos;s veteran bad guy McNally in a good guy departure from his usual. The movie starts off with an eye-catching chase across scenic red rock country, but soon moves indoors to the way- station. At that point, the characters multiply and, unfortunately, so does the talk, while the action turns mainly to soap opera with Indian complications.\n\nActually, my main gripe is with the two girls. Unhappy wife Ann (Greene) over-does the unhappy part by looking and acting like she just swallowed a big lemon, while the gorgeous Adams is decked out in enough finery and elaborate eye make-up to impress a queen. Now, I&apos;m ready to suspend some disbelief in a western, knowing how preoccupied Hollywood and its leading ladies&apos; are with glamour, but Adams&apos; glamorized appearance here in the middle of Indian country is little short of ridiculous. \n\nThe plot itself is a well-worn one of Indians jumping the reservation and attacking whites. It&apos;s notable, however, that by the mid-50&apos;s Hollywood has been forced to recognize that Indians amount to more than convenient canon fodder for the cavalry. Here, the Apaches are provided recognizably human traits, especially the chief (the blue-eyed Barrier), while the cavalryman colonel (Marlowe) comes across as cruel and blood thirsty, certainly a reversal of the usual.\n\nGiven all the character complications, it&apos;s too bad the studio didn&apos;t assign a director more attuned to dramatics. Instead, director Sholem moves the dialog along in pretty bland fashion, draining away whatever intensity and suspense is in the script. All in all, it&apos;s a pretty undistinguished western, one that I doubt would have improved even in its original 3-D."

While good, the story did not completely grab me like some of his others, especially &quot;Street Of Shame&quot; and &quot;Ugetsu&quot;. The film&apos;s success is in the message it portrays as to these ladies, that they are somewhat trapped in their existence with no way out, broke and looking for a patron to take them out of that life. However, I did not find the characters to be as developed as I would have liked, so the film loses steam, even though it is a fairly short film, much less than ninety minutes. Still worth watching, it just doesn&apos;t have the depth of some of his other films.",

      "reviewBody": "3.9 stars from IMDB users? For shame! I give this film 10 out of 10, and no mistake.\n\nAnyone who doesn&apos;t realise this is the ne plus ultra of Heimat films -- with the exception of the Sissi trilogy, another Ernst Marischka Agfacolor bonbon -- doesn&apos;t know a thing about cinema, and less about Viennese Burgtheater history.\n\n&quot;Die Deutschmeister&quot; showcases the most talented actors who ever pried a laugh from the hyper-critical Viennese (certainly the most discerning judges of acting talent in all of Europe), a mouthwatering Who&apos;s Who of Austrian theatre and film: Susi Nicoletti, Gunther Philipp, Adrienne Gessner, Hans Moser, Josef Meinrad, Paul Hörbiger not to mention Romy Schneider&apos;s film debut alongside mama Magda.\n\nThis film has not made it to the English-speaking world, and more&apos;s the pity -- certainly those in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, South America are not so deprived. It&apos;s to the great credit of the translators involved that the pace and hilarity are not compromised in the least, the Portuguese and Castillian-Spanish versions as special standouts. The Viennese accent and slang does not lend itself to translation, partly because of the inherently comedic nature of the accent with it&apos;s broad A&apos;s and slurred rat-tat-tat speech, but perhaps that&apos;s more a credit of the comedic richness of the film, which allows itself to be replicated with a sparkling levity in whatever language.\n\nFor those who wish a film capsule, here you are:\n\nStanzi Hübner, the insouciant be-dirndled Salzburger maiden who believes in fortunes foretold by parrots, comes to the &quot;Kaiserstadt&quot;, Vienna, to work for her auntie Therese. She in turn is the Official Croissant Baker of that aged Biedermeier legend, the Emperor Franz Josef: a job of importance in this croissant-conscious capital. Now there&apos;s a mouthful.\n\nIn one of the twists of fate so adored and duplicated a million-fold by Austrian storytellers, she is confused by a Tourette&apos;s Syndromed nobleman as a Countess in a Fasching dance, and he later enters into matrimony sight unseen with a real Countess, who merely had the infinite good fortune of living in the general neighbourhood of Stanzi&apos;s aunt.\n\nStanzi then meets a young would-be composer soldier in Die Deutschmeister regiment, and whilst her own romance is flourishing, she engineers her aunt&apos;s flirtation with a courtier whose sole duty seems to be &quot;Official Picker-Upper of the Daily Imperial Croissant&quot;. No doubt his title is more grandiose on paper.\n\nFor those who wish a highlighted critique, here it is:\n\nWatch the light interplay between Susi Nicoletti, Adrienne Gessner, and Gunther Philipp and then tell us this film isn&apos;t worthy of Tracy and Hepburn at their peak. Only when you&apos;ve acted together more times than they have, do you mistake absolute mastery of their craft for anything less than what it is.\n\nIf you want a frisky gambol in the best tradition of Viennese light comedy, this my friends, is your film.",

Nice work by Glenn Ford and Janis Carter. This film is a bit like &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, only with a twist ending, and a lower budget. Oh, to have this released on DVD--I would be so happy. I just love these old black and white film noir type films from the 1940&apos;s and 1950&apos;s."

Gets a little slow in the middle but it&apos;s worth it to the hear the LAST LINE for the worlds worst/best pun, which sort of suggests the whole film was designed just for that. We gave it a standing ovation at the Brattle in Harvard square (the filmmaker lived in Brookline). This film was released on video by TROMA in 1999, but thank god is not like a Troma film.",

But there is one big problem that others have already pointed out: \n\nThe things that he does mostly make no sense, and most of the movie is spent having him repeat these things that make no sense the next time he goes around the time loop, just so that the events in the first time happen the way he remembers them. And that&apos;s not clever.\n\nI can do this easily by making up a simple example: Joe is sitting in his living room and sees a dead bird thrown through his window, he goes out to investigate, falls into a time-machine into the past, then when he sees himself in the living room, he kills a bird and throws it through the window so that he will go out to investigate. The End.\n\nNot very satisfying is it? \n\nThere are elements that make this movie entertaining, especially the dark way that he solves the final problem and the fact that there are three versions of himself running around trying to make or stop things from happening, but otherwise, it&apos;s just an extended version of my story.",

ABC released &quot;The Day After&quot;, (which I have already commented on) but in all the furor around that, &quot;Testament&quot; was released. This is THE 1980&apos;s nuclear war film.  It doesn&apos;t deal with the effects on an entire community, but rather on one small, close knit family in California. Jane Alexander&apos;s performance was one of legend, and is possibly one of the classic dramatic performances of all time.  The day begins innocently enough, dad heads off to work, the kids watch &quot;Sesame Street&quot;..then the Emergency Broadcast System cuts in and the world stops.  Ignore all the Y2K mumbo-jumbo and put yourself back in 1983 (most of us know where we were) and watch this film.  You may not be &quot;entertained&quot;, but you will appreciate what you have just a bit more."

In its day, SISTER GEORGE was considered the ne plus ultra in coarse homophobia; critics saw the sweaty thumbprints of the Aldrich Touch on every girl-on-girl scene. (Does anyone now lambaste THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT for not being hardhitting docudrama?) In retrospect, the movie seems to me one of Aldrich&apos;s most affecting, with Coral Browne (December) and a teeny, teenaged Susannah York (May) grand-slamming this folie a deux to a fare-thee-well."

Or do we Germans simply have no other topic to talk about but the eternal struggle between man and woman? (At least in this instance, the optional gay character was delightfully missing...)\n\nThis movie centers on female power, on friendship above any romantic relationship. That is not bad in the first place. But almost everything the characters are doing, from the first accidental kill to cold-blooded murder, goes unpunished, yes there isn&apos;t even any kind of conflict with, let&apos;s say, police, law, conscience...\n\nSo what is the message of this movie? Stay single and kill every man who dares to get close to you?\n\nI don&apos;t know, but I don&apos;t care for German movies anyway. Even those with Christiane Paul. And her character would probably kill me for calling her beautiful... :-)",

Even if she wants to put him off the scent,it will not delude him for long anyway.\n\nLouis de Funes&apos;s fans can be interested in his small part of a lousy playwright.He is not the comic relief though,this is reserved to a man called &quot;Carcassone&quot; whose interventions are irritating."

      "name": "Bartha and Zeta-Jones Shine In An Interesting Romantic Comedy",
      "reviewBody": "While the title may be a tad misleading, Bart Freundlich&apos;s &apos;The Rebound&apos; is a refreshing romantic comedy that centres around a forty-something single mother and a 24-year old singleton. Unlike most traditional Hollywood movies of this genre, much of the humour here is subtle and it balances off well with the rest. \n\nFreundlich also addresses the issue of age-stereotype and how it affects people. When Aram calls Sandy an ageist, it may appear petty but there is some truth to it as she just couldn&apos;t see him outside the stereotype even though her concerns are justified to an extent. \n\nOn the technical side, it&apos;s a decently made little film. The setting is New York and Freundlich cleverly steers clear of exposing too many postcard images of the city. Refreshingly paired Justin Bartha and Catherine Zeta-Jones form a very likable and convincing couple on screen. Zeta-Jones displays her growth as an actress in a mature performance and Bartha is excellent as the kind-hearted young man who&apos;s going through a lot (split up from his wife, unemployment etc) and yet decides to do the generous thing. The supporting cast is mostly adequate. Joanna Gleason is brilliant with her downplayed performance. \n\nOverall, &apos;The Rebound&apos; is a delight to watch while, at the same time it presents some interesting issues regarding age and gender stereotype. It&apos;s a great date movie and something worth considering for a rainy day."

      "reviewBody": "I went into this movie expecting a stylised(somewhat overly) thriller from Abbas-Mastan duo and boy was I surprised.\n\nThe movie started off like expected with a stylised flashback and a decent attempt to merge to the stories of a few individuals but it was all different and confusing since then.\n\nIn fact everything about this movie and the motives behind it such as packaging it as a thriller and the dozen ploy holes (maybe more i lost count after a while) are confusing.\n\nI&apos;ve reviewed this movie like a comedy with a murder involved maybe even like a spoof as THIS MOVIE CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE CALLED A THRILLER AND ANYONE GOING INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING ONE WILL BE SEVERELY Disappointed also if i did review this movie as a thriller than even one star would be to much.\n\nThe story of this movie is promising enough with a few bumbling people all landing up at the same time at China Town(sic) in Goa at the same time a murder happens.\n\nThe characters are all caricatures with the henpecked husband, the suave playboy, the tough cop, the bumbling sidekicks etc. Even so they are all tolerable and the performances by everyone is good given the limited premise of the movie.\n\nSpecial mention to Upen Patel (who I&apos;m sure is dubbed) who has had a decent debut and Johny Lever who thanks to his short hiatus from films (and the fact that his Numero Uno status as the most annoying guy in Bollywood being taken over by Rajpal Yadav) is actually quite tolerable in this film. However he and Paresh Rawal have nothing new to offer in terms of their roles. In fact Item Girl Payal Rohtagi also gave a decent performance.\n\nThe songs in this film save for the first one are probably the worst part of this film as they completely destroyed the flow of the film and were played when you least wanted it. In fact one could easily hear the collective sigh of the audience when yet another HIMMESBHAI song was played.\n\nThe comedy is nothing special though a few scenes especially those involving the interrogation of the Suspects was hilarious. Some of the scenes even though they were predictable had me falling out my seat laughing.\n\nAlso a really funny person throughout the movie was the Stupid Junior Cop who was Akshaye Khannas sidekick all his one liners were absolutely hilarious.\n\nThe sets of this film were actually quite good although the crude labeling of the Casino was very annoying (come one people are gambling inside we all know its a casino).\n\nWhich brings us to Murder Mystery...the lesser said the better there were a dozen plot holes it was shoddily done and completely unimportant I&apos;m sure almost no one in the audience cared who the killer was....hell it was so bad that the killer actually cracks a joke about the killing after being caught WTF.\n\nSave for the first ten minutes when this movie tries to be a thriller this movie is actually funny.\n\nA good comedy (maybe even a spoof)but the obtrusive songs and the fact that this movie was not supposed to be comedy and a thriller affect its ratings.\n\nWatch this movie if you want to see a good comedy with the background of a murder mystery.\n\nPS maybe subhash ghai saw the box office of the recent comedies and repackaged this movie as a thriller to con us whatever be the reason this movie will definitely reflect negatively against him.",

I laughed a couple of times, and rolled my eyes a couple of times. Wasn&apos;t really scared though. There&apos;s no real looming claustrophobic terror there. It&apos;s more like the shock violence of 28 days later and 28 weeks later, that mixed some Aliens knock off, and strangely enough Scary Movie. The zombie effects are OK, bit like an episode of Buffy, and then there&apos;s the film effects like the beginning of Dawn of the Dead. It&apos;s no way as good as the new Dawn of the Dead, and is a bit of a let down, but it&apos;s just a zombie movie. It&apos;s strait to DVD, but I&apos;d wait for the sales.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this film way, way back in the early 80&apos;s as a teenager around 13 or 14. The film had some memorable scenes etched in my mind and, I thought the film was an intense, well-crafted thriller. After reviewing it again, I realized the only scene which really stuck with me was the bizarre tent scene and that makes perfect sense considering my age then. What I DID forget is just how awfully bad a film this one is. I mean it is a stinker! Where to begin...the story is about mutated salmon that are eaten by prehistoric-like fish that quickly evolve into man-sized creature from the black lagoon/alien ripoffs. These monsters are plentiful and have only one goal: to capture as many girls in a bikini and have sex on the beach to procreate in order to create more mutant fish people. Fish people having babies with real people despite any biological problems that might arise(no pun intended). Hmm. Next, add Doug McClure, Vic Morrow, and Ann Turkel into the mix. None of them great actors...not bad either when they have some decent direction. Not evident here. Morrow overacts, McClure is over his head when he is the lead, and Turkel is less than mediocre. One scene really showcases her &quot;talent.&quot; The scene where she is in the lab telling us how much she has fought to bring the news of the superfish out is one of the finest pieces of bad acting I have seen in a long time. It is almost an inspiration for everyone else in the film to do likewise. Director Barbara Peters really seems to set out to be solely exploitative and there is nothing wrong with that if you can do it well or with a point. I mean her producer Roger Corman did it all the time. Here plot, acting, and all those other qualities that make a movie good are secondary(or tertiary) to gore, violence and nudity. Peters does do some things fairly well. The pacing of the first three-fourths of the film is rapid and there are some well-shot scenes of menace. I particularly liked the scene in the water with the naked(of course!) girl and boyfriend playing splash...soon to be victims of the fishman&apos;s enormous libido. The last scene...roughly 20 minutes or more is just simply too ridiculous as creature after creature pop out of the boards on a boardwalk and start gutting everyone. OK. I think I would prefer keeping my adolescent opinion of the film intact; the entire film centered around a beautiful, full-figured woman, her man, and a dummy."

He learns about Tuvan throat singing by hearing it on a shortwave radio, learns how to throatsing himself. When a Tuvan throat-singing master visits the States, Paul and the singer encounter each other. Along with Friends of Tuva and a small film crew, Paul embarks on a trip to Tuva, meets the throat singer, and enters in a competition. Paul is a remarkably gifted musician, and the film manages to capture that as well as some of the pain, anxiety, and fear that he is feeling. Still, this documentary could have been filmed and edited in more capable hands. How Paul is feeling about his experiences as a blind person in a foreign place is not presented with the kind of power and clarity it could have been presented with. And the feeling arises watching the film that there are many elements to this story that the documentarian is not willing to explore. Still, Genghis Blues is a fascinating record of a meeting of cultures and musical styles.",
