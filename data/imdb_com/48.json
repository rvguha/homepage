      "reviewBody": "Based on the novel &quot;Space Vampires&quot;, by Colin Wilson, Tobe Hooper&apos;s Lifeforce is an intriguing blend of sci-i, horror, and action, with particularly masterful  special fx. \n\nAs far as vampire films go, it&apos;s really quite original, in that it attempts to explain the origin of the vampire legends on Earth, as intervention from an extraterrestrial race of beings that traverse the universe- riding the wave of haley&apos;s comet- and leaving destruction in their wake (Von Daniken would be proud).\n\nEverything begins when a mission is sent to study and observe Haley&apos;s Comet up close- using the new minerva engine, which allows them to travel with gravity for the first time (which is convenient for production purposes)- during which they discover this mysterious alien craft. \n\nKnowing this is a once-in-a-lifetime oppourtunity...they send a team to enter the ship via an &quot;artery&quot;...only to discover the desiccated corpses of a  thousand bat like creatures. \n\nUpon further investigation they find 3 humanoid figures perfectly preserved in what appear to be crystalline obelisks of some sort. \n\nThe commander immediately falls in love with the female of the species, and orders the three humanoids and one desiccated bat corpse be taken back to the ship so they can be studied. \n\nHowever, this unleashes something that kills everyone on the ship. \n\nAnd by the time the ship gets back to Earth&apos;s orbit, there is nothing left...except the three humanoid creatures (who are the only things left inside the vessel that haven&apos;t been scorched). \n\nThe space agency then brings the specimens back to Earth, only to discover for themselves, exactly what they are dealing with- body snatching vampires that require human lifeforce as nourishment. \n\nUnknowingly, they have just unleashed this plague- which spreads like zombies and vampires- upon the Earth...and they cannot contain it. \n\nShortly after making this discovery, the escape pod- from the ship that originally scavenged the three entities from the alien craft that now  sits in orbit over London- returns carrying the sole survivor from that fateful mission. \n\nBut it&apos;s too late...the plague is spreading like wildfire across London, and NATO plans to nuke the area to contain the threat. \n\nSo our returned man (who is both the original cause of the plague and only hope for stopping it)- alongside his earthly counterpart- must find a  way to kill the three entities before the plague obliterates all life on Earth. \n\nAnd the only way for our out of this world protagonist to redeem his sins- and save what is left to be saved- is to form the ultimate union; and become himself, like a God (providing mercy for mankind). \n\nStory aside, the special effects in this film are among the best I&apos;ve ever seen. \n\nThe animatronic puppets used for the bodies drained of their life&apos;s essence are absolutely incredible (and something we rarely get in today&apos;s cop out age of cgi). So animated and lifelike! \n\nThe transformation sequences (a blend of real fx, cell animation and cinematic techniques) are also top notch...up there alongside the scene from American Werewolf in London...maybe even better! \n\n It&apos;&apos;s no Star Wars, or anything...but this film is a nugget from the Golden Age of Special Effects, which has since been heavily diluted, if not abandoned altogether. \n\nThey just don&apos;t make films like this anymore, and that&apos;s a real tragedy. \n\nWorth watching on that note alone. \n\n7.5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "My starting point for this film was no knowledge of this famous battle (and I imagine a good many people from outside central/eastern Europe know little about it either), which made this film a real cultural education.\n\nIf films were like singing, this film would be a rowdy pub singalong rather than a finely nuanced choral mass, but by the end of it, I didn&apos;t mind one bit. There are a few functions it should fulfill: to tell the amazing story of this battle (I had to educate myself afterward, and it really is an amazing episode) as well as to say something about Poland&apos;s place in the world, and explain something about Polish mentality, particularly with respect to Russia. It more or less succeeds on all fronts, even while lurching from almost slapstick comedy (a beloved art form in Eastern European film) to the horrors of war to the important military strategising scenes.\n\nThe nightclub scenes are really well done, with some great stage numbers, which although incidental to the main story, lend authenticity. The two leads - one a soldier, one the night club star singer are warm characters, and the rest of the cast are good too. The war scenes are not only visceral and realistic, but historically fascinating. At the point in time of this battle, the old technologies of canon and horse were competing with machine guns and armoured cars. But in 1920, machine guns often jammed (the downside), but were becoming lighter and nearly portable (the upside), while armoured cars were not much more than a T-model Ford covered in steel sheets, undoubtedly with limited range and speed. This meant that no single technology was decisive: in the end, a Polish cavalry charge is what sends the Bolsheviks fleeing, even though they had greater numbers and more &apos;new&apos; technology.\n\nSome scenes are set in the halls of the Kremlin and involve the conversations of Lenin, Stalin, and others as they plan the attack, justified by what seems today an absurd concept of a pan-European (and then global) socialist nirvana. It&apos;s hard to believe anyone could even think in such abstract terms, with a complete disregard for real human lives and indeed entire countries and cultures, but we know of course that it was only too real.\n\nIt would have been easy for this film to be a breast-beating Polish nationalist pride statement, but it absolutely avoids that stance, and in doing so I suspect would make many Polish people proud of what their forebears achieved in this battle, and how they are perceived today. For me, with little knowledge of Polish culture, it was a real eye-opener into issues such as the historical antipathy for Russia, and the insecurity of even being Polish during a century of invasion. The Polish general Jozef Pilsudski is portrayed as a real person, rather than a heroic personification of his erstwhile legend, and in doing so, allows us to reconstruct the legend for ourselves.\n\nOne complaint: the 3D is terrible (I didn&apos;t realise it was 3D until too late). I really hate 3D, and I found it terribly disturbing when trying to focus, particularly on battle scene long shots. Let&apos;s give this 3D mania up now before too much money is spent on it - it adds nothing, and detracts from the great cinematography.\n\nI recommend anyone who doesn&apos;t know much about Poland to go and see this film - you will learn a lot. And anyone who likes cinema with real heart and soul should see it as well. As for Polish people reading this, all I can say is that I am glad to see such an important episode in your history finally on the big screen.",

      "reviewBody": "When I think about it, there have been quite a few cinematic variations on Anton Chekhov&apos;s classic &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; from Woody Allen&apos;s austere &quot;Interiors&quot; to Diane Keaton&apos;s execrable &quot;Hanging Up&quot;. Playwright-turned-screenwriter Richard Alfieri provides a more literal adaptation by updating the original play to the present and resetting it primarily in a Manhattan faculty lounge on the Upper West Side. Longtime TV director Arthur Allan Seidelman guides an impressive ensemble of actors in the proceedings, but the result unfortunately feels like a stagy TV-movie brimming with overripe theatrics. The abundance of characters and multi-layered set-up seem to make the actors chew the scenery excessively, though a few still make indelible impressions.\n\nThe structure and themes of the Chekhov play remain the same. The plot focuses on the four Prior siblings - Marcia, Olga, Irene and Andrew - and their clashing destinies and unraveling secrets furnish the drama as they get together for Irene&apos;s 22nd birthday party. Maria is the beautiful, vitriolic older sister unhappily married to a passive psychology professor while embarking on a torrid affair with Vincent, their father&apos;s former teaching assistant who has come unexpectedly for a visit. Irene is the buttoned-up middle sister, an English literature professor and by default the family conciliator. Irene is the protected baby sister whose sunny disposition masks deeper insecurities that lead to a crystal-meth overdose. Andrew is the weak, emasculated brother who has brought home Nancy, his slatternly fiancée, whom his sisters, especially Marcia, despise. There are others who encircle the family like a vise with their own histrionics - kindly department head Dr. Chebrin and dueling professors Gary Sokol and David Turzin, both in love with Irene and seething with rage against each other.\n\nThere are plenty of fireworks, but with so many characters to track, Seidelman produces a truncated flow to the story while making the movie itself feel overlong. The performances are all over the map, though each seems to have at least one bravura set piece. As she proves in David Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, Maria Bello is one of the strongest actresses on screen today and makes Marcia a memorably fiery character, especially as she lays into the vulgar Nancy or succumbs to Vincent&apos;s ardent attention. As Irene, the underused Mary Stuart Masterson brings a coiled sense of repression that makes the contrast between her and Marcia biting and poignant. Less interesting is Erika Christensen, who makes Irene sweetly vulnerable but cannot transcend the trite arc of her character. Chris O&apos;Donnell barely registers as the romantically obsessive David, but Eric McCormack - who will have a challenge overcoming his pervasive Will Truman persona - is all sarcastic blather as Gary until he manages to convey the character&apos;s pathetic jealousy.\n\nElizabeth Banks - memorable as the lusty bookstore clerk in &quot;The 40-Year Old Virgin&quot; - makes the vulgarity of Nancy palpable if rather obvious with a wavering Bronx accent, while Alessandro Nivola - equally memorable as the pampered rock star in &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; - is effectively passive as Andrew. Tony Goldwyn seems oddly stilted as Vincent, making him a dispassionate match for Marcia&apos;s voracious self-destruction. At times, the dialogue is insightful with clever zingers. At other times, it sounds laughably mannered, and the general dysfunctional situation gets wearing over time. A few cathartic moments shine through, especially toward the end when Marcia and Olga come to terms with each other. The DVD is short on extras - just the original trailer and an overly earnest commentary from Seidelman and Alfieri.",

Overall, I got to say, I had some fun with it!\n\nSo, the plot is out there for everyone, nothing new, nothing secret, a tired formula, brought again on the big screens, but with a better, fresher approach. This one will come down to everyone&apos;s personal opinion, some will like it, some will take it as wasted time, in my books, I saw a lot worse than it, so I&apos;m glad I got to play it with my friends. Possibly, the fact that we were many, helped us to take the movie lighter than usual, therefore we all had fun, laughed many times, overall, had a good time.\n\nIf you can get in such a mood too, I think you&apos;ll do just fine. If you want pure horror tho, look elsewhere, this one will probably annoy you at best.\n\nCheers!",

A grand example of the final flowering of Hollywood.\n\nIn 1963 it seemed old fashioned compared to the excitement of European cinema and what the critics perceived as new (many of their favourite films of that era now just seem dated and pretentious).\n\nBut Cleopatra grows in stature with time.\n\nIt is far from flawless. And certainly the second half is somehow not right. Whether the missing two hours will reclaim this part of the film is yet to be seen.\n\nBut compared with Gladiator or similar modern epics, Cleopatra is a brilliant film with an intelligent script, stunning design, masterly and beautiful cinematography in 70mm (which sure beats 35mm and does justice to the intricate sets and design), an evocative and effective musical score and superb costumes and makeup.\n\nThe big three, Taylor, Burton and Harrison are extremely good and in the case of Harrison, who has many of the best lines, brilliant.\n\n The supporting cast and especially Roddy McDowall are equally excellent.\n\nCleopatra may not be a masterpiece but it is a superbly crafted and beautiful film.\n\nIf it fails, it fails because of our expectations.\n\nSit back, put your feet up and luxuriate in a quality of film-making that you simply don&apos;t see today! .... but I have always wondered what Miss Taylor thinks of this extraordinary film?"

Quite frankly, I&apos;m not quite sure what I saw. I would analogize it to cotton candy(or Chinese food, just hear me out). I ate a lot, but it just kind of dissolved. I know that I watched this movie, but what was it that I saw? Was I too deep for it or was it too deep for me?? Unfortunately, this is another case in the grand tradition of &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; and &quot;Dude, Where&apos;s My Car&quot; where a trailer writes a check that it&apos;s ass simply cannot cash. My advice is to watch the trailer continously- it&apos;s hilarious on so many levels. Watch the &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; one as well to really get a taste of unbridled potential gone horribly awry."

It was neat to see the types of tricks that had gotten used in the likes of &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Jumanji&quot;, but I didn&apos;t like the focus on &quot;Independence Day&quot; (one of the worst movies ever made). And really, did ANYONE see that Shaquille O&apos;Neal movie about the genie? \n\nOverall it&apos;s a fun documentary.

Scorsese picked Bottle Rocket as his seventh favorite movie of the decade.  From that point forward, I had to search out and find this movie.  Boy, am I glad that I did.\n\nThe movie Bottle Rocket is a joy.  It is a caper comedy in one respect, but also an interesting look at how the bad brother can talk the good brother into doing the wrong thing.  The second idea sets up some great comedy bits. Owen Wilson as the bad brother, Dignan, is absolutely hilarious.  From this point forward, I will always be interested in seeing him in a movie.  His brother Luke Wilson as the good, yet naive brother, is also very charming. James Caan shows up in the second half of the movie and is fantastic.  The writer/director, Wes Anderson (Rushmore), does a great job of telling an off-beat story and gives his characters great lines to say. \n\nAll in all, Bottle Rocket was a pleasant surprise that I had never heard of. Thank you Martin Scorsese."

It takes place at Christmastime, and having spent Christmas in Rome, the fun-insane carnival atmosphere Fellini depicts is pretty accurate, but exaggerated for film.  Walking around Rome I found subconscious playing back bits of the soundtrack and it was only then that I realized how much I love this film.  It&apos;s also about people who time leave behind.  And about two people who are tragically unable to say how much they do love each other. It&apos;s also very very funny.  Fellini go the idea for the film after seeing his older films butchered on Italian TV.  A highlight is an old woman who was paid not to watch TV for a month.  She&apos;s brought into the studio a mental wreck, swearing she&apos;ll never do it again and promises to watch more and more TV.",

      "reviewBody": "When I was a kid, this was among my favourite movies. The story of an old couple who are finally granted a wish to have a son, only to find he is just as tall as a thumb, is heartwarming and funny. And the naive character of the boy, the clumsy and funny villains, the comic relief characters, all together make this an enchanting tale for kids. \n\nBut for me, the highlight of the entire movie was the yawning man. There were lots of funny setpieces (dancing shoes, a romantic sub plot, ...) to extend the length of the movie, which would otherwise have lasted only half an hour or so, but this one stands out in my mind even today: The animated puppet that sings a yawning song, which makes Tom fall asleep. The song was so good, I have never forgotten it, and better yet: It worked. It was incredibly hard for my entire family not to yawn - not because of boredom, but because there are few things as infective as yawning...\n\nSo while Harry Potter may be the kiddie-movie of the moment, full of expensive special effects and a world famous franchise, it is hard to beat this old classic with the one thing that Harry Potter lacks: A soul.\n\n Few other kid&apos;s movies managed that. Watch &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (with Gene Kelly), or a few of the old Czech fairy tale movies (Salt prince, Cinderella with Hazelnuts), and you won&apos;t be disappointed. They all had what most ultra-slick kid&apos;s movies lack...."

      "reviewBody": "(1971) Dead Men Ride/ Anda muchacho, spara!/ El sol baja la tierra (In Spanish with English subtitles) SPAGHETTI WESTERN\n\nCo-written and directed by Aldo Florio that has a young convict (Fabio Testi) escaping from a prison compound until an impoverished gold miner, Joselito (José Calvo) decides to help and and heal his wounds in his little shack. Jose then names him &quot;muchacho&quot; because he has no identity as he realizes he with a group of slave miners, mining for their boss named Redfield (Eduardo Fajardo) with hired thugs to keep them at bay, so that they do not take their gold dust some place else. Jose manages to hide his gold dust in a secret hideout inside his shack, and decides to hand it to Muchacho so that he can buy the provisions he needs that also includes a gun and a horse. By the time Muchacho comes into town, he searches for a barber named Manolo (Luciano Pigozzi). And at first, Manolo does not recognize him, but as soon as he mentions the name &quot;Emiliano&quot;. Manolo begins to freak out and tries to gun Muchacho while he was sitting on the barber&apos;s chair with a shot gun hidden behind the bar, except that because of the mirror, Muchacho manages to shoot him down first. One of the goons that was also in the &apos;bed and bath&apos; leaves to tell his boss Redfield about this. And the next thing we know, Muchacho is gunning more gunmen who work for Redfield whenever he mutters the name &quot;Emilliano&quot;. And it is not until the very end viewers will understand why.\n\nOut of the entire movie, there is only one interesting gun moment and that is the very first person Muchacho had killed which he manages to shoot and kill someone from behind while sitting on the barber&apos;s chair. The other scenarios, is nothing original or unique we have not seen from other westerns or Spaghetti Westerns for that matter. If i were to see this movie dubbed, my rating might have been lower.",

Of course, they don&apos;t like each other at first - that is, until they find out they&apos;re twins. As they want to get to know their respective other parent, what&apos;s the obvious result?\n\nAlthough the storyline is rather old (&quot;invented&quot; by Erich Kästner in the 1950s), this film, playing in the 1990s, is still amusing and funny. Even touching at some points. Friederike and Floriane Eichhorn as Charlotte and Louise are acting rather well, a number of lines really make you laugh.\n\nI can recommend this film to all people who like comedy/family movies. It&apos;s German only, however!",

However, she proves that she can do something besides &quot;bubbly&quot; and is pretty good in a more edgy role.\n\nTchéky Karyo was excellent as a semi-likable French guy. One common weakness in romantic comedies is that the viewer can&apos;t understand why the &quot;nice girl&quot; would fall in love with the &quot;bad guy.&quot; In this movie, we can she why she loves him and, by the end, we even like him a little too. Good writing and acting.\n\nNot Matthew Broaderick&apos;s best performance... fairly uneven. He doesn&apos;t do &quot;hopelessly in love&quot; very well. Broaderick looked great, even when disheveled. For that matter, all the characters look great.\n\nKelly Preston is pure cardboard but it sort of works because three developed characters are probably enough in a Romantic Comedy.\n\nThe set (the hideout, especially) stole the show. The sound was unusually good for a fluff movie."

It isn&apos;t you being neutral for sure. That being said, there is a lot more to this than just the story that is easy to follow, even if quite complex when it comes to keeping track of all the characters involved.\n\nThe main actress is well known, and she gives quite the performance. You may not entirely agree with all her stances ... you may not like what she stands for or how she conducts herself. You may find her annoying - but she never betrays the inner core of her character.\n\nThere is so much more to this - but at least we get some spy stuff and the suspense is quite high. I kept guessing or rather let it flow ... I reckon I could have seen a lot of things beforehand ... but it was more fun, just letting the movie do the work and just sitting back and letting it flow over me.",

Also, there is some great singing in this movie. Jennifer Rubin&apos;s character sings a song at the end of the movie that I would love to be able to find. The singer, whether or not it truly is her, is terrific. The story line is serious, as is the movie, but anyone who wishes to see Keanu master his dramatic, sad role should definitely see this movie."

The plot has many unusual twists and turns and it&apos;s one of the more unusual Hollywood films of the era.\n\nThe story is set in the town of Jericho. Dave Connors (Cornell Wilde) is a very decent man...working hard as a county prosecutor. And, he&apos;s easy to like and you find yourself rooting for the guy. The problem is that he&apos;s married to a nasty drunk (Ann Dvorak), but he makes the best of it. Even when an old lady friend of his returns to town and she clearly is in love with him and vice-versa, he resists the urge and avoids the woman because he is a faithful, decent man. In addition to this lady coming back to Jericho, an old friend (Kirk Douglas) comes with his gorgeous wife (Linda Darnell)...and she, also, seems very interested in Dave. So where is this all going to end? I bet you couldn&apos;t predict it in your lifetime unless you see the film!\n\nI give this film high marks for originality and acting. While Wilde never rose to the upper echelons of actors, he was excellent here...as was everyone. An interesting and often overlooked film from Twentieth Century-Fox that deserves to be seen.",

      "reviewBody": "Coup de grâce refers, of course, a finality. Often it means a bullet to the head or something similar to make certain the subject is dead. The original title is Der Fangschuß.\n\nIn this German and French language film, covering the period just after World War One, and filmed in a dull black and white that evokes the drab, colorless and perhaps hopeless world for many in the war&apos;s aftermath. Set in ravaged Latvia where the Czar had previously allowed a number of aristocratic wealthy Germans to continue to own estates with sumptuous homes. Among these, Countess Sophie de Reval has allowed herself to become attached to the promise of Communism. Despite the German Empire&apos;s collapse, German troops nevertheless have been stationed in the region, ostensibly to protect the German citizens from Bolshevism. Since this was formerly a part of Mother Russia, many locals want to see the return of Czarist Russia of the past while some hope for a republic and others only wanting an end to all the strife and horror of war. They only desire a peaceful home for themselves and their children. One of the German officers who has returned to his former homeland, happens to be a gentleman the countess has known since childhood. Once they meet, her former passion re-ignites and when he rebuffs her advances, she begins to throw herself at him. Finally, unable to achieve fulfillment with the officer, the countess releases her sexual desires with others, making this a film destined more for adults, despite the fact that there are really no outright graphic sexual scenes. As mentioned earlier, the drab hopelessness of the period is only accentuated by the low-key black and white film production. This is not an action-packed suspense film, but rather a study in human values and emotions during times of trial. One comment is that the subtitles in English are not well- incorporated into the film and many will find them difficult to follow, especially considering that the film does have a number of abrupt changes of scene. For all that, this is a film many will not quickly forget.",

Just like I shouldn&apos;t review a Sci-Fi movie I know I&apos;m not going to enjoy.\n\nA few other Christmas movies I watched were cringeworthy and seemed to have a really cheap budget, but I thought this one was much better. I liked the storyline and also the main characters. I don&apos;t typically leave reviews, but I thought it deserves a higher rating than what it has. You can guess what happens here, but I thought it was well executed and liked watching the story unfold. If you&apos;re into Christmas movies it&apos;s a good one!",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve seen the trailer for this movie, you&apos;re probably thinking it looks hilarious and you&apos;ve made a mental note that it&apos;s one you don&apos;t want to miss.  More often than not, however, the funniest stuff is in the previews, and when you see the whole movie it&apos;s a let-down.  But I&apos;m here to tell you, that is decidedly NOT the case with `Rat Race,&apos; directed by Jerry Zucker, and furthermore, make a mental note:  This movie is hilarious, and one you DO NOT want to miss.  In the tradition of Stanley Kramer&apos;s 1963 BIG comedy hit, `It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,&apos; this one is exactly what it is supposed to be-- Fun (yes, with a capital `F&apos;), and Funny-- with one laugh after another that just keep on a-comin&apos;.\n\nLas Vegas casino owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), likes to offer his elite customers-- the `high rollers&apos;-- something they can&apos;t get anywhere else, in the form of things they can gamble on that are so bizarre you can only imagine.  And the big one he comes up with this time begins with the planting of six lucky tokens in his slot machines.  Those who win the tokens are invited to attend a meeting, at which time Sinclair announces that they are to be the lucky participants in a `race&apos; of sorts.  In a train station locker in the small town of Silver City, New Mexico, there is $2,000,000 waiting for whomever gets to it first.  He passes out six identical keys to the token bearers that will open the locker, shouts `Go!&apos; and they&apos;re off! And Sinclair&apos;s high rollers proceed to put down some big bucks on their favorite horse-- uh, dog!-- uh-- Well, you get the idea...\n\nThe participants include Nick (Breckin Meyer), who is pretty much just a regular guy; NFL referee Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), hated by millions because of a recent botched call; brothers Duane and Blaine Cody (Seth Green, Vince Vieluf), not the brightest bulbs to begin with, and hampered in their communications by Blaine&apos;s newly pierced tongue; a mother, Vera (Whoopi Goldberg), and the daughter she gave up for adoption and with whom she has just reunited, Merrill (Lanei Chapman); Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), who has a hard time making his wife, Bev (Kathy Najimy), and their two kids, Kimberly (Jillian Marie) and Jason (Brody Smith) understand why he&apos;s interrupted their Vegas vacation to drag them off suddenly to New Mexico; and-- last but not least-- Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson), a narcoleptic Italian.  It&apos;s quite the eclectic bunch, and they definitely put on quite a show.\n\nDuring the rush for the gold, they encounter a number of people and situations that drive the laugh meter through the roof, including:  A woman (Kathy Bates) selling squirrels by the roadside (Vera and Merrill); a group of `Lucy&apos; impersonators on their way to some kind of Lucy convention (Owen); a `Barbie&apos; museum that isn&apos;t what it seems, and not a great place for the Jewish Pear family to visit; an errant cow, a hot air balloon and a guy who overhears too much (Duane and Blaine); a jealous helicopter pilot named Tracy (Amy Smart), who buzzes her boyfriend&apos;s house at a most inopportune time (Nick); an ambulance driver, Zack (Wayne Knight), who is transporting a human heart for a transplant, and suffers something akin to the same fate as that famous `cat&apos; due to his curiosity (Enrico).  Zucker and writer Andy Breckman pulled out all the stops with this one, and the result (and there&apos;s much, much, MUCH more than what&apos;s mentioned here) is some pretty wild stuff.\n\nThe secret to making this all work, is above all to keep it moving-- and Zucker certainly does that.  He relies heavily on sight gags and slapstick, and knows how to set up the schtick for a real payoff, which he succeeds at time and again throughout the entire film.  it&apos;s all fairly controlled insanity, and with a couple of exceptions when Zucker wanders into Jim Carrey/Farrelly Brothers territory, it&apos;s pretty easy to swallow.  Most importantly, IT&apos;S FUNNY! with enough different kinds of humor thrown in to satisfy just about any taste.  And that&apos;s a rare thing to be said of any comedy, and it&apos;s a big part of why this one&apos;s such a gem.\n\nThe cast is superb, but the highlights have to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who demonstrates a real knack for comedy; John Cleese, who can make you laugh just by smiling, brandishing as he does a spectacular set of teeth; and Rowan Atkinson, who does some masterful bits of physical comedy, the likes of which rivals the best of Peter Sellers and Buster Keaton.  The way he mugs and moves is absolutely hysterical.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Gloria Allred (Herself), Dave Thomas (Mr. Grisham), Dean Cain (Shawn), Paul Rodriguez (Gus), Brandy Ledford (Vicky), Tristin Leffler (Pierced Girl) and Andrew Kavovit.  One that lives up to it&apos;s expectations and more, `Rat Race&apos; is everything you want it to be, a laugh a minute movie that never lets up, and one that won&apos;t wear your brain out making you think about it too much.  This is pure entertainment that&apos;ll lead you down the road to riot (make that `laugh&apos; riot).  There hasn&apos;t been anything quite like this since Jimmy Durante kicked that bucket and started that other bunch of madcaps off looking for `The big &apos;dub-a-yeh&apos;.&apos;  Zucker and his gang really pulled this one off, and moreover, they did it with style.  And that&apos;s the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "In Manhattan, in a dilapidated building on Mulberry Street, the super Ross (Tim House) has trouble to repair the decayed systems to improve the lives of the tenants. The former boxer Clutch (Nick Damici) is a leader in the building and is anxiously waiting for the return of his beloved daughter Casey (Kim Blair) from a hospital for veterans after serving overseas. He prepares a surprising homecoming party for Casey with his gay neighbor Coco (Ron Brice). Clutch feels an attraction for her neighbor, the single mother and waitress Kay (Bo Corre), and her teenager son Otto (Javier Picayo) respects him like a father. Clutch is also close to Frank (Larry Medish), who is very sick, and his friend Charlie (Larry Fleischman). Meanwhile there is a rat attack in a subway station, followed by two others in different stations, and forcing the Major to showdown the public transport system. Sooner the victims bitten by rats turn into flesh eater mutants, attacking the other human beings and there is an outbreak that puts Manhattan in quarantine. The inhabitants have to fight to survive the attack of the ratlike creatures and Clutch gives his best effort trying to protect Casey and his friends.\n\n&quot;Mulberry Street&quot; is an effective low-budget horror movie that really works. The characters are human, realistic and very well developed, creating an empathy with the viewer; the plot is simple but explains the origin of the outbreak; and the attack of the horde of mutants is gruesome and claustrophobic, recalling 1968 &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;REC&quot;. There is no final redemption in the non-commercial end, and for me it is another plus in this good film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Infecção em Nova York&quot; (&quot;Infection in New York&quot;)",

We walks in alone, unescorted and as soon as he walks in there is an unexplainable silence in the court, and to everyone&apos;s surprise the Judge, stands up in respect of the accused ! Seeing him do this the barristers and rest also stand up. This scene though may seem insignificant on paper is one without which this entire movie would have been incomplete. To know whyread on ! \n\nOn day of 2nd October they play this movie every year on DD National, Richard Attenborough&apos;s Gandhi. I never watched it whenever it was shown since 20 years of 2nd Octobers I had seen. The first few years because I couldn&apos;t understand and the next few because I felt that though it&apos;s a multiple Oscar winner, how could at the end of the day, a British person understand and do justice to an Indian icon ? After so many years I finally broke the ice and saw the movie in totality right from the first scene of Nathuram Godse, to Hey Ram, and I understood that Gandhi was as British, as much a part of Britain&apos;s history as he was of India&apos;s, in fact an outsider judged the person better than we ourselves could, hence without doubt this is a masterpiece, because it was always meant to be. \n\nRichard Attenborough like all directors worth their salt uses visual aid as a medium to replace conventional dialogue delivery at times. A picture is worth a thousand words and a scene without words is worth a million. Like the first scene I described and others. In one scene towards the end of the movie, Gandhiji starts a fast until death to stop the communal riots post independence and Nehru goes to meet him. A crowd had gathered near his residence and one of the person in the crowd shouted a suggestion, &apos;Why don&apos;t they kill Gandhi ?&apos;, Nehru furiously jumps into the crowd to search for this person and the camera moves in the crowd and for a briefest time and quite unmistakably you spot Nathuram Godse in the crowd. This made me think, &apos;hey this is what I call good cinema!&apos;.\n\nSo what about the outsider theory ? Well you see if Rajkumar Santoshi, Yash Chopra, Raj Kapoor or Mani Ratnam had made this movie they would have fallen under the pressure and the unbearably weight of historical facts, Richard had that advantage. Someone quite ignorant about Indian culture was telling a story of an Indian to an audience even more ignorant. What I mean is that there are things which are skewed up, characters gone wrong and famous words mouthed by someone else. For example the writer has messed the character of the Patel Siblings. Vallabhbhai Patel was never an extrovert and never as polished as shown in the movie, but someone else was and it was his more Birtish, yet less famous elder brother Vithalbhai who in fact introduced Vallabh to Indian movement. Again it is a known fact that Vallabhai continued the Dandi march after Gandhi&apos;s arrest, the fact which is ignored. Once again the characters of Kriplani, Maulana Azad etc are all skewed. But at the end of it works, why, because Richard&apos;s view is focused. I would notice these mistakes because I am an Indian aware of this, a person in England may never find out and even if he does he would consider it as trivial because this is a story of Gandhi and not the Indian freedom struggle. People say that unnecessary importance is given to foreign characters in Gandhi&apos;s life like Margret, Rev. Charlie, Walker, Miraben, but I would say it is necessary because these people did influence Gandhi and made him an international personality which he is. \n\nBut before I end my take on this movie I must comment on the characterization. Starting with Ben Kinsley as Gandhi. To tell you the truth when I first saw him as Mohandas KG in the train I was shocked, he didn&apos;t look like Gandhi which I imagined, but as the movie goes ahead I changed my opinion. Ben worked because of multiple reasons. The first he is a British Gujarati, Gandhi was gujarati who did his law in England so both speak the same language, Partly British English with unmistakable Gujarati overtones. Second all other characterization of Gandhis in the history are shown as fragile creatures without clothes. Ben did carry some more body than others and which made Gandhi look more real , more alive. Also he had an infectious little smile which works because Gandhi in many was a jovial happy person who smiled a lot , a kind smile of calm which no one but Ben Kinsley brought out ! Of the other characters, Martin Sheen as Walker was impressive, so were Lord Erwin, Gen Dyer, Margrets, Nehru and Miraben&apos;s characters. Rohini Hattangidi as Kasturba does a remarkable job too, though she was shown a little more extroverted than Kasturba was , maybe. \n\nAs a whole to sum it up, this is one hell of a beautiful movie experience. If you missed it this 2nd October don&apos;t forget to tune into it the next."

      "reviewBody": "Brain Dead is many things, including a mess, but with an ambitious story which is enough to hide the idiocy (mostly), it becomes a fairly enjoyable mess.\n\nDr. Rex Martin is a renowned brain surgeon who is approached one day by a representative of the Eunice corporation. One of the corporation&apos;s best mathematicians has gone Brain Dead, but there are still some numerical data locked in the back of his mind which Eunice wants. Dr. Martin is asked to operate, but as he manages to tap into the patient&apos;s mind, he triggers something in his own. He starts behaving strangely. What follows is a seemingly endless series of dreams and illusions that follows the old rhetorical &apos;what is fantasy and what is reality&apos; question.\n\nAs messy as Brain Dead is, it&apos;s not dull. The question is whether you enjoy being confused. Making do with a fragmented budget, first time director Adam Simon has constructed the film with a kind of post-modern sci-fi approach. There are times when it resembles some of David Cronenberg&apos;s early work, which shows that the film has intellectual potential, but I would&apos;nt call Brain Dead an intelligent film. Then again, next to Carnosaur (simon&apos;s proceeding feature) This is actually pretty brilliant. \n\nIf I am interpreting correctly, it looks as if Brain Dead is trying to say that the brain is not merely a vital organ, it is a living thing. Whether I am right or not, means nothing. You can interpret this film any way you want.",

      "name": "The movie does not work, but Kajol makes a confident debut",
      "reviewBody": "I was quite curious to see this movie for quite some time. First, it is the film debut of the talented Kajol. Secondly, it is directed by Rahul Rawail, some of whose films I had really enjoyed watching, and other than that, I had seen some clips from the film which looked worthy. But then I watched it, and I was completely disappointed. Bekhudi is pretty much the typical Hindi melodrama. It is one of those countless Hindi films centring around star-crossed lovers whose love is impossible blah blah blah, and follows their struggle to be together against all odds. The film, though starts pretty well, fails for the most part and suffers from extremely poor writing. The story is filled with clichés and the proceedings are ancient. That said, there were also a few points which made it watchable. First, Kajol. She made a confident debut and tried her very best throughout the film. Her character is that of a decisive and stubborn young girl and though it is nowhere close to being a particularly good performance, one could foresee the great actress that she would become seeing her dedication to the role. Secondly, Nadeem-Shravan composed a great soundtrack of some melodious songs. Asha Bhosle was the voice of Kajol and sang all the songs beautifully. The film also marked the debut of Kamal Sadanah, who played Kajol&apos;s boyfriend. He was also pretty good, though it was one of the few films he has appeared in and no one really knows who he is today. The supporting cast includes Kajol&apos;s real-life mother Tanuja as her mother, and Farida Jalal, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Vijayendra Ghatge, among others. All of them were quite okay in their unimpressive roles. To sum it up, Bekhudi is not worth your time, but if you are a Kajol fan, you can take this one to watch her very first performance in a film. I think this reason is good enough.",

Since I knew it had been cut and restored, I was pointedly looking for stand-alone scenes that only fleshed out the characters but weren&apos;t integral to the extremely complex storyline.  There weren&apos;t any.  Every single scene contained some important bit of information that cast light on and helped make sense of something elsewhere in the movie.\n\nEver since then, I&apos;ve been patiently waiting for this director&apos;s cut to show up on VHS, LD, or DVD -- and refusing to watch the theatrical cut!  It&apos;s been 15 years and I&apos;m still waiting.  But I would certainly think that eventually this will come out on DVD, and we can al hope and pray that it will do so in the full version.",

Aaron is given the chance to wrangle Aldous for his big chance.\n\nThe Judd Apatow friends gather together to do another hilarious movie. Russell Brand is wonderously wild and childlike. Jonah Hill is a great straight man, charmingly funny and sweet. The combo is a home run. Even P Diddy is great as the bombastic exec. Jonah and Elisabeth Moss are hilarious together in the beginning. The Sarah Marshall call back is hilarious. But it&apos;s not just all hilarity. Aldous has real personal problems and not just about the drugs. It&apos;s a wonderful mix of heart and comedy.

      "reviewBody": "Destination Tokyo (1943)\n\nWhile not officially a propaganda film (it&apos;s not endorsed or paid for by the government), this is one of many films the studios put out to basically join the effort, putting their shoulder to the wheel. It&apos;s not a great film for our times mostly because it&apos;s overflowing with lessons, with the propagandistic style of persuading us the Japanese were bad and the U.S. soldiers, with all their wonderful flaws, were out to save us.\n\nI say this first because it&apos;s a lot of baggage to wade through. The other side to this coin is an adventure war movie where Cary Grant is in charge of a submarine out for a special mission. It&apos;s well paced, generally well acted (the cast is filled with lesser actors along with the main three). John Garfield is an average sailor with a big role, and big ego that grates on some of the other sailors. But he tells ribald stories that they can&apos;t help listening to. The one older actor is the cook played by character actor Alan Hale, who is appropriately comic.\n\nSo, what you get is some very talented people explaining the current events, including lots of anti-Japanese chat. The interior shots in the sub are fairly realistic (though from what I read, an actual sub is far more cramped). The outside stuff varies a lot in quality. The shots of the sub underwater are painfully crude models in water tanks. Some of the landscapes are also invented in the studio and you can tell.\n\nWhat carries it at all is a sense of danger and necessity. These men have to succeed to defeat evil. Remember (of course) the audience at the time had a very black and white view of the war, and of the enemies. They were anxious for confirmation that we were capable of such things, and that the enemy (Japan, but also Germany is discussed) is fundamentally wrong—they lack freedoms, the woman are simply alive to bear children, no free press, etc.\n\nWhy did I watch it? Cary Grant. I&apos;m curious about his range, and his being corralled into this kind of vehicle. I&apos;m guessing he was partly interested in helping the war effort, and partly under contract. And you know what? He&apos;s great. He plays it straight, and he&apos;s smart, confident, warm, complex. If you like Grant, you might like this movie just for that reason.\n\nAnother thing to say overall: it gets better as it goes. The set up in the first half is a bit obvious and sometimes stiff or slow. But there is a medical emergency which is pretty great, and then there is the general operation in Tokyo Harbor. It&apos;s all dramatic and well done by first-time director Delmar Daves. Yeah, it&apos;s got a lot of dated script to wade through, but the best of it is great war stuff best remembered for its context.",

Throw together a bunch of facts interspersed with talking heads - so that a gullible audience doesn&apos;t notice that the information isn&apos;t connected at all. \n\nThe film portrays the debt crisis in Greece as an element of cannibal capitalism through privatization and lists Chile, Russia, Thatcherist Britain and East Germany in one breath as examples. Chile was a CIA-fostered coup aimed at curbing Communist expansion; the Soviet Union was bankrupted in the course of the arms race with the US, which enabled new private banks to sell and confiscate assets for a pittance - which is how the oligarchy started; and Greece went several times over the Euro stability criteria to finance political promises and the Olympics, thereby increasing its borrowing costs until the crisis hit. Thatcherism is, indeed, a perfect example of neoliberal capitalism, but in this film, all kinds of non-connected things are thrown together to create the illusion of a global conspiracy. Your head will spin over movie clips, snippets of Slavoj Zizek and Naomi Klein, and how they connect Greece with British rail privatization and Enron.\n\nI can only determine the full scope of disinformation here on the bits about Germany. The &quot;experts&quot; consulted here are with one exception members of &quot;Die Linke&quot;, the follow-up of the sole East German party SED. Which means these people were part / benefited from the ruling elite, and since they lost their privileges upon reunification, they have created their own mythology about evil West Germany taking over the innocent East. No word about East Germans being adopted into the Western pension fund and health insurance scheme, financed by a &quot;solidarity tax&quot; of 5.5% on top of income tax - until today! No word about the &quot;Länderausgleich&quot; which obliges states like Bavaria, which generate a budget surplus, to finance states on a deficit, which are the Eastern ones. \n\nBut of course, for Greeks Germany and the EU are evil because they insisted on compliance with the Euro stability pact before agreeing to bail them out. Yet had the evil Troika not pressured Greece into this and chosen Grexit instead, there would have been state bankruptcy, and no bank would have vouched for Greek debt. The Greeks would have had to negotiate a deal with private equity funds like Argentina, they would have returned to the Drachma leading to hyperinflation, and the overall situation would have been way worse than it is now. But hey, those are facts, and who gives a damn about those these days. You&apos;ll either applaud this fact manipulation because it fits your view of the world, or you&apos;ll shake your head over people believing this nonsense.",

In the beginning I was close to stop watching. Too many unrealistic and improbable actions. I can&apos;t go into details because that would give away too much (spoiler alert). Going into the second half, however, things became more interesting. I came away pleased with sitting it through. Someone remarked that there was a hidden feminist angle, which I can&apos;t agree on. Definitely, the movie took a swipe on fanatical and bigoted religious beliefs. I found it entertaining and thought-provoking.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;So weit die Füsse tragen&quot; - translated in English &quot;As far as the feet can carry&quot; came out in 2001 and was kind of flop in Germany. The movie has some good actors in it, like Michael Mendl, Hans Peter Hallwachs and also the main actor, Bernhard Betterman, does a good job. Its a story of a single german POW Clemens Forell, who escapes from prisoners camp in siberia and walks thousands of kilometers to the border of Iran, where he would be in safety of the sovjets. It was a true story, and in the 50ies a very popular TV series (much popular than this movie) was made of it. I did not like that movie very much. I think there were just to much thinks mixed together - a love-story, the plot with russian smugglers, the scenes with Forells family and much more. It could not really concentrate on one topic: the hard conditions of war prisoners in Germany and adventurous scenes were put together - in a bit cheesy hollywood-like style. That works in Germany with american movies, but not with german ones. And so it could not satisfy german watchers: For people interested in politics or history of that time, it contained not enough information; for blockbuster watchers was not enough action in it. Thats why I think this movie is even better for foreign watchers: they get a bit about german history, but theres some adventure to and it never gets to deep that they cant understand some things.

      "reviewBody": "The American professor of literature and novelist Tom Hicks (Ethan Hawke) travels to Paris to see his beloved daughter Chloé (Julie Papillon) that lives with her mother Nathalie (Delphine Chuillot). However, Nathalie uses the restraining order to call the police and avoid letting Tom to meet Chloé. \n\nTom flees from the police and takes a bus but he is tired and sleeps. When he awakes in a poor neighborhood, he finds that his luggage and money were robbed. He goes to a bar and the Polish waitress Ania (Joanna Kulig) brings a coffee for him. He asks for a room and explains that he had been robbed and she asks him to talk with the owner Sezer (Samir Guesmi) that allows him to stay in a very low budget room and pay him later. Then Sezer offers a job of night watchman in a suspect building. \n\nOne day, Tom goes to a bookstore and is invited to a party with writers where he meets Margit Kadar (Kristin Scott Thomas), who is a translator and widow of a Hungarian writer. She gives her address and telephone to Tom. Soon Tom has a love affair with Margit at her apartment and with Ania on the roof of the bar. But Tom is also obsessed by his daughter, snooping around Chloé during the days. When his next door neighbor at the hotel that is blackmailing Tom is found dead, his only alibi is Margit. But when the police officers go to her place, they discover that she had committed suicide many years ago.\n\n&quot;La femme du Vème&quot; is one of those movies like &quot;Triangle&quot; where there is no explanation for bizarre and surrealistic situations. I am not sure whether the director Pawel Pawlikowski had this intention or not, but forget any explanation about the plot and simply enjoy (or not) the movie. \n\nDavid Lynch is the master of this style while Claude Chabrol was the French master of thrillers with open endings to make the viewer think and discuss possibilities. But this is the practically unknown Pawel Pawlikowski and I was disappointed with the lack of conclusion of the good plot. But as an unconditional fan of Kristin Scott Thomas and Ethan Hawke, I do not regret this strange experience. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Estranha Obsessão&quot; (&quot;Weird Obsession&quot;)",

It all seemed so random - just random ghosts at random times coming after random people in random ways and doing random things with them, all for no apparent reason. The characters were pretty much text-book cookie-cutter. There were entirely too many full-on face shots where the heads of the characters filled up the entire screen, back &amp; forth between them. I never realized how annoying that could be, but I&apos;ve never seen that kind of shot so over-used before. There is no discernible story, just a bunch of disjointed, discombobulated &quot;fragments&quot;. Not very well plotted. If you don&apos;t care too much about story but just like seeing people scream &amp; ghosts go, &quot;Boo!&quot;, this will do it for you. But if you&apos;re looking for an interesting or engaging story of some sort, this really doesn&apos;t cut it.",

The performances are all horrifically over the top, the plot is ridiculous, there are terrible country songs, and, on at least one occasion, a &quot;tree&quot; that moves when leaned against. \n\nIf anyone ever tries to tell you that Gordy is &quot;a good family film&quot; or &quot;almost as good as Babe&quot; or any such thing, don&apos;t talk to that person anymore.

      "name": "Excellent adaptation of the Robert Lewis Stevenson novella",
      "reviewBody": "We should always beware when Hollywood attempts to &quot;update&quot; the classics, and we are usually disappointed when they do. The new film &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the exception to the rule. Though the original novella was considered groundbreaking and shocking for it&apos;s time, by today&apos;s standards it is tame and not as earth shattering as it once was. Perhaps this is because of the many stage, and film adaptations based on the original work. Most are dull and boring. To be sure, there are some classic movies and television plays, including the great, silent John Barrymore version, the wonderful Frederick March film, and the Dan Curtis produced TV version starring Jack Palance. We may now add a new winning adaptation to the lexicon of Jekyll and Hyde. This is a contemporary retelling of the story and this adaptation takes some liberties in translating it to the screen. --But then again, what screen adaptations don&apos;t take liberties? This is a fun, fast paced, horror film that delivers the goods! Writer/director John Carl Buechler is no stranger to horror icons. He directed Friday the 13th part 7, and created the stunning visual and make-up effects for numerous horror classics in the 1980&apos;s, including; Nightmare on Elm Street, and the Halloween movie franchises. In many ways he has structured is vision of the literary classic as a sort of retro nod to those vintage eighties horror pix. It is fast, furious, often funny, and absolutely terrifying at times. In the first few minutes of the movie, the screen explodes with action, mystery and gore. I don&apos;t want to reveal the excellent new slant this picture brings to light, but suffice to say the picture is both inventive and spine tingling. Perhaps the reason that this picture works so well is that as an independent film, it was made on a modest budget, with no studio interference. Either way, Tony Todd is great in the dual roles of Jekyll and Hyde, his ability to combine humor and pathos is nothing less than genius. Se it on the big screen with a full house if you can.",

The picture evokes a feeling of sorrow for the young Frank McCourt, in a tale that never has any definite answers, it just leaves them open. The acting is superb, mainly by Emily Watson as the loving mother Angela McCout and Robert carlyle who gives his best performance since Trainspotting here as the father with almost three different personalities.  We watch as young Frank goes through three periods of his life in the poverish Ireland and thankfully in the end everything turns out OK.  This makes the film even better.  Along with a gentle and moving score (by oscar winner John Williams), this film is very provocative, touching and dramatic.  Well done.",

So did my 7 year old grandchild. Why haven&apos;t they been making movies like this for years?\n\nUsually when I take a child to the movies, I am saddened by the experience. Where are all the wonderful, wholesome productions of yesteryear that entertained one and educated at the same time? This movie did both. My grandchild knew nothing about the Depression, so I explained the time in very simple terms. She seemed to get it, and loved the way the story had a good ending where the main character had a personal triumph and a family endured adversity.\n\nTake your kids to see this movie. You will be proud and not embarrassed.",

My wife is American but lived in Belgium for thirteen years and with English subtitles she could easily follow the movie and understood almost all the expressions. But that&apos;s because she lived here. Even after all those years Dikkenek came out in the theaters a lot of my friends still use some of the classic phrases out of Dikkenek, and almost everybody immediately knows it&apos;s from the movie. François Damiens better known as François l&apos;Embrouille with his sketches on Youtube proves again he is a really good comedian. His mimics can only be done by him. Jean-Luc Couchard plays also a very good role in Dikkenek, with his typical arrogant know-it-all bully character from Brussels. To me those two are the absolute top in Dikkenek. The rest of the cast is also good so there is not much bad to say about this movie. Maybe the story is a bit simple, but it is supposed to be a parody on the typical characters from Brussels so the story doesn&apos;t really matter. I could watch this movie over and over again, it always makes me laugh.",

Because if these putrid few comments are all this rendition gets then....Popeye is nearly dead. Long live Popeye. My six year old grandson that we are raising loved this CGI version because I had bought many DVD&apos;s of Popeye, from the original greats to the boring 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s stuff. He enjoyed them all, mostly. He enjoyed this one, too. He laughed and watched me laugh. BUT the few (2) comments here shows how popeye has died. God and man rest his soul. A legend gone. Only a memory,soon to be forgotten. History. Sad but true.\n\nLong live Popeye, my hero. Sincerely, Jeff Johns, and Nathan Dale McKee Thank you, Ezekiel Norton, Jim Hardison and Paul Reiser. I loved Popeye, too. I know y&apos;all did.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary is an excellent portrayal of the life of Charles Darwin. It illustrates how his writing of the book, &quot;On The Origin Of Species&quot; in 1859 was the product of his interpretation of various scholarly works of the time but also his own inquisitive nature as well as some personal tragedies in his family. It also shows the shortcomings of some of his assumptions wherein his personal world view affected his opinions and writings, and how the light of modern science shows up some inconsistencies in his theorizing.\n\nCinematography includes on-site footage of the Galapagos Islands and other parts of South America, with species of tortoise, iguanas (including naturally occurring hybrids) and various bird species.\n\nRe-enactments of the life and times of Darwin depict him as a boy, a young man and various other times of life right up to his more well-known depiction as an aged gentleman.\n\nInterviews of modern scientists and historians give a balanced view of Darwin&apos;s scientific ability. As these experts come from a range of belief systems, the viewer is left to make up their own mind on the theories that Darwin postulated, and the film helps to foster a desire to explore the origins of life for oneself and to make up one&apos;s own mind about the deep mysteries of the origins of life that Darwin sought to address.",

Nothing much new here, dredging up a lot of the usual gangster/revenge/fish out of water motifs, but it does a decent job of pulling you in and manages a certain freshness despite the familiarity of the material. Some of the larger dramatic scenes are painfully clichéd, but it&apos;s pieced together nicely and has some pretty good character moments. I get the feeling Turgul is a more talented director than a writer. Sener Sem (who I just realized was also in that lousy &quot;Rascals&quot; movie I recently watched) is a likable fellow, and his rapport with Ugur Yucel works well. Overall it&apos;s a somewhat mediocre film, but quite watchable with flashes of potential.",

Eventually, Cochran&apos;s on their trail... one sled after another.... but the best scenes had occurred back at the neat looking, matte-painted town during his dark-eyed attempt at seducing the assertive ingenue...\n\nHenderson, far prettier without the caked-on, circus clown makeup, is a bland match for Hudson but has terrific anti-chemistry against Cochran, who outwardly looks the leading man but usually plays the heavy...\n\nFrom cheating with Virginia Mayo first against Dana Andrews in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES and then James Cagney in WHITE HEAT, he&apos;s always great at not being a good person, and is much better than Rock is the hero, headlining this particular ride while it&apos;s Marcia Henderson&apos;s vehicle throughout.",

      "reviewBody": "Pane e tulipani or Bread and Tulips is a wonderful Italian movie. The story is told in a way only a European can, you would never find such a movie in Hollywood. There are no special effects, no gadgets, no fast cars, ... nothing you would probably find in it if this was a Hollywood production. The characters are the real stars in this movie, together with all the streets and canals of Venice. \n\nIt&apos;s about a middle aged, neglected housewife and mother who is left behind by her family on a bus trip. Her family doesn&apos;t even notice she&apos;s missing until two hours later. She decides to hitch-hike home and she meets different people. To one of them she says that she has never been to Venice, but that she really would like to see it. The man suggests to bring her to Venice instead of driving her home and so her adventure begins. She meets some interesting people and in one way or another she always influences their lives. But not only their lives change, her life is influenced by it as well. \n\nI guess this must sound incredibly boring to some people, but it really isn&apos;t. I enjoyed the movie - which can be seen as a modern fairy tale or as a real story - a lot. I guess it all depends from the viewer. Do you believe finding real love, when it&apos;s not supposed to happen to you, could actually happen? Personally I do, but I&apos;m a real optimist, so perhaps that&apos;s why I liked it so much. It might also be because it gives a very optimistic view towards life.\n\nI guess the real strength of this movie lies in the fact that even after the movie has ended, you are still thinking about it. The story is simple, very universal, but also subtle and deep.\n\nI could talk for hours about this movie, but I guess you&apos;ll have to see it for yourself. My advice to everybody, but especially to the people who love Italy as much as I do: Sit down, relax and enjoy. I give it a 8.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Look I love &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos; as much as the next guy, and think it&apos;s one of the few movies of the 1990s that can truly be considered a classic. But I think comparing that movie to &apos;The Way Of The Gun&apos; (Christopher McQuarrie wrote both and directs this in an impressive debut) is unproductive and misguided. Both movies feature criminal anti-heroes and tricky plot twists, but in different ways, and are very different in approach and theme. McQuarrie isn&apos;t repeating himself here, this is something new. Something that has more in common with Sam Peckinpah than the plethora of shallow post-Tarantino rip-offs Hollywood has foisted on us in recent years.\n\nThe basic premise is fairly straightforward - two losers &quot;Parker&quot; (A surprisingly effective Ryan Phillipe in easily his best role to date) and &quot;Longbaugh&quot; (the always excellent Benicio Del Toro), cook up a half baked scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis - &apos;Cape Fear&apos;, &apos;Kalifornia&apos;) and hold her for ransom. Little do they realize that she is carrying a child for Chidduck,  a Mob money launderer (veteran character actor Scott Wilson - &apos;In Cold Blood&apos;, &apos;The Ninth Configuration&apos;) who has some nasty associates, and is reluctant to pay up.\n\nThe guys soon find themselves embroiled in a chinese puzzle of relationships including ruthless bodyguards Jeffers (Taye Digs - &apos;Go&apos;) and Obecks (Nicky Katt - &apos;SubUrbia&apos;, &apos;The Limey&apos;), and Chidduck&apos;s bagman and troubleshooter, the complex Sarno (the legendary James Caan - &apos;The Godfather&apos;, &apos;Thief&apos;), and Sarno&apos;s colleague Abner (frequent Clint Eastwood sidekick, and Juliet&apos;s real life father, Geoffrey Lewis).   \n\nTo reveal what happens would be to ruin this wonderful movie. &apos;The Way Of The Gun&apos; isn&apos;t a stupid popcorn action flick. It requires thought and attention to fully appreciate, and that fact, along with the lack of heroes, and the matter of fact violence, seems to have turned many people off. But in my opinion it is just those factors that will make this, like &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos;, a movie that will stand the test of time. \n\nAlong with &apos;Chopper&apos;, the movie that has impressed the most so far this decade. Don&apos;t miss either one!"

Yes it&apos;s that kind of movie. \n\nThe movie is a shot for shot parody of Blood Rayne 3. I think you can guess what the joke is from that horrendous title.\n\nSadly this movie only works as an inside joke as all the &quot;funny&quot; bits were simply to change one thing from the shot of the original movie. If you don&apos;t have that movie memorize or even bothered to see it then you won&apos;t get the joke... and see how anti humor it is. \n\nMake no mistake. This movie is offensive and the director went that extra mile to humiliate the lead actress for being plus size because.... I don&apos;t know maybe he thinks pointing at people that aren&apos;t stick figures is funny? It&apos;s a shame because she&apos;s actually good and totally wasted in this heap of trash. \n\nThen you have Willam Belli who is simply FABULOUS! but no, here he is made to act the typical 90&apos;s gay friend and then black face... there is an actor with black face in a 2011 movie. I&apos;m serious!\n\nThis movie was bad, offensive and weird. If you know what you&apos;re in for then you&apos;ll get a few laughs out of it. Mostly for the wrong reasons but you can still have some stupid fun with it. \n\nIf on the other hand you are unfamiliar with this director&apos;s work or blood rayne then take out your electric fan and will the stench of this heap away. You WILL hate it .",

The film consists of a lot of archival documentary footage, with the Freud character commenting on how events unfolded from a psychological/sociological viewpoint. It&apos;s not a dry history lesson, but rather a fascinating deconstruction of this portion of Russian and world history. The film itself deconstructs toward the end, as the fourth wall is broken. I&apos;d say this wouldn&apos;t have worked if it was drawn out any longer than the hour it runs. As it is, a fascinating examination of a country that&apos;s, at best, an unwilling patient.",

      "name": "Exemplary direction lifts an offbeat futuristic thriller",
      "reviewBody": "This futuristic thriller disposes of much of the sci-fi jargon we&apos;ve come to expect from Hollywood films. There are no outlandish gadgets or chases through CGI-created landscapes; CHILDREN OF MEN, based on a novel by P. D. James, is a realistic thriller through and through. It&apos;s set in a recognisable dystopia (full of violence, poverty, disease, segregation and warfare) and the story follows a strict &apos;journey&apos; template, following a group of characters as they travel through myriad locales, suffering death, defeat and adventure along the way. So far, so predictable. However, this film works because it&apos;s literate, it&apos;s intelligent and the focus is on storytelling over flashy special effects or action nonsense.\n\nMexican director Alfonso Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) is a force to watch out for on the strength of his work here: this is the best direction I&apos;ve seen in a long while and the film is chock-full of great tracking shots which really emphasise the excitement and danger around every corner. The view of a future UK is nightmarish and believable and the backgrounds and locations are as much a character as the protagonists themselves.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that the film remains as unconventional as possible as it moves along. Clive Owen, the heroic protagonist, never fires a gun and is definitely an everyman character rather than a hero: he&apos;s utterly believable and this is the best role I&apos;ve seen the actor in yet. Supporting actors are good, but it&apos;s the older heavyweights who give the best turns: Julianne Moore, as likable as she&apos;s ever been, as a terrorist leader; Pam Ferris as an ally; Michael Caine as an aged John Lennon-type. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also very strong in a minor role. The film does have action, including a ferocious fire fight at the climax, but it&apos;s never an action film per se. It&apos;s just a great movie that avoids pigeon-holing and never left me bored or underwhelmed once.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is excellent if you take it for what it is - a thin but pleasant comical storyline as an excuse for what turns out to be practically a revue of MGM&apos;s lesser stars of the day, plus two great stars - Laurel and Hardy - that didn&apos;t even work for the studio. However, Hal Roach did distribute his films through MGM, thus the boys do show up in a couple of MGM films of this era. Also, Disney&apos;s Mickey Mouse shows up for a comedic bit. I&apos;d love to know how MGM ever worked that out with Walt.\n\nThe jist of the plot is that Schnarzan (Durante) is losing his audience for his jungle jaunt movies since the death of his original lion. People think that the subsequent lions he wrestles in his films are flimsy excuses for courageous carnivores and box office receipts are beginning to drop. His producer says that he can guarantee a hit if Durante can procure one or more of the lions of the famous Baron Munchausen who is a renowned hunter of wild beasts. Durante decides to wine and dine the baron at his mansion and give a big party in his honor.\n\nThere are a couple of very good precode musical numbers in this film including the title song featuring scantily clad chorus girls in various states of undressing/dressing and singing and dancing telephone operators dressed up in weird metallic outfits. At the party Lupe Valez spars with Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges put in an appearance back when they were still with Ted Healy, and there is an early musical cartoon number involving chocolate soldiers with music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. Finally there are Charles Butterworth and Polly Moran as a wealthy oil magnate and his wife who have some hilarious moments.\n\nIf you don&apos;t know who any of the people I just mentioned are, you are probably not going to like this film. If you know who all or most of them are you are sure to enjoy it as one of the last pre code films made, released just one month before strict enforcement of the code began.",

You&apos;re sucked into the whole atmosphere, to the characters - both the good and the bad -, and it really eats you up and leaves you with this bundle of emotions that catch you off guard and in the end, leave you empty-handed.\n\nI&apos;m sorry for not being very precise about the plot and the characters, but I simply can&apos;t write an ordinary &quot;this film opens with...&quot; review, the experience was just too much.\n\nI highly recommend it, but not for the weak-hearted.",

He has a beautiful young wife played by Janet Leigh who adores everything about him and a toddler son as well. When an army buddy played by Robert Ryan unexpectedly shows up, it throws Heflin&apos;s little paradise into chaos. His wartime history emerges, presenting a disturbing picture of cowardice and betrayal, things he&apos;s kept hidden from everyone, including his wife, but which his own conscience and Ryan as well, won&apos;t let him escape. It turns out Ryan&apos;s been trailing him from coast to coast. Heflin&apos;s disintegration is awesome, one of the finest acting jobs ever. It&apos;s all perfectly capped off when he&apos;s trying to explain what happened to his unbelieving wife. He winds up on LA&apos;s skid row, meeting a party girl who&apos;s seen much better days played by Mary Astor, who gets him to confide in her and introduces him to Johnny (Berry Kroeger), someone who can arrange to have all his problems taken care of for a hefty price. The conclusion, a classic western style noir showdown on a breezy night on the railroad tracks, is beautifully done.",

The family faces the Rape of Nanking by the Imperial Japanese Army, with rapes, mass murder of prisoners of war and civilians including women, children and elders, and disrespect of international conventions. \n\n&quot;Nanjing 1937&quot; is one of the most realistic films of a dirty war unknown for Westerners, the &quot;Nanjing Massacre&quot;, a.k.a. the Rape of Nanking and produced by John Woo. The direction of Ziniu Wu is impressive and gives the sensation of a documentary to the viewer. Unfortunately this film has been released only on VHS in Brazil. I saw this great film for the first time on 14 March 2000 and today I have seen it again. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Tempos de Guerra&quot; (&quot;Times of War&quot;)",

The haunted leader, the bald black man, the inexplicable hot blonde chick, and the eccentric guy, who in this case thinks he&apos;s Butch Cassidy (including hat and six shooter).\n\nAnother is, this was made in Canada and many of the actors portraying Americans speak with a Doug and Bob MacKenzie accent, kinda weird eh? On the plus side, there is a far too long strip tease sequence performed by what looked to be an up and coming porn star (this accounts for my second star).\n\nThey obviously had some money to spend but the lousy acting, hokey cartoon alien and woeful, annoying &quot;on the nose&quot; dialogue drag this thing deeper than the underwater tomb their monster allegedly came from.",

This is a beautifully produced film with amazing credits, directed by Karel Reisz, written by Harold Pinter, cinematography by Freddie Francis, and starring Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons.\n\nI should have liked this film more than I did, although I did enjoy it. It&apos;s beautiful to look at, shot mostly in Lyme Regis on the south coast of England, it focuses on actors making a movie in contemporary times; and the story of that movie, which takes place in Victorian England. Basically, two love stories involving the Meryl and Jeremy characters, one story seemingly tragic, barreling however toward a happy ending; the other, a modern story, ending unhappily, at least for Jeremy. Sometimes, it&apos;s almost very briefly unclear at first, which story you are actually watching, which is a nice touch. I liked it but probably would have liked it more, had I seen it in 1981.\n\nLike the Jeanne Moreau character&apos;s sailor in The Sailor from Gibraltar, one wonders if the French lieutenant really existed.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always felt that when you fictionalize a story about war, you dishonor the memory of so many people who have a compelling story to tell by choosing to make something up instead *cough*privateryan*cough*.\n\nThe problem with war movies about real people is that you have to deal with complexities of character and plot that the genre simply doesn&apos;t lend itself easily to.\n\nSo when the story at hand aims to pose questions like &quot;what does it mean to do the wrong things for the right reasons&quot; and tries to debunk the popular myth of herodom, there&apos;s very little margin for error.\n\nEnter Clint Eastwood. Never one to shy away from challenging stories, this is a much bigger effort than his usual understated character dramas. On the one hand, it doesn&apos;t &quot;feel&quot; like a Clint Eastwood movie, but on the other, it feels at home in his themes of used-up heroes -- the person behind the larger than life persona. These are complex characters in very difficult situations, and he presents them in a way that&apos;s straightforward and non-judgmental, so we&apos;re left to decide the answers to the film&apos;s central conflicts ourselves.\n\nTo a person, the cast is up to the challenge. It&apos;s hard not to admire Ryan Phillippe for a restrained and thoughtful performance, but the real kudos go to Adam Beach. Almost every aspect of Beach&apos;s character is cliché, with one minor exception - that&apos;s really the way Ira Hayes was. So the challenge was to portray Hayes as a real person despite the cliché, and the result is one of the most heartbreaking and troubling performances in the film. Here&apos;s a guy who is portrayed as a hero, who really has no answers at all.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot not to like about the film. It&apos;s not &quot;entertaining&quot; per se, in the same way that any war memorial in DC is not entertaining. Nor is it a particularly approachable film. What it lacks in popcorn-munching entertainment value, it replaces with gravitas. This is an important film, about an important time. It&apos;s status as a valuable history lesson is secondary to it&apos;s reflections on human nature and our society. As such, it deserves to be seen, and contemplated, and appreciated.\n\nI can&apos;t wait for Letters From Iwo Jima (the companion piece, also from Clint Eastwood, told from the Japanese point of view.) Taken together, the scope of this project is breathtaking.",

Also it really hits home that &quot;Art Programs in schools&quot; are needed and are in danger. (My favorite Scene in the whole film has to do when a mother says her son might be good at sports but he can play this tuba). \n\nDuring the holiday season, Bethlehem School goes under review by a stern school administrator Cal Peterson (Gerald McRaney), sent to eliminate programs to save money and the school itself. Following long review, Cal decides to eliminate the music program led by music teacher Lily Waite (Naomi Judd). Cal is unaware that his teenage niece Fern (Alison Pill), whom he has been taking care of, has been changed by the music program. There are many sub-plots, including the hijinks of Jake Peterson (Andy Griffith). With a musical back ground, this film is unique in itself, it reaches out to the viewer not only through acting but through the joy of Christmas music, showing tradition in a new light, and showing that you are only as old as you feel. \n\nThis film is worth watching. Beware that the film is sold sometimes under the tile of &quot;A Song For the Season&quot;. \n\nWatch this film. It is worth watching. It is worth owning. It might even propel you into sending a letter to your favorite teacher..",

      "reviewBody": "I taped this off UK TV in 1988  the washed out condition of the print even then made it look as if it could be from 300 years ago, but recently seeing the even more degraded copy TCM US is showing made me think it really was! How did this get into such a state  the wobbly cheap colour and choppy copies from multiple TV dupes haven&apos;t helped to be sure, but it all makes it a bit of an ordeal to sit through without rose-tinted glasses on.\n\nAt the cutely named Death&apos;s Head Tavern Bud &amp; Lou unwittingly join forces with Charles Laughton playing Captain Kidd on the track of a treasure island  much fun is made of the map of Skull Island continually getting mixed up with Lou&apos;s supposed My Darling Darling Darling love letter. Add a deliberately devilish Leif Erickson as a sidekick for Laughton and elegant Hilary Brook as a pantomime Captain Bonney for something good to look at and you have the main crew. There&apos;s plenty of lusty non-pc songs, maybe too many but some not too bad and all well sung, my favourite being the romantic Speak To Me sung by the corny romantic leads on the pirate ship. It was the 2nd of the two films A&amp;C did for Warners in 1952 (this was Bud&apos;s choice, Jack was Lou&apos;s), and was amazingly successful noisy slapstick at the time; the reason given by Laughton as to why he accepted the role was to learn how to do double takes from Costello. He generally hammed it up nicely and he and the boys in particular seemed to enjoy themselves, but it all seemed a bit too laboured at times.\n\nFor anyone new who might be interested in A&amp;C this is not the film to start with, unless you&apos;re under 10 years old. And yet  I still end up watching this jolly nonsense every five years or so, never mind the grotty condition.",

      "reviewBody": "The Quest is an odd mix of martial arts and epic adventure. Its running time is too short for it to be deemed a true epic, but the panoramic worldwide locations hint that Van Damme was trying to give it the flavour of an epic.\n\nIt&apos;s a painfully simplistic story. Young American pickpocket Chris (Van Damme) has to flee from New York in the 1920s after a botched robbery. He ends up on a pirate ship headed for the Orient. Soon, he is rescued by another ship (another pirate vessel, this time captained by gentleman buccaneer Roger Moore). Moore drops him off on a Thai island where young men are trained as fighters, and before long young Chris is a very handy fighter indeed, with aspirations to win an ancient golden dragon in a fighting competition. The final third of the film is comprised entirely of fight sequences in which competitors from various nations combat each other in an effort to take the ultimate prize.\n\nThe film marked Van Damme&apos;s directorial debut, and he gives it a lovely sense of scale and period but can&apos;t wring much out of the thin and obvious story. The backdrops pictured in the film are beautiful. Some of the martial arts moments are well choreographed. Roger Moore gives a surprisingly thoughtful and moving performance. Beyond that, it&apos;s very childish and simple-minded and doesn&apos;t contain enough memorable moments to be anything other than a passable time filler."

This is an art film, though it is made accessible by the performances of Davies, Jovovich and Gibson. It is a very simple, character driven film with a host of great actors. (It is nice to see that Bud Cort is doing something interesting.) The best films usually take a simple story and do it very well. Such are the films of Kubrik and Kurosawa, two of the greatest film-makers of all time (if you don&apos;t agree there is a good chance you wont like this film). This film (as opposed to just &quot;movie&quot;) has a very simple story, but it does it beautifully. I recommend it to any film lover.\n\nPS: If you like this one check out &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; by Kurosawa and &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (trans.) by Clement."

      "reviewBody": "In their movies about Francisco Goya, Konrad Wolf and Milo Forman give the Spanish Court painter a totally different role. Also, those movies were shot in two different political regimes. But, still they have the same utmost relevant human message. As Oscar Wilde said in his &apos;The Critic as Artist&apos;: &apos;For when a work is finished, it has an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips&apos;. This is absolutely true for Konrad Wolf&apos;s movie, which attacked censorship in a totalitarian State.\n\nIn the movie by Konrad Wolf &apos;Goya or the tortuous road to understanding&apos;, based on the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger (centered on Goya&apos;s private life), the artist is the direct target of the Holy Office&apos;s Inquisition, because of his paintings and diabolic etchings. In &apos;Goya&apos;s Ghosts&apos; by Milo Forman, the painter is a kind of neutral observer or helpful middleman between the Holy Office and the family of an innocent victim of the Inquisition and its bestial &apos;question&apos;. However, the message of both movies is crystal clear and highly relevant today; first of all, no inquisitional powers with armies of spies and laws propagating denouncements; and, secondly, no torture, because unbearable pain forces totally innocent people to confess anything asked for, which is then considered as the ultimate proof of their guilt by their barbaric interrogators.\n\nThe play of the whole cast in Milo Forman&apos;s movie is simply fascinating, but it is not fully convincing in Konrad Wolf&apos;s film.\n\nAll men and women of good will should view these remarkably courageous masterpieces.",

      "reviewBody": "Pale color background, 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s scene set-up, steady frame shot, constant tempo, dramatic directing and acting; the film is full of old day&apos;s sentiments, yet it&apos;s a story happening in the overwhelmingly prosperous year 2010. Such a misplacement to reflect the most confusing and unbreakable issue that is troubling everyone in the metropolis gives a strong implication of a totally turning upside down era where boundary between right and wrong doesn&apos;t exist anymore. Things realigned according to past social order cannot stand the wave of time change; social value, moral standard, principle are all becoming useless and destroyed. No matter how hard one tries to reset it, it&apos;s no more than a joke that nobody would pay attention.\n\nAs people are turning to a dead end corner, surprises might turn up to help. On the other hand, those who think they can figure out everything not losing a penny might not be as wise as they presume they are, or somehow be ruined by their wisdom. Lo and Keung thought they are the winner of the game; even though they persist until the last breath, their fatal ending wouldn&apos;t change. Denise Ho and Lau, playing honest roles ever, should have been the loser of the game, but thanks to an accident, they both live a decent life thereafter without spending an effort. It&apos;s not strange or new to see fate or coincidence happening to the characters in Johnny To&apos;s film, but being put in a world of misplacement, this time it looks more like an accident than it&apos;s under fate, leading to an even more absurd ending where the world is totally unpredictable that one can&apos;t reason it. Mankind relies on accident and luck to settle down, that is a laughable grief.\n\nThe film, however; doesn&apos;t seem to rule out hard work could bring return, at least Wong, the role of recyclable paper collector, has enough significance. Unfortunately just a while later we see an old working class having fallen under the fade-out group of the society trying to kill himself. The script is actually talking to itself debating over the subject. It even further elaborates by condemning through the characters&apos; dialog. The most remarkable one is the confession by JJ Jia in the police station. Her brilliant acting has turned uncontrollably subconscious contradiction within into reasonable greed. What a marvelous demonstration of metropolis ridiculousness!\n\nSensibility might not win in this battle against absurdity. Richie Ren has been in a terribly confusing state struggling deeply within throughout the entire film. Not to mention the incidents he faces as a police inspector, he has yet to deal with a lot of personal problems such as his wife&apos;s persistence to purchase an apartment under the high market price, a seriously sick father and the sudden arrival of a younger sister by the mysterious wife of his father. These, however; are not dramatic enough to constitute irony effect, so the director has to arrange his wife coming to a sudden awakening by seeing him would die as the ending of the story. All these have come together too fast that Richie Ren is unable to react. He acts in such a slow-reflex way that has conveyed his thoughts of questioning &quot;what&apos;s going on with my fate?&quot; He rather believes it&apos;s all a coincidence. By taking away one&apos;s fate, he loses control over his life and all that left to him is coincidence. He has to pray for this for the rest of his life.\n\nAlthough the script is full of condemns to reality, the director has remained himself as an outsider with a very calm view over what is happening. The shots are all apathetic, just like people ignoring what is happening around them every day. This metaphor is too good, really too good that it might need another accidental coincidence to wake up the audiences before they would even notice it."

      "reviewBody": "I just saw a screening of Samsara at the TIFF, at the brilliant TIFF Lightbox theatre. \n\nWow.\n\nA film that took 5 years to make and co-ordinate. Shot in Panarama 70mm, across 26 countries, needing major government and regulatory clearances, having to wait for certain seasons or lunar phases to get the light to hit the way director Fricke wanted...carefully strung together with a massive 7.1 surround sound design and music score from Michael Stearns, Marcello de Francisci, and Lisa Gerrard (of Dead Can Dance).\n\nThe 70mm negative has been digitally scanned and oversampled at 8k resolution (much like the &apos;Baraka&apos; Blu-ray); the TIFF Lightbox theatre installed a brand new Christie 4k projector (Christie Projection Systems rushed the projector before its release to the market specifically for this event) making it the first true 4k screening of it&apos;s kind. \n\nFrom sweeping landscapes to time-lapse sequences of the night sky and from exclusive looks into the processing of food to the consumption and effects it has on the human body, Samsara is nothing short of astounding. Modern technology, production lines, and human robotics are juxtaposed against a backdrop of deserts, garbage mounds as far as the eye can see, and traffic congestion in modern centres. The time-lapse footage is simply transcendent. In fact, I caught myself questioning the reality of some of the landscape vistas and night skyline montages...they looked so hyper-real that I thought they must have come from a CG lab somewhere. Simply astonishing. The richness, depth and clarity of colour and image achieved within the processes utilized gives birth to the most beautiful visual meditation that I have ever witnessed.\n\nAs one film journalist noted, &quot;That Samsara is instantly one of the most visually-stunning films in the history of cinema is reason enough to cherish it, but Fricke and co-editor Mark Magidson achieve truly profound juxtapositions, brimming with meaning and emotion. It sounds preposterous, but it&apos;s true: In 99 minutes, Samsara achieves something approaching a comprehensive portrait of the totality of human experience. If you&apos;re even remotely fond of being alive, Samsara is not to be missed.&quot;\n\nIf you ever come across the chance to see this film in a decent theatre, run, and let your eyeballs (and earholes) feast upon its brilliance.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was created in 1952 during the peak of cultural/political dogmatism in the GDR. During this time, films were officially supported if they portrayed &quot;typical fates in typical situations&quot; with &quot;positive heroes&quot; in the lead roles who could convince viewers of the victory of socialism.\n\nDirector Slatan Dudow chooses another, less conspicuous and didactic method. His protagonist, Conny, a womanizer from West Berlin, is the archetypal bourgeois adventurer. The film presents him in relations to four women: a law student who is almost ruined by her love for him; a designer who becomes pregnant with his child, loses her job in West Berlin and moves to East Berlin; another woman who, in an attempt to impress him, steals a dress and later becomes guilty to the death of her brother; and lastly, another student who rebuffs Conny the first time they meet. \n\nFor Slatan Dudow, the positive heroes are the women, not the men. This interpretation was hardly shared by the political leadership in the GDR. During an SED film conference, The Destinies of Women received harsh criticism. Despite the declamatory scenes and black/white portrayals of East and West Berlin, The Destinies of Women provides an accurate picture of the times and proves to be a substantial political study. Stylistic innovation and a striking montage approach make this film a DEFA classic.",

      "reviewBody": "This male chauvinist comedy starts promising refreshing, but as the story develops the viewer is confronted with a very trivial love story.\n\nBut Detlev Buck knows his metier and this film  is far better (made) than the average German 90&apos;s comedy. Buck is supported by the very good cinematography of Idziak whose use of colour is excellent. Almost as a rule in 90&apos;s German cinema the music is no more than muzak.\n\nHeike Makatsch almost steals the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Pablo Tusset&apos;s novel &quot;Lo mejor que le puede pasar a un cruasán&quot; was an unexpected hit at the time of publishing. I read it from cover to cover in a long journey by train, and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was really looking forward to the big screen adaptation. When I heard the first casting news, I pleasantly discovered that the main character was to be played by Pablo Carbonell, who seemed to have been born to play Pablo Miralles. José Coronado, Marta Belaustegui and Nathalie Seseña were also the ideal actors to play their characters. \n\nSo I had high expectations towards this movie, and I have to say that most of them were met by Mir&apos;s adaptation. Of course I liked the book more, but that&apos;s something usually happens with book-to-film adaptations. The film managed to capture the essence of Tusset&apos;s novel, but most of the humor and the complexity of the mystery plot were lost somewhere in between the book and the script. Still a passable comedy/mystery movie, it does not reach the high quality of the original. Pablo Carbonell and the rest of the cast do their best with their characters, José Coronado being specially remarkable as the main character&apos;s brother. If Spanish cinema were more keen on genre movies, Coronado might well be our very own action hero, judging from his scenes in this one. \n\nIf you&apos;re open for a few laughs you probably won&apos;t regret watching &quot;Lo mejor que le puede pasar a un cruasán&quot;, but I would really recommend to read the book too. \n\nOverall rating: 6/10",

By the time this third one was made, Paul Hogan was putting on the wrinkles fast (although still in shape) and co-star/wife Linda Kozlowski had put on a few pounds.\n\nThe movie didn&apos;t fare well, maybe because the humor dominated instead of a balanced mix of it with drama, humor and romance as the other two films emphasized. Also, this story had done before in the first movie, with the Australian coping with America in New York so we didn&apos;t a replay of that in Los Angeles.\n\nOne thing nice about this film: it was nice in a mellow sort of way. There is a gentleness to it, a nice tone which you don&apos;t often see in today&apos;s R-rated dominated film industry....and it still was entertaining, for the most part. It&apos;s just too much familiar ground and added very little to what the first two films showed.",

      "reviewBody": "Someone decides to make their own feature film ? Don&apos;t tell me , I know what&apos;s coming next - a zombie apocalypse filmed on someones mobile phone ? Well that&apos;s what happens in the 21st Century but away back in the mid 1950s two ambitious amateur film makers Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo pulled out all the stops to make an alternative neo-realist film featuring a scenario where Operation Sealion was a success and Britain is under the fascist jackboot and these two idealists managed to pull out all the stops . All I really know about the behind the scenes story is that it took them eight years and seven thousand pounds sterling of their own finance to produce it \n\nFrom a technical point of view IT HAPPENED HERE is somewhat crude . Filmed in black and white it resists the temptation to intercut real life footage of the second world war and instead everything on screen is pre-filmed for the camera . I&apos;d be very interested in hearing amusing anecdotes about the production . Did the makers get strange reactions by asking where they could get some Waffen SS uniforms for example ? It is amazing that the production team gained access to so much military hardware and equipment . If there&apos;s a downside it&apos;s that the directors can&apos;t help showing off Nazi marching bands walking along the streets of London . Another negative is that the sound-mix is very poor \n\nIt&apos;s the screenplay that makes up for any limitations in the mis-en-scene . One annoyance is that &quot;England&quot; is constantly mentioned throughout . I take it the Nazis stopped at the borders of Wales and Scotland or more likely the writers have euphemistically used the term England when they mean Britain/UK . As a Celt this upset me slightly then I quickly forgave them because the story quickly nails human nature under occupation . There&apos;s not really a central plot but this doesn&apos;t matter in the slightest because human nature is put under the spotlight and without pluralist democracy human nature knows no bounds when it comes to inhumanity \n\nBy this I mean very few people would set you on fire , but by the same yardstick very few people would lift a finger to help you if you were on fire . Truth be told few people would p*ss on you if you were on fire . You ever worked for a corporate company ? I have worked for several and universally they operate in the same way a one party state does . Most people are indifferent to the company , they see it as a means to an end as in getting paid to feed their families and never lose their decency as humans or as colleagues . This isn&apos;t enough for some people . They are in a minority but give such people an inch of power and they shall take light years . Be thankful that democracy doesn&apos;t allow such people to rise to the top .\n\nIf there&apos;s one problem with the film&apos;s politics it&apos;s equating the resistance not being all that different from the methods employed by the fascists and the film is book ended in that both sides have the justification of &quot;If you&apos;re not for us you&apos;re against us&quot;. I can understand what the makers are trying to do but is it actually true that &quot;The appalling thing about fascism is that you&apos;ve got to use fascist methods to get rid of it.&quot; Presently in Syria the Kurdish YPG and their Arab comrades in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are engaged in a war against Daesh and the fascist Assad government who are backed by proxies from Russia , Iran and Turkey and yet never stoop to the methods of the regime they are fighting . That said in my own experience of politics there&apos;s a noticeable similarity between the far left and far right in that the world is constantly manipulated by a race of outsiders . Fascists use the word &quot;Jewry&quot; while leftists use the word &quot;Zionists&quot; and only the phraseology is different \n\nIf nothing else IT HAPPENED HERE gives an interesting window on the world of what things would be like if the Nazis had won the Battle Of Britain . Perhaps the most scary thing is that it&apos;s a world not a million miles removed from our own corporate Western world where &quot;We don&apos;t accept your decisions. You accept ours.&quot; . Don&apos;t be glad you live in a democracy . Be sad it&apos;s never going to be democratic enough",

      "reviewBody": "Reminiscent of Jacques Demy&apos;s 1968 &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; where characters now and then burst into song (and dance) to convey the story, and Eric Rohmer&apos;s flavor of intertwined relationships and coincidental meetings of characters that wrap around a tale, Alain Resnais&apos; treatment here in 1997 &quot;Same Old Song&quot; has his characters burst into lines of songs in between dialogs. Irrespective of the mix and match of a male vocal coming out of a female character or vice versa, they are excerpted strains and words chosen from certain songs that propel the storytelling. It&apos;s as if the characters are thinking aloud in songs on the situation or predicament at hand. It is rather fun once you get a sense of what Resnais was trying to deliver. Being an Alain Resnais film, intellectual exchanges and philosophical tones are never lacking.\n\nDefinitely reminded me of his treatment on 1980 &quot;Mon oncle d&apos;Amerique&quot; where he has scientific mice experiment scenes juxtaposed against the human (brain) reactions to relationships and love. In this 1997 &quot;On connait la chanson&quot;, his fascination with how people think - how the brain cells work in each of the characters, is again deftly demonstrated. At the last segment, where a theoretical explosion of the minds occur as gray matters collide - there was an appearance of a graphical ear-shape (in quiet wavy motion) in the center of it all - it&apos;s amazing to see how Resnais&apos; mind at 75 was still so very much into studying and unraveling human emotions, offering us life lessons in love.\n\nThe story centers around two sisters, Camille the tour guide who&apos;s also writing a thesis (Agnes Jaoui) and her popular and successful sibling Odile (Sobine Azema), and four men in their lives: an old flame of Odile - Nicolas (Jean-Pierre Bacri), husband of Odile - Claude (Pierre Arditi), writer of radio plays and quiet admirer of Camille - Simon (Andre Dussollier, more casually groomed than usual), and profiteering real-estate agent of Odile, fanciful beau of Camille and arrogant boss of Simon - Marc (Lambert Wilson).\n\n Typographically oriented, I can&apos;t help noticing the sequence of treatment to the credit roll at the end of the film: it started with a centrifugal look of the names of les chanteurs, followed by horizontal scroll from right to left of the main cast and crew, then a quick shooting upwards to facilitate the conventional bottom to top scroll of rest of the credits.\n\nIt may not be a French film for just anybody, it certainly is delightful to experience. (An Artistic License and Merchant-Ivory Films production indeed!) The subtitles, translated by Ian Burley, were super: the lyrics actually rhyme in English, e.g., &quot;resist&quot;, &quot;exist&quot;, &quot;egotist&quot;!\n\nThis film was dedicated to Dennis Potter, a cerebral genius he was. Check out his 1996 &quot;Karaoke&quot; (a multitude of colorfully complex characters) and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; (quite a sci-fi notion not completely implausible) - both centers around Albert Finney being the main character, and as always, a tour de force performance Finney delivered.",

      "reviewBody": "This was something of a milestone – denoting a leap for pioneer D.W. Griffith from his customary one or two-reelers to a then considerable length of 49 minutes in this version (its length may vary on account of differing speeds utilized during projection of Silent movies) as well as from a modern-day, or at least American, setting towards apparently unlimited scope. In that regard alone, JUDITH OF BETHULIA is worthy of attention – but Griffith&apos;s Victorian sensibilities (which he could never, or would not, shake off) still ground it into the antediluvian quality of film-making which is perhaps the most common objection raised by certain viewers nowadays to watching Silent pictures! Anyway, this was obviously inspired by the Old Testament tale in which a saintly woman sacrifices her dignity in order to release the Jewish people (depicted as long-bearded stereotypes which would not go down well today!) from oppression by the Assyrian army: she ingratiates herself within the affections of King Holofernes, whom she gets drunk one night and decapitates – after which the invaders disperse. Apart from a lengthy offensive outside the city walls, the running-time is padded-out with the plight of a young couple (the boy is a brave warrior and the girl eventually enslaved inside the enemy camp) and, also appearing from time to time, is Lillian Gish in a typical role symbolizing motherhood. Unfortunately, the print I acquired of this 95-year old title was extremely fuzzy – rendering the elaborate and often chaotic visuals even harder to make out – and it was accompanied besides by one of the most incongruous scores I have ever heard, approximating to a circus jingle (complete with laugh track!) which one finds at its most jubilant when the on-screen events seem to demand emotions of an entirely different nature!!",

Better yet, other things in the film are also good.   Granger, playing a more realistic role, is at his best elements as a daring arrogant English Col., match nicely with the beautiful Gardner as a romantic couple.   Most of the Indian characters are well portrayed and I love movie with a  historical background .  The story is complicated ,yet well told and paced. The characters are interesting and well presented. Over all, this is Cukor&apos;s movie at its usual fine standard.\n\nThis one is not to miss for fans of Granger, Gardner, and Hollywood oldies.",

You have to remember that this is an Italian version of the D-day hullabaloo, you could call the film &quot;D-day Italian style&quot;, and naturally the Germans are as wicked and naughty as ever, real monsters, with one notable exception. The film is perhaps enough for an evening&apos;s entertainment but blows over like so many other ordinary war action reels without leaving anything behind except perhaps a relief that it&apos;s over.",

I grew up in Brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent 5 years in Rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place... Shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a likely town, or a likely forest, but nothing even SEEM like Brittany nor Rennes... And calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. Besides those details, it could have been a good film, but it&apos;s crap. Silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. Definitely to avoid.",

Of course, it&apos;s not going to be that simple - there are vested interests on both sides who wish the conflict to continue, there&apos;s a good old dose of family melodrama as his son (William Henry) is also at the post - and they don&apos;t exactly see eye to eye, and we also have a wagon train carrying his wife and his son&apos;s fiancée en route to the fort through treacherous territory. Now the acting here isn&apos;t up to much - aside from the odd gun toting scene from Andy Devine&apos;s scouting &quot;Sneezer&quot;; nor is the writing but there are some fun action scenes with the feisty band of blue-shirts facing what appeared to be the entire, and heavily armed, Apache nation bearing down on them. It&apos;s far too long, too - but as standard B-western afternoon fayre, it&apos;s watchable enough though don&apos;t expect any history lessons!",

      "reviewBody": "OK, I&apos;m 26 so I&apos;ve been thru all the action heroes 80&apos;s hype, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of bullets from one round only;) I saw the advert of this movie on TV a couple of days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. WHOA! &apos;That is a must-see crappy movie!&apos;, I said. And indeed it was. Only a lot lot worse. It is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve Satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of Christian fundamentalist&apos;s wet dreams.\n\nI&apos;ve nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c&apos;mon, Chuck Norris playing an ANGEL, whose job is to look after little town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it&apos;s not stupidity anymore, we&apos;re talking silliness like... like a retarded child&apos;s joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as I suppose for elder people very much devoted to Catholic Church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. Technically it&apos;s incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you&apos;ve seen in early 90&apos;s in TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as I&apos;ve heard was played on a childish toy piano. I&apos;ve seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the IMDb bottom list) like &apos;Space Mutiny&apos; or &apos;Manos - hands of fate&apos; BUT believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students&apos; prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. Avoid it. At all cost avoid it. There&apos;s even nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris has officially finished his movie career.",

What in the name of heaven prompted Ms. Hawn to record this? I found this flick for one buck in the bargain DVD barrel at the dollar store. Was she desperate for work? This was post &quot;Foul Play,&quot; so her career was already set. I don&apos;t get it.\n\nNEVERTHELESS, now that I have all that off my chest, this was a fun movie, for what it was worth. Giancarlo Giannini almost reminded me a little of Peter Sellers with his slick but bumbling slapstick acting. Goldie Hawn complimented the slapstick.\n\nIt&apos;s worth watching. But unless you are a die-hard Goldie fan, don&apos;t go out of your way to find this rare film.",

From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy&apos;s life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you&apos;ll let your kids watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "This Italian &quot;Jaws&quot; knock-off really only has one redeeming feature, so I might as well open with it: the croc is real! Well, not real real, but I mean that it isn&apos;t a cheap CGI effect like in &quot;Blood Surf&quot; or God forbid &quot;Crocodile&quot;. The puppet they use can&apos;t really move well, but at least it&apos;s actually freakin&apos; there. It even looks pretty scary from time to time, they really did an excellent job with such a limited budget. It&apos;s just too bad they couldn&apos;t use the model in a better movie, because all other aspects of &quot;Killer Crocodile&quot; are well below average. The characters are annoying, the dialogues are uninspired and the story developments are all lifted directly from &quot;Jaws&quot;. They even bring in a blatant Quint rip-off just for those who don&apos;t catch on quickly. Hell, even the music is just John Williams&apos; theme with one or two different notes to avoid a lawsuit. In the end there are no scares, no real memorable scenes and a pretty boring finale but like I said, the puppet&apos;s damn cool. It might be worth a watch just because of that, and also for the rare &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; moment.",

      "reviewBody": "Citizen Kane it ain&apos;t, but if you&apos;re looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn&apos;t replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let&apos;s face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff&apos;s Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo&apos;s Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady&apos;s perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.\n\nBrendan Fraser looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that&apos;s pretty much all I&apos;m looking for in a screen idol.  John Hannah was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of &quot;Heroine in an Adventure Film;&quot;  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.\n\nOK, I lie.  The modern &quot;Heroine in an Adventure Film&quot; is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.\n\nAnd as to Oded Fehr, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy&apos;s tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.\n\nA couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?\n\nSo if you&apos;re in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.\n\nCatmommie",

      "reviewBody": "Many of the best films have portrayed real-life events -- and Sergeant York is no exception.  Gary Cooper as Sergeant York delivers an Oscar-winning performance as a Tennessee hillbilly who, for personal and religious reasons, doesn&apos;t want to kill anyone and refuses to join the war on the Western Front in WW I.  After much soul searching, he eventually dons a uniform and ships out to France.  Using uncanny marksmanship skills acquired from years of living in the back woods, he prevents his platoon&apos;s position from being overrun by the enemy by methodically mowing down a few dozen German soldiers.  One of Sergeant York&apos;s secrets to shooting accuracy is wetting down his sights with a bit of saliva to prevent glare.  He emerges from the war as a hero, marries his favorite girl, moves into a house given to him by the State of Tennessee as a symbol of their gratitude, and lives happily ever after.  Great stuff, and all true.  A stunningly moving film that everyone should see."

Shot between a crime flick and a documentary it is extraordinary to see how long before Oliver Stone made his movie this one already had it all: the craziness, the character&apos;s excessive performances, the mix of footages (documentary, news, acting), the gratuitous violence... If in the 60&apos;s Italy produced some of the most important masterpieces, in the 70&apos;s Italy became extraordinarily experimental producing some incredible innovative movies and movie genres (the poliziottesco, Damiani&apos;s mafia movies, Argento&apos;s gialli, Bava&apos;s horrors, the soft porn comedies, Rosi&apos;s movie-inchiesta, to name the more famous) This movie has not dated and is still to be recommended to anyone interested in experimental movie-making. A tribute should be dedicated to that supreme actor named Gian Maria Volonte&apos; here in top form.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It&apos;s been more than 50 years since this one was released, so it seems a good time to offer up some thoughts and observations. Let&apos;s start with the fact that you probably read Edgar Allen Poe&apos;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; in high school. Director Roger Corman and writer Richard Matheson take Poe&apos;s work as a starting point in a most unique story of their own.\n\nIf you aren&apos;t familiar with Roger Corman, he is one of the most prolific and entertaining &quot;B&quot; movie makers of all time. His writer here, Mr. Matheson, is best known for his work on numerous episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Poe - Matheson - Corman would be enough, but we also get Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Hazel Court and Jack Nicholson. Price is always a treat to watch (especially in horror films), Lorre appeared in 3 of the greatest movies of all-time (M, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca), Karloff is the master of monster, Ms Court was one of the first stars of Hammer Films, and of course, Nicholson (fresh-faced here) went on to become one of the most successful actors in movie history.\n\nPrice, Karloff, Lorre and Nicholson offer up four of the most unique voices ever heard in movies, and they each partake in the fun provided by Corman here. Yes, I said fun. This is almost slapstick comedy, and at a minimum, it&apos;s a parody of the much darker series of Poe films. If you consider it as an influence of the 1960&apos;s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, you wouldn&apos;t be wrong. Even the music (heavy on the tuba) has an air of comedy.\n\nWatching Peter Lorre as a matador is pretty funny, and some of the back-and-forth with he and Nicholson as father and son is clearly ad-libbed, but the classic comedic sequence occurs when Price and Karloff take their wizardry duel to the death and turn it into a special effects highlight reel.\n\nThis may be the only time you hear the phrase &quot;precious viper&quot; used to describe a woman, and if that, combined with all of the above reasons, isn&apos;t enough to motivate you to seek this one out, then maybe you will never discover why so many adore the films of Roger Corman. Compared with films of today, this style is nevermore.",

Beautifully photographed, excellently acted, brilliantly directed, &quot;Lola and Billy the Kid&quot; (U.S. video release title) is a deeply affecting movie that gives us a rare glimpse into the gay-Turkish subculture of modern Berlin and introduces us to characters who -- though they may be far removed from ourselves -- are heartbreakingly real, utterly dynamic, and upliftingly human.  The Suddendeutche Zeitung said this movie &quot;has a touch of West Side Story and a pinch of Rebel Without a Cause.&quot;  It is a very accurate statement.  As one who tries to see every gay-themed film out there, I can honestly say that Lola jumps to the top of the list...  a well-crafted, brilliant piece of filmmaking that is not only one of the best gay-themed films I&apos;ve see, but also one of the best films of any genre I&apos;ve come across.  Like &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette,&quot; Lola made me laugh, made me cry, and made me want to know more about the subculture and racial dynamics it represents.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1957 Gustaf Gründgens staged a new production of Goethe&apos;s Faust in which he once again played Mephisto, a part he had played since 1932. The brilliant production was a huge success and ran for a couple of years. In 1959 Peter Gorski captured the performance on film in his directorial film debut. Basically it is a registration of the production, but Gorksi did manage to accentuate the details of the acting by using enough medium and close-up shots which give a view on the acting you normally would not able to see in a theater. \n\nHow fortunate it is and how happy we can be that at least this Mephisto of Gründgens is on film (I do not know of any other Faust production with Gründgens on film). Here we can see his brilliant, if not obsessive acting to the full. Here we can also see that, although Gründgens was know for not being in favour of &quot;modernization&quot; of classic plays, he was not entirely against it either. The stage set is simple and almost bare which gives the production a certain light touch. Faust himself is a young man (without long beard!) who is a nuclear physicist (an idea given to Gründgens by Will Quadflieg); a very clear reference to the then nuclear race. According to Heinz Reincke (interview on tv) the exploding of the atom bomb was more sensational on stage than in this film.\n\nSo, not only for Gründgens this is a fascinating film, the staging and interpretation of the play as well make it wonderful viewing; for the first time he included the prolog. While watching this production I hardly need to consult Goethe&apos;s text; the cast read their lines with a wonderful sense of rhythm and very, very clear; productions nowadays can learn something from this. Not only Gründgens&apos; acting can be admired, under the supervision of Gründgens the complete cast is extraordinary.\n\nHighly recommended and a must-see for all those studying or interested in German language and culture.(8/10)",

Griffith, Doug Fairbanks initially plays another idle young man of the upper class, &apos;FRESH out of college&apos;, as the inter-titles point out - but by some small incident, he finds himself in a poor neighborhood one fine day; and falling in love with a poor girl who works as a bar dancer out of necessity (played by young Bessie Love, who soon was to become a big star herself)...\n\nAnd so, without hesitation, he decides to leave his former surroundings - and, together with his faithful servant &apos;Pickleface&apos; (wonderfully portrayed by Joseph Singleton), dressed in worker&apos;s clothes, goes to that bar to look for the girl he&apos;d fallen for at first sight; and is hired as bouncer there! Which very soon gets him in trouble with the leader of the gas-house gang, who&apos;s also got an eye on pretty Agnes...\n\n... And, of course, it gives Doug Fairbanks a LOT of opportunities to show his athletic stunts; that&apos;s undoubtedly one big part of the entertainment in this wonderfully unusual movie (especially for the female part of the audience...), another one are the many comical sequences; then there&apos;s the element of a very early &apos;pre-gangster movie&apos; - and, maybe most important of all for the time it was made, the breaking down of the &apos;barriers&apos; between the &apos;upper&apos; and the &apos;lower&apos; class; love conquers all!! In short: this is a GREAT movie and a GREAT time document, not to be missed by any real fan of classic movies by any means!",

For almost two hours I was completely involved with two people I will never really know, yet for some reason it has changed me in some strange way. I watched the movie and like the others in the theater had the same rollercoster ride of feelings, but it was not until after I left the theater that I had an abundance of emotions come over me.  The acting was amazing all the way around, story was an A+. I work hard for the money I make and for the high price I paid for admission, it was all worth it for this great creative process!  I suggest that everyone support their local small theater when this film comes around to your town!!",

      "reviewBody": "Reincarnation is the one word which can be used to describe Karan Arjun, a film which can easily be a fun watch for the entire family. It is about two brothers who are killed and their mother who expects to see them again for some reason and desperately prays for the day they come back. And her prayers get paid off when her children are reborn in different parts of the country and grow up looking the same as her dead kids. The film has some heartbreaking feel about it, but as a film, it is a bit overdone, melodramatic and cheesy. Yet, it never takes itself too seriously, so it somehow works despite being blown out of proportions. The film may particularly appeal to children - heroes and villains, fights and races, dialogue which does not have much sense, very caricaturish characters. Despite that, there are some emotions that somehow work for others, so I would call it a children&apos;s film which may appeal to the rest of the family. Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan work very well together and give the film a certain appeal not warranted by the script. Salman is restrained as never before and Shahrukh is carefree and positive. Raakhee does well as the suffering mom and the moment of unity is such a familiar tear-causing scene that nothing else matters. Mamta and Kajol are hardly there, particularly Kajol, who is invisible. Rajesh Roshan&apos;s music is as always amazing, with &quot;Yeh Bandhan&quot; leading the list. All in all, go and try this wholesome Bollywood entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "The Divorcée (1930)\n\nThe start of this is such a busy, overlapping party scene in a country house, you can&apos;t help but get swept up in it. And if some of the acting or a few of the quips are not perfect, the best moments are really fun and spirited. The naturalism is really refreshing, and pace fast, and the dialog real. Then it spins out of control--the events, not the movie--and before fifteen minutes are up, there&apos;s a brief terrible moment that has two or three of the actors exploring an hysteria that a method actor would be proud of. It&apos;s intense, great stuff. Get at least that far in.\n\nThe rest of the movie follows suit, through quiet and fast moments, and the drama turns to melodrama and back, all pinned together by the ever convincing Norma Shearer. The themes--fidelity and infidelity, love and friendship, the superficial versus the things that matter--give it all something to chew on or laugh at at ever turn.\n\nIt&apos;s unnecessary to say that this is just two years after the full advent of sound, and it&apos;s a very developed, mature element in the movies. In fact, the density of things going on would never have been possible with intertitles, and it must have been a revelation to audiences and movie makers equally. Fast dialog and overlapping events are a natural extension of the theater, of course, but with the ability to shift scenes and zip down wooded roads with the camera is the essence of cinema.\n\nSo, in all, for how it&apos;s made, for the acting (the best of it), and for the serious, important themes, this is gem, an amazing movie, whatever its hiccups and flaws here and there. I wouldn&apos;t miss it.",

      "reviewBody": "Anthony Minghella knew something of the Civil War in locating his story in North Carolina. Of all the states that seceded to form the Confederacy, North Carolina may have been the most reluctant. It&apos;s Governor Zebulon Vance who is mentioned in the story dragged his feet in giving help to the Confederate government and its citizens save for the east where the plantations were never really embraced the Southern cause. Jude Law&apos;s attitude about fighting for a rich man to own slaves was not at all uncommon in North Carolina.\n\nWhich after a well staged recreation of the siege at Petersburg which when the north blew up the Confederate defenses by tunneling under and mining them with explosives did not have the desired result, Law decides he&apos;s sick of war and just quits to go back to his sweetheart Nicole Kidman on Cold Mountain. In the meantime Nicole is having her own problems just keeping body, soul, and property together on the small family farm. So the film proceeds along two tracks of Law&apos;s journey and Kidman&apos;s problems.\n\nThe stronger track for me is clearly Kidman and her problems. Renee Zellweger won a Best Supporting Actress Award for playing a young white trash woman who Kidman takes on for just board and feed to help with the farm. Without her help the farm&apos;s survival would be problematic although she has to put up with some pithy observation as well. Zellweger invests this simple character with so many dimensions her performance even without the Oscar capping it is her personal best. Kidman while not to the plantation manor born being the daughter of minister Donald Sutherland also is not used to manual farm labor. She grows in character as the film progresses.\n\nAs for Law and Kidman as well he has to worry about the Home guard, a self appointed group of militia taking over because official government machinery has broken down. Probably before the war they were slave catchers, now they hunt deserters and those who aid and abet them. Giovanni Ribisi also scores well as a young man in the home guard who declined to serve at places like Petersburg. Ribisi is some piece of work.\n\nBesides Zellweger&apos;s Oscar, Cold Mountain was deservedly nominated for a flock of other Oscars. It&apos;s a marvelous look at the decline of the Confederacy, a cause that simply would not die quietly. In its own way the survivors are invested with the same kind of nobility that the Gone With The Wind cast was.",

      "reviewBody": "Savana Violenta, a.k.a. Mondo Violence, from start to finish is a huge disappointment. The box boasts that the film is banned in over forty countries, yet there is very little here to be offended by. Eighty percent of the movie is spent watching stock footage of animals chasing and eating each other, all of which can be seen on television. There are a few scenes of hunting and traditional animal sacrifices, but most feel very staged and out of place. If you&apos;re looking for something a little bit more extreme you might want to check out the Faces of Death series and give this film a wide berth at the video store.",

      "name": "Seagal&apos;s Ship Is Still S(t)inking",
      "reviewBody": "Well, I have to say I am very disappointed. Again. I&apos;d like to start this commentary by saying that I&apos;m myself a fan of Mr. Seagal and have followed his career in motion pictures since I first saw the superb &quot;Above The Law&quot; back in 1989. This information is just to clarify, that I&apos;m not here to bash Seagal just because it seems to be the &quot;hip&quot; thing to do.\n\nIt&apos;s fair to say that Seagal&apos;s cv hasn&apos;t looked very impressive since &quot;Under Siege&quot; over ten years ago. It&apos;s been a slow downhill with a few exceptions like fairly enjoyable &quot;US 2&quot; and dumb but entertaining &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;. With his Hong Kong influenced &quot;Belly Of The Beast&quot; outing I dared to expect something of a comeback for our beloved thespian, but &quot;Out Of Reach&quot; sends him right back where he was with the dreadful &quot;The Foreigner&quot; and even more horrible &quot;Out For A Kill&quot;. You could sum this commentary with one sentence: no more polish action films. The production values of &quot;OOR&quot; are minimal, script has holes for trucks to go through and the acting. Oh lord, the acting. Through out the entire film it is just plain torture to watch. Let&apos;s face it - Seagal has never been exactly Oscar material, but he has had his moments. Not in this one. I just don&apos;t get why on earth they have to dub his voice with these totally moranic voice overs? And this time it happens a lot, even in the middle of the scene in where he has spoke with his own voice in the beginning. \n\nSeagal has dropped some weight, but it is still a stretch to buy him as an action hero. His moves are slow (still the show them most of time in slow motion!!) and he uses stunt doubles a lot. Action in &quot;OOR&quot; is quite minimal and fairly up to basic standards even for a movie this scale. The brothel shoot out is OK, but the final duel between Seagal and Matt Schulze is a major let down. And while speaking of Mr. Schulze it should be noted that Seagal&apos;s acting really isn&apos;t the worse in &quot;OOR&quot;. Schulze, who delivered good performances in &quot;Blade 2&quot; and &quot;The Transporter&quot; is totally lost with the role of Faisal The Ultimate Bad Guy. His pseudo sophisticated character is probably one of the most lame villains ever supplied with incredibly stale dialogue.\n\nLike noted, the acting in whole is pure crap and it seems that many of the polish actors don&apos;t even know English - they just repeat what the director or who ever tells them to say. There really are no good performances in &quot;OOR&quot; except the small cameo of Nick Brimble and momentarily the girl who plays Seagal&apos;s pen pal. There are numerous just idiotic scenes like the one where the little girl is held captive in the basement of a castle where villains are having a big party. She is guarded by one of the villains and asks him something like &quot;Why are you not invited to the party?&quot; The bad guy totally loses it and screams: &quot;Stop trying to get inside my head!&quot; Whoa. Then there are the goofy scenes where Seagal wanderers in the forest &quot;looking for injured animals&quot;. It is of course a beautiful concept, but the guy looks like a lost-in-the-woods member of a motorcycle gang. And the final still picture before the end credits start to roll. What the heck were they thinking in the editing room? &quot;Wow, NOW this movie works like it should!&quot;\n\nI did my best to come up with even one positive thing about &quot;OOR&quot;, but it just seems impossible. How can talented(?) people mess up this bad and what in heaven&apos;s name did Seagal see in this project that made him want to get into it? Is he proud of his Poland era of film making?\n\nIf you are a fan of Seagal you have to ask yourself a question: did you like him as the arrogant ass kicker from his Warner Brothers days or do you prefer this independent (no big studio wants to touch him with a ten foot pole?) filmmaker -version of him? If your heart beats for his neat ponytail wearing, black leather jacket and jeans -period then do your self a favor and leave &quot;OOR&quot; alone. As sad as it might seem.\n\nThis was a stink bomb. Please, let &quot;Into The Sun&quot; be better.",

Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.\n\nThe story is so-so.

Schindlers List troubled me, but not in this way, this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded, I&apos;m still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!\n\nI love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that, &quot;Oh my God!!!!!!&quot; look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you&apos;re easily scared don&apos;t watch this movie, you&apos;ll have a heart attack. If you haven&apos;t been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. \n\nYOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Paul Hagas&apos;s &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; follows carefully and closely all the long held and well affirmed standards of any good murder mystery. For anyone who really enjoys this Genre you won&apos;t be disappointed. \n\nThat being said I believe the performances also strengthen this story. Tommy Lee Jones hands in a subdued yet internally complex performance the like I&apos;ve never seen him do before. He is tough and yet has the sensitivity necessary to drive the character along to where it needs to go. Susan Sarandon gives a strong performance as the mother of a missing soldier. She is placed in the position of an actress having to create a great role from a small part and pulls it off by tapping what must be very heartfelt emotions.\n\nMs. Theron is good and carries off her part well. She is once again not afraid to look bad in order to carry a role. It is a good performance...that&apos;s all. I&apos;m not writing home to Mom over it though. The rest of the cast is very strong and gives me great hope for the future of Film making in this country. The cast works well together and makes a compelling story.\n\nThe part of this film that is the Star and center piece is Paul Hagas&apos;s script. He sets up the characters and situations in a direct and fast manner. The storyline is consistent and flows well and as I mentioned he follows the correct direction that any good murder mystery should. He also makes us aware of the growing struggles of our soldiers and what is going on as a result of this war in Iraq. Please see this film and look at it for what it is...a good mystery with great performances.",

      "name": "An unexpectedly strong horror classic, if sometimes heavy-handed and deliberate",
      "reviewBody": "There are film-making and storytelling sensibilities of horror here that one will recognize in like fare from most any country&apos;s cinema; that in this case the proceedings are flavored with tinges of Indonesian culture is refreshing, not least as Islam is spotlighted over Christianity. Otherwise, the story bears familiar roots of eerie goings-on following the death of a member of the family, and we can just sit back and take in all that &apos;Pengabdi Setan&apos; has to offer. There are perhaps points where the presentation is overbearing in some manner, whether it&apos;s especial clamor in a sequence or extra forcefulness in the acting; though such instances are obviously intentional, for my tastes they&apos;re too overt a choice. Yet otherwise I&apos;m rather pleased with how good this is - it may not be an absolute must-see, but anyone who appreciates the genre will surely find much to like here.\n\nThe cast generally gives strong performances fitting for the material; if they are sometimes too heavy-handed, I think that&apos;s more a question of Sisworo Gautama Putra&apos;s direction. But excepting the few most overly pronounced instances, Putra&apos;s orchestration of every shot and scene is also commendably strong in accentuating the growing disquiet that pervades the scenario, and in making every moment matter. With that said, this is certainly a case where the dispensation of the most significant horror elements is more measured and deliberate, parsed out more sparingly as the length advances, and not necessarily doled out very subtly at that - but the incidence is more than enough to inculcate a robust, growing sense of Things Going Wrong in the household. Each such step along the way is realized with excellent stunts, effects, and special makeup, facets that are as admirably well done as in many like-minded titles, and by the time we&apos;re in the last third of the length the differences between this and other such titles are decidedly few.\n\nAnd that&apos;s sort of the key here: while I don&apos;t think &apos;Pengabdi Setan&apos; is remarkable in any one way, it&apos;s notable as an Indonesian feature that has achieved enough renown to be recognized to a degree that cannot broadly be said of other works of the country&apos;s industry. The closest points of comparison in terms of aesthetics and production values may be contemporary genre fare out of Hong Kong or Japan, and that arguably comes across above all in the cinematography, and in the approach toward specific genre elements. And whatever else one may say about where this 1980 film stands, it all looks pretty fantastic! As the course of events escalates the entertainment becomes ever more delicious, and while strictly speaking this may be a smidgen more modest than contemporary pieces out of Europe or the United States, that doesn&apos;t truly mark this as any lesser. In fact, for as excellent as the horror happenings come to be as the narrative develops, I rather believe this stands well above many more widely known flicks. All the component parts here, including the ambient soundscapes of the score, increasingly produce a layer of atmosphere over the affair that cements its strengths and overarching value - and when all is said and done, I believe this quite stands shoulder to shoulder among the upper middle (or is that lower upper?) echelons of any horror one may wish to watch.\n\nGiven the calculated pacing of all herein, reserving the most substantial aspects and intensity for the back end, I can understand that this won&apos;t appeal to all comers. This isn&apos;t a movie of major visceral thrills or chills, nor instant gratification. Moreover, as one particular criticism, I will say that this is very heavy-handed about its underlying themes, to an extent that&apos;s more than a little gauche. Still, for those who are receptive to all that the genre has to offer, and who have the patience for pictures that play their hand in their own time, I&apos;m happy to say that ultimately there&apos;s enduring worth here that even some of the best known horror features can&apos;t always claim. It&apos;s not wholly perfect, and it&apos;s not an exemplar per se, but I sat to watch with mixed expectations and step away very satisfied with how enjoyable &apos;Pengabdi Setan&apos; turned out to be. If you have the chance to watch, this is an underappreciated classic that deserves more attention.",

However, unlike the race, the film just doesn&apos;t go anywhere. Having set the scene, it repeatedly focuses on a number of competitors - exhibiting their struggles, but after a while this repetition feels wearing. The riders are rightly lauded for their achievements, but we don&apos;t actually learn much about them. We don&apos;t know their backgrounds, how they prepared for the race, what they ate/drank during the race, or indeed anything at all about the bikes themselves. It&apos;s extraordinary to see a &quot;travel&quot; film where the viewer is not even shown a map of the route. This omission stripped the film of its geographical context. We are entertained to the spiritual musings of the racers, but these appeared both incoherent and contradictory. The film is devoid of any interesting challenges to the &quot;heroes&quot; ( what are these people like to live with when they aren&apos;t racing / how do they combine their careers with training ). It&apos;s reverential style permitted neither humour nor an ounce of irony. A wasted opportunity to make an interesting and thought provoking movie."

      "reviewBody": "This time Chuck Norris confronting an ominous psycho-killer . A sensible but two-fisted cop (Chuck Norris) and his tough helper (Steve James) pit a dangerous series killer who holds a supernatural force . The police named Danny O&apos;Brien is back in action fighting the notorious psychotic Simon Moon (Jack O&apos;Halloran) , also known as ¨The Terror¨ who murders his victims by twisting their necks . The monstrous and virtually indestructible man is a Frankestein-alike , acting similarly to Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers .\n\nThis Chuck Norris vehicle contains action-packed , thrills , chills and lots of blood and violence . Chuck Norris demonstrates his qualities as an action hero on the fights against the largest-than-life murderous by means of punches , kicks , bounds and leaps . This is last film that Menahem Golan , from Cannon film company , produced with Chuck Norris . Large support cast formed by usual secondaries of the 80s such as Steve James , Jeffrey Kramer , Billy Drago , Branscome Richmond and Ron O&apos;Neal as the Mayor . David Michael Frank&apos;s screeching musical score was composed by means of synthesizer . The motion picture was regularly directed by William Tannen . This horror-fighting-thriller is an inferior Norris film , in spite of it he was on his best period with hits such as ¨The Octagon¨ , ¨An eye for an eye¨ , ¨Forced vengeance¨ , ¨Lone Wolf MacQuade¨ , and ¨Missing in action¨ , among others . Rating : Below average but entertaining . The picture will appeal to Chuck Norris fans though results to be one of his inferior outings .",

      "reviewBody": "And just what IS The Stuff? Well, physically, The Stuff looks like marshmallow Fluff, but it&apos;s also as addictive as supercrack and as zombie inducing as an alien space pod. And it just happens to be the latest dessert craze to sweep our nation, in Larry Cohen&apos;s 1985 sci-fi satire &quot;The Stuff.&quot; As other dessert manufacturers go belly up, industrial spy Michael Moriarty is hired to find out just what this Stuff is all about, and he is assisted by Andrea Marcovicci (a Madison Ave. exec who is pushing The Stuff) and by a Famous Amos-like character played by Garrett Morris. Paul Sorvino pops up toward the end as Col. Spears, who seems to head his own private army, and he too is instrumental in the fight against the deadly confection. Anyway, like The Stuff itself, &quot;The Stuff&quot; is fun to consume but leaves one wanting still more. It has an intriguing plot, and its satire on this country&apos;s rampant consumerism does work, but at the same time, there aren&apos;t enough exciting set pieces, and the film&apos;s joking tone fritters away any real sense of suspense. This movie might have worked a lot better if it had been more serious, and less tongue in (Stuff-stuffed) cheek. It doesn&apos;t quite hold together somehow--possibly the fault of the script or the editing--and though the film looks fine, with nice Blob-like Stuff FX, it still feels slapdash somehow. But wait till you see Abe Vigoda and Clara &quot;Where&apos;s the Beef?&quot; Peller do a Stuff TV commercial, and hear that catchy jingle (&quot;Enough is never enough, of The Stuff&quot;). Fun stuff indeed!",

Seriously, this film shows how to make a truly scary film without the special effects budget of some other horror films. 1) Hire great acting talent. 2) See #1\n\nThis movie had no cheap thrills, no special effects pizazz, and no hokey acting talent with great one-liners. I&apos;ve never given Colin Firth his due. He is hands down, a really great actor and he should do more films like this, where he&apos;s not the nice guy. (Maybe he has, already, but thanks to this film, I&apos;m going to check now).\n\nThis plot didn&apos;t need anything extra to weigh it down. And it was very nicely acted out.\n\nMena Suvari is so adorable in this role. She really seems too good to be true. I&apos;ve always liked her in any movie and this is no exception. But she seems to work well with Colin and I believe they should do another movie together.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for ghosts or demons. Things that jump out and make you scream. Or hokey one-liners and teenagers engaging in sexual acts while be watched, stalked, and then hacked by a knife-wielding maniac. Look elsewhere... far from this film. If you want to see horrors of the psyche and a genuine mental thriller, &apos;Trauma&apos; is a very great choice.",

It&apos;s a romantic and enthralling vision of the dark perspective about life and death for the poor people controled by the privileged, cruel and envious society. It finds a inspired Johnny Depp in probably his best performance of this century. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall compelte this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented one assembled in a musical!"

The scene of the ball is the turning point of the movie: it&apos;s folk music which represents immutability too.Alain ,who got engaged to Amelie -more because his passion for Emmanuelle frightens him - realizes he&apos;s only a passing affair to her as she changes partners faster than the music.A short scene highlights Amelie&apos;s problem:when she involuntary becomes sexy for a short while,she sees a young man looking at her and she feels confused.\n\nEmmanuelle epitomizes the modern woman,most of the men around have astutely perceived her firm independence of men .Amelie is the romantic orphan girl of the nineteenth century,whose only hope is marriage .If Alain can find some consolation in sailing away ,Amelie cannot find any way out.\n\nThe story consists of two flashbacks ,but they are so smartly introduced we never realize they are flashbacks.Looks are more important than words and Alain&apos;s hand trying to reach something finds an exact equivalent in the last scene.Music is kept to the minimum;when &quot;Elise Ou La Vraie Vie&quot; was released ,Drach told he thought that music scores were a survival from the past in the movies.\n\nA demanding work,which grows on you.",

Catherine Zeta Jones manages a sort of warmth that I had never noticed before in her and Aaron, well, he just goes for it, reveling in this film persona that he&apos;s been developing for years. The tender macho type. The food looks great but not as great as in &quot;Big Night&quot; remember that one? Some character touches are really spot on. The city and the dishes are photographed beautifully, the human beings a little less. I almost walked out during a musical montage but I&apos;m a glad I didn&apos;t. All in all. Fun.

Although it was made under the Hammer Films banner, THE DAMNED is not a typical SF picture by any means. Expatriate director Joseph Losey set out to make a social parable more than an SF thriller. He succeeds in showing how society&apos;s increasing violence and callousness on the streets could lead to the horrible thought of &quot;breeding&quot; radioactive children in the government in order to survive an inevitable (?) nuclear war. The moral is both, of the time &amp; time-less. Of course, modern audiences may feel that the end of the Cold War makes such a tale outdated and even silly - but are we only fooling ourselves? \n\n&quot;Black Leather, Black Leather.....&quot;"

      "name": "The greedy cunning of the pale-faced or the Magnificent Goiko Mitic: part three",
      "reviewBody": "Western. In the wake of the success of the films of the East German film studio DEFA, the Soviet Union decided to help in the creation of new films with the participation of Goiko Mitic. The result is the painting &quot;Trail of the Falcon,&quot; which is the fourth of twelve that I will see. Moreover, it was this picture that opened to me the whole series and personally to the actor Goiko Mitic in early childhood, for which I am very grateful to her. And here is my brief opinion - the greedy cunning of the pale-faced. I did not notice any flaws in the picture, but there are small clarifications, which I will talk about in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the merits of this excellent western. So, here they are: 1. The story told - the picture tells that gold was found in the mountains belonging to the Indians, which threatens another break in the treaty between the American government and the Indian tribes inhabiting this territory. Of course, various suspicious personalities, scoundrels and scoundrels, accompanied by the army immediately rushed there. This is opposed by the leader of the Dakota tribe Zorky Sokol (Goyko Mitich), who does not want to allow the pale-faced to their native land, but not all leaders agree to go to a direct military clash. Obstacles, pain, defeats and victories, all this awaits the leader of the Sharp-Sighted Falcon and his brave warriors, who dared to go against the pale-faced almost with bows and arrows. The painting itself is a kind of prelude to the War of the Black Hills - the historic and last major clash between indigenous peoples and the US government. The picture even shows one of the real leaders of the Indians, namely Crazy Horse, or Crazy Horse, so named for perseverance and fearlessness on the battlefield. The script tells about the greed and meanness of the pale-faced, but does not smear everyone with black paint, showing noble and even decent Americans. As a child, I was sick with the whole picture, worried and supported the Indians, from whom the vile conquerors take the house for the sake of gold. The finale turned out to be relatively encouraging, especially given the real historical facts. They did not forget to show the barbaric extermination of buffaloes in order to deprive the Indians of food. Well, the struggle between the Vigilant Falcon and the main enemy is simply interesting to watch. All the ingredients of a good story are here. 2. Entourage - atmosphere, costumes, scenery, music, cameraman - everything breathes the Wild West a little more than completely, immersing the viewer in it literally from the head. Dressers and decorators have clearly perked up on the Indian theme, so everything looks even better than it was in the previous pictures. The music has become similar to Indian motives, and in dynamic scenes exactly the music sounds that emphasizes these very scenes. There were more extras, which made me happy again. Nature still evokes trembling admiration, especially since the shooting took place in Soviet Georgia, for nature is painfully reminiscent of its native land. 3. Fights, chases, skirmishes - this picture is a step forward for Westerns by DEFA studio, because not only have there been more such scenes and there have been much more extras, the Indians also began to use military tactics that allowed them to fight on equal terms with the regular the American army. Yes, and the dynamics of these scenes clearly cannot be denied. And they became a spectacle unambiguously. 4. Final battle - the climax of the battle is precisely the confrontation between the noble Indian and the greedy gold digger, who is ready to do anything to achieve his goals. The fight is intense, dynamic, and even somewhat emotional. Its ending is obvious and predictable. A little about the main characters: 1. Vigilant Falcon performed by Goyko Mitich - the leader of the Dakota tribe, who knows how to understand people and the current situation, understands the clear advantage of the pale-faced, so he makes a number of decisions in order to have at least one chance to win. A noble savage, a true leader and a good warrior, fighting for his land and his tribe. Goiko again perfectly played the already familiar character. Bravo! 2. Mr. Blagen performed by Hannyo Hasse is an insidious and greedy gold digger, the leader of a small gang, a notorious scoundrel and villain, who received the nickname &quot;Poisonous Snake&quot; from the Indians. He hates Indians, but will not tolerate rivals in the face of other gold diggers. Hannyo is very good at this role. Bravo! 3. Sam Blake performed by Helmut Schreiber is a pale-faced merchant who is quite successful in trading with the Indians, but the discovery of gold promises trouble not only for him, but for all civilians. He does not despise the Indians, even opposes Blagen&apos;s plans as best he can. A worthy role and a good embodiment. The future Nadia Sheveleva from &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; also starred here - Polish actress Barbara Brylska, who played a brave and kind girl who went to the very border of the United States at this turbulent time. Of course, such an explosion of emotions, as in the year of release, this western is not able to provide now, in our age of &quot;Avengers&quot;. The blood was delivered, though a little, again pressing to the wound site, but already better. And besides, we will make a discount for the release time. Okay? Agreed! Well, next time Goiko Mitic will take revenge on the pale-faced. It will be in the painting &quot;White Wolves&quot;. As a result, we have a good western with a magnificent Goyko Mitic, with a great exciting story, great surroundings, great music, exciting shootings and excellent acting.",

Even so far as the movie was allowed to break the fourth wall and call them by their real name at one point.\n\nWhat also hasn&apos;t aged well, is the humor of it all. In a woke enviroment this will not survive 5 minutes ... so many things wrong, so many racial missteps or sexist remarks or ideals that are upheld. Now of course some may feel I am being too harsh and don&apos;t see the things here for what they are ... but I&apos;m just laying out facts here. It is for you to decide if and how offended you may feel about those things (the mocking of different languages included) ... again this was considered to be fun or funny and people were not so easily offended back then. You may hold that against them or not ... I can&apos;t speak for you. I can only say, that it did not age well and has quite a few issues to say the least",

      "name": "A Bridget Jones clone, with a way more life and beauty",
      "reviewBody": "Well, it seems the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; phenomena penetrated the film-making nowadays. A talented Hungarian filmmaker lady created a nice after-shoot of the &quot;original&quot;. She took two really pretty female characters in the summit of their single-hood, added a cool mix of guys, the not-so-bad (Tamás), the not-so-good (Péter), and the runner-up (Ali), placed these persons into the microcosmos of a theater, and voilà, there is a refreshing and a way more entertaining presentation of the original &quot;Single-Lady-Chases-The-Father-For-Her-New-Baby&quot; scenario.\n\nBut, as always, the secret is in the details. First, this film is a fully loaded comedy, with lots of laughable situations and sparking dialogs. But also a personal drama, about a working woman in her middle of thirties, who already gave up the chance to get a &quot;soulmate&quot;, and the remaining, and quite serious goal is to have a baby. This dramatic motivation pushes her into pretty nasty situations, the outsiders (and the viewers) can easily laugh at.\n\nAnd the story, contrary to the gags is pretty close to the real life, the characters really have depth. That is why can Mr. Csányi, (a star from &quot;Kontroll&quot;) outperform even Mr. Firth. With ease. Same applies to a Ms. Schell - Ms. Zellwegner comparison.\n\nAnd not just the drama balances the comedy. There is lots of emotion presented in the film, but with utter sensitivity. I have to mention Mr. Gulyás&apos; picture crafting talent, some of the sequences are not just perfect, but stunning, especially when he plays with the speed. I think there is the best Budapest depiction in the last decade, compressed into less then 20 seconds. Some of his sequences gave the perfect depth of this comedy.\n\nLet see some of the cons. First, as I mentioned, the story lacks the uniqueness. Some of the repetitions came from a theatrical archetype (secret lover escapes through the balcony), some from more recent films, (a similar scene with the applicants appeared in the &quot;Coming to America&quot;, in the &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, or speaking of Hungarian films in the &quot;Kontroll&quot;). I found some of the gags a bit too harsh, but I guess it is a question of personal taste. I have to add, even the &quot;harsh&quot; ones are way more civilized, than you can experience in recent &quot;campus comedies&quot; like &quot;Van Wilder&quot;. And Ms. Schell&apos;s sidekick, Ms. Dobó, is simply not up to the challenge. The director most probably knew it, and adjusted the role accordingly, but she remained as a weak spot on the film.\n\nSo, if you liked Bridget Jones, if you like to see it with more humor, more life, and more beauty, you should see this film also.",

Skolimowski had a big reputation in the 60&apos;s as an avant-guard director in Poland (Barrier) who had to leave for the West because of the government crackdown on artists. Here he is using Godard&apos;s actors--Leaud and Duport from Masculine-Feminine--and cameraman, and Polanski&apos;s favorite composer (Komeda). The story he tells is so trite, so lacking in human interest as to make the viewer lose all interest in what is happening, and sometimes there&apos;s a lot happening.\n\nLeaud is encouraged to display all the worst features of this young man: the bratty, childish behavior, the forced cackling laugh, so ugly to hear. You won&apos;t laugh at the dumb fights that Marc gets into, or the scene at the hairdresser&apos;s when he gets his buddy to bloody his nose so he can get out of work. When you steal a car, as Marc does three times, don&apos;t the police go looking for you? No sign of that. Catherine Duport--well, the less said about her, the better. It was the third and last film for this ex-model, and a more bovine and boring performer could hardly be imagined.\n\nWilly Kurant gives us the best scene by far; he&apos;s lit the car showroom very sharply and coldly for the car that splits in half with the two lovers in it.

Peppino, his wife Antonia and their five children live in a shanty town, populated by all sorts of tramps, pimps and prostitutes, plus a &quot;professor&quot; in disgrace who lectures everyone on the importance of reading and the beauty of Marxism. Every year a millionairess turns up to play cards with Peppino and Antonia, and every year they hope to win enough money to change their lives, not that they would need much, as they have nothing! The villa in which the old woman (la vecchia) lives is stunning, surrounded by the most beautiful roman trees, in stark contradiction with the grey poverty surrounding Peppino&apos;s family. The underlying theme of the film is class struggle and how the rich keep teasing the poor with the promise of a better future which never comes. But Comencini is not as bitter as his contemporaries (Monicelli, Petri etc): he celebrates love and humanity, something the old millionaire will never own. Needless to say, the performances are formidable.",

      "reviewBody": "Up to the time it was released in 1945 Caesar and Cleopatra was the most expensive British film ever made. It was as though the British cinema was trying to show America it could do a DeMille like epic as good as Cecil B. DeMille or anyone else from Hollywood. It may have been a little too overdone. Director Gabriel Pascal might have gotten a bit carried away with the spectacle and the audience might well have missed some of George Bernard Shaw&apos;s inspired dialog.\n\nAnd Pascal had the advantage of the aged Mr. Shaw personally supervising the production. Of course Shaw insisted on total fidelity to his play and the ideas therein. I understand that J. Arthur Rank wanted to have a little sex and romance in there, like DeMille did do, but Shaw would have none of it.\n\nWhat sets Caesar and Cleopatra apart from other Cleopatra stories that starred Theda Bara, Elizabeth Taylor, and Claudette Colbert is that Shaw portrayed her as probably what she was, a silly teenager who just happens to be Queen of Egypt. There&apos;s a little bit of Scarlett O&apos;Hara in Vivien Leigh&apos;s performance as she moves from silly teen to a young women well schooled in statecraft by Julius Caesar.\n\nClaude Rains plays a world weary Julius Caesar and the Shavian quips roll off his tongue with great aplomb. Like George Bernard Shaw&apos;s other masterpiece Pygmalion, Rains tutors Leigh and the results far exceed what he could have hoped for.\n\nProduction on Caesar and Cleopatra was begun while there was still a shooting war in Europe and V-2s and other such explosive devices were still raining down on the United Kingdom. A couple came real close to the studio in London this was being filmed at.\n\nStewart Granger got his first real notice in this film playing Apollodorus and Francis L. Sullivan plays a blustering and plotting Pothinos. If you look hard among the various slave women you will find both Jean Simmons and Kay Kendall among the extras.\n\nYou will also like both Basil Sydney as Ruffio and Cecil Parker as Britanus, two aides to Caesar who both occasionally give him a reality check.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra failed to recoup the cost of making it in initial release. J. Arthur Rank misjudged the British public taste post World War II. Maybe a little less expense and more attention to Shaw&apos;s words and the film might have been better.\n\nStill it&apos;s pretty good as is.",

      "reviewBody": "Not a bad movie. In fact better than some of the huge budget offerings intended for cinema, lately.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s got all the usual clichés. A heroic scientist, tough American soldiers who don&apos;t take no s___ and distrust heroic scientists, and the tough female agent. It&apos;s also got it&apos;s plot holes and as is often the case with this genre, the heroes always manage to be stood in the right place to not get killed, while &quot;nameless soldier&quot; gets it! They also love a montage, where incredible weapons and sciency stuff can be created in only a few hours! But I could forgive all this, because it was fun to watch and didn&apos;t feel like a chore at any point.\n\nSure, it won&apos;t fire your brain cells to their full extent, but like I said, it has nice touches and a very nice feel, visually. It is reminiscent of recent computer games, such as Gears of War or Titanfall, leading me to believe the creators may be gaming fans. They do get that feel right however. I&apos;d even go as far as to say, give Paul W S Anderson (a staple game/movie director) his WELL deserved marching orders and let this team handle the next game to movie conversion. They seem to understand the look well.\n\nIt also borrows from previous action/sci-fi movies at some stages. I got a feel of Aliens at one point, and the overall story is VERY reminiscent of Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. There are lot&apos;s of little touches throughout, that made me feel I&apos;d been here before, but they never went to the &apos;ripping off&apos; point, but more a nostalgic tip of the hat to previous sci-fi.\n\nThe acting is all solid, aside from moments where the characters don&apos;t seem quite troubled enough, considering they may be snuffed out by an invisible force at any moment, but that is often the case with these movies, due to the short amount of time they have to set the scene, develop characters and tell the story, but aside from this, everyone is likable, if a little two dimensional overall. I think this is why serialised tories are taking off so much in recent years.\n\nThe visual effects are also very nice and miles better than I expected for a straight to Netflix movie. I can&apos;t recall any moment where I cringed at the effects. The war-torn sets were also nicely done.\n\nDon&apos;t go in expecting some sci-fi epic that will change your world view. Go in expecting a bit of fun, with some nice effects and a simple story. Not a bad way to spend an hour and forty eight minutes, if you like sci-fi.",

(not quite a accomplishment, but still...)\n\nIf you haven&apos;t read the comic and maybe not biased by expectations, you most likely like this one. It has all the elements for a good action film and the his personal crusade with his nemesis general turnbull makes it worthwhile to watch.\n\nIMDb rates it with a poor 4,6 I rate it with a 6,5 (G.O.O.S.)

      "reviewBody": "I’d never heard of this peplum before it turned up recently on late-night Italian TV; however, with a bit of research, I realized that it was listed on the “Leonard Maltin Film Guide”. In any case, what particularly drew me to the film was the fact that it starred Marcello Mastroianni – soon to become one of Italy’s foremost leading men and international stars; he’s appropriately dashing in the garb of the Spanish armada but, then, his distinctive voice is dubbed by someone else (films from this country were famously shot M.O.S.)! \n\nAnyway, it turned out to be a very ordinary spectacle – even without taking into consideration the extremely choppy (and muddy) quality of the print on display: in fact, while the film’s ‘official’ running-time is given as 105 minutes, the copy I watched ran for a measly 76! Incidentally, the action sequences (though little of these actually remain in the film as shown on TV!) are here credited to Pietro Francisci – best-known for helming the two Steve Reeves Hercules vehicles from later on in the decade which brought him stardom and cemented the popularity of the peplum genre; for the record, a solo genre effort by Francisci – ATTILA (1954), with Anthony Quinn in the title role – was released within days of this one! \n\nThe plot involves the Spanish conquistadores’, ahem, conquest of the Canary Islands; no sooner have they landed that one of the leaders of the expedition (Mastroianni, of course) meets and falls for a local girl (peplum regular Silvana Pampanini)…without realizing that she’s the current ruler’s daughter! While the old man is willing to negotiate peace terms with the Spaniards, a hotheaded young warrior wants none of it and conspires with the King’s chief adviser to oust their forces from the land. To begin with, they organize an ambush of the Armada who, naturally, retaliate by burning down one of their villages; then, the King is poisoned so that the girl assumes command – and take the rebellious warrior for a husband, since she needs a strong man by her side at such a precarious moment! \n\nNeedless to say, Pampanini has conflicting emotions about all of this: she loves Mastroianni but can’t bear the treatment of her people by the Spanish (despite being merely the direct result of their own provocation!); eventually, she gives in to the warrior’s demands…but, then, thinks back on it and leaves him reeling at the altar during the wedding ceremony! At the end, the two parties engage in open battle (again, it’s so extensively trimmed as to be confusing and deeply unsatisfying) – with the lovers finally re-united against an evocative backdrop of sea and sand, where the fleeing warrior had just then been cornered and dispatched.",

For all the history buffs this is not a movie for them, but if you really just sit down and watch without analyzing every detail it is very enjoyable. The plot is very interesting and interwoven and for the most part the cast does an excellent job. My only exception was unfortunately Hilary Swank. I have always loved Hilary Swank, but she didn&apos;t seem to have a clear understanding of what she wanted to portray with Jeanne. Jonathan Pryce was absolutely fantastic as the cardinal. He conveyed a danger that was very subtle yet frightening at the same time. The costumes were amazing, and I was very happy to see some scenes actually shot in &quot;The Hall of Mirrors.&quot; Charles Shyer didn&apos;t blow me away with his directing style and some shots seemed uneven and out of place, but it was in no way distracting. Overall, it&apos;s a movie that doesn&apos;t necessarily require you to think very much, but it is still enjoyable. I&apos;d recommend it for a lazy afternoon next chance you get.",

      "reviewBody": "I really liked Feast and I recommend it to all my friends. Recently I found out that Feast is a trilogy, so I immediately went towards seeing the other two films. After seeing Sloppy Seconds I have to say that either I don&apos;t remember the first one well or that this sucked a lot more.\n\nAs other reviewers have commented, this is more about the gore than the fun. However most of it is badly made, the little humor that remains is more like Final Destination than the original Feast movie and none of the characters are easy to empathize with. The budget probably was close to none and the monster scenes are either uselessly gory and explicit, either completely ridiculous.\n\nBottom line: I will watch the third installment hoping for a miracle, but if it will be like this one, I will not enjoy watching it. It was more than a letdown and more than a failure, it was a pretty bad movie overall.",

In &quot;Knallharte Jungs&quot; everything imaginable goes wrong, which make this film very predictable on one hand, but on the other the whole &quot;everything&apos;s going wrong&quot;-thing is presented in a very strong and graphical way, so I enjoyed just viewing the visualization although I could predict what comes next.\n\nThe characters are completely out of reality, but nevertheless the actors filled them with a lot of life.\n\n&quot;Knallharte Jungs&quot; surely isn&apos;t on the edge of German filmmaking, but it&apos;s worth to see if you like movies from this genre.\n\n6 of 10",

Seriously, most of the dialog brings the movie to a crashing halt because they just ramble on in such an artificial way.\n\nThe whole situation of them losing their power and water because they haven&apos;t paid their bills is so artificial. Neither one of them even react to the situation the way normal people would. Follow that up with the obvious set-up as to how they are going to fund the film (their friend just happened to be saving up for a widescreen TV..and wow, just like that, he hands them a LITERAL WAD OF CASH.)\n\nWe have Traci Lords in a film about making a Porno...har har har! Can we get any more obvious?\n\nThen the movie switches into Romantic Comedy mode...thats right. We get the overly used, &quot;OMG, we slept with each other, so what does that mean? &quot; plot stolen directly from &quot;When Harry Met Sally.&quot; The problem is, THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY HERE! They tried the &quot;Best Friend&quot; conversation at the beginning of the film, that falls flat and sounds like they&apos;re reciting from a bad script, so their sexual attraction just isn&apos;t believable.\n\nFinally, let me skip to the nail in this films coffin: the &quot;This porno needs an ending&quot; speech from his friend that pushes him into giving her one last chance...and their final scene ends with the romantic music and happy ending flair..I was waiting for the Slow Clap from the film, &quot;Lucas.&quot; :)\n\nKevin Smith, I now crown you as the George Lucas of comedy. Whatever it was you once had, you&apos;ve lost."

All the characters played their roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d, and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling rocks, Pegasus flying, and other scenes had a strong presence with the 3d. A couple weaknesses I saw in my opinion were the character representations of Hephestus and Hades toward the end. Hephestus was seemed to be way scrawnier, too good looking, not serious enough, and too weak for a god. He was a solid character just wish they made him more represented to how he was in myth. Also without spoiling the character change of Hades toward the end was a little interesting, but felt it shouldn&apos;t have been done. The effects were in this movie were awesome especially for Cronus. It also has some great fight scenes that really get you blood pumping. All in all though it was a great action film, with some solid comedy relief, and just a great overall film especially for those looking for flashy effects 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Watched Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya today in a late night preview show and was bit happy and a bit disappointed at the same time with the movie. I am happy because it is a nice movie which dares to blend genres, manages to keep the SciFi &quot;Real&quot;and even manages to find a pretty effective end to literally an impossible love story but I felt disappointed that it may be a bit difficult to savor for the masses and it doesn&apos;t excite as much as its potential.\n\nIt is a feel good movie with nice performances that should do well but if it doesn&apos;t then it will be looked back on kindly and with positivity as time passes. The basic premise of the movie is clear from the trailer - Man falls for a cutting edge very Human like Robot and wants to get married. So it is pretty difficult to imagine a satisfying and still &quot;realistic&quot; ending for the movie. I commend the writers on finding a pretty good ending which feels like it can be a real possibility and doesn&apos;t become a standard &quot;Kuch Bhi&quot; happy Bollywood ending. It is also good that the story not only shows the potential of AI but also comments on the nascency of our understanding of AI and its potential impact. This ending is going to be very hard for the masses to digest. I hope it isn&apos;t too good for its own good.\n\nKriti looks stunning and is pretty well cast as the Android and Shahid looks blindly in love with her. The support cast is good. Dharmendra is good and a pleasure to watch but somewhat wasted in the role. The music and songs are catchy. The jokes are funny. The movie has all the right pieces to become a hit but its theme, genre and well executed but difficult to satisfy ending may be the biggest challenge to it has to overcome For me the biggest negative of the movie is that we have already seen way too much of the movie in the trailer and songs. There are additional funny bits and the ending is completely fresh and new but the trailer feels like almost a 2 minute version of the movie without the ending sequence. The movie is entertaining and the right step towards making new types of movies. I liked the movie. I appreciate this daring effort at a new kind of Romcom. I even applaud the difficult to satisfy ending....but I didnt love the movie. 7/10.",

The cover has Tori Wells and three other &quot;80&apos;s&quot; porn stars, and has a copyright of 1986.  If you&apos;re like me (and I hope you&apos;re not) you&apos;ll think &quot;80&apos;s porn? Tori Wells? Alright!&quot;  Trickery!!  It was made in 1974 and has dubbed German stars!  There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with 70&apos;s German porn, but it&apos;s not my cup of tea, and it&apos;s nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you&apos;re getting. Once I got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket, I watched it anyway.  It&apos;s a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I guess I didn&apos;t really get past the rage.",

      "reviewBody": "What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.\n\nIf you aren&apos;t one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I&apos;m afraid to tell you that you won&apos;t do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls&apos; character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn&apos;t have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it&apos;s great that they have used a so-called &quot;tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy&quot; for the part of Brian O&apos;Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He&apos;s new in the field, it&apos;s his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too."

The campaign involved a cast of thousands and a staggering array of skills, the most sacred of which was the singing of an ancient music that arrived in the Cape on slave ships. Kaatji labored day and night, driven by dreams of glory and, in the end, by pain. You see Hadji Bucks had limitless resources and he used them to lure Kaatji&apos;s best friend into changing sides. \r\n\r\nAfter that, it wasnÂ’t just about the music anymore!\r\n",

I am sure that the catering account for most feature film sets would tower over the entire cost of this picture. This film was a labor of love in all respects and its purpose was to help the viewer identify with the reason for our existence. This film portrays the flawed human character with great accuracy and then speaks to us in a language that Hollywood can&apos;t quite understand. That language is forgiveness. If you truly care about your family and what they watch, this is the movie for you."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d give this a 1 out of 10, but because the colour is good, nothing seems out of focus, big buildings are effectively set alight, I can&apos;t do that, in all fairness. Nonetheless, God only knows how any self-respecting filmmaker could look at the James Bond movies, think &quot;I&apos;d like a piece of that action&quot; and then make this piece of tepid crapola. Not only is it tepid, but it&apos;s embarrassingly, self-consciously smug and seems to think it&apos;s funny. The women are stupid, with vague motivations; our leathery-faced, Marlboro-voiced all-American hero is supposed to be a real lady-killer and action man; and the genre is classified as Sci-Fi. Sorry folks, but one top-secret weapon made with Ruby crystals does not Science Fiction make. (apologies for overuse of the hyphen but I can&apos;t help myself) Richard Egan made a convincing weary gunslinger in Tension at Table Rock, but here, where wit and charm is required, he&apos;s left floundering. Furthermore, he looks as if he wouldn&apos;t hustle if his arse were on fire. To pull of that stunt in this type of film, you have to be a little bit cool, and more than a little bit suave. He doesn&apos;t have it I&apos;m afraid. Sean Connery he ain&apos;t. Heck, Dean Martin he ain&apos;t! Can you believe it: they&apos;ve even given him a wifey type who throws plastic vases at the door in a limp-wristed manner because he&apos;ll be late for dinner while saving the free world from the Red Menace. That could, of course, be funny. But here it most emphatically is not.",

This film is a comedy all the way with Virginia Bruce playing a woman who volunteers to be invisible for scientist John Barrymore so he can let his money man John Howard patent the product and become wealthy again after years of womanizing and eventual bankruptcy.  Very light fare here, but in the typical Universal way very entertaining.  John Barrymore gives a good performance as a very thick slice of ham.  At one point, he is talking to a mouse like an overbearing Shakespearean stage trouper.  Barrymore also has some wonderful verbal assaults with his house maid, played by Margaret Hamilton from The Wizard of Oz fame, and Charlie Ruggles, who does an outstanding job as a butler lacking courage.  Much of the film is silly patter with Bruce exacting revenge on her mean boss played with the usual flair that only Charles Lane can create.  Decidedly a notch below the first two installments of The Invisible Man series and The Invisible Agent, but the film was fun nonetheless.  Where else can you see such a great cast with Barrymore, Lane, Ruggles, Hamilton, Bruce, and even Oskar Homolka(very interesting seeing him young!) and even Shemp Howard!  The best part for me was watching Barrymore try to convince Bruce about the negative effects of drinking, even at one point saying, &quot;dissipate and disappear!&quot;  What an actor!"

Gordon joined husband Garson Kanin when he joined the service and the play is inspired by that experience.\n\nHere, Knox plays the 39-year-old newspaper editor Max Wharton, who feels that he can&apos;t write about the war unless he gets into the fray himself. His boss, Robert Gow (Charles Coburn) has a fit and so does his wife Paula (Dunne) but he insists. Paula gets housing in a broken-down bungalow so she can be closer to him. Max, meanwhile, is having a tough time. There are lots of tests, and there is a theory that people &quot;over 21&quot; can&apos;t absorb anything. Also his boss keeps calling, intending to pressure him to return to the paper as he is needed. Paula keeps Gow from talking to Max, but acts as if Max has agreed to write editorials. She then, under the guise of working on a screenplay, writes them herself.\n\nThis is an okay movie, if somewhat frantic. Dunne always had a wonderful style and a flair for comedy. She does a good job here but it almost seems as if she&apos;s working too hard. She has a huge part and she&apos;s not really surrounded by people as good as she is at comedy, so perhaps that&apos;s why. Knox gives an excellent speech at the end of the film.\n\n&quot;Over 21&quot; is enjoyable, it&apos;s pleasant, it&apos;s no great guns, but the speech at the end is inspired.",

      "reviewBody": "Exciting court-intrigue, costume drama, propelled to almost greatness by Nino Rota&apos;s beautiful score. I was impressed with its tempo and enjoyed the action-filled scenes, and even when the scenes were loaded with dialogs, they were delivered with passion by the fine cast. It is one of those movies in which you do not know who directed what, and where you find Edgar G. Ulmer co-directing with another filmmaker, in this case Italian Giuseppe Maria Scotese (although each artist was given the sole director credit in the copies of their respective countries). It is interesting that both men had backgrounds in the art field, Ulmer being a production designer early in his career, and Scotese starting as a painter and exhibiting his works. The richly detailed sets and costumes, as well as the lush cinematography are more impressive being this a black and white production, and it helped very much filming in Italy, using real and imposing buildings of the past and a majestic ship. Although Louis Hayward was no longer the dashing young man of «Anthony Adverse» (1936) or «The Saint in New York» (1938), first screen outing of the Simon Templar, he was still the agile action man as Captain Sirocco, the swashbuckling alter ego of the effeminate and ironic Count Amalfi. To Hayward&apos;s fine characterizations, Massimo Serato effectively counterpoints as the villainous Baron Holstein, the chief of police who wants to seize power of the kingdom of Napoli, ruled by weak queen Marie Caroline, played by Binnie Barnes. Mariella Lotti is the love interest and Mikhail Rasumny provides the comic elements of the plot. Recommended.",

I think this film is very underrated and should receive more attention than it does, Sol Politos camerawork is very interesting and give some scenes a claustrophobic feeling with his use of light and shadow. If you like atmospheric, dramatic noir dramas I can recommend this one.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fun film - very lighthearted with beautiful sets, fast paced dialog and caricatures at every corner and turn.\n\nIt seems to pay homage to old Capra screwball comedies - and it&apos;s pretty much old fashioned farce right from the beginning.\n\nThe film is far from perfect. Jennifer Jason Leigh&apos;s performance is labored. She tries to squeeze every last snicker she can with her character. She misses the mark in my opinion, moving and talking with so much effort and pace - just to get a laugh - that in the end, she gets none.\n\nPaul Newman goes the other way - he understates his character and when contrasted to the lunacy of both the environment and the story around him - it makes for some great scenes. He makes a great villain in this movie - and for me, he&apos;s a large reason why the movie works.\n\nTim Robbins does a good job, especially at the start of the film. His best moments come when the story and the environment overwhelm his character.\n\nThere&apos;s great moments, like the ridiculous Muncie fight song, the Monty Python-esque mail room, Charles Durning with wings and the grim, faceless board members - with their inane questions and so frightened to lose their authority that they agree to virtually anything.\n\nThis film isn&apos;t genius or anything, but if you enjoyed the antics of something like &apos;Arsenic and Old Lace&apos; then this is worth catching. It&apos;s delightfully silly - and has some interesting visuals and symbolism along the way.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is lots of fun and goes down smooth. Grant is classic as the grizzled boozer who plays look-out for the Allies and a gaggle of young lassies. It is one of the more well-executed romantic comedies (that&apos;s how I would classify it, anyway) and the tension of the final scenes is excellent considering the difficulty of weaving in such weighty material to an otherwise farcical film. Nobody does those twisted-lip facial expressions of exasperation better than Grant.\n\nI will always remember a certain Sunday in lil ole Luverne, Alabama, having a great time with my family watching trusty TBS (the way it used to be). It&apos;s not the greatest movie ever, but it is a fine choice for a lazy afternoon or light evening fun. I give it a 7/10 and it might deserve higher marks. Break out the Orville Reddenbocker, and follow with an &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; chaser.",

It is an easy-going, friendly creation -- not a lot of drama and nothing fearful or anxiety-producing, just a sweet story, which is great as far as I&apos;m concerned. I think anyone would appreciate its genuine humanity. In particular, I loved its ingenuity -- this film is very different from standard Hollywood fare. The opening credits are extremely clever and the magical realism of Latin America was nicely evident. I thought some of the slapstick humor was a little too sophomoric, but there were also some extremely funny moments. The political overtones were occasionally heavy-handed, but the chance for an inside look at the Cuban people makes this film worth the price of admission. The two main actors were children and amazingly good. The filming of the Cuban countryside was first-rate. It is a gorgeous country. There were also a couple of very easy-on-the-eyes guys. (If you see this film, you&apos;ll know who I&apos;m talking about!)",

Hand in hand, these two men from the country of &quot;poets and thinkers&quot; dare utter the words: &quot;we are German, we are funny, and we are not ashamed!&quot; In case you missed Wortmann&apos;s &quot;Kleine Haie&quot; (1992) -- a road film about three young men coming to grips with their thespianism -- here&apos;s proof that comedy is not merely a genre inflicted unilaterally by Hollywood on the rest of the world. Although this film does make concessions in order to be more palatable to its hetero viewership, it is clearly head-and-shoulders above recent Hollywood forays into the queer-exploitation venue such as the abysmal &quot;In&amp;Out&quot; featuring Kevin Kline. After Fassbinder and Wenders it now looks like Germany has a commercially viable director with something worthwhile to say!"

The rest of the cast ain&apos;t half-bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat.\n\nThe story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film. Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. If you don&apos;t pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but I really liked it.\n\nLouis Morneau isn&apos;t all that well known but he has done a perfectly OK job with this one and I never really grew impatient while watching the movie.\n\nMade men is well worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been fascinated by &apos;The Wicker Man&apos; ever since I first saw it on TV in the late 1970s. I was very young then and probably didn&apos;t completely understand it, but I knew immediately that it was a very special movie, unlike anything I&apos;d ever seen before. Twenty five years, and literally thousands of movies later, I think even more highly of it, especially now that I&apos;m able to see the cut available on the 30th Anniversary DVD, which is over fifteen minutes longer than the version I already own on video. And, yes, &apos;The Wicker Man&apos; is still unlike any other movie I&apos;ve ever seen. I think this is mainly down to the brilliant script by Anthony Shaffer, who also wrote &apos;Sleuth&apos; and Hitchcock&apos;s &apos;Frenzy&apos;. There hasn&apos;t been anything made remotely like it since.  I think it&apos;s the greatest British horror movie ever made, but the description &quot;horror&quot; only gives you half the story. It&apos;s also a thriller, a mystery, a Christian morality tale, and in a weird way, a musical. Christopher Lee regards it as the best movie he&apos;s ever been involved with, and describes it as one of the three or four greatest movies ever made in Britain, and I agree with him. Lee is very good in the movie as the enigmatic Lord Summerisle, but Edward Woodward is the real star. Woodward is best know for his TV work, as either &apos;Callan&apos; or &apos;The Equalizer&apos;, depending what generation you&apos;re from, but he&apos;s superb as the deeply religious Sgt. Howie. Apparently Peter Cushing was initially suggested for the role, as was Michael York, but I really can&apos;t imagine either of then being half as good as Woodward is. The supporting cast are all superb - Diane Cilento as the school teacher, famous mime Lindsay Kemp as the publican, and especially Britt Ekland as the publican&apos;s daughter Willow. Ekland&apos;s seduction dance scene is the second most famous scene in the movie. She claims her speaking voice was dubbed throughout , director Robin Hardy disputes this, though her singing voice certainly was, and she used a (ahem) butt double. I also get a kick out of Aubrey Morris&apos; graveyard scene. Morris is a great Brit character actor and was also in &apos;A Clockwork Orange&apos;, Hammer&apos;s &apos;Blood From The Mummy&apos;s Tomb&apos; and sci fi trash classic &apos;Lifeforce&apos;. Another Hammer alumni Ingrid Pitt (&apos;The Vampire Lovers&apos;, &apos;Countess Dracula&apos;, etc.) is also in the cast as a librarian, but sadly in underused. Still, I&apos;m glad she was involved. Inexplicably some people seem to hate this movie. I can&apos;t for the life of me understand why. It&apos;s utterly brilliant, utterly unique, and I never tire of watching it. If you&apos;ve never seen it before I envy you! It&apos;s a cliche, but believe me, you have never seen anything like it before!"

The Beast With A Million Eyes may indeed have a pathetic space ship that looks like a coffee percolator, but the film itself is an understated and serious attempt to deal with issues as diverse as individualism, loneliness, guilt, and spirituality. The film doesn&apos;t rely on stock footage, giant bugs, prescient scientists, granite jawed generals, or any of the other cliches of 50s sci fi. Shot in the deserts of California on a meagre budget, it manages to convey the depression and decay that have overcome the small, but nuclear, farm family headed by the excellent Paul Birch. Birch went on to play a similar role in the 1956 ARC production, The Day the World Ended--another film that is remembered primarily for its goofy monsters instead of its interesting story. This film scared me to death when I was 10 years old, and seeing it now reminded me of the primal fears of betrayal and disloyalty that were the obvious triggers of my pre-pubescent psyche. By no means a &apos;classic&apos;: simply an outstanding example of low low budget independent filmmaking and intelligent screenwriting.",

It is the best movie ever made that features a skier bombing down the mountain while playing the accordion.\n\nI frankly don&apos;t remember much more about the plot, except that the rival is a well-married local who has returned to win the big ski race, there is a girl, an orphan and a mountain rescue - in other words, all the requisite elements of a great heimatfilm.  If you like skiing, gripping drama and good clean Tyrolian fun, this movie&apos;s for you.",

But there&apos;s the one bugger who wants to stick to the party line and ruin it for all. But the citizens get through it with good times, laughter and love. Nice twist at the end brings all this into focus. An ensemble cast without any real standouts -- great direction brings it all together so very nicely.

For the first few minutes I thought it was a fairly standard issue low budget slasher flick, but just as it looked like it was going to take a nose dive, it took a major, unexpected left turn and became a really engrossing and fun ride. I can&apos;t say much without giving anything away, but I&apos;ll say this - the writer/director did a terrific job working with what could have been cliche&apos;d material, and turned in a film that delivers. Clearly done on a shoe string budget, the movie transcends its low cost and entertains massively."

      "reviewBody": "Le Dernier Metro is the portrait of a woman. An ageing, beautiful, authoritative, successful and famous actress caught in her own personal quagmire, and that of a strange historical era.\n\nIt&apos;s 1942 and Paris screams under the German occupation. A quiet scream, at least as portrayed by Truffaut, where Parisiens go on living their everyday lives as close to normal as they can. The German element is of course ubiquitous, always lurking in the shadow of normality like an undiagnosed disease. The black market, the Jewish persecution, the curfew, the collaboration and the resistance, all are accepted as just another fact of life.\n\nThe real threat though is the unknown. What will the war bring? How longer will it last? And yet, decency and normality go on being the bourgeois lifestyle of choice, simply because most don&apos;t know how to really survive without the city, without its theaters and fashion circles. Without this superficial normality.\n\nIn the middle of this strangeness stands a woman disillusioned by her life. Deep inside, this poignantly beautiful, famous, smart and strong woman is empty. Torn between her professional and artistic duties that have increased dramatically since her Jew husband and theater chef fled to save his life, and her ageing femininity and her devoid of passion life, she revolves around the sole remaining centrepiece of her life, acting. Only acting proves to be just another lifeless remain of her previous life.\n\nShould she stay faithful to a husband that she stopped loving a long time ago? Do they both cling on to their failing relationship just for the sake of normality, to survive this strangeness of an era? Will tomorrow ever come, and if it comes will she be too old to enjoy it? Deneuve is perfection. The script has most probably been written with her in mind and it shows. Nowhere in the film is she caught relaxing, even in the most ambiguous moments her eyes are crisp clear on her intentions.\n\nDepardieu is solid but lacks the internal flame his character should possess, probably due to him being influenced by Deneuve&apos;s coldness.\n\nPoiret and Bennent are sublime in secondary but very important roles. Richard underplays his character&apos;s potential as a threat. The rest of the cast are adequate and in control of their roles.\n\nTruffaut delivers a quiet film with claustrophobic cinematography, low-budget sets, fabulous costumes and minimal music. Just like a real theatre show. The director&apos;s brilliance drives through the sharpness of the second World War with a fine comb and picks only what&apos;s relevant to the story, and nothing more. A film to admire, but not to be inspired from. And there lies probably the only fault of the film. The nouvelle vague has matured and settled down with a sigh.\n\nWatch this film just to experience the ferociously magnetic beauty and strength of Catherine Deneuve. Or if you really love theatre. Or both.",

It was like reliving tales told by my grandparents and some of their siblings of their immigration stories.\n\nIn this case this was fashioned tales of Elia Kazan&apos;s parents and their siblings woven together to create an immigrant story. It&apos;s not pretty at times and the black and white cinematography accents the harshness of the experience.\n\nKazan&apos;s protagonist is young Stathis Giallelis and a few familiar character actors are in the cast. No box office names though to accent the reality of the story. Giallelis is a Greek in Turkish Anatolia, a place where during the Ottoman Empire persecuting Greeks and Armenians was a national pasttime. Not that persecution led to any kind of solidarity, the two minorities had it in for each other as much as the Turks.\n\nGiallelis hears of America, a fabled land where this sort of organized persecution and permanent status at the bottom of society doesn&apos;t happen. He resolves to go, but his family only sends him as far as Istanbul (as Greeks they still call it Constantinople)to help out one of the relatives.\n\nHe hears the fare is 110 English pounds and one way or another he&apos;s going.\n\nThe last 15 minutes or so is when Giallelis arrives and there&apos;s a compelling montage of immigrants including our protagonist doing all kinds of menial jobs that we who are here won&apos;t do. It&apos;s no different today with the current folks who want to come here, the ones our current administration is bent on scapegoating for its own purposes. Look folks, that montage tells more than the Kazan family story. it&apos;s your story or mine unless you were born an American Indian.\n\nAnd speaking for the Kogans, Lucyshyns, Scrobacks, and Fleischmans, I&apos;m glad Elia Kazan made America America and told the tale.",

The plot is plausible (for science fiction), paying attention to many small details that often make these kinds of movies farcical. Most important, it&apos;s very existential; humans simply trying to survive against almost insurmountable odds. As the struggle builds, the relationships begin to gel nicely. This IS a movie about human relationships, not Star Wars style hype. I know, there are some weak spots. The opening and closing dialog, Val Kilmer whispering all the way through, some of the dialog, etc. But overall, this movie doesn&apos;t try to do too much (unlike the abysmal Mission To Mars), and that&apos;s what makes it a success.",

      "name": "Tragic romance with some stairs",
      "reviewBody": "The years from 1918-1920 are largely lost in Paul Leni&apos;s filmography, so it becomes difficult to see at this point if the more assured storytelling comes from Leni&apos;s increased experience or the added influence of the co-director Leopold Jessner. I&apos;m actually leaning towards Jessner being the bigger influence because his sudden introduction feels different from what Leni had been making before. Leni&apos;s films had felt overstuffed to a certain extent, but Hintertreppe feels pared down, like a short story of five to ten pages spread over fifty minutes of screentime, like the work of someone who understood that, especially in silent cinema, less can be more. Also, the copy I had listed Leni as just doing the sets even though just about everywhere else lists Jessner and Leni as co-directors.\n\nThe maid (Henny Porten) works in a nice apartment owned by rich patrons and spends her days cleaning their kitchen and manning the back door to the back stairs (the literal translation of the title). After she&apos;s done with her work, she sneaks out to meet her lover (William Dieterle) in the street to embrace. One night, the lover does not come to meet her. The next night he does not come either, nor the following. This gets observed by the crippled mailman (Fritz Kortner) who loves the maid and hates to see her in pain, so he decides to forge a letter from the lover to give to her to make her feel better. She&apos;s so excited that she runs after him to thank him, meeting him in his dingy little underground apartment and discovering his secret of his forgery.\n\nThat is something like two-thirds of the film, and it really takes its time to tell it. I really don&apos;t mind here because it&apos;s about focusing on these two characters as they navigate each other cautiously in the middle of this dangerous looking place. The nature of the world is defined by the set design, and it&apos;s effectively another character (all praise goes to Leni for this). The kitchen looks well-put together, but the titular stairs are dark and decaying (so distinctive that they ended up firmly influencing a lot of German Expressionism afterwards) while the outside world (a very tall set of a pair of buildings up against each other) is dark and imposing. The postman&apos;s flat is simple and dirty. It all amounts to this imposing, grimy environment in which these two characters end up almost entirely alone.\n\nAside from the lover&apos;s early appearance for a minute or so, the maid and the postman are the only two characters for about forty minutes of the film&apos;s fifty minutes of screentime. We see shadows of the maid&apos;s employers behind a glass window having a party, but her existence is otherwise a lonely one. The lack of other actors could very well have been a cost saving move at the time, but it has a great effect of making the discovery between the two all the more affecting. They&apos;re alone, and all they can find is each other, so when the maid discovers the postman&apos;s ruse, she can&apos;t help feeling, after a minute of a sense of betrayal and invasion, that he was just trying to be kind to her (I was honestly expecting something far more nefarious, which I never got, and I don&apos;t mind).\n\nThe tragedy happens when the lover comes back and everything comes crashing down. It fully embraces its status as melodrama with its final movements, and it&apos;s not something I entirely oppose. I don&apos;t hate melodrama, but I think these final moves end up feeling like a more sensational out than something that could have been a bit more character-driven. The issue is that while the relationship between the maid and the postman is very nice, we don&apos;t get deeper senses of their character beyond their stations and the postman&apos;s deformity. Her feeling compelled to do something so drastic after we know so little about her individually feels almost like a cheat. It is essentially a scandalous ending that sort of works, but it could have been better with a fuller portrait of the maid.\n\nHowever, that&apos;s not to take away from the central little tragic romance. It&apos;s quite nice, and it&apos;s framed greatly in this fantastic series of sets. I think it works quite well overall. It&apos;s small, looks great, and has an ending that goes a bit too far, but it&apos;s fine.",

These are the kind of people who read books, listen to music, and watch TV shows just to create a mental checklist of all the things that are done wrong in their own brilliant opinions. So if you follow me so far, here&apos;s my brief review of The Core.\n\nMy reactions to the various big budget disaster movies of recent years have been varied. My expectations were low going into &quot;The Core&quot; because the trailer, while interesting, still made the movie look like major cheese potential. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. For what it is, which is pure popcorn escapism fun, it works. The special effects and sets are excellent, the actors are all good, and the story was not nearly as hokey as I thought it would be.\n\nAaron Eckhart, Hillary Swank and Stanley Tucci are all pretty respectable actors, and they give the movie the substance that it may have otherwise lacked. Yes, the cliché &quot;hacker nerd&quot; and military brass characters are a little old, but they don&apos;t ruin the experience. I have no idea how realistic or plausible the story is. But &quot;The Core&quot; is one of those entertaining movies that will take you away for a ride if you can suspend your disbelief. Thumbs up for a good effort."

      "reviewBody": "Martin Sulik&apos;s Gypsy is loosely based on Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet. The film carries the familiar plot to a rambling gypsy village. Since it&apos;s 21st century and the people have more important troubles than honor and throne like unemployment, open and vulgar discrimination, the basic tension is not constructed on the play&apos;s revenge theme. It is about a young boy who tries to do the right thing for his family and for himself after the death of his father and the marriage of his mother to his uncle. Sulik&apos;s characters are by no means heroic or theatrical, they are ordinary people who want to stay alive in a world of poverty, unemployment and discrimination. They are gypsies who are living on ram-shackled houses or huts, most of them do not have a proper job, stealing seems to be main area of business. This does not affect their mood though, they do not like the cheerful and bizarre gypsy characters of Emir Kusturica films but they also like to sing and dance. Although you feel the agony of poverty and deprivation in every frame of the film, Sulik masterfully portrays a colorful and lively village with its all living souls. He also gives a crucial role to the surreal images, which is a distinctive aspect of his narration style. Although it seems harsh and bitter from time to time, Gypsy is a beautifully photographed impressive and moving picture.",

The plot takes a deceptively leisurely pace but it builds to a gripping climax.  It is worth the viewer&apos;s time &amp; effort to stick with it to the end.  Marilyn Monroe is radiantly treacherous &amp; her performance is subtle and bears close watching beyond her obvious attractiveness.  She should get a lot more credit for this picture than I&apos;ve seen others give her.  Joseph Cotten balances between being menacing &amp; getting our pity &amp; sympathy.  Not all the performances are terrific but this movie is a gem that rewards the effort to stick with it to the end.",

      "reviewBody": "When Gertrud was first released in 1964, the critics weren&apos;t kind to it (one can still see on Rotten Tomatoes the Time magazine review, who said &quot;more museum piece than masterpiece&quot;). Seeing Gertrud some fifty years after its initial release - Carl Dreyer&apos;s last film by the way, and one wonders if he knew it would be the last - I can understand why: this is very, very understated filmmaking and acting. It&apos;s a romance film but much more about loss than about real love... or, I should amend that, it IS about love, and really how impossible it is to hold on to, or to find in the first place, as Gertrud is married to one man (soon to be a Cabinet Minister, oh boy) who she may have never loved in the first place, pines after a younger man who sees it as a fling and is startled to hear there is more on her mind, and one more man, an old friend and respected artist, who has been affectionate to her for years and... then what happened? \n\nWhy I understand is this: at the time this was made, and even more-so today, people want to see some PASSION (in capital letters) when it comes to their stories of love, or at least some sense of energy to the filmmaking - Truffaut and Godard exemplified these two sensibilities in their stories of love and loss in the Nouvelle Vague. Dreyer is much more experimental; characters only every once in a while will even *look* at one another in a scene as they talk - and you&apos;ll find out if you watch, there is a lot of talking, it&apos;s based on a play and it feels every moment of it. This is highly unusual just from an acting standpoint, as in acting the performers will most often look at each other and so that you can&apos;t see any of the fakery of their acting or see the &quot;acting&quot; in quotes - when they&apos;re looking one another in the eye, it&apos;s harder to deceive.\n\nSo why watch it? It&apos;s certainly not exactly a &quot;fun&quot; time at the movies, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything - so many movies out there bring with it the expectation that you&apos;ll get some kind of emotional or intellectual catharsis or consciousness-expansion out of it (Dreyer&apos;s previous Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath are hard to watch at times, but the thrill of filmmaking is there in spades). Getrud asks for your patience and asks you to meet it halfway; if you do, you&apos;ll discover a world of hurt that these actors are conveying in their characters. This is, after all, the world of the upper class that we&apos;re seeing as Gertrud is in this loveless marriage, and yet even leaving is such a difficult task - women so rarely left their husbands then that&apos;s how you got plays that were so groundbreaking as A Doll;s House - so you have to look deeper to see what&apos;s there.\n\nThe takes on these actors last quite a while as well; why have unnecessary cuts when a long take will do just fine? It&apos;s easy to see people feeling antsy watching it, and it&apos;s a difficult film to defend in the sense of &apos;Well, the movie&apos;s really entertaining, it is!&apos; It&apos;s not an easy sit. But, this was something that, frankly, I started to watch late at night thinking that it might actually help me go to sleep - not that I was out against the film already, but I could watch a little, fall asleep, and watch it again the next day.\n\nIt actually kept my attention and I fought against nodding off. It is about something and people who are pining for something that either was long ago there and no longer is, or was never there to begin with and memories have been created to fill in the gaps, as the husband does with his wife. It&apos;s also about how men look at a woman such as Gertrud, and as stubborn as she may be there is more complexity to her thinking and how her view of love and dependency changes. By the end, as an older woman, looking back at a poem written as a teenager, there&apos;s both hope and real sadness for what has been gone and what will be forever gone in death. And for as little as seems to be happening with the cuts or those precious moments where characters look at one another (or, for that matter, those gulfs of time spent looking off into nothingness, trying to find something to fill the void in themselves), everything that does happen matters.\n\nUltimately, Dreyer made a film where we have to see these people. We either can or we won&apos;t, but there&apos;s little to help along the way. It&apos;s bold and provocative, if not something to put on at a dinner party.",

      "reviewBody": "During the Nazi era, a Jewish woman on the run takes a trolley which passes near the Warsaw ghetto, where the uprising battle is taking place, and some passengers are struck by stray bullets. They take temporary refuge in an empty building, and there she has a chance meeting with her ex-fiancé. He offers to put her up--that is, hide her--for a few days. He&apos;s now married, a professional who lives in an idyllic suburb reached by a trolley that runs through the woods. His wife seems more committed to putting up the fugitive than he is. The story involves the neighbors, the building owner who avoids involvement and seeks solace in classic poetry, and the super and his suspicious wife.\n\nThis is certainly one of Wajda&apos;s major films, but it apparently did not get a favorable reception from any faction (Jews, Poles, etc.) and one can see why. It isn&apos;t an easy film: it tackles a difficult subject and doesn&apos;t provide any facile answers or try to provoke a simple emotional response. And the characters are not especially likable.\n\nThe central character is a man who knows what&apos;s right and even DOES what&apos;s right at the cost of his life, but still isn&apos;t very sympathetic. He has no zest for taking a principled stand, and he has a certain lack of empathy. A key scene is where his younger brother, romantically attracted to the underground, goes off to his possible death fighting in the ghetto. The husband doesn&apos;t understand why his wife is crying, and only sees his pesky younger brother&apos;s unexplained (to him) departure as a relief. In short, he&apos;s like a lot of us. In films where characters are faced with strong moral choices, right and wrong are usually clearly defined. Wajda understands that it&apos;s not as simple as that. I saw this film 9 years ago, but this character often returns to my mind.\n\nWajda is not badly represented in the DVD/tape market, but the emphasis is on his earlier films. This is one of the later ones that&apos;s sadly not available. It deserves a wider audience.",

The underlying subtext that sexual appetite makes you crazy is reinforced by the casting of porn star Marilyn Chambers in the lead role (she&apos;s not bad). There are some good scares and some great grotesque images (especially the frozen twisted corpse that was used in the film&apos;s poster).  But the story is by turns confusing and, until the military is brought in at the end, repetitive. It feels overlong for what it is.  Cronenberg had some nice directorial touches--I like the way he uses brightly lit, underpopulated buildings as a backdrop for the horror.",

      "name": "How Roman Ulybin fought for Soviet power or the &quot;Quiet Don&quot; of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks",
      "reviewBody": "Historical drama. The film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the Russian and Soviet writer Konstantin Fedorovich Sedykh. And since I am not familiar with the original source (because I have not read it), therefore I will evaluate the painting as an independent work. In general, I stumbled upon excerpts from this picture by chance when I was watching the TV channel &quot;Spas&quot;, on which Soviet classics are very often played, which I have never even heard of, so I recommend all viewers to pay attention to this channel, which appreciates the Soviet heritage, unlike the first channels, which have long since fallen by the muzzle in the mud and every year they only plunge into it more. So, my brief opinion about the painting &quot;Dauria&quot; - &quot;The Quiet Don&quot; of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks. Despite my good perception of the picture, in addition to the pros, there were also some disadvantages that should be identified, and which influenced the final assessment. And this should end such an important introduction and get to the point.\n\nSo, the pros: 1. Scenario - the picture tells us about the life of the inhabitants of a small Cossack village in Transbaikalia in the period from 1914 to 1918, which fell to the share of the First World War, the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War that followed, in which the Cossacks were divided into white and red, and in the center of the story the fate of a young Cossack Roman Severyanich Smybin, in love with the beautiful Cossack Daria, who was married to another. Everything is mixed up here, and love, and war, and fratricide, and intrigue, and betrayal, as well as the selfless devotion of the red heroes to the ideals of the revolution, and the brutality of the Semenov gangs that staged terror in Transbaikalia. There is a story behind the characters, everyone can be understood, the dialogues are simple and understandable, and very clearly convey the essence of the opposing sides. The characters and types are spelled out thoroughly, because all the characters are real people, with their strengths and weaknesses. But the finale surprised me a little, but we&apos;ll talk about it below.\n\n2. Life, atmosphere, costumes and scenery - especially for filming, Lenfilm studio built a real pre-revolutionary Cossack village, in which all the actors lived for almost two years, in order to look more natural in the frame. Everyday life, uniforms, various little things only give the picture a sense of realism. The viewer is literally transported to that turbulent time, and watches the events taking place. From a historical point of view, it looks great (if you suddenly notice flaws, then comrades military historians - you are welcome in the comments). The final result was worth all the effort.\n\n3. Characters - ataman Yelisey Kargin (Yefim Kopelyan), sergeant Nikifor Chepalov (Viktor Pavlov), Vasily Smybin (Vasily Shukshin), Semyon Nagorny (Yuri Solomin) and so on. Not only are they charismatic characters in themselves, but it is interesting to observe their relationships, because everyone has an idea, moral guidelines, life experience, understanding of the current situation and a forecast for the future, and in the conditions of a raging civil war it is very difficult to take up arms against his brother, uncle, son, father, and so on. Someone is trying to keep neutrality, trying to prevent bloodshed in the village, someone is ready to sacrifice everything for the victory of one of the parties, and someone is simply trying to survive in this turbulent time, but all the characters, sooner or later will have to make a difficult choice in this war, otherwise this choice will be made for you, but you will be responsible for all the consequences.\n\n4. Fights, battles - they are staged and filmed quite well, because all parties to the conflict are fighting fiercely, and everyone intends to bury the enemy as deep as possible underground. Each side has authoritative commanders, followed by fighters to the death. Yes, there is indecently little blood in the picture, yes, again the fall from the alleged &quot;hit&quot; of a bullet, and the modern viewer, spoiled by the &quot;Avengers&quot; and other blockbusters, is unlikely to find this watchable, I&apos;m not saying exciting. But for Soviet (and Hollywood) movies of the past years, we make a discount on the time of release, and here it should do the same.\n\nSo, the cons: 1. Provison in the middle - the fact is that the first series ends in August 1914, and the second series begins already in 1918, when some of the heroes find themselves in the ranks of the Red Guard, and some in the gangs of ataman Semenov. Creators! And does it mean that the viewer should not know what happened to the characters for five whole years? How did Roman Ulybin end up among the commanders of the Red Guard? What, it wasn&apos;t even possible to indicate it in text? Seriously? Fellow viewers, you&apos;ll forgive me, maybe it&apos;s all described in detail in the book, I repeat I haven&apos;t read the book, but I&apos;m looking at the picture, and everything should be clear to me from the picture. It&apos;s not here. Sad!\n\n2. Ataman Semenov performed by Zinovy Gerdt - I respect Zinovy Efimovich, he is a great actor with an inimitable voice, but here his intelligent appearance does not fit the role of a tough tyrant Semenov, I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t even believe it was Semenov until I started checking. We could have invited Arkady Tolbuzin (Colonel Kudasov from The Elusive Avengers), and it would have been more convincing.\n\n3. Open ending - I know that the original book has a sequel (called &quot;Father&apos;s Land&quot;), but in the picture everything ends with an open ending, from which it is unclear what happened next. And since there was no sequel, the fate of the heroes remained unknown. It is not good to do this, given the great popularity of the painting in the USSR.\n\nA little about the main characters: 1. Roman Ulybin, performed by Vitaly Solomin, is a young and dashing Cossack who became the commander of a red partisan detachment fighting with Semenov&apos;s gangs for peace and justice in Russia. A daredevil, not devoid of charisma and a certain amount of charm, whose role was played by the magnificent actor Vitaly Methodievich Solomin. Bravo!\n\n2. Vasily Ulybin, performed by Vasily Shukshin, is Roman&apos;s own uncle, who became a &quot;shameful stigma&quot; in the family and village before the revolution, and after the revolution became the commander of the Red Guard fighting Semyonov&apos;s gangs. A brave, determined commander and a fairly authoritative leader, whose role was played by a good actor Vasily Makarovich Shukshin. Bravo!\n\n3. Yelisey Kargin, performed by Yefim Kopelyan, is a village chieftain who keeps order in the territory entrusted to him, even in conditions of civil war, tries to support the villagers and does not join any of the parties to the conflict, for which he is punished. A bold and firm ataman in his decisions, a role that was successful for Yefim Zakharovich. So, Burnash turns out to be good. Bravo!\n\nAs already mentioned, the picture was accepted by the Soviet audience with a bang, despite the solid timing (almost three hours), but there was no continuation, and in fact it was needed, so the fate of Roman Ulybin and other heroes remained unknown. Pity!\n\nMy rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

The opening scenes are fantastic, it&apos;s a very smart looking film, it looks great. The content of the film is decent, it&apos;s such a shame that Robert Englund didn&apos;t do the film, but I can imagine he feels it&apos;s a role that&apos;s well and truly in the past. That fact was a nail in the coffin for the film, I&apos;m not sure what many were expecting.\n\nSome of the scares are a little on the tame side by today&apos;s standards, but the story is good, it deserved a bit more loving that it got. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "¨Django dares Sartana¨ was well directed by Pasquale Squitieri as William Redford . Passable Western concerning about a bank robbing , then Steve (Alvar) is suspected to have committed the hold-up . After that , a bloody vengeance takes place , as Steve is hanged by the enraged townspeople . Meantime , Djanjo (Tony Kendall) takes the law on his own hands against the killers who murdered his brother , this one was a bank clerk and while making love with a prostitute (Tania Alvarado) , he is subsequently kidnapped , mistreated and hung to take a loot . Acceptable Spaghetti dealing with usual theme : a relentless revenge . It deals with Djanjo (Tony Kendall) who seeks vengeance when his sibling is lynched and hanged ; as he carries out a cruel slaughter , and he thinks of Sartana (Giorge Ardisson) is real culprit , then it occurs the predictable battle of wits . Shortly after , Djanjo find out the true executioner of the grisly killing is a nasty band , as he joins Sartana and both of whom kill anyone they meet for blind vendetta . As Djanjo pulls off his vengeance by means of a cruel manner . He is relentless in his vendetta , deadly in his violence . The conflict is simple , one between avenger Djanjo , helped by Sartana, against relentless murderers and never hesitating to kill. \n\nIt&apos;s an exciting Vengeance western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Tony Kendall/Ardisson against the ominous enemies   . Both of them are fine, they ravage the screen , kill , betray , hit and run , and they execute massacre and atrocity , they proceed a single-handedly revenge , and kills each enemy involved on their way ; and ultimately takes places the final showdown . This thrilling western contains a story full of violence , good dramatic pace and slick direction though packs some flaws . Enjoyable Spaghetti Western ; it follows the Sergio Leone wake , including close-up , zooms , choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . The film packs action , shootouts , drama , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining . It&apos;s a moving western with attractive outdoors and breathtaking confrontation among heartless protagonists , and their nasty nemesis and slimy , menacing underlings . Decent action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody shootouts at the end . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actors , Tony Kendall and Giorgio Ardisson , are good in their usual tough as well as silent roles . There appears habitual secondaries in Italian Western , here in their ordinary roles as a villains and in cruelly baddies characters , such as : RickBoyd , Fortunato Arena and Tania Alvarado . \n\n \n\nThe musician Piero Umiliani composes an attractive soundtrack , well conducted , this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie , as it&apos;s plenty of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background and with agreeable leitmotif , including catching songs and ballads stunningly sung . Nice cinematography , including good sets, filmed on locations in Rome, Lazio, Italy and Elios studios . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Pasquale Squitieri , under pseudonym William Redford , though contains some gaps and flaws. Pasquale was longtime companion of actress Claudia Cardinale , who usually played his films , and father of Claudia their daughter . He is a writer and director, especially known for Atto Di Dolore (1990), Russicum (1988) and Mussolini&apos;s lover (1984). He also made another Western titled ¨La vendetta è un Piatto Che Si serve Freddo&quot; or &quot;Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold&quot; (USA title) (1971) . He wrote/ directed a lot of movies dealing with Italian Mafia such as 1988 Russicum , 1985 &quot;Il Pentito&quot; or &quot;The Repenter , 1978 L&apos;arma , 1978 Corleone , 1977 Il Prefetto di Ferro , 1975 El Ambicioso or &quot;The Climber&quot; , 1974 I Guappi , 1972 Camorra ; many of them starred by his wife Claudia Cardinale and notorious Spaghetti actor Giuliano Gemma",

I&apos;m not sure if they had American backing or if the director/producer or whoever was a fan of hers, but she almost put me off the movie. And I quite like her in other movies, but this one ...\n\nWith that being said, we get more of Largo and his back-story. While I&apos;m not familiar with the source material (haven&apos;t read anything, only watched the first movie), it seems like there is a rich story behind the character. I&apos;m not sure if there will be another installment into the series (could go even further back I guess), but I do know that Largo made an impression on me overall. Good action-thriller that delivers what it needs to",

This film is an unbelievable contrast : simplicity and sobriety in form but ultimate sophistication in content and in the actors&apos; performance. I have never seen a film which raises so many questions at the same time : war, family, tolerance, women&apos;s condition, fanaticism, homosexuality, etc. Furthermore, it is a wonderful love story between two people who are actually too good for the world they live in. And last but not least, the contrast between the scruffy apartments and the beauty and elegance of Mastroianni and Loren is incredible. Mr. Scola achieved a masterpiece without make up, special effects or wonderful sceneries. When you have seen the film, you will understand that the special day was not for Mussolini and Hitler, who all the sudden seem very unimportant compared to what happened to the two characters. The day I have seen this film was definitely a special day for me as well, unforgettable ! It is just the most human film I have ever seen, a wonder of refinement."

      "description": "Italian cinema&apos;s most iconic screen couple, Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni - here cast against glamorous type - deliver the finest and most nuanced performances of their career in this rarely seen masterpiece finally presented, restored and remastered in 4K - with striking desaturated colours - as originally created by its multi-awarded director Ettore Scola.\nOn this special day in 1938, all of fascist Rome has been mustered to a parade for Hitler visiting Mussolini. Loren&apos;s working-class housewife, Antonietta, left alone to her chores, meets the only other person left in their block, Gabriele (Mastroianni), a persecuted homosexual radio announcer. The two, who are poles apart, forge an unexpectedly close friendship that will change their perceptions of love, politics and life itself...",

We&apos;re not here for intellectual enlightenment but for the forceful, visionary, smart ass style of one of the female filmmakers that has already revolutionize the Broadway stage without, really, changing anything. I believe that&apos;s the kind of revolution that leaves a sign. The kind that reassures rather than confuse and &quot;Accross the Universe&quot; does just that. The Beatles are reassuring their message is reassuring. Little did that generation know that things were going to take a terrifying turn. Love! Love! Love! All You need is love. Still true but we&apos;ve never been, as a society, so far apart. It was great to see teen agers humming the Beatles tunes coming out of the theater. The lyrics are like Gospel or lullabies. Was it only yesterday? It feels like centuries ago. The innocence seems foreign and at the same time so real. It will be nice to go back with the experience of hindsight. It doesn&apos;t work like that, does it? No, I&apos;m afraid not. In the meantime the great Julie Taymor gives as a beautiful reminder. And a lovely evening out at the movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Yet another of those French films that just catch a moment in time and the bitter-sweet fleeting relationships of people, shot with attractive photography, backed by charming music and centred on a good-looking pair of adulterous lovers. \n\nBored rich wife Élizabeth and her teenage daughter Cécile leave Paris for a few days&apos; holiday in a spa hotel at Vittel run by the effervescent and ever-swigging Madame Édith. Élizabeth soon succumbs to a another guest, a mysterious solitary Italian called Giovanni, while Cécile promises her virginity to a lad in the kitchens called Georges. That&apos;s all there is: no plot, no action, and no character development beyond the fact that every love affair changes a woman at least a little.\n\nIt would be going too far to say the story enters the territory of Chekhov, though it is reminiscent of his tales of empty lives. For no political, cultural or spiritual dimension clutters the simple account of the parallel encounters. Echoes of French history intrude very tangentially when the characters visit Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, already turning into a shrine to the recently departed General de Gaulle, and a fountain at Domrémy-la-Pucelle allegedly used by Joan of Arc, a previous saviour of the nation. \n\nDirector and scenarist Jean-Claude Brialy gives himself an amusing cameo when he reprises his brief rôle in &quot;Les 400 coups&quot; as a man trying to pick up a beautiful woman. Back in 1959 it was Jeanne Moreau and here it is the delectable Romy Schneider, whose charm carried the picture for me."

To entertain the wealthy they are set off into the wilderness with a 3hr head start hunted down and killed.\n\nPersonally I liked this angle, not only did it work in theory but it worked in practice as well. Instead of playing the suspense and tension card like the others it becomes a full on action film and surprisingly (Considering I&apos;m not an action guy) it very much works in the movies favor.\n\nTurkey Shoot is a fantastic piece of Australian cinema and had it not been for a couple of unfortunate flaws could have been a true classic.\n\nThe Good:\n\nInteresting twist on the classic tale\n\nVery well paced\n\nAll round likeable movie\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLooks and sounds very dated\n\nCouple of spots fell flat",

A man is imprisoned and spends his time talking to his equally animated penis who has opinions of his own.\n\nIt&apos;s been awhile since I even thought about this film but I don&apos;t remember hating it, though nobody I knew would go with me to see it. Every character is represented by an talking human/animal. The marquis slides his member through a crack in between the loose rocks in his cell and hurts himself pretty badly. He cuts himself open to use his own blood to write his stories. A cow/woman gets raped and produces milk/blood out of her udders which is grotesque.\n\nI guess the story is riveting if you&apos;re in the theatre with nowhere else to go. Otherwise, you may find yourself returning to the place where you rented this, complaining to the management. Sorry I couldn&apos;t be of more help in this review, but it was over ten years ago."

It&apos;s 1924: little Elmer Smith loves little Hattie, but she despises him because he&apos;s a sissy. In 1940, Elmer has grown up to be Earle Foxe and Hattie to be Derelys Perdue. When she still doesn&apos;t love him, he climbs into his airplane and goes to hide. Meanwhile, a germ is spreading across the earth that kills all men over fourteen.\n\nIn the distant future year of 1950, the Teahouse Gang locates Earle living in a tree. He is the last man on earth. They bring the timid creature back to a world of women that can&apos;t keep their hands off him. When the cat lady who is the President finds out about it, she arranges a boxing match between two junior senatoresses, winner take all.\n\nSome parts of this silent comedy have not aged well, but there are some good gags and sequences in it.... just the idea of Earle Foxe as the beau ideal is image to make anyone snicker. The costume designers also had a lot of fun making the clothing as ridiculous as possible. By 1940, we are led to believe, garden-party clothes for young ladies will be thigh-length hoop skirts over harem pants. Ten years later, Roman togas will also be things that the well-dressed woman will wear. And hats! Weird hats decorated with all sorts of knick-knacks; only Miss Perdue will wear fruit on her chapeau.",

This is certainly a very strange, bizarre yet unique love story/thriller that asks a lot of deep questions but sadly none are really answered due to the lackluster ending. The first hour is certainly hard hitting stuff with some eerie atmosphere that goes a long way. Nicole Kidman turns in another brilliant and incredibly brave performance, which should have gotten more attention but I guess it was overlooked due to the controversy surrounding a couple scenes including the one with her and the kid in the bathtub together. What I enjoyed best was that the film played out as something from real life and not B.S. we see in a movie. The characters are all very mature, they think and act the way people do in life and not in some normal movie. Danny Huston and Lauren Bacall co-star. Anne Heche is also very good in a role I didn&apos;t even know it was her at first."

      "reviewBody": "I had enjoyed Japanese writer-director Shinobu Yaguchi&apos;s Swing Girls back in 2004, in a story of how a group of schoolgirls mobilized to form a big band jazz group, trained and finally perform in competition. It had a simple story made great by the excellent cast in endearing characters, as well as awesome jazz music to go along. In my attempt to revisit some of his earlier works, it had led me back to the Waterboys.\n\nWaterboys almost follows the same formula, where a group of misfits get together, and against all odds and everyone&apos;s pessimism, manage to pull through and put up one heck of a performance. Along the way, they encounter seemingly implausible obstacles which stand to derail their plans and hopes, and sometimes watching them come through in comedic ways just puts a smile on you. It&apos;s one of those feel good movies without any real villains to snarl at, just being there to cheer them on as they try to give one of the best performances of their mundane lives.\n\nA youthful looking Satoshi Tsumabuki (starred in this year&apos;s Nada Sou Sou) plays Suzuki, the only member of his school&apos;s swim team, who gets more members than he bargained for when a beautiful teacher, Mrs Sakuma (Kaori Manabe) becomes the swim coach of the all- boys school. But after a comedy of errors, we&apos;re left with 5 nerdy boys who must rough it out to be synchronized swimmers instead, bringing guffaws from their schoolmates and folks in their neighbourhood.\n\nNot wanting to give up, they enlist the reluctant help of a dolphin trainer (Naoto Takenaka, who was also in Swing Girls) at Sea World, who trains them through unorthodox methods, which brings on the laughter and allows space for the boys to exude charm during their weird routines. It&apos;s basically an underdog&apos;s story and their struggles to fulfill a promise, whether or not they look stupid or effeminate while doing it. And thrown into the mix is a budding romance between Suzuki, and Shizuko Kiuchi (Aya Hirayama), a female karate exponent from a neighbouring all-girls school.\n\nAnd when they finally get their act going, you&apos;ll be left wanting more. That&apos;s how a bubblegum movie should be, in order to cover its breezy, simple plot. Thoroughly entertaining, and suitable for all ages.\n\nThe Code 3 DVD from Alliance Entertainment (as with most locally pressed DVDs) comes without any special features. Visuals are letterboxed, and the quality of transfer is decent. The audio comes in Dolby Digital Stereo, and subtitles are available in English or Chinese. Scene selection is available in 8 chapters.",

It could have been a lot better if there was more exposition about the villains. They were certainly the best part of the film.\n\nIf you liked the comic, it&apos;s probably worth seeing. If not, you may want to wait for video."

This film IS a comic book.......a story, visually told, verbally disjointed....ON PURPOSE.\n\nThere is nothing in this adaptation that smacks of the original written work....and that&apos;s OK......it would have been MUCH darker with the HIV angle...more like the twisted film &quot;24th Day&quot;.....\n\nThis was silly fluff, and nothing more than a fun little ride through a comic book. Those that were looking for a cohesive through line.....nope, not there....and that&apos;s OK...since when do all films NEED to be told in a strict linear fashion that fits into a societal mold.\n\nThe actors gave their roles a great film noir bite, and I must say that the banter was some of the smartest written for a &quot;gay&quot; film in a long time (or have you all forgotten the inane babble from &quot;Eating Out&quot;). Each character was a grotesque caricature...and I loved this movie for that...even the brother/sister relationship.....true ugliness done up right.\n\nThe DVD did offer a not so satisfying alternate ending, wherein Dean is conversing with the ACTUAL head (the cooler lid is off) and ASjr. is responding....not so good...much better to have him drive off into the sunset with our imaginations doing the gruesome dirty work.\n\nFinally, the &quot;meandering&quot; storyline everyone is bitching about.......are you kidding......101 minutes...BLAM...flew by....and I&apos;ve seen this film maybe 20 times...always show it at dinner parties.....those in our circle who get film noir, and who &quot;get&quot; the comic book mode...LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!"

Without giving anything away it will keep you guessing all the way through..enjoy it for what it is.",

His talent was as precocious as his temperament was tormented. He was a political idealist and a prodigious poet, until the destruction of La Commune de Paris and the recuperation of Parisian society by bourgeois values lead him to disillusionment, to abandoning poetry altogether and to going into overseas adventures and ultimately, death.\n\nThere is no music in this film. It is spiced with Rimbaud&apos;s letters and poetry and entirely told by characters who knew him, including Verlaine whose friendship turned into a love that lead to abandon wife, child and bourgeois comfort to follow Rimbaud in London and in ultimate destitution. The pace is unimposing. Each scene is relevant to paint a man teared apart between a domineering but loving mother living in a too quiet country town, and his exalted emotions surging from his unease with existence and society. And for once, the narrative is exact, with no invention added to the plot for dramatization purposes.",

The photography by none other the great Sven Nyquist more than makes up for some slight sluggishness in the narrative. \n\nSchell&apos;s direction is lyrical but not overt or showy. But it is the leads that make this a touching and memorable adaptation of the Turgenev story. Hard to find but definitely worth it."

The great director gives us eight vignettes that often seem more like messages than dreams, speaking to the danger of nuclear power, damaging the environment, and senseless death in war. Guilt is a recurring theme, and as the film covers childhood to old age, it seems very personal to Kurosawa&apos;s own life. The images are often beautiful, and I absolutely loved dream #5, &quot;Crows,&quot; where an art student runs through Van Gogh&apos;s paintings and meets him. The highlighted work, &quot;Wheatfield with Crows&quot; is so profoundly meaningful to the end of Van Gogh&apos;s life that seeing it here in the elderly Kurosawa&apos;s work gave me goosebumps. I didn&apos;t mind the preachiness that&apos;s in several of the other dreams too much, though it did take away from the film&apos;s surreal feeling, but the bigger issue was pace, which was almost always too slow. It&apos;s a must-watch film for fans of Kurosawa and I&apos;m glad I saw it, but it needing paring down.",

      "name": "Provocative and mesmerizing foreign cinema",
      "reviewBody": "Great acting, wonderful script, open sexuality and provocativeness is so refreshing next to most American films, has a wonderful sense of blocking. Realizing you need to live your life your way before it ends. Love being a fantastical idea that only exists when it seems like everything will go away or you are young &amp; innocent. Realizing your own past mistakes and errors can be made up for, and finally living a life that you seemed to have lost, passion finally regained. Life is tough, but not enjoying the brief time you have is even harder. So many wonderful lines of dialogue that provoke thought and made you think about the life you lead, and the lives that are led around you. Asking questions about stagnant marriages, the innocence of young love, and finally resisting the stasis and escaping to your own self-reflection. Love to see when characters learn, change, and grow from the stasis from which they are kept. Impeccable performance by Claudia Michelsen, such vulnerability and the wonderful quite frustration, wanting to explore but unsure how far to go. Ulrich Tucker is also wonderful as her husband, a man who cheated on her, broke her heart, yet still has the gall to complain about her finally doing the same thing to him, somehow sympathetic and conniving at the same time. Derflinger shoots the movie impeccably, with an eye for the cross between bodies, and the way the bodies come together and separate. The human body as an experiment of filmmaking, how it moves and how it ends up, we are all the same species yet so far apart. The screenplay is wonderful, the dialogue is so beautifully written, each monologue was like I was being spoken to through the screen, hit me to my core. Dialogue about the ritualistic process of marriage, breaking up, loving, and falling back out of it. The midlife crisis is a horrifying journey, we know that life will reach that eventuality but doesn&apos;t make it hurt any less. The beauty in the tragedy, plays like a Shakespearen play, without all of the murder, just the murder of a broken heart. Also just really damn mesmerizing and engaging, only 88 minutes but just kind of flies by, just a series of well-written characters &amp; scenes you actually get involved with."

I&apos;m surprised that this movie didn&apos;t do better in the theaters, given the cast - which all perform marvelously. My favorite part about this movie is the way it explores a Dick theme that Blade Runner fans will no doubt recognize: What makes us human?"

      "reviewBody": "Varg Veum is the hero of the titular novels written by the godfather of Scandinavian crime fiction, Gunnar Staalesen, and he is one of the most well fleshed out characters in the genre. The name translates in English as &apos;&apos;wolf in a holy place&apos;&apos; and is the best description for Staalesen&apos;s protagonist who is a private investigator with a strong moral compass and decent, though not extraordinary, detective skills that help him to solve the various cases he takes. His past experience as a social worker, mainly dealing with delinquent children, make him more sensitive and intuitive and also helps the audience to empathize with him.\n\nThe television adaptations are wonderful and Trond Esper Seim proves to be the best choice for the role of Varg. His performance is measured and esoteric and it succeeds in the difficult task of embodying a demanding fictitious character who has become a legend in his hometown of Bergen. All the stories, twelve in total, are compelling and engaging, unfolding in a nice, steady pace and some of them have some well-placed and effective twists that make them all the more intriguing. The cinematography is also breathtaking with the majority of episodes set in the beautiful Norwegian landscape.\n\nIn the sea of today&apos;s Nordic Noir television exports, &apos;&apos;Varg Veum&apos;&apos; stands out both in terms of quality and entertainment. If you are a fan of the genre, you should check out immediately this Norwegian production which is on the top-5 on my list of the best Scandi-Noir television series of all time. It should also be noted that the book series are ongoing and the latest novel, titled Wolves at the Door, was published on April 14, 2019.",

      "reviewBody": "The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , fierce combats and groundbreaking struggles . Classic as well as impressive Chop-Socky in which wild fighting scenes provide an overwhelming view of Jet Li skills . It has lots of fights , as well staged as Jet Li&apos;s Hong Kong films . It is set in Paris where a betrayed intelligence officer (Jet Li) enlists the aid of a prostitute (Bridget Fonda) to prove his innocence from a deadly conspiracy while returning a favor to her . Li against time to clear his name and rescue a junkie whore and her daughter . When the secret mission goes wrong he is framed for murder by a nasty as well and amusing villain officer , Insp. Richard (Tchéky Karyo) ; as the Chinese agent will face off a bunch of heinous henchmen across threatening streets of Paris . Then Li has to go on the run pursued by corrupt cops , being his only ally the mistreated call-girl and an old Chinese shopkeeper (Bur Kwouk) .\n\nThis moving Chop-Socky displays drama , action-packed , thrills , and wild fighting images . It is an action-filled and violent film , being utterly filmed in Paris . Li shows awesome skills , as he hits , punches and kicks most of Paris hoodlums into tiny pieces . The battle scenes are sliced up by means of flashy quick cuts that sometimes reduce Jet Li&apos;s extraordinary athleticism to a little more than the backdrop to a video clip . An exciting art martial movie in which , once again , an oriental Chinesse super cop is sent loan to tackle crime in the West . The style of action in this movie was heavily influenced by comments made during series of messages posted by fans on the Jet Li website forum , immediately after the release of Romeo must die (2000) in the United States , the fans wanted more realistic fighting as in Jet Li&apos;s movie Jet Li&apos;s Fist of Legend (1994) . The rousing fights include deadly use of fists , feet and palms ; being perfectly staged by expert Corey Yeun . Fights , attacks and exciting combats very well staged by great fighters , in fact , here are only seven wires used in the entire movie, the only scenes involving wire work were when Jet Li had to jump up to kick the pool ball and when Cyril Raffaelli performs his one-and-a-quarter backwards somersault-kick ; the result is a strong entry for art martial buffs . Actors made their owns stunts ; some of the players got injured and to had to be hospitalized during the shooting , some of them suffered mild concussions during filming, after being struck several times during fighting scenes . The only scenes that used CGI are when Jet Li falls down the laundry drop with CG flames surrounding him and in the hotel scene when Jet Li kicks the ball from the pool table . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios , including luxury hotel , is developed an intrigue about women exploitation and dealing with a Chinese agent who attempts to restore his name . \n\nColorful and luxurious cinematography by Thierry Arbogast . Adequate musical score fitting to action by Craig Armstrong . This moving film was lavishly co-produced and written by the great producer/director Luc Besson and well realized by Chris Nahon . Director Chris Nahon had to slow down the fight scene between Jet Li and Cyril Raffaelli because they were moving too fast for the camera. Filmmaker Nahon establishes his signature style of kinetically-paced story-telling through sumptuous imagery , leading to international critical acclaim . Chris Nahon was born in France , he is a good director and writer, known for Empire of the wolves (2005) , Blood: the last vampire (2009) and Kiss of the dragon (2001) . Rating : Better than average art martial movie . Worthwhile watching .",

      "reviewBody": "The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70&apos;s, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.\n\n&quot;El Secreto de Sus Ojos&quot; is a film awarded with the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year with a dramatic story that perfectly entwines crime, thriller and a subtle romance in an adequate pace. The direction of Juan José Campanella is tight and the screenplay is wonderful, unfolding two lead stories – the brutal murder of a young woman and the repressed love of a subaltern for his chief – with many subplots. The acting is top-notch, with excellent dialogs and many funny lines but never vulgar. The cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and there is one specific scene very impressive with the camera approaching to the stadium in the middle of a soccer game between Huracán and Racing. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Segredo dos Seus Olhos&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Your Eyes&quot;)",

It really brought back the feeling of being an awkward teenager and the fantasy of being guided through adolescence. There were a few quirks with the story but this can be overlooked by how the sensitivity of being an awkward teenager can be is portrayed. I do think the bones of the story could be updated for a remake that could possibly make more sense but still be a fun movie.",

So it is with Julien and Sophie, the central characters of this film, who in childhood become fast friends because of a game they share (or visa versa) which involves one challenging the other to do something outrageous while passing a gayly decorated candy canister to them. Upon completion of the dare, the canisters is passed back and the dared person announces &quot;Game!&quot;. And so it goes, back and forth, as the children grow to adolescents and then to adults with the brinksmanship and friendship becoming increasingly substantial and the ubiquitous canister the ever present reminder of their unspoken bond. Finely crafted though sometimes disjointed, this creative work is full of life and energy and passion and its ever escalating story is maddeningly captivating and unsatisfying as it waxes toward its inevitable and somewhat clumsy conclusion. A love it or hate it audience dividing flick, &quot;Love Me...&quot; can be appreciated on as many levels as it can be condemned. The only way you&apos;ll know if you like it is to watch it. (A-)",

      "reviewBody": "One of the most successful translations of &quot;comic book to screen&quot; has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.\n\nThe simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.\n\nEveryone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter&apos;s best friend.\n\nAdmirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It&apos;s heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??"

Fantasies of Oskar Luts have been visible to the audience.\n\nSomething that has to be mentioned are the wonderful, warm songs. Almost every single one of them is a classic.\n\nConsidering the Soviet power which ruled Estonia at that time, the movie is surprisingly human, free of any kind of propaganda. It is a must-see for anyone connected to Estonia.",

The cinematic aesthetic of his movies from the 70&apos;s were reminding me of illustrated magazines with glossy pages and photos of celebrities on the covers, beautifully printed and sparkly colored but a bit empty of content. From that moment on, I stopped watching his movies. &apos;Il y a des jours ... et des lunes&apos; (the English title is &apos;There Were Days ... and Moons&apos;), made in 1990, was a pleasant surprise for me. I decided to see it because of the presence in the cast of an impressive number of well-known French actors, and I was immediately captivated by the original idea and the interesting concept. It is not clear to me why this film is not better known, commented and debated in the context of Lelouch&apos;s filmography and other films with similar themes.\n\nFrom the very first scene, Anouk Aimée&apos;s off-screen voice announces that one of the film&apos;s heroes will die in less than 24 hours. There are many candidates, in a human mosaic and a multitude of events that take time to form and find their place in the structure of the film. We are dealing with couples who are falling apart after many years or just a day after the wedding, with lonely men and women who met the wrong men, with a depressed singer and a truckload driver stressed by his boss, with a priest who is in love with a pianist and a little girl who observes everything and asks about everything, with police officers who drive over the legal speed and with traveling actors. A whole world that seems to be in chaos, but actually finds itself under astral signs - the full moon and the penultimate solar eclipse of the 20th century, combined with the transition from winter to summer time. Is the fate of all these people predestined? Will their paths converge to the same place and at the hour doomed to be fatal for one of them?\n\nI liked many things in this movie, especially the way the stories unfold in parallel and the pace of the action accompanied and marked by an excellent soundtrack. The charm of the film lies in the humanity of the collection of small and diverse stories, presented with empathy and understanding. Not all the characters are well defined, some of them are perhaps even redundant and could have been omitted at editing to make the ensemble a little shorter, simpler and more clear, but the formula works. Made in 1990, &apos;There Were Days ... and Moons&apos; was one of the first films to approach in a new-wave-ish manner the theme of astral signs guiding the destinies of heroes, and is also among the first films that use traffic jams on the highways as a framework for unexpected encounters and conflicts of the modern world. I believe it&apos;s a movie worth watching (or re-watching) and discussing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;National Velvet&quot; tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents.\n\nWhile &quot;National Velvet&quot; is a family film that fact shouldn&apos;t deter anyone who typically views such films with derision. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention-addled youngsters. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.\n\nAnne Revere, in the part of Velvet&apos;s mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also on board is Oscar-winner Donald Crisp as Velvet&apos;s father, Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as Velvet&apos;s older sister.\n\nThe film&apos;s lustrous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film&apos;s two Oscars. Additionally, the film was nominated for its direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography &amp; art direction. The score by ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning, though it went unnominated.\n\nAll in all, &quot;National Velvet&quot; is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn&apos;t exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on.",

His output was prolific, but TERJE VIGEN is one of my favorites-- it captures well the angst and anxiety so pregnant among Scandanavian and Danish masters (Dreyer and Bergman come to mind as spiritual successors/contemporaries of Sjostrom). TERJE VIGEN, in particular, is one of those stories that will haunt but also reward. The cinematography is what one would expect of a film that is literally more than 100 years old-- innovative for its time, it is very subtle. Where this film really shines is in the phenomenal acting, especially by Sjostrom himself.",

      "reviewBody": "Ernest Saves Christmas is a very underrated Christmas holiday flick. I will agree that it is very silly, and certainly not Oscar worthy. Don&apos;t expect a sophisticated plot, and a superlative script. Expect a harmless and fun Christmas comedy, that way you are in for a good time.\n\nWhile very predictable in plotting and rather repetitive and slow in the middle half; especially in the first thirty minutes Ernest Saves Christmas does have its funny moments. And I must say the scene with the magic sleigh was uproariously funny. Amongst the humour, is an in general heart-warming story about Santa and his attempts to find a successor.\n\nThe camera-work may be a tad dated, but the music is very nice indeed. And I actually thought the acting is above decent, with the late (and talented) Jim Varney wonderfully spirited as Ernest and Douglas Seale is simply great as Santa. The opening credits with the collage of Christmas carols were a delight.\n\nErnest Saves Christmas is an above average seasonal comedy about the power of belief and the dignity of an individual. It is far from a masterpiece, but seriously I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be. I got exactly what I wanted, a fun film that while predictable and silly is lots of fun too. I do also think it is underrated; there are much worse movies out there, namely any of the Friedberg-Seltzer movies, Home Alone 4 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Worse than Hudson Hawk, worse than Billy Jack, worse than than any other movie you can name. It really has to be seen to be believed. The lead actor should be thrown in jail for his performance in this movie and Danny Aiello&apos;s acting is sub-par even by his standards. The plot&apos;s so stupid it&apos;s hardly worth a laugh and the dialogue couldn&apos;t have been written by someone with more than a fifth grade education. The music is so cheesy you&apos;ll catch yourself wondering if the movie&apos;s supposed to be funny and you&apos;ve completely missed the joke. I usually enjoy horrible movies, but Power of Attorney is so bad it tried even my patience, and that&apos;s saying something. I defy anyone who&apos;s had the displeasure of watching Power of Attorney all the way through to name worse movie.",

Miyayama employed beautiful framing and use of light. The acting was very good.\n\nSure there were odd things like the Jack Wolfskin rucksack that were not explained, but this did not detract from the storytelling. It would have been pretty boring to include a scene of her buying a German brand rucksack because her Japanese bag got damaged en route just to satisfy a handful of pendants like escadamausgaby. To be sure, we were given hints ahead of time of in what way the story would unfold, but for me that only enhanced the emotional impact of the story.\n\nFor me Marie Miyayama was very successful at conveying the heart of her story - one certainly felt the sincerity of the director&apos;s intent. I look forward to seeing more films from Miyayama in the future.",

Voice characterizations led by Nick Nolte, Sylvester Stallone, and Cher give the animals personality but really little else. James is definitely a likable comedic force, but he deserves better material. The leading ladies struggle to keep up his mild momentum and really the animals are not even needed as their appearances sometimes distract from what is going on as the plot limps along into development. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "To be quite honest, not everyone will be taken with this movie, particularly if they are not already familiar with the Hemingway stories. These stories were written sporadically, but most readers of the collected Nick Adams tales have not found it difficult to see in them an arc of a young man&apos;s life, from his hell-raising days in the thick woods of Michigan, through to his growing maturity in World War I. The problem, of course, is that the story format makes the whole thing highly episodic: like a photo album of significant moments.\n\nTo some extent, the movie manages to blend this away, although at cost to the integrity of the original stories. Still, it is such a help to see these stories made visual that any objections are overcome. Further, the performances of the many distinguished actors involved -- above all, Paul Newman as the punch-drunk Battler -- are truly distinguished.\n\nI liked this movie thoroughly, although it needs to be said that &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946), from another of the Nick Adams stories, is undoubtedly better as an adaptation. Still, it&apos;s hard not to admire the audacity of those who put together &quot;Adventures.&quot; It&apos;s probably about as good as it could be.\n\nIt is really very irritating, at any rate to those who know the originals, that the Region 1 version is still censored, and for absolutely no discernible reason.",

In the two weeks I have had it in my possession I have watched it at least ten times and I expect to watch it many more times in the years to come.\n\nThis movie is absolutely amazing. Its cinematography boggles the mind. Filmed long before the advent of computer special effects, it shows us tiny elves in the presence of full-size human children seamlessly working together.\n\nIt has wonderful music that I just cannot get out of my mind. It has children, some of them well under 10, acting along experienced professional adult actors as if they were old pros, a great tribute to the art and craft, and probably psychology, of director Oldrich Lipsky.\n\nThe story is both funny and endearing, both dark and innocent, even romantic. A great movie for the whole family, children and adults alike.",

People, even people who know me pretty well, thought/think there was/is something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or I should say, devotion for &quot;Le Locataire&quot; They may be right, I don&apos;t know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within Polanski&apos;s darkness and I haven&apos;t even mentioned the humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes over him and, naturally, us, me. That building populated by great old Academy Award winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is compulsory viewing.

      "reviewBody": "Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn&apos;t just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in &quot;liquid metal&quot; machines. Robert Patrick&apos;s performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he&apos;s not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he&apos;s a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won&apos;t stop. Not only that you don&apos;t know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he&apos;s better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he&apos;s great entertainment.\n\nEleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah&apos;s experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John&apos;s younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of &quot;a mimetic polyalloy&quot;, a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on &quot;Judgment Day&quot;.\n\nTerminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn&apos;t seen it, there&apos;s something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold&apos;s line &quot;It&apos;s in your nature to destroy yourselves&quot; is something that always sends chills down my spine because it&apos;s true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie&apos;s eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said &quot; The terminator wouldn&apos;t stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him.&quot; meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it&apos;s just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.\n\n10/10",

Only Zarah Leander manages to captivate the audience with her songs and her (beautifully photographed) languorous face.\n\nThe song &quot; Nur nicht aus Liebe weinen&quot; will continue to haunt you well after the end of the film!\n\nAll in all, this film will be appreciated by Zarah Leander&apos;s fan. If you are not (or if you are not familiar with 1940&apos;s Gernan cinema), you might want to give it a miss and opt for another of Leander&apos;s films.",

      "reviewBody": "Ridicule is a French film which takes place in 1783, a few years before Louis XVI lost the ability to wear a hat; where &quot;...in this country, vices are without consequence, but ridicule can kill.&quot; The film is about the effect of wit and word play on people&apos;s lives and careers. Malicious, mannered and highly enjoyable. Charles Berling, Jean Rochefort, Bernard Giraudeau and Fanny Ardant are excellent. A man would be a fool not to want to bed Ardant, and even more a fool to trust her. The love affair between Berling and his deep-diving sweetheart is amusing and endearing.\n\nThe film is sumptuously mounted. The dialogue is so clever a knowledge of French might be in order, but the English subtitles do a superb job of conveying the witty, cruel, self-serving word play.",

I think Macmurray has an accident, and by the time he wakes up, Smoky has been sold.  Macmurray searches for him. The tale tells of both man and horse&apos;s adventures apart.  At the end, Macmurray inadvertently comes across a man beating his horse, and Macmurray comes to the horse&apos;s rescue.  It&apos;s raining, the horse is harnessed to a cart on the city street, Macmurray suddenly realizes it&apos;s Smoky.  Even through the rain, you know Macmurray is crying tears of joy.  It almost seems as if Smoky is too.  I love this movie and would love to find a vhs copy to watch over and over.  It must be at least 35 years since I&apos;ve seen it. It was made in 1946, but I think it was released in 1951, my birth year. Julie",

Story is routine but the dialogues are excellent and heart touching. Shreeya is one asset in making success of this film especially her innocent looks. Comedy by Brahmanandam is very nice. He is the one we can say who can create comedy without dialogues. His way of moving head and gear-up in the film makes one to laugh by just watching itself. Songs are nice. One can not recognize that the music director is R.P. Patnayak. Because our telugu people can immediately recognize his songs. But the tunes in this film are completely different from rest of his movies. Singer Usha did well. The song &quot;Ne toli sariga&quot; is the highlight of the film. If any one is feeling boredom just watch this film.",

The great performances of Robert Downey Jr and Anton Yelchin convinced me that the Principal of a school and a troubled student could end up helping each other and overcome the predictable high school conventions. It was surprising and satisfying, and the outcomes for many of the characters were positive in a not-unbelievable way. I understand why some people would see the likeness to Rushmore, but for me that was a uniquely brilliant Wes Anderson creation that can&apos;t be touched by films with apparently similar plots. Charlie Bartlett is worth seeing for its own sake and it is a rewarding experience. Anyone who has been a teenager should appreciate it and fans of Robert Downey Jr will also get the bonus of his character opening up about a history of drug abuse that seems to come from the heart of this wonderful actor.",

      "reviewBody": "Phool Aur Patthar review :\n\nLong before Salman Khan went shirtless to evoke cheers from his fans, the original He-man of Bollywood - Dharmendra - appeared bare chested in O. P. Ralhan&apos;s Phool Aur Patthar which established his image of a macho action star. The minute garam Dharam removes his shirt and starts moving towards a sleeping Meena Kumari only to cover her with it, the audience used to go berserk with excitement. A young voluptuous Shashikala seducing Dharam in the song &apos;Sheeshe se pee yaa paimane se&quot; was another &apos;taalimaar&apos; moment in the film.\n\nDharam played the kind hearted toughie Shaaka who protects the widowed Meena Kumari and tries to turn a new leaf but fate has something else in store...\n\nThe beautiful Meena Kumari and Dharam shared a solid chemistry which ensured Phool Aur Patthar to be a roaring hit at the ticket counters. It also became a re-run favourite at Paradise Cinema, Mahim playing multiple times there in the &apos;80s and &apos;90s when I saw it on one such occasion. Dharam&apos;s entry and the shirtless scene evoked ceetis from the audience even after so many years.\n\nDharmendra&apos;s Shaaka character was replicated many times in other &apos;80s films particularly in Pahlaj Nihalani&apos;s Aag Ka Gola (1989) where beta Sunny Deol played the namesake good hearted goon.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie&apos;s a quality outdoor production with engaging characters, solid script, and compelling scenery. So how did they get the cougar to go through his involved paces on apparent cue. The trainer or someone should get special credit since it&apos;s the cat&apos;s roaming that sparks the plot. \n\nSpindly city lad McCallister arrives in Utah high country complete with suitcase and city suit. The question is what to make of him since the native woodsmen are a tough lot, from the men to the boys. But tough as they are, they can&apos;t seem to take out the predatory cat that&apos;s taking their stock. Turns out that McCallister&apos;s related to grouchy Foster, but how he&apos;ll manage to fit in with his city ways is the big question. Good thing that sweet little malt-shop Garner&apos;s there to flounce her dress at him. I like the way the thoughtful screenplay sets events in Depression era 1930&apos;s. Among other things, it explains why McCallister moves from ravaged city to high country unknown.\n\nThere&apos;s lots of outdoor action with no obvious sets. Note how noir director Karlson zeros in with close-ups to catch fleeting emotional moments, especially with Foster. Plus the chest butting between a blustering Foster and Tucker seems authentic as heck. But especially, there&apos;s that surprise about two-thirds way through that I sure wasn&apos;t expecting. I guess my only gripe amounts to a cougar without claws since Spike the dog is left unbloodied following his many tussles with the big cat. I guess the predator was understandably de-clawed before filming. Anyhow, I hope they gave the two critters a good payday for all their good work.\n\nAll in all, I can see the movie being produced as a boy&apos;s matinée. After all horse and dog movies were very popular during the latter &apos;40&apos;s. Nonetheless, the film&apos;s quality is really much better than most. In my book, the result happily qualifies as a guys-of-all-ages creation that&apos;s as entertaining now as it was in &apos;49."

Curse is mediocre but it does have some good things.\n\nPros: The film does look decent, the title sequence is fun, the music is wonderful, Ted Wass is good comedic value, Roger Moore&apos;s cameo is another bright spot and the part where Wass sits on the giant duck is hilarious. Herbert Lom is entertaining as Dreyfuss and Joanna Lumley doesn&apos;t grate like she did in Trail of the Pink Panther.\n\nCons: The story is very standard, slow moving and predictable, and the film is overlong. The script is fairly weak too and some of the gags and jokes don&apos;t work as well as they should have done. Sadly this was David Niven&apos;s last film, and he deserved a better swan-song, he is a good actor but he looks uninterested and bored.\n\nOverall, mediocre but has a few good things to make it watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.\n\nThe movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won&apos;t have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn&apos;t take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn&apos;t like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...\n\nThe story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you&apos;ll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.",

Jackson and Cage are as usual wonderful actors, and the supporting cast does a pretty good job too at impersonating a variety of morons and other petty opportunists."

      "reviewBody": "Emil i Lönneberga is a series of children&apos;s novels by Astrid Lindgren, covering 12 books written from 1963 to 1997. Emil, the title character, is a prankster who lives on a farm in the district of Lönneberga (Swedish lönnar: maple; berg: hill, mountain), in Småland, Sweden.\n\n5-year-old Emil Svensson lives with his family on a farm called Katthult. He has got fair hair and blue eyes and looks like an angel, but is not, as he also has a prodigious knack for getting into trouble. Emil is not malicious, but does not think about the consequences of his actions. For example, he gives away food - which is meant to be dinner for relatives who will soon come to visit the family - to the poor because in his view they need it more. Every time Emil plays a &quot;prank&quot;, he escapes his father by locking himself in a tool shed. This is not a severe punishment for Emil, who likes sitting in the shed and takes to carving a wooden figure during each of his stays. He eventually accumulates 369 of them, save for the one his mother buries because she claims it looks too much like the rural dean.\n\nHis parents are Anton and Alma Svensson, Ida is Emil&apos;s little sister - a very well-behaved child, unlike him. She has tried to pull pranks like her brother since she wanted to go to the shed, which she thinks is cozy, but she failed. His father, in particular, is often angry with his son, though it has been seen many times he still likes him a lot when he does not make pranks. His mother, however, adores her boy and tends to say, &quot;Emil is a nice little boy, and we love him just the way he is.&quot; She also writes down every bad thing Emil does, in a blue book, although, that blue book expands to several blue books. Alfred is the family&apos;s farmhand, and Lina is their maid. Alfred, who is very fond of children, is Emil&apos;s best friend, whereas Lina dislikes the boy. She is in love with Alfred and pesters him with her wish to marry him, a subject which Alfred tends to avoid.\n\nEmil&apos;s father is portrayed as a very typical inhabitant of Småland - for example, he does not like spending money. In Sweden, this is regarded to be characteristic of people from Småland. Church is very important, and the priest is a regular visitor. Alcohol and swearing are strictly forbidden in the Svenssons&apos; house. The books give a vivid impression of Swedish farmers&apos; daily life in the beginning of the 20th century.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is everything a prehistoric adventure should be. Forget the fact that dinosaurs and man did not co-exist...this is just as much a fantasy as &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot;.\n\nThe world of &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; is insanely brutal, where man is the weakest creature in a harsh landscape of volcanoes and giant monsters. The Rock People have lives that are &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot;, where only the strongest survive. They are dominated by the rugged chief Akoba, whose two sons Tumak and Sakana are in a constant battle to see who will gain his favor. Sakana gains the upper hand and Tumak is banished into the wastelands. After dodging monsters, he finally arrives at the seaside domain of the Shell People, who are more cultured and civilized. He captures the eye of the beautiful Loana and the two have a non-stop series of adventures.\n\nThe narrative is direct and primitive, befitting the primeval setting. John Richardson is quite good as Tumak...he is decent but still has a lot of barbarism in him. As for young Raquel Welch, not even the special effects of Ray Harryhausen could outshine her incredible beauty in this film. Even in our own time, gorgeous babes like these are rare...they would be totally impossible in the prehistoric world. The stunning Raquel is pure eye candy and succeeds better in this regard than any other actress in film history. Especially noteworthy is her cat-fight with sultry Martine Beswick, no slouch in the looks department herself.\n\nRay Harryhausen outdoes himself again with brilliant stop motion dinosaurs. Look at the realistic movements of these creatures, which have not been surpassed by CGI. The ravenous Allosaurus who duels with Tumak is a particular stand-out, but the battling Triceratops and Ceratosaur are also pretty cool. The movie also features the more standard giant lizard dressed up and made huge, but even this scene is better than most of its ilk. An eerie scene featuring ape-men and some colossal earthquake and erupting volcanoes round out an exciting picture.\n\nDon&apos;t look for anything really deep in this one. Just expect primitive action with plenty of monsters, battling cavemen and the awesome Raquel Welch. This movie does everything it sets out to do.",

      "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t track down this rare flick till last year, but am I glad I did. This one stands as a strong entry into the post-nuke genre. The plot is simple: after the nuclear war, small pockets exist where the radiation levels are low enough to sustain life. These areas are known as &quot;Survival Zones&quot;. The story follows the lives of a family on a farm, trying to eek by after &quot;the big one&quot;. This is definitely a B movie, and the acting less than stellar, but it makes up for it in spirit. I really liked the overwhelmingly positive attitude displayed by the father. This is just what would be needed to get through a situation as dire as this. He was the glue that held his survival unit together. What really hurt the movie was the budget. There was no footage of any devastation: flattened cities, burnt-out buildings, nothing. No money for special effects here, like radiated zombies, etc. The only way you know what happened is from dialog. This hurt the overall impression of how bad the aftermath of World War III would be. They only make one trip to a city for supplies, and it looks normal, just abandoned. The heavies in the movie are leather-clad cannibalistic bikers (a bit cliché, no doubt). I&apos;m not sure what the significance of the plastic baby doll parts on his helmet and clothing was!? If it was supposed to be scary, it wasn&apos;t. Nevertheless, the realities of kill or be killed in a lawless world are presented quite clearly, and provide a lot of food for thought. \n\nAs far as I know, this never made it to DVD, so you will be forced to locate a used VHS on online, but it will be worth the search. If you can look past the numerous small flaws, it is a solid flick. \n\nIf you like these types of movies, also check out The Aftermath, Def Con 4, Damnation Alley, Warriors of the Wasteland, and After the Fall of New York.",

      "reviewBody": "I really wanted The Lazarus Effect to be good. It has a great cast and an interesting premise, and I love horror movies so why should this be any different? Well first of all calling it a horror movie is a bit of a stretch. Yeah, there are &quot;scares&quot; but they&apos;re all the cliché flickering lights, someone coming up behind someone else&apos;s back, fake out, cheap ass easy jump scares that we&apos;ve seen a million times and you can see them coming from a mile away. \n\nThe best thing this movie has going for it is its atmosphere. It all takes place in an empty laboratory and there are some moments where you feel the claustrophobia of being trapped in a place where dead bodies are kept and weird surgical instruments all over the place. But none of that psychological horror is expounded on. It&apos;s just like one second I&apos;m like, &quot;hm, this could actually go somewhere&quot; and then two seconds later a freaky face pops on screen and it&apos;s like ugh, why bother.\n\nThe acting in this movie is fine for what it is. Aside from the two leads, Evan Peters was the only character I cared about because he was the comic relief but he just isn&apos;t given enough to work with. Everything about the movie feels rushed. The characters aren&apos;t developed enough. The movie is barely 80 minutes long and it still has dull moments. It also borrows a lot of elements from other horror movies. A good chunk of the movie is straight up &quot;Event Horizon&quot; in a laboratory with some &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Lucy&quot; sprinkled here and there. Sure there is some creepy imagery but it&apos;s stuff we&apos;ve seen a million times. If they had actually built up tension instead of relying on stupid jump scares then maybe the imagery would have some effect. As it stands, it&apos;s just like... what a waste.\n\nI can&apos;t give this movie a lower score because it did have potential and I liked the cast. There are some moments that are admittedly cool, however brief they are. Oh, and none of the movie makes sense. It starts off plausibly with these doctors performing weird experiments but as soon as sh*t starts to go down, any sense of realism goes out the window. The Lazarus Effect isn&apos;t terrible - there&apos;s just no reason to see it. Go see &quot;Event Horizon&quot; or &quot;The Shining&quot; if you&apos;re in the mood for some real psychological scares.",

He was great in NOW AND THEN(1995) as the boyfriend and in IDLE HANDS(1999) as the pothead. SLACKERS is a good grown-up role for him, although he will ultimately need better scripts if he is to break out and become a major star.\n\nScwartzman is fantastic. He reprises his role from RUSHMORE,but he plays it in a more seedy, hateful, sociopathic way.And King, what can one says? She is terrific.\n\nI was not looking at this flick with too critical of an eye. It is not Shakespeare. But if you don&apos;t mind some raunchy humor, realistic language,and brief nudity, this film works on its own level as a college comedy."

      "reviewBody": "Comedy films in France are different from comedy films made elsewhere in the world.This is because the French look at humor is different from the way it is approached in other parts of the world.In the past Buster Keaton and Max Linder were great comic artists but there was a marked difference in their comic styles.French comedy is a kind of comedy mixed with a fair doses of intellectualism,seriousness whereas American/British comedy is a pure comedy entirely dependent on funny, comic situations.One has to watch most of the Woody Allen films to see that effect.French humor involves auto derision which is similar to Italian humor but it bears no resemblance to other types of humor practiced in the world.Un ticket pour l&apos;espace is a hilarious french comedy film directed by Eric Lartigau.Although space travel happens to be one of the major themes of the film,writers of this film Kad Merad and Olivier Baroux use all of their available imagination to the maximum possible level to give us a funny concoction of silly life of a failed actor,stupid males falling over a beautiful woman and a criminal brother taking revenge.The result is a laugh riot where we learn why space travel is becoming more and more popular.This is a perfect film which might give some ingenuous ideas to Sir Richard Branson to commercialize space travel.",

If you did like The Descent, for the record the follow up even with the tantalising story setup it is sadly a huge disappointment. \n\nSurprisingly the excellent editor Jon Harris gives a poor directorial debut. Even with some of the strong original cast including Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza, they simply can&apos;t save J Blakeson and James McCarthy poor screenplay. On board is Eden Lake&apos;s writer James Watkins and support from cinematographer Sam McCurdy (The Descent, Dog Soldiers, Doomsday to name a few).\n\nIt feels and looks like a poor mans interpretation of the Descent, it&apos;s not a straight to video production but its almost there, awful dialogue, little if any character development, no suspense and poorly executed scares and that&apos;s just touching the surface. The film looks rushed, the lighting, sets, sound, direction, everything on screen looks cheap and nasty. It lacks the grittiness of the first and the Crawler&apos;s don&apos;t look as menacing or a realistic.\n\nIt is only worth watching to see how film with such great talent can go so wrong."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Catacombs&quot; stands out in the catalogue of Charles Bands&apos; Empire Pictures; it&apos;s actually pretty good, with a refreshing lack of cheese and camp. Yes, it&apos;s possible that it may bore viewers hoping for more action and a high body count, but it has a serious, somber quality and atmosphere that makes it quite effective. Filmed at Empires&apos; Italian studios, it&apos;s earnestly acted by a sound cast, deliberately paced, hauntingly scored (by the ever reliable Pino Donaggio), and uses the classic theme of good vs. evil to good effect. Granted, the finale is somewhat underwhelming, but until then the movie works well.\n\nDirected by David Schmoeller, who co-wrote under a pseudonym, it stars &quot;Class of 1984&quot; villain Timothy Van Patten as Father John Durham, who lives in a monastery but isn&apos;t part of the brotherhood of monks residing there. The place is visited by a schoolteacher named Elizabeth Magrino (Laura Schaefer, &quot;Ghost Town&quot;), and this seems to serve as a catalyst for supernatural phenomena to occur. John, Elizabeth, and the others realize then that there is an evil presence on hand.\n\n&quot;Catacombs&quot; is bolstered by its engaging performances; Van Patten is low key but likable, as is the lovely Schaefer. Ian Abercrombie (&quot;Army of Darkness&quot;) and Vernon Dobtcheff (&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;) each have a warm presence as the monks who give Elizabeth a nice welcome, while Jeremy West is very good as Brother Marinus, a humourless stiff who distrusts her presence. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. is touching as the terminally ill Brother Terrel. And viewers are certain to remember cast member Brett Porter as the creepy possessed albino.\n\nProduction design (by Giovanni Natalucci) and cinematography (by Sergio Salvati) are first rate, and special effects are good but kept to a minimum.\n\nFans of 1980s horror who love discovering the more obscure offerings may find this to be very respectable and interesting.\n\nEight out of 10.",

Right?\n\nNope. Instead, this cult&apos;s followers burn each other alive, blow up airports and have developed a lethal virus that completely drains the human body of all blood. Hey, I&apos;m not opposed to daft plots when they&apos;re amusing, but 20th Century Boys pretty much lacks humour, as &quot;mysterious&quot; people point Kenji - the film&apos;s protagonist - in the right direction so that he can play a game in which he may or may not get to save the world.\n\nYeah, it&apos;s that dumb. And upon figuring out that all these terrorist attacks taking place are being scheduled by the events of a comic Kenji drew as a kid, instead of taking the said comic to the authorities on finally finding where he left it some 25-30 years ago, Kenji instead runs over to a friend&apos;s house, digs out his old guitar and jams out in the morning&apos;s early hours!\n\nBut that&apos;s perfectly logical, since Kenji once aspired to be a glam-rock star.\n\nWith a running time of well over 2 hours, I can&apos;t recall the last film I watched during which I spent almost as much time looking at the clock. Unfortunately, the sheer humdrum and stupidity of the film all got too much to bear and I eventually turned it off. I now waste even more time over this crap-fest by advising other IMDb users of its sheer awfulness.\n\nAvoid.",

      "reviewBody": "After discovering that she can regain youth and beauty by bathing in the blood of maidens, an aged Countess (Ingrid Pitt) courts a handsome young cavalry officer, but after she learns that the sanguineous youthifying is temporary, the body count begins to rise. The film is one of Hammer Films&apos; more &apos;adult&apos; horrors, with less emphasis on the &apos;monster&apos; (in this case just a murderous old woman obsessed with regaining her youth) and more on the dread surrounding her. Much of the lurid film is about sexual relations, including the strange &apos;four-sided triangle&apos;, in which an older man (Nigel Green) desires the mature countess while the young officer (Sandor Elès) lusts after her youthful incarnation. There is some gratuitous nudity thrown in for good measure but not a lot of overt gruesomeness (despite the premise). The story is based on the legend of Elizabeth Báthory, a real-life 16th century Hungarian noblewoman rumoured to have depraved tastes for torture and who allegedly bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her beauty (the &apos;Dracula&apos; in the film&apos;s title is more about marketing than about history, legend, or plot). Most of the script and acting (especially by Pitt when she is portraying the &apos;young&apos; countess) is rudimentary but the production values are pretty good and the &apos;aging/ugly&apos; makeup is effective (if sometimes inconsistent). In the end, I found the film watchable (and seemingly more than the sum of its parts) and the final scenes are quite good (although they may be a letdown for viewers expecting some kind of bloody dénouement). Not among of the best of Hammer&apos;s extensive horror output but at least a bit different from the Lee/Cushing canon (despite the derivative and misleading title).",

Sharing adventures involving poachers, badgers and battling storms, the two have formed a strong bond and now view each other as heroes. Once again, Vaek has a memorable summer vacation. \n\nPreviously we saw Vaek with almost a naively enraptured view of nature, mainly because of his age, his grandfather&apos;s protection and his innocence. The primary lesson in this conclusion is that it&apos;s time for grandfather to teach him about understanding the life and laws of nature, and his innocent becomes replaced with a more sympathetic view when Vaek realizes that nature must be protected at all costs. Of course, being the cute little boy he is, this causes a whole series of comic situations while teaching the viewers about the importance of environmental protection.",

      "reviewBody": ". . . and it&apos;s not even about the war.  There&apos;s no wall to wall action.  In fact, World War II is merely the setting  a backdrop so to speak  and the battles are all downplayed in favor of giving the audience a glimpse into the brilliance (or insanity) of the historically significant character, Patton.  From the script on up, everything plays out wonderfully to bring the famous general to life on screen, and after watching George C. Scott deliver his Oscar-worthy performance, I find it hard to believe there were a number of actors on the list above his name.\n\nGeorge C. Scott&apos;s performance of Patton is one I consider the greatest given of any war film.  Patton is a champion for freedom while sometimes equally as much of a tyrant as the ones he&apos;s trying to put down, he&apos;s a monster and a hero, and neither he nor the filmmakers give a damn about political correctness.  I found the character to be an overly harsh prick, myself, but in some strange way, very likeable and sympathetic, and when watching the movie again I don&apos;t look at the screen and say, `Hey, there&apos;s George C. Scott.&apos;  Instead it&apos;s, `Hey, there&apos;s Patton.&apos;  Not very many film characters have a personality strong enough to overtake the actor playing them.  I appreciate that depth and that degree of realism, this attention to detail on the parts of Scott and Schaffner.  \n\nSchaffner surprised me by somehow managing to capture my interest on a subject matter I&apos;d ordinarily write off as too silly (Planet of the Apes); two years later, he applied that same technical know how, craft, and intelligent storytelling towards a film whose subject appeals to me from the get go, and once again I&apos;m impressed.  There are some great war films out today; however, Schaffner&apos;s take pursued the most unique perspective in all realms, and captured my imagination with such ease . . . I can&apos;t help but come back to it over other war films.\n\nAnd I have to comment on the score, which is not only one of my favorite Goldsmith scores but also one of my favorite war-film scores.  Jerry Goldsmith matched point for point the brilliance of Franklin Schaffner&apos;s vision, the depth of George C. Scott&apos;s performance, and somehow managed to captured the essence of both musically.  A good music score is one that tells the story of the film in its own unique voice.  Goldsmith&apos;s score has such a prominent voice in the experience of Patton, that to remove it would be the equivalent of removing Schaffner&apos;s direction or George C. Scott.   \n\n Lastly, how accurate is the film?  Not a clue, and even if it is completely false, I don&apos;t care.  I&apos;ve never been about writing history papers based on cinema experiences.  All I know for certain is that Patton is a very entertaining and well balanced movie that holds up very well thirty years later, and it&apos;s a film that can be admired for its craft."

      "name": "A whirlwind tour of corruption and diplomatic deceit",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is an important film, dealing in detail with the great issues of current American society, with a degree of skepticism that our newsmedia has proven entirely incapable of exhibiting in the last decade. Lone gadfly Michael Moore cannot singlehandedly reverse the effects of a servile corporate media, but he can -- and does -- fling it right back in their faces. Is it any wonder televised interviews with Moore have been less-than-cordial of late? \n\nIt doesn&apos;t matter. For a film like this, any publicity is beneficial, and Michael Moore has gone out of his way to thank his conservative detractors for their support. \n\nAs a movie, it&apos;s a whirlwind tour of corruption and diplomatic deceit at the highest levels of the industrial-political machine, mixed with direct examination of the lives of the &quot;ordinary&quot; people affected by the decisions of the aristocratic few. Much like a roller-coaster ride, it pulls you up the first steep incline with images of the 2000 presidential election followed by the major players in the bush administration getting ready for their performances, and then comes the first plunge: a stomach-wrenching drop into the black screen, with only the sounds of that awful day in September when &quot;everything changed&quot;. Fade back in on the people of New York, confused, hurting, seeking their loved ones in the rubble. \n\n From here on, there is no stopping for breath. We observe the flight of Saudi aristocrats who, but for their political connections, might have been held as material witnesses. Moore depicts vividly the links between the Bush family and their Saudi friends, one of whom (Prince Bandar) &quot;earns&quot; the Bush surname. On it goes, fact after fact after irrefutable and disgusting fact. Many of us entered the theatre thinking we knew the score, but seldom has an overview of each tree led to such a complete vision of the forest. \n\nAlong the way, we&apos;ll see behavior from members of the bush administration that cannot be described as flattering -- but once again, this isn&apos;t up for debate. It&apos;s the facts, it&apos;s what they themselves said. You can argue context, but the footage speaks for itself. And more than anything else, this is where Michael Moore proves he&apos;s grown as a director. No longer are his films chock-full of his narrative, he lets the evildoers hoist themselves on their own petards without as much overdubbed commentary. His statement rests in the overall structure of the film, rather than his usual assortment of shame-defying pecadillos and exposes. \n\nWhich is not to say that fans of his spirited antics won&apos;t have something to watch, as he drives around the capital building in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot act to the representatives who never bothered to read the legislation they passed, or chases after congressmen trying to get them interested in enlisting their children for a tour of duty in Iraq. \n\nAaah, Iraq. The second half of the film deals with the buildup to and execution of our current adventure in nation building. Iraq is shown with a brief clip from before and a whole lot of after -- with its people confused, hurting, seeking their loved ones in the rubble. Our soldiers are also given plenty of time on-screen, time to describe what it&apos;s like, time to proclaim the thrills, dangers, and ennui of life as an occupying army. Far from being unsupportive as claimed by its detractors, this film makes every effort to give the front-liners their say. Wounded soldiers are treated with no less compassion than the other victims in this film. And unlike the corporate newsmedia, Moore&apos;s cameras dare to follow the injured to the Walter Reed medical center and into their underfunded rehabilitation. \n\nAnd it follows the heart of a patriotic woman from Moore&apos;s hometown of Flint whose soldier son makes the ultimate sacrifice for Bush&apos;s folly.\n\nThis is, above all, a sympathetic, patriotic and humanistic movie. Even its main star, George W. Bush, is given a measure of understanding. We understand that he is out of his league, unable to push for the appropriate diplomatic solutions with Saudi Arabia, forever beholden to the corporate interests that purchased his throne, barely capable of coherent thought, and not at all comfortable with the responsibilities of the presidency. He would far rather be golfing, or &quot;lookin&apos; for bugs&quot;, or hanging at fundraisers with &quot;the haves and the have-mores&quot;; the presidency is a burden he clearly cannot bear. He almost begs to be removed from office.\n\nThis movie has a lot more to say than any reviewer&apos;s encapsulation can convey. Ignore the naysayers who, in all likelihood, haven&apos;t even seen the film. Understand that the facts are the facts, the presentation is Mr. Moore&apos;s, and your opinion is your own. \n\nMy opinion: 10/10 -- If there&apos;s a documentary/editorial piece that could touch this one, I haven&apos;t seen it yet.",

It&apos;s interesting to note that the director,Geza Radvanyi, made one masterpiece &quot;Valahol Europa&apos;ban&quot;(somewhere in Europa) and after soon degenerated into what the German critics call &quot;films limonades&quot; (mushy movies).\n\n&quot;Uncle Tom &apos;s Cabin&quot; is more an European movie than a German one:Italian actors(Eleonora Rossi-Drago) meet German (Herbert Lom)  or French ones (Juliette Greco,Mylène Demongeot)ones. Mrs Beecher -Stowe would be turning in her grave if she saw some of the scenarists&apos; &quot;adaptations&quot;:On the boat,there&apos;s a steamy (for the time) scene between Legree and Cassy.Exit chaste old cousin Ophelia,and make way for a vivacious gorgeous young Harriet.Besides,the deadly serious M.Saint-Clare goes to see a hostess in a bar .(Juliette Greco).The end of the movie becomes epic,as the slaves rise up against their &quot;owners&quot;.\n\nOn the plus side:beautiful Negro spîrituals during the Mississipi shots and a nice Evangeline Saint-Clare played by Gertraud Mittermayer.However,it&apos;s doubtful that this movie should be reissued some day."

It is a delight to see the two Roberts together even though Julia has a very small role. IF you like good old fashioned tales about good and evil, good guys and bad guys, crooks and decent people, you will love this movie. Dennis hopper does what he does best, play a mean and nasty person - in this case, the railroad baron. Eric Roberts takes on the role of hero and fills that role very well. He is forced into his heroic stance by circumstance not by choice, making it all the more entertaining. This movie has it all, a villain, crooked politicians, good politicians, betrayal, a love story, little guys against giants, people fighting for their land and homes,  what more could you want. Fix yourself some popcorn, turn out the lights, sit back and allow yourself to be entertained in classic fashion. This movie does what all movies should do  no political agenda, no great moral  it is just good, old fashioned entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Amidst a Chinese and Japanese mafia war, a lawyer for the Chinese mob finds a rift forming between him and his corrupt police officer brother. Welcome to the &quot;black society&quot;, the underworld that exists just beyond the periphery of our vision.\n\nIn this world, many of the characters have a grey, ambiguous morality, and (in the words of Tom Mes) &quot;nobody does what you expect them to do.&quot; In this sense, the film is not terribly far removed from the classic noir with its gritty scenarios and anti-heroes. Of course, here it goes in directions never before considered.\n\nThe ethnic / nationality aspect is fascinating, even if not fully comprehensible to an American audience. We can understand the ancient divide between China and Japan, and appreciate how this battle is now playing out between the Triads and yakuza. But the use of a character half-Japanese, half-Chinese is brilliant. Americans who do not understand the languages or customs may miss the point, but for their culture it is no different than how we once thought of the &quot;mulatto&quot; -- rejected by both black and white cultures.\n\nSight &amp; Sound noted the film was similar to the gangster films of Kinji Fukasaku, while noting that it still contained &quot;scenes such as the one where sodomy is used as a police interrogation technique bear Miike&apos;s unmistakable signature.&quot; (Interestingly, neither Miike nor Fukasaku are primarily known for their gangster films -- Fukasaku is connected best to &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.) \n\nThe film is one of the earliest examples of Miike&apos;s use of extreme violence. We have decapitated heads, eyes ripped from their sockets, and the aforementioned sodomy. The film also has some unsettling sexual aspects. Not quite on par with Miike&apos;s &quot;Visitor Q&quot;, but what is? \n\nAlso worth noting is the soundtrack, which often sound like more 1980s synth than 1990s techno. Was this a style choice, or was Japan in a different musical era than the United States in 1995? Interestingly, this film is composer Atorie Shira&apos;s only credit. Another &quot;anachronism&quot; is a trunk shot very reminiscent of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992). Coincidence? It&apos;s no secret that Tarantino borrows from his favorite films, but was Miike borrowing from Tarantino?\n\nArrow Video has released the film as part of their Black Society Blu-ray box set, complete with an all-new audio commentary from Miike expert Tom Mes, the author of &quot;Agitator&quot;. This is actually the second Mes commentary for the film, so anyone who has an old DVD can now hear him twice. (Interestingly, he feels this film has a &quot;gothic element&quot;, which is not something that immediately comes to mind when you are talking about Miike.)",

      "reviewBody": "BATAAN is one of the better war films to come out during the war years of World War II. Robert Taylor holds the whole gritty film together with his realistic depiction of a sergeant leading a small troop of men in an effort to hold back the Japanese attack by blowing up a crucial bridge. Taylor, Robert Walker as a gum-chewing homesick sailor, Lloyd Nolan, Dezi Arnaz (surprisingly effective in a dramatic role) and others make splendid contributions. Special mention should be made of Philip Terry&apos;s medic--an under-appreciated actor who is shown as committed to his job in a selfless way but finally going berserk under the pressures of war. (He had other good roles in Olivia de Havilland&apos;s TO EACH HIS OWN and Ray Milland&apos;s THE LOST WEEKEND).\n\nThe jungle setting (although filmed on the studio lot) is impressive with its exotic foliage and adds to the realism. The hand to hand combat scenes are well staged, as are the final moments of the film.\n\n All in all, a gripping war film that more than holds its own with contemporary stories like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. \n\nHas to be appreciated in the context of its time--when flag-waving patriotism was at its peak and lines like &quot;Those dirty Japs&quot; were not considered politically incorrect."

      "reviewBody": "French national treasure Jean Cocteau&apos;s last film is as personal and private as it&apos;s title suggest. Le Testament d&apos;Orphee is a fond farewell to cinema with it&apos;s free-flowing, spirited collection of images and scenes that includes characters from Cocteau&apos;s past films and personal friends. One would hardly imagine a cinematic poet like Jean Cocteau would be so crass as to make something like a mere sequel to his acclaimed Orpheus/Orphee (1950). And instead what Cocteau does is to give us perhaps cinema&apos;s first meta-film. The film itself is an autobiographical fantasia of his whole life. Playing various versions of himself, Cocteau glides through the film as a time traveler in search of his place in the universe. He called it an active poem.\n\nThe film was shot on location at Les Baux in the South of France, a landscape whose rough limestone canyons appealed to Cocteau even more than Greece. Francine Weinweller and the main crew put up at that gourmet&apos;s mecca, the Hostellerie de la Baumaniere. Francine had a costume part in the film as La Dame qui s&apos;est trompe d&apos;epoque. All the icons out of Cocteau&apos;s past were woven into the visual testament - mirrors, horses, flowers, tapestries, and many of his friends - Dermit, Marais, Yul Brynner, Picasso and his wife, among others, appeared.\n\nUnfortunately for Cocteau, public and critics, weaned on the literature of commitment popularized by Sartre and Camus, turned their backs on Le Testament d&apos;Orphee, finding it a self-serving celluloid relic, oddly out of step with the times. One voice, however, and an important one, praised the film. Young Francois Truffaut, winner of a large prize for his film Les Quatre Cents Coups, had turned the money over to Cocteau to help finance Le Testament. Truffaut liked the finished product, which he considered a remake, thirty years later, of Le Sang d&apos;un Poete. Truffaut was not alone in seeing Cocteau, judged by his previous films, as one of the main precursors of New Wave filmmakers.\n\nLe Testament d&apos;Orphee is a misunderstood masterpiece. Brilliant!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.\n\n*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he&apos;s seeking revenge&quot;. \n\nBut this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it&apos;s a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.\n\nSince I don&apos;t want to go into spoilers, I&apos;ll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist&apos;s work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby&apos;s personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey&apos;s point of view. Didn&apos;t experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.\n\nI genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It&apos;s worth your while.",

It remains a raw, powerful film that is as exciting as it is moving, real and literate. \n\nJohn &quot;Joker&quot; Jackson (Tony Curtis; The Vikings, Some Like It Hot) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier; Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Dinner, In the Heat of the Night) are two convicts on the run. Escaping from a Southern work gang, the two men are bound together by an unbreakable iron chain and separated by an unbridled hatred towards each other. Relentlessly pursued by a bloodthirsty posse, they must put aside their differences if they are going to survive.\n\nHighly acclaimed upon release for its directing, writing, cinematography and acting, (Sidney Poitier won numerous awards for his role, including the coveted Silver Bear for Best Actor) THE DEFIANT ONES remains one of the most influential films of its era, and Eureka Classics is proud to present the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK in a special Dual Format edition.",

It covers everything from his youth to his final days.  The film does an excellent job at discussing Eisenstein&apos;s failure to pursue a successful career in Hollywood.  It even mentions his short stint in Mexico while trying to do some films there.  This documentary is filled with some clips from many of his best work and also talks about Eisenstein&apos;s theories on editing, directing, and the use of montage. Eisenstein: The Master&apos;s House(1998) is a documentary that is a must see for anyone interested in directing a film or learning about the work of Sergei Eisenstein."

      "reviewBody": "This is a sad film about personal weaknesses. The storyline has several weak points too, but on the whole I should think the movie does a great director like William Wyler justice and is still watchable today. There is a certain similarity with the Oscar winning In the Heat of the Night. The screenplay is by the same author, Stirling Silliphant.\n\nThe Liberation of L. B. Jones really belongs to the African American cast, the whites&apos; performances do pale in comparison. Roscoe Lee Browne plays the well-to-do undertaker who is cheated by his wife with a white policeman. He gives his character a quiet dignity that lasts throughout the story, up to the bitter and sad end. Yaphet Kotto&apos;s portrayal of an angry young man who comes to town with a score to settle is equally intense and convincing. Both Browne and Kotto have a few very good scenes in which they act by themselves. They both seize the chance to give their characters real depth. Lola Falana is convincing as the amoral undertaker&apos;s wife and there is a good supporting cast. I fondly remember a small, well acted scene at the beginning with an elderly lady who regularly visits the undertaker&apos;s show room to have a look at the coffin for which she pays instalments.\n\nThe white population is, it seems to me, much more stereotypical. The only really interesting figure here is the town&apos;s most important lawyer, played somewhat stiffly by Lee J. Cobb. He is a racist against his better judgment. His unlawful actions to protect white criminals seem like a reflex, not coming from the brain but rather from the spinal cord."

      "reviewBody": "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** &quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot; (Warner Brothers, 1935), directed by Archie L. Mayo, with choreography by Bobby Connolly, is a flimsy but highly entertaining show-biz musical that became the only film collaboration of the Jolsons, Al and Ruby Keeler. Like most Jolson movies of that period, &quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot; starts off with good comedy and wisecracks, and during its final half hour or so, changes to melodrama. In spite of mood swings, the changes don&apos;t hurt the continuity in any way. Jolson appears to be more at ease with his comical one-liners and is much improved here as an actor during the more serious moments. Keeler gets to sing one song but she gets plenty of opportunity to go into her dancing.\n\nOpening title: &quot;BROADWAY: The street of ups and downs, where show business in 1935 was in top speed.&quot; Story: Al Howard (Al Jolson), is an irresponsible and egotistic entertainer responsible for his Broadway shows closing by not appearing. Al&apos;s sister, Molly (Glenda Farrell) comes to the Actors Equity Association with the assurance that this will be Al&apos;s last time that he will ever desert a show, but she is told by the producers that he is through on Broadway. Molly manages to get her old friend, Dorothy Wayne (Ruby Keeler), a dancer, to team up with Al in hope her partnership with him will lead up to his comeback. Dorothy agrees and she and Al become successful for the next several months appearing at Brown&apos;s St. Ledger Roof Garden. While Al treats Dorothy like a &quot;kid,&quot; and philanders with other women, especially chorus girls, Dorothy, who resents being treated this way, unwittingly falls in love with Al and decides to leave the act. Molly, however, persuades Dorothy to remain and soon arranges to hire Duke Hutchinson (Barton MacLane), an underworld financier, to back Al&apos;s new night club engagement, The Casino De Paree, in New York. In the meantime, Al, who considers himself &quot;God&apos;s gift to women,&quot; becomes entangled with Luana Wells (Helen Morgan), a blues singer who happens to be Duke&apos;s wife wanting to also make a comeback on Broadway by appearing at the Casino De Paree. Before opening night, Al is told by Dorothy, after receiving a phone call, that his sister Molly is in jail for murder. Al must decide whether to take the show&apos;s $30,000 to bail out Molly, or go on with the show as planned. If he abandons this show, the Duke will have his thugs awaiting for him outside.\n\nPatsy Kelly, not mentioned in the above synopsis, provides true comedy relief in appearing in three separate scenes with Jolson actually unrelated to the plot as if she were added in at the last minute to boost up some comedy. In spite all, it helps the continuity along. Kelly is a laugh riot and not to be missed. Glenda Farrell, featured as Jolson&apos;s sister, known best for usually playing a wisecracking and fast-talking gold-digger, gets her chance on film to play a basically straight character. Farrell only has one scene that does involve comedy which takes place on a train where she encounters a British passenger (Arthur Treacher) after accidentally dipping him with ink. She even gets her chance to wear stylish wardrobes and fur coat.\n\nGreat tunes by Harry Warren and Al Dubin include: &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot; (written by Elpidio Ramirez and sung in Spanish by Jolson); &quot;A Good Old-Fashioned Cocktail&quot; (sung/danced by Ruby Keeler and chorus); &quot;Mammy, I&apos;ll Sing About You&quot; (Jolson); &quot;About a Quarter to Nine,&quot; &quot;Swanee River&quot; (by Stephen Foster, sung briefly by Jolson in black-face); &quot;The Little Things You Used to Do&quot; (sung by Helen Morgan); &quot;Casino De Paree,&quot; &quot;She&apos;s a Latin From Manhattan,&quot; &quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot; and a reprise finish to &quot;About a Quarter to Nine&quot; (all sung by Jolson). During a night club sequence earlier in the story, there is an underscoring by a band to the tune, &quot;&apos;Cause My Baby Says It&apos;s So,&quot; but is never sung in the story. Possibly an intended song for this movie but scrapped before release. That song would finally be heard and fully introduced by Dick Powell in &quot;The Singing Marine&quot; (Warners, 1937). \n\nAlso in the cast are Akim Tamiroff, Sharon Lynn, Phil Regan and Gordon Westcott. While Benny Rubin gets screen credit, he has only a tiny bit at The Caliente. I did recognize former silent screen actress, Mary Carr, famous for sentimental mother roles in the twenties, briefly scene as a wardrobe woman.\n\n&quot;Go Into Your Dance,&quot; available on DVD and occasional viewing on Turner Classic Movies, is 89 minutes of solid entertainment, highly recommended as it is entertaining. And as Jolson would say whenever being truthful and sincere, &quot;A word of a Howard.&quot; (***1/2)",

      "reviewBody": "A surprising Finnish film from the end of the 60s, which proposes, in a science fiction environment that could have inspired Woody Allen&apos;s Sleeper, a reflection on the concept of democracy and the utopias it gave rise to, which kept the world divided and suspended at the time of the Cold War, which nevertheless caused episodes of enormous violence, permanently threatening the world with the total destruction of humanity.\n\nThe conclusion seems to be that totalitarian democracy annihilates the individual, and that only the imperfection of the democratic social struggle guarantees individual freedom, even if it generates violence and social confrontation.\n\nHowever, totalitarianism inevitably imposes itself on the annihilation of the individual in the face of the collective interest.\n\nAn interesting reflection that well reflects the ambiguity of political thought at the time, which is still relevant, even in current times, when the Cold War has become history.\n\nWhat is democracy after all? Are these regimes, in which we currently live, truly democratic?\n\nDoesn&apos;t the ghost of totalitarianism remain suspended, waiting for the bankruptcy of social democracies, victors of the cold war?",

The second half uses a mythic tale and experimental style to explore that theme. It&apos;s an attempt to use film and storytelling to portray the feelings and instincts that human beings have but can&apos;t find words for. Exciting, but not for those who want everything wrapped up and defined (the film argues against the very possibility of easy definitions). I also highly recommend his two other feature-length films: &quot;Mysterious Object at Noon&quot; and &quot;Blissfully Yours.&quot; Hopefully &quot;Tropical Malady&quot; will be released widely enough to get the attention it deserves, and hopefully one day &quot;Blissfully Yours&quot; will make its way to DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Unknown Purple&apos; is a VERY odd science-fiction film, with plot elements resembling &apos;The Count of Monte Cristo&apos;, &apos;He Who Gets Slapped&apos;, &apos;The Invisible Man&apos;, Tod Browning&apos;s &apos;Devil Doll&apos; and Jack London&apos;s &apos;The Shadow and the Flash&apos;. I screened a nitrate print of this film, in which all the frames in the invisibility sequences had been (partially or completely) stained purple ... but the stain had long since darkened the film stock, rendering the action on screen invisible for quite the wrong reason. Also, the original English-language intertitles had been cut out, and French translations spliced in. The action keeps jumping backward and forward in time, very confusingly: some scenes take place BEFORE scenes which have preceded them, and other scenes take place DURING previous scenes. I can&apos;t tell if this is actually part of the film&apos;s structure, or if the sequences were put in the wrong order when the French titles were added.\n\nAccording to the opening credits, &apos;The Unknown Purple&apos; is based on a stage play. I&apos;d like to know how the invisibility scenes were handled onstage.\n\nHenry B. Walthall plays Marchmont, an impoverished inventor who has somehow captured ultra-violet rays and converted them into crystals. When he holds one of these crystals in his hand and presses it with his thumb, he (and all his clothes) can turn invisible. Unfortunately, the invisibility effect emits a cone of purple light. So, Marchmont can turn invisible any time he likes, but wherever he goes he&apos;ll attract attention with his purple glow.\n\nMarchmont&apos;s wife and his business partner Dawson betray him. When Burton (yet another inventor) creates a gizmo that is sure to be a commercial success, Dawson and Mrs Marchmont murder him and steal his gizmo, then live off the profits while they frame Marchmont for the theft and murder. Marchmont can&apos;t prove his innocence, so he serves a long prison sentence but is eventually released.\n\nYears later, Dawson and Jewel Marchmont are wealthy. (Alice Lake, as the faithless wife, is very pretty in medium shot ... but, in close-ups -- even with the damaged film stock in this nitrate print -- we can see that her eyes are two different colours.) After Marchmont is released from prison, a mysterious burglar named the Unknown Purple suddenly strikes. Of course, it&apos;s Marchmont in disguise ... or, rather, invisible entirely. No, not quite entirely. Somehow, Marchmont is able to render himself invisible all over except for one hand, so that he can spook his ex-wife with the sight of a disembodied hand moving through a cone of purple light. The bodiless hand snatches the pearl necklace from Jewel&apos;s throat. But what good is invisibility if you keep one hand visible (clutching visible pearls) while you make your getaway?\n\nInto the scene comes a French financier named Cromport. He looks rather different from Marchmont, but they&apos;re both obviously played by the same actor (Walthall). At first, I thought that Cromport was Marchmont in a fake beard, although Walthall (a very mannered actor) does a fine job of giving them two different personalities. When I rumbled that Cromport and Marchmont were two different people, of course it was obvious straight away that Marchmont would eventually impersonate Cromport. Sure enough...\n\nI shan&apos;t rate this film, as the print which I viewed was in such bad condition that I feel it would be unfair of me to form any opinion. But what I saw here was intriguing enough to make me want to view a better print. Still, some parts of this story don&apos;t seem to make any sense."

I felt like I&apos;d been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, or self-indulgent, or neglectful of our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. And if you aren&apos;t doing something each day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.",

      "reviewBody": "Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla is regarded by many as the best Godzilla film in the &apos;Heisei&apos; series,and it&apos;s easy to see why,with it&apos;s non-stop action,revivals of three of the &apos;Showa&apos; series monsters and huge amount of monster footage. No leisurely build up here-we are plunged almost immediately into the action,and it than never lets up apart from a brief slowing down in the middle.\n\nThis was Godzilla&apos;s 40th anniversary film,and so it is rife with scenes from Showa Godzilla films copied,including even certain shots-for instance,Godzilla attacking an oil refinary from the original Godzilla Vs Mothra,or Rodan knocking down Godzilla from Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster,there&apos;s a terrific knowingness to this film. The plot here is very simple but effective in it&apos;s simplicity,and Akira Ifikube&apos;s score is simply wonderful,his best ever for a Godzilla film,full of memorable themes and often amazingly poignant.\n\nThe film is let down a little by it&apos;s monsters-the new baby Godzilla is great and far better than &apos;Minya&apos; from the &apos;Showa&apos; series,but Rodan and Mechagodzilla look inferior to their predecessors. The fights are OK but the climactic one is somewhat static,and the film has a lot less visual imagination than the last three films. It&apos;s difficult to say if this is better than the previous two films,it lacks the wild and crazy story of Godzilla Vs King Ghidorah or the sense of wonder and eye candy of Godzilla vs Mothra,but if you just want monsters on the rampage and battling it out,this one delivers wonderfully,and most Godzilla fans want little more than that."

What a guy, insane sword action, brilliant dubbing combined with outright craziness does&apos;nt even begin to describe him. My hero. He&apos;s a man on a mission and nobody will stop him, no henchman is good enough, no boss tough enough. Then you also have Boris, and Leon. Both Ninjas, caucasian of course, with bright colored outfits and little headbands that actually say &quot;Ninja&quot; on them, fantastic! These two have a sort of vendetta thing going and only one will live to tell! Hordes of henchmen are sent to stop Leon, but he&apos;s just too damn good. But not as good as Eagle. Along with these main characters you have some ancient mystics, monks and a little bit of romance for Eagle. There is not much more I can say to describe this gem of a movie. So I leave you with a taster of possibly the best film I have ever seen. If you see this anywhere, watch it, hire it, buy it. Whatever, just watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "I usually try to avoid &quot;defending&quot; movies that I like. If people get it fine, if they don&apos;t, well them&apos;s the breaks. However I too profess to having been unsold on the charms of LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES for ages. But now after finally having seen a restored widescreen presentation courtesy of Anchor Bay I am convinced that one of the reasons why the effort left me cold the first few times through was due to the miserable, scrappy, fullscreen home video versions available previously which excluded as much as 12 minutes of footage.\n\nI came of age during the home video years and heading out every week to the various rental shops in our area to see what Hammer or Hammer related flicks we could find became a regular past time. Certain movies were relatively easy to locate but we&apos;d always heard about this legendary kung-fu/Dracula hybrid by Hammer that was made significant by Peter Cushing&apos;s final appearance as Professor Van Helsing, the world expert on the Undead. Rumor had it that the movie involved Van Helsing tracing the elusive Count Dracula to colonial era China where he&apos;d set up shop and acquired a taste for the local food. Hijinx awaited in the form of supernatural kung-fu battles with a band of seven specialist martial arts masters, who were of course brothers, fighting off legions of vampiric barbarians. Somehow the combination sounded like trying to mix oil with water and when I finally managed to find the meager VHS release of the film my apprehension was proved well- founded by a muddled mix of Gothic horror chills with difficult to follow chop-socky interludes. The pan-and-scan compression of the widescreen shots was dizzying, the vampire interludes were anything but the dreamy &quot;foggy castle on a hill&quot; variety that Hammer had become specialists in, with lots of insert shots of Peter Cushing standing around looking concerned while Julie Ege&apos;s bosoms heaved, cruelly encased in her cleavage baring tops.\n\nIt turns out however that much of this muddling and cockamamie mish-mashing was due to the confinement of Roy Ward Baker (directing the talking scenes) and Cheh Chang&apos;s (directing the martial arts scenes) marvelous widescreen 2:35:1 Techniscope photography into a claustrophobic, nappy lookin&apos; fullscreen image. Fading of color and reduction print distortions didn&apos;t help much, and my opinion now after seeing the widescreen print is that much of the disdain aimed at the film is in fact aimed at the miserable presentations that have been available until now.\n\nSure, it&apos;s still a bit cobbled together. Hammer&apos;s grip on the marketplace was tenuous at best by 1974, THE EXORCIST and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had happened and they were still banking on Gothic shenanigans to sell movie tickets. One result was the creation of these genre crossing hybrids like LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES mixing martial arts mayhem with Gothic chills, and CAPTAIN KRONOS - VAMPIRE HUNTER which effectively blended the Spaghetti Western, swashbuckling high-adventure and the Gothic nightgowns blowing in the wind. The public didn&apos;t seem to care but the result were two very charming movies that had the gall to be different, even if horror fans had moved on. Hammer was hoping to extend their life by coming up with some new series and their collaboration with Shaw Brothers productions was perhaps both ahead of its times while a year or three too late to save the company. It was a glorious failure that deserves to be seen again now that present day technology can give viewers a better estimation of the movie&apos;s intended form. It is surprisingly entertaining and compulsively watchable.\n\nWhat I would recommend is that anybody who may have heard of LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES should give it a try, and anyone who had dismissed it before as a crummy home video oddity to try it again now that the original full-length widescreen version is readily available. It&apos;s still somewhat confusing if you are looking for a discreet, beginning-middle- end story progression. But when taken as it&apos;s individual moments strung together into a greater whole some of it is actually quite compelling: Slow-motion legions of the Undead riding horseback whilst slaughtering the populace &amp; making off with all the hot chicks (the Blind Dead, anyone?), torture chambers with topless girls strapped down to a bizarre rack designed to drain their blood, the re-insertion of some amusingly clever gore shots, James Bernard&apos;s at times utterly surreal &amp; way under-appreciated musical score recalling some of his Dracula themes while experimenting with more Eastern inspired sounds, traditional non-wire guided kung fu fights with all the bravado and forced sentiment of a classic martial arts film, and rest assured, plenty of insert shots of Peter Cushing standing there looking concerned. \n\nJust by turning his head slightly to the side and raising an eyebrow Peter Cushing is a treat, nobody can look concerned or impart a sense of dire urgency into an audience like Peter Cushing: It may be an odd movie but it does feature some of his best work at appearing concerned and some of the urgencies that he imparts within viewers are the most dire of his career. Yeah, he was getting old and tired and probably looked upon the movie as an expense paid trip to China to help him forget the sorrow of his wife&apos;s passing. But by golly he made the movie and if he means anything to you it simply must be seen because it is his last screen turn as one of his classic Gothic horror characters. Try it again, make sure it&apos;s a widescreen version, pop plenty of popcorn, perhaps an adult beverage or two, and put down the lights. Turns out it&apos;s not a bad movie after all.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "ISADORA is one of those exquisitely produced big studio films of the late 60s that had a major release for 3 months and then vanished off the face of the earth forever. Some other titles this seemed to have happen to are; YOUNG WINSTON, NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA, MONTECARLO OR BUST (the other &quot;Great Race&quot; movie), STAR!, MAROONED, FINIANS RAINBOW, ON A CLEAR DAY, DARLING LILI....all presented in 70mm as souvenir ticket presentations in luxury cinemas of the time and then.....rarely revived or screened but also never forgotten, because so many people apparently saw them and remember them from this one major release. ISADORA may have been more financially successful than some mentioned above and it did have a huge impact on the beautiful Art Nouveau decor revival of the 60s (Art Deco ate the 70s..or vice versa). The look for the film was a sensation and the impact on teenage girls and their mothers was undeniable, all having a huge impact on free form ballet classes (nymphs and Grecian urns and veils) so hilariously satirized in THE BOYFRIEND in 1972. Vanessa Redgrave is synonymous with this role and one yearns for a cinema presentation of this extraordinary 20s icon now in 2005. I don&apos;t remember the film being overly criticized in 1968, it was a hit and respected for its tragic story and superb art direction. Several docos appeared on TV (one even being directed by Ken Russell) and there was quite a celebration of all things ISADORA and Vanessa in that year. But none since."

With so many talented actors, it&apos;s utterly astonishing that anyone could create such an unpleasant film. But these people pulled it off. Amazing.\n\nThe only fortunate person to take part in this movie was Jennifer Lawrence, who didn&apos;t stick around for long.

Kajol&apos;s character was a lot of fun too. It&apos;s nice to see a girl with spunk get her man! Nearly all of the songs and choreography were stellar. I will most definitely buy this one.\n\nLike some of the other reviewers mentioned, there is definitely some over-acting but those few moments of suffering are rewarded with a variety of eye-candy. This film is definitely worth watching.",

While Rahul has been adopted, Yashvardhan and Nandini treat him as their own. When their sons mature, they start to look for suitable brides for Rahul, and decide to get him married to a young woman named Naina. When Rahul is told about this, he tells them that he loves another woman by the name of Anjali Sharma. Yashvardhan decides to meet with the Sharma family, and finds out that they are middle-classed, unsophisticated, and will not be able to it into his family circle, as a result he refuses to permit Rahul to marry Anjali. A defiant Rahul decides to leave, gets married to Anjali, without his foster parents blessings, and re-locates to London, England, where Anjali&apos;s unmarried sister, Pooja, also lives. Rohan, who was studying in a hostel, returns home to find that Rahul is no longer living with them, and he also discovers that while outwardly his dad is not interested in seeing Rahul get back, Nandini wants the family back all together for all happy and sad moments. Rohan also misses Rahul a lot, and decides to travel to London in order to try and get Rahul to return home. Yashvardhan, is unable to prevent this, and as a result Rohan does travel to London, meets with Rahul, Anjali, and Pooja. The question remains will the hurt and sorrow that Rahul experienced with his foster parents be erased and enable the family to be reunited, or will Rahul forget about the past, and continue to live his life without getting back to his roots and the family who brought him up, leaving Rohan to return alone?",

      "name": "&quot;Can you write startling tales about these wax figures?&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s only when you begin to delve deeper into works of German Expressionism that you can appreciate how important and influential a film was &apos;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920).&apos; It demonstrated to filmmakers and audiences that cinema is an inherently artificial medium, and so, rather than striving for realism, films should emphasise the fake and fantastic elements of their story. Though Frenchman Georges Méliès had first struck on this idea at the turn of the twentieth century, it was Robert Wiene&apos;s creative horror film that established German Expressionism as the defining artistic style of the 1920s, securing post-War Germany as cinema&apos;s most prominent innovator and paving the way for directors F.W. Murnau, Fritz Lang and Paul Leni {each of whom were later coaxed to Hollywood to share their expertise}. The hand of &apos;Caligari&apos; is evident throughout &apos;Das Wachsfigurenkabinett / Waxworks (1924),&apos; a fantasy/horror that is framed around a young writer&apos;s attempt to concoct thrilling tales to accompany three carnival waxwork characters - Harun al Raschid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper.\n\nThree names come to mind more readily than most when one considers silent German actors: Conrad Veidt {&apos;The Man Who Laughs (1928)&apos;}, Werner Krauss {&apos;Herr Tartüff (1925)&apos;} and, of course, Emil Jannings {&apos;Faust (1926)&apos;}. It&apos;s no surprise that both Veidt and Krauss had achieved their stardom with &apos;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&apos; four years earlier, and the parallels between that film and &apos;Waxworks&apos; stretch much further than the mere casting decisions. The film, co-directed by Paul Leni and Leo Birinsky, employs grossly-exaggerated art direction {the sets designed by Leni himself} and Helmar Lerski&apos;s imaginatively-warped cinematography to highlight the fantasy in each story, even though there are very few elements that would ordinarily be considered fantastic. Emil Jannings plays the rotund Harun al Raschid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph, with a loathsome repugnance that gradually gives way to a certain likability. When his intentions towards the beautiful Maimune (Olga Belajeff) are shown to be friendly rather than sexual, he becomes an affable and cartoonish oaf.\n\nThis segment is followed by the story of Ivan the Terrible (Conrad Veidt), who is driven to madness by the trickle of sand through an hour-glass, every falling grain bringing him closer to demise. Veidt plays the cruel Grand Prince of Moscow with a wide-eyed craziness that calls to mind the intense acting style of fellow-German Klaus Kinski. One of the earliest portrayals of Ivan the Terrible, this segment no doubt influenced Sergei Eisenstein when he directed &apos;Ivan the Terrible: Part I and II (1944).&apos; The final story, definitely the scariest of the three, concerns Jack the Ripper  also referred to as the mythical Spring-Heeled Jack for some reason, perhaps due to a translation error. Though it barely runs for five minutes, I found my heart genuinely thumping as Jack (Werner Krauss) stalked through the dream-like haze of Luna Park, as the young writer (William Dieterle) and his girl (Olga Belajeff) flee from his multiple eerie shadows, every step leading them ever-so-closer to the cold glint of his knife.\n\nThe framing device around which &apos;Waxworks&apos; revolves unavoidably leads to a distracting unevenness of tone, the atmosphere fluctuating between light-hearted comedy and gruelling horror. Also rather frustrating is the fact that Jannings&apos; segment, while certainly entertaining at a satisfactory level, is afforded so much screen-time, and yet Krauss&apos; Jack the Ripper killing-spree is wrapped up in a matter of minutes. Since a fourth character tale, about Rinaldo Rinaldini, was scrapped due to budget constraints, I suspect that funding also played a role in reducing the third act. However much of an oddity it might be, &apos;Waxworks&apos; is nevertheless a visual marvel, and no shortage of imagination has been expended on the strange and exciting set and costume designs. The film certainly impressed studios in Hollywood, for director Paul Leni was subsequently lured to the United States to continue his career, after which he notably directed &apos;The Cat and the Canary (1927)&apos; and &apos;The Man Who Laughs (1928),&apos; before his premature death in 1929.",

      "reviewBody": "A large group of international terrorists led by Soviet agent Rostove invade America unexpectedly and go on to turn country against each other. However after turning down the job, ex-government agent Matt Hunter takes up the assignment, when they kill his friend in an attack that was aimed at him. Rostove and Hunter share a past, and now Hunter wants to seem him dead and Rostove fearful obsession of Hunter could disrupt their plans of turning America against each other.\n\nWho you kidding? No one can take down Chuck. Not even an army of international mercenaries! Gee this is gold medal stuff from Norris (whose name appears in bold gold letters to head the credits) and he even co-wrote the insane screenplay. Touchdown! Get ready for something so stupendously outrageous and wonderfully dumb that you&apos;ll get an all out assault on your senses and plenty &quot;bang&quot; for your buck. While your funny bone will get a real tickle out of it! Director Joseph Zito and actor (or better put karate champ) Chuck Norris tackle this preposterous, but always riveting anarchy macho action camp that the 80s loved to heave up. Plenty of gunfire assured and Norris showing off with those eye-opening moves (no not that bare chest sticking out of his always half/or unbuttoned shirt), but the main weapon of choice seemed to be anything that caused numerous explosions. Meaning a high and random casualty rate! Zito&apos;s bravura style never lets up, as the crunching stunt-work holds up strongly and the perverse violence towards innocence amazes. Joao Fernandes&apos; professionally shoots the film with the right scope to capture the mayhem and Jay Chattaway&apos;s roaring score fits ruggedly into the mix.\n\nA denim wearing Norris is looking comfortably stiff and expressionless throughout as former CIA agent Matt Hunter. The excellent Richard Lynch goes monstrously hammy as the mastermind villain Soviet agent Rostov and Alexander Zale sticks to a rather icy and relaxed mode as his right-hand. Showing up in smaller parts is a bored looking Eddie Jones, the feisty and useless irritation that was Melissa Prophet and Billy Drago as a greasy drug dealer. Now that armadillo was a star. I thought Norris was going to have a buddy to work off, but it seem to get the boot.\n\nThe hysterical premise is corn, laughable and downright punishing in its look at the heart of America and Reagan-era that turns the country upside down. It done with serious faces, which only makes it more stupid and plot holes are that large due to probably all of those explosions. Norris character must&apos;ve been so gifted in that he was the everywhere man with his pick-up truck. How does he do it? How does he know? Because he was at the right place at the right time to prevent what he could well 99% of the time. However nothing beats how he manages to disappear then reappear to stump those villains. They didn&apos;t know what hit them! The juvenile script on the other-hand did, but these carefree one-liners were ridiculously fun and Norris always had a way with words. The less the better.\n\nLoud and senseless gung-ho gusto. With security like Norris, America should never fear an invasion on their doorstep.",

According to her autobiography though that very spryness became a type of prison limiting her casting and when musicals declined in popularity made it impossible for her to transition to other types of pictures. \n\nSomeone who certainly didn&apos;t suffer the same issue is Elizabeth Taylor, very young and very beautiful, this was one of her first roles that flirted with adulthood. \n\nThe doomed Scotty Beckett, a major child star throughout his youth, plays Jane&apos;s gangly boyfriend, the unfortunately named Oogie, struggling with puberty in one of the roles attempting to ease him into adult roles. He couldn&apos;t make the leap and within the year started the long slide into trouble with the law and drug addiction that ended in his suicide two decades later at 38. \n\nIn one of his last roles Wallace Beery is full of warm understanding as Jane&apos;s father in a departure from his usual bluster, he and Selena Royale at well matched as a long married couple. \n\nLastly Carmen Miranda is a delight as always, her clothes and hats are outlandish, take special note of her shoes and wonder how she could possibly walk in them! One quibble, the Technicolor is unusually garish and at times the cast practically glows orange.",

      "reviewBody": "Absolutely love the first &apos;March of the Penguins&apos;. It is visually stunning, informative, cute, fun to watch, emotionally investable and with adorable without being too much so penguins. It does help if already a major fan of nature documentaries and if one has a lifelong adoration for penguins, both the case with me (&apos;Pingu&apos; plays a major role in my love for penguins). Hearing that there was a follow up, part of me was intrigued but part of me also thought &quot;is this really necessary?&quot;\n\n&apos;March of the Penguins 2&apos;, or &apos;L&apos;Empereur&apos; was a worthwhile watch and is recommended. Am not raving about it but liked it just about enough. It doesn&apos;t disgrace &apos;March of the Penguins&apos; at all and has a lot of its great things, though it doesn&apos;t have the same amount of charm and magic and in a way it wasn&apos;t really needed. Morgan Freeman returning was a very good move and the right one, genius really and it would not have worked as well with somebody else.\n\nShall start with what &apos;March of the Penguins 2&apos; does well, which is a lot. It looks beautiful first and foremost. Especially the majestic scenery, that has sheer beauty and at times a suitably harsh atmosphere to show that such a beautiful environment is not all idyllic. The music has some playfulness, some lushness and some dramatic sweep, not feeling too intrusive which sometimes was the case with DisneyNature documentaries.\n\nFurthermore, &apos;March of the Penguins 2&apos; entertains and educates. Doing a great job with making the viewer relate to the penguins, the offspring being particularly adorable. While there are playful moments, a good deal of the journey/story is poignant. Freeman is a perfect choice for narrator, and he brings booming gravitas and subtlety to the nice mix of facts and human-like story.\n\nWill agree though that some of the material did feel a bit too derivative from looking as if it was lifted from elsewhere or too similar to footage in the first and at times repetitive from lacking sometimes variety.\n\nThere are times too when the cuteness early on is a little overkill. Other documentaries have information that is more illuminating and that is fresher, which added to the derivative feel.\n\nOverall, not great but very worthwhile. 7/10.",

And the film does this while being a complete joy to watch. This is certainly one of the great sex comedies and certain to be a good introduction to Bergman for those concerned about some of his tougher films. Besides, any Bergman fan should be proud of this film, because word has it that he had reached a crossroads, during a heavy bout with depression, before writing this film. He was either to commit suicide or write a comedy. The rest of his catalog and his canonized presence in film history shows what that decision brought us."

      "reviewBody": "Bluff Master (1963) : Brief Review -\n\nThe iconic Dahi Handi song and Shammi Kapoor stand out in Manmohan Desai&apos;s bluffy masala flick. Desai, who became a successful director later, had some expected struggles in the early days. After the melodramatic Janam Janam Ke Phere (1957) and the socially and religiously challenging Chhalia (1960), he finally moved towards a masala genre, which later became his identity. Bluff Master is an interesting concept for sure if we have to consider the early 60s Bollywood films-the con stuff. But the poverty factor-I mean, the hero being poor and in debt (and his mother)-was definitely corny stuff. Old Hollywood was doing the same after the mid-30s and throughout the 1940s, but with less drama and more crime, con, and noir elements. Bluff Master bluffs too much in the beginning, only to make things more interesting, but struggles in the conclusion part. The happy ending was expected, but not like this. Suddenly, all those neighbors who had cancelled Ashok appeared from nowhere, and it looked so chaotic and illogical. The heroine being too loyal to the hero despite knowing his truth and keeping his mother to her were definitely not reliable characteristics for a rich and sensible woman. Like I said, the film gets too bluffy and preachy in the end, giving off a sense of immature vision. Desai wasn&apos;t a pro-level director then, and his previous two films also fell in the same category. The problem with Bluff Master is that it was easier compared to Chhalia and JJKP, and still it couldn&apos;t get above them. The iconic Dahi Handi song, &quot;Govinda Ala Re,&quot; is ageless and evergreen. It&apos;s been 61 years already, and I hear it every year at dahi handi functions. I&apos;ll hear it next month, too, on Dahi Handi 2024. Shammi Kapoor was cute and charming even with those bluffs and conning, and Saira Banu looked gorgeous. Lalita Pawar and Pran both get tailor-made roles, and Desai&apos;s direction neither bores you nor excites you much. Overall, a one-time flick.\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

I had expected the same creepy feeling in this movie - and especially as the main characters in this one are more mature. Unfortunately the script is not as strong in this movie. The actors are struggling with sentences that would never be said in real life, which is a shame. Dejan Cukic has done much better before, he has proved that with the right script and instruction, he can actually act. This movie is an embarrassment to his skills. The same thin cannot be said about Anne Birgitte Lind, who basically stinks in everything she has been in - including this movie! When does she realize that acting is more than reading lines from the script? The story makes no sense, and the characters actions are downright ridiculous. The movie fails on all accounts in my book! By the way, Zlatko Buric is a walking joke. He should have stopped his career after the first Pusher-film!",

It was a great (though obviously not a commercial) success here in Britain, thanks to the Beeb. Sadly the German public state broadcaster, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), which funded Die Zweite Heimat, chose to relegate it to a very late night slot when it was premiered, so in its own country it is less well known.\n\nMeanwhile, though, if you can read German, try and get a copy of the screenplay. A massive hardback, to read the scripts and directions is just as engrossing as watching the films themselves - and there&apos;s some lovely colour and black-and-white stills too.\n\nAnd if you haven&apos;t seen Heimat, the prequel, do so too!"

      "reviewBody": "Jorge (Quim Gutiérrez) is stuck in a dead-end job and with an unrequited long-term love for the girl next door. His father has suffered a stroke and needs constant supervision, which Jorge alone manages. His brother is in prison. His best friend is contemplating his sexuality. In short, he is the epitome of a &quot;nice guy&quot;  the kind who is too nice to lie, cheat or think in even remotely self-serving paths. In Arévalo&apos;s directorial debut, we are offered a slice of his protagonist&apos;s life  to no discernible end, but still a worthwhile watch.\n\nThe latter can best be attributed to the film&apos;s preference of continuity to climaxes. It offers next to no culminations, &apos;key&apos; scenes or satisfying plot development and instead presents a highly low-key story that takes a gentle yet unflinching look at a young man&apos;s life. Quim Gutiérrez is handsome, affable and intrinsically good as Jorge, giving a sweet little performance that is just a smidge to humourless to wow the audience or even go the extra mile. None of the other actors are particularly noteworthy, although Raúl Arévalo caters to the comedy part which undoubtedly elevates the whole film above generic drama formula. Make no mistake however  it is no comedy.\n\nAzuloscurocasinegro is also one of the calmest films I have ever seen. seen. It is neither boring nor slow, but the pacing is peaceful and there is an underlying tranquility in the seamless intercutting of scenes, without resorting to dreamy cinematography or soothing nature shots. I suppose that is another way of saying not much happens in it, which is certainly quite true, but there is some emotional poignancy to be found, some sex scenes to be &apos;enjoyed&apos; and above all remarkably insightful dialogue to be shared. It delivers little gems by the bucketload, puffed full of actual wisdom  best of all, it never feels forced. In the end, Azuloscurocasinegro is quite forgettable, but a sweet viewing nonetheless.\n\n7 out of 10",

However, I&apos;m not clear as to why many reviewers have singled out Sam Gray&apos;s narration for particular derision. True, there are a couple of instances where his pronunciation is not perfect, such as Berchtesgaden, and referring to &quot;the Grecian capital&quot; seems strange, but then he&apos;s American and perhaps it&apos;s like others referring to Beijing as Peking; to each his own. One can also hear gasps of air and creaking of chairs, particularly when Hitler&apos;s Berghof chalet is described which seems a bit careless of the producer, and the sounds of birds chirping during Hitler&apos;s three hour tour of Paris are incongruous to say the least. However, Gray&apos;s narratives competent and judicious which is not surprising as he has played judges and doctors for so long on television: Judge Greenspan in The Sopranos, Judges Chabot and Leon in Law and Order, Dr. Hough in Equal Justice, Judge Weiss in the film Suspect, Dr. Henry Spivak in C.A.T. Squad, Judge Kaufman in Concealed Enemies, Judge Mineon in Rage of Angels, Dr. John Wolff in Hanky Panky and Dr. Bernstein in A Little Sex. Remark has also been made as to this monotone delivery but, again, I don&apos;t know how else he should speak- in the same excitable manner as that of the German propaganda films? www.tracesofevil.blogspot.com",

      "name": "An exciting and ingenious French film noir by Costa-Gavras",
      "reviewBody": "This film, the original French title of which is COMPARTIMENT TUEURS, is known in English as THE SLEEPING CAR MURDER. I don&apos;t believe it has ever been available with English subtitles on DVD or video. I obtained a poor DVD copy of an off the air tape, which was dubbed into English. Despite the poor quality of my copy, it was well worth viewing. The film is directed and scripted by the famous Costa-Gavras, but is one of his least known films, because of the lack of distribution. It goes at a cracking pace and has a splendid cast. Probably the best job of acting is done by Michel Piccoli as a hopeless, creepy lech who is on the edge of madness and can&apos;t make it with women despite his uncontrollable lusts and interior rants of frustration, which we hear as voice-overs. Tthe film is filled with other well known actors. Yves Montand plays a world-weary Paris police inspector, Simone Signoret plays an aging woman who has fallen hopelessly in love with a mysterious young man played by Jean-Louis Trintignant. The scene where Montand interviews Signoret (the two in real life were a well known couple, as most people are aware) is amusing, because they struggle to control their giggles. Catherine Allégret plays a young girl just travelling to Paris for the first time in a sleeping car with five other people, two of whom are Signoret and Piccoli. They are on an overnight train journey from Marseilles (although the story starts at Avignon) to Paris. Upon arrival, a glamorous woman in the compartment is discovered to have been strangled to death. The police set about trying to find the killer and start by attempting to round up all the people who had spent the night in the sleeping car. But then, one by one, before the police can get to them, the people in the sleeping car are brutally killed by the same person, presumably to get rid of witnesses to the strangling of the woman in the sleeping car. However, the story has a lot more surprises than that. The film is based upon a novel by the very clever writer Sébastian Japrisot, who is famous for A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT (2004) starring the Elf, Audrey Tautou, and THE CHILDREN OF THE MARSHLAND (1999, see my forthcoming review). This was the first feature film directed by Costa-Gavras, who was later to shake the world with his powerful political dramas such as Z, STATE OF SIEGE, MISSING, and MUSIC BOX. He is still with us, aged 81, and directed the film CAPITAL starring Gabriel Byrne and Philippe Duclos (one of my favourite actors) as recently as 2012, when he was 79. One curiosity of the casting is that Claude Berri appears as a porter in the film, though uncredited. It was in this same year that he produced his first short film, LE POULET. He had already been acting for twelve years. This film has many twists and turns and an extraordinarily ingenious plot. I will not spoil things by even hinting at an explanation of it. Costa-Gavras directs with verve and intensity, and he achieves a spectacular success with the complicated filming of a sequence where a speeding car is being chased by a gang of motorcycles. It is no easy thing to keep track of half a dozen speeding vehicles of different sizes streaking across the streets of Paris at night, and make it look convincing. The cinematography by Jean Tournier is a tour de force, and the editing by Christian Gaudin enables the director to achieve his sense of an insoluble mystery hurtling over a cliff into the unknown at ever-increasing speed, with Yves Montand, who is heavy-lidded and has a cold, streaking after it, determined to find out whodunit if it is the last thing he does (I mean, the last thing he does before going to sleep, as he so laid back that one often does not know whether he is thinking or napping). The spider&apos;s web of complexity of this film&apos;s plot and the explosive speed at which it travels creates what was to be the trademark Costa-Gavras sense of danger and excitement from this, his very first film. If you can find it and manage to see it, you certainly won&apos;t regret it. What a way to start his career as a director!",

The story uses the archetypal Headless Horseman theme and does a silly bit with poor Washington Irving&apos;s grave, but Stacey Keach is priceless as the curmudgeonly Klaus Van Ripper. The name alone is a hoot. What makes this film better ,for me anyway, is that my family and I visit Sleepy Hollow every Halloween for their Legend Weekend festivities. The original Keach character still gives tours of the Old Dutch Church where the bridge used to be and we got some great photographs of him amongst the graves of the Van Alan family. Anyhow, The Hollow, despite some gratuitous gore is not a bad escape for a rainy night and a bowl of popcorn. In addition, the hayride in the film is actually modeled after the Haunted Hayride in Sleepy Hollow that the local High School has been hosting for years.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Now what I say about children is this: Have &apos;em, Love &apos;em. And then leave &apos;em be.&quot;\n\nThe pre-Code era is full of villains and gangsters, but none are more evil than this woman so wonderfully played by Laura Hope Crews, though she is a monster of a very different sort - a smothering, manipulative mother who deliberately sabotages the romantic relationships of her two sons.\n\nWe see that we&apos;re not just dealing with a mother struggling to accept a new phase in life when she talks to her younger son (Eric Linden) with his head in her lap. She tells him that he and his fiancée (Frances Dee) don&apos;t love each other and that he should leave her, a suggestion the milquetoast young man passively accepts , and then she says &quot;I won&apos;t have to be lonely now&quot; before leaning down to kiss him fully on the lips. It&apos;s an extraordinary moment, even considering the custom of the period, when it wasn&apos;t uncommon for a parent to kiss their child on the mouth (and note earlier we see the two prospective sisters-in-law doing it in a way that would raise eyebrows today, but which was clearly innocent then). Later she lays a smooch on the older son (Joel McCrea) as he&apos;s about to go to bed, and it&apos;s telling that the peck he gives his wife (Irene Dunne) afterwards is shorter in duration. There&apos;s a real mental illness here, one that has the sons under her sway, and ultimately we find that she&apos;s displaced the romance missing from her marriage onto her sons.\n\nThe women in this film truly shine, starting with Laura Hope Crews of course, but also Irene Dunne and Frances Dee, each of whom have some fantastic moments confronting her. In addition to the main theme of a possessive parent, the film also points out that women can be brilliant and have a career in addition to being a wife and mother (and a research biologist no less). Meanwhile, as the mother clings to her sons, she pathetically voices the fear of the older generation, that women having careers is putting motherhood &quot;in some danger of vanishing from the face of the earth.&quot;\n\nThe film is a little infuriating because of how weak the two sons are, but this is a script which has no wasted scenes, great dialogue, and great pace - and with the psychological manipulation taking place on top of it, it all feels very modern. It&apos;s an example of a film I love finding out about from the pre-Code era, as it seems to be lesser known and feels so alive, despite its age.",

With its opening scene of loud rough sex inside and a bunch of bikers kicking the crap out of two guys outside I settled in for what I thought would be a mindless horror film that was entertaining but without much depths. I was wrong.\n\nI can&apos;t get too much into the plot as the movie packs a surprising punch near the end but the ride to the twist was definitely a fun one. I can say that even though the movie started off as your typical horror film with its drunken party, slutty girls and drama when the party ends, that&apos;s when the fun begins.\n\nThe film starts to get very strange when a gang of 50&apos;s era punks show up looking for one of the girls at the party. I loved that they added this and found it refreshing as its nothing I have ever seen before. The gang ends up having an odd sense of humour and uses it to amuse themselves with their hostages in a series of bizarre games and such.\n\nOverall great flick, delivers on the gore, acting, storyline all topped off with quite an amazing twist. This movie would be great for most non-mainstream horror movie lovers.\n\nZombiesteak.com - Discover a new world of horror films, designed just for you."

      "reviewBody": "Peter Graves and Andrea King are working toward making communications with some life form on the planet Mars. Communications are made and then frequent messages are shot back down to Earth relating the Martian way of life, its lack of need for resources such as coal and oil, its ability to produce enough food from one field to feed a city, etc... All this news puts the world in a panic and the Western world&apos;s economy comes crashing down. Workers all of a sudden have nothing to do because of this little piece of communication. Now, the time has come for the East and the Red Menace to take over. What a bunch of malarkey! Red Planet Mars is a definite diversion from typical Sci-fi fare of the 1950s. We never see Mars(except some map of how its surface changes all the time). We don&apos;t get a glimpse at any aliens. We don&apos;t get any special effects except an astronomy lab and a cheaply-made communication center. What we do get is a story about science fiction actually masking a political agenda: to show how there is a great deal of tension between the West(United States) and the East(Soviet Union). The West is of course good; the East is bad. This is a propaganda film all the way, and though some of it is indeed thoughtful and inspires discussion - much of it is way too simplistic and heavy-handed. To really appreciate the film for what it is, it is important to understand the context of the time in which it was made. As a reminder of the Cold War and all the friction that existed in the world at that time, Red Planet Mars is acceptable. As a science fiction film, Red Planet Mars ultimately fails. Look, it isn&apos;t a bad movie really. Sure its doesn&apos;t have the most creative direction by Harry Horner. Graves gives his typical every man attempt at a performance of a world-famous scientist that has caused the catastrophic fall of Western civilization as being nothing more than a father of two boys a bit harried with his new found fame. His wife played by King is ever so more unconvincing as she just gives a bad performance. Watch her as she says some of her lines. it&apos;s like watching a bad impersonation of Olivier! The rest of cast borders one side or the other around mediocrity(Morris Ankrum has a bit part). Easily the most interesting character in the whole movie is the Russian in charge of trying to beat the Americans in conquering the communications battle. He is funny in his sly manner. If you don&apos;t mind the overly-optimistic preaching laced throughout the film and particularly at the end, you might give Red Planet Mars a look. It is definitely not something you have seen before.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening sequences of this late silent documentary about the building of the railroad connecting Turkestan and Siberia was a bit off-putting. Was it going to replicate the hysteria of the titles of SALT FOR SVANETIA, with its setting of a problem -- for Svanetia, not enough salt; for Turkestan, not enough water, and access to outside markets and supplies? But no. It shows its problems, and their solutions in images, as a movie should.\n\nAnd at an increasing editing pace. I don&apos;t believe that Russian Academician film making was a marvelous advance; it codified what Western film makers had been doing for twenty years, and offered them in university language that gave the skills of the craftsmen an intellectual patina of respectability. Its major innovation was to quicken the pace of editing, a process that had been going on since George Smith and Williamson in Britain had realized that you could stick two shots together to offer a story. If it seems the message was lost for half a decade with the coming of sound, it was because recording techniques had to catch up before editing could be integrated as fully, and it wasn&apos;t until the 1960s that editing paces equaled those seen here. The techniques weren&apos;t lost, they were set aside for a few years, and then reintegrated into film making. Looking at 1930s B movies, you see long, dreary takes through 1937 from Poverty Row producers. After that, the techniques were settled, and gradually picked up pace. In Japan and China, where silent movies continued through the middle of the 1930s, there was no barrier, no need to recover and re-establish fast cutting. But Hollywood set the pace, and it would be a third of a century before the cutting speed of this movie would become the gold standard once again.",

And a very gory dream is is too, so far so good. Unfortunately that promise doesn&apos;t last very long. It&apos;s all a bit messy but the plot sees him and his friends take a night time trip to the infamous island prison of Alcatraz, which is where some demonic being is causing him to have these horrific nightmares. I kind of gave up trying to follow it word for word, I found is confusing and silly, but needless to say there is some Elm Street influence going on here. I originally saw this on the heavily cut British VHS release titled &quot;Hell Island&quot; but thankfully the UK DVD appears to be uncut. The best thing going for this movie I would say is the demonic make-up and gore, of which there is plenty. In fact it reminded me of Italian horror movies such as &quot;The Beyond&quot; and &quot;Demons&quot;. There is also some sex and topless female nudity in the shape of Playmate Hope Marie Carlton. On an interesting note 80&apos;s pop star Toni Basil plays a rock chick ghost and cult band Devo provided the soundtrack, though it doesn&apos;t really rock. Unfortunately the acting on the whole isn&apos;t very good and this isn&apos;t helped by an often muffled sound. The picture quality isn&apos;t very good either, too dark in places. Gore fans will get their monies worth but otherwise I found it disappointing.",

      "reviewBody": "Something you should know about this movie before you see it is that it does NOT attempt to be historically accurate. In fact, many scenes were purposely &quot;sabotaged&quot; with anachronisms to remind us that this is not a historical biography; instead it&apos;s meant to be a parable for the modern world.\n\nIf I had known that, I might have enjoyed the movie instead of grinding my popcorn with searing hatred through most of it.\n\nMost noticeably, we&apos;re hit with a very non-18th century soundtrack: Adam Ant, Siouxie &amp; the Banshees, The Cure, New Order, Bow Wow Wow, etc. And it&apos;s not just atmospheric background music either. There&apos;s actually a ballroom scene where they&apos;re rockin out to 80s post punk. If you don&apos;t realize the purpose of this odd juxtaposition, you might find yourself strangling the person sitting next to you.\n\nOther anachronisms are more subtle but equally bizarre. When Marie Antoinette goes on her shoe shopping spree (to the tune of &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, no less) if you look closely you&apos;ll see a pair of Converse hi tops in the picture. That&apos;s probably when it should sink in that the director is messin with you.\n\nSo the point of my review is to warn you NOT to expect any sort of historical accuracy, or even proper historical context. &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; is more like the story of a 21st century teen growing up in a world of social jealousies, confused politics &amp; cliquish loyalties. Only instead of the highschool hallways it happens in the Palace of Versailles.\n\nThat explains why the film &quot;missed the opportunity&quot; of chronicling the French Revolution, the royal flight to Austria, the subsequent trial for treason and other landmark events that you&apos;d think would be covered in a film called &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. But no, those weren&apos;t within the scope of the film.\n\nIn the IMDb &quot;goofs&quot; section, people have listed everything from &quot;The real Marie Antoinette didn&apos;t wear underwear&quot; to &quot;18th century French forks should have 3 tines, not 4.&quot; Ooook. I&apos;m sure those historians hated the movie like I did. But literally as I type this review, I&apos;m hating the film less &amp; less, and I might even try watching it a 2nd time. &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; is definitely not your typical period piece, though the lavish visuals and big budget might lead you to believe it is. Approach it instead as an experimental indie type film with no rules, and you might really enjoy it.\n\nFor me it might be too late, but if you haven&apos;t seen this movie you should have fun if you know to expect a modern day story that&apos;s ironically set in the late 1700s. It&apos;s a good flick, although I question why it won at Cannes (actually, when you see the end credits and realize how much money this production brought to France, maybe there&apos;s no question why it won). Definitely do not expect an 18th century European history lesson. For that, stick with the excellent period piece &quot;Amadeus&quot; and the very entertaining 1961 Sophia Loren film set during the French Revolution, &quot;Madame&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "Fellini never made too many films that had absurdly intense sexual themes and dialogue. He made two, and along with `Casanova,&apos; `The City of Women&apos; revolves almost entirely around sex. What `City of Women&apos; has that `Casanova&apos; did not, however, is a beautiful child-like view of things that really makes Fellini&apos;s movies fun in the first place. It also has Marcello Mastroianni (one of my favorite actors) and gorgeous surreal cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno. \t `City of Women&apos; begins, appropriately enough, with a train going into a tunnel. Marcello Mastroianni is Snaporez, an again man on a train. He begins to flirt with the woman who is sitting across from him and follows her into the bathroom. As he reveals his lustful feelings, the train suddenly stops and she gets out. He runs after her and ends up at a hotel that appears to be hosting a feminist convention, a REALLY exaggerated and completely insane feminist convention. He soon discovers the entire land he is in is populated with women. Snaporaz is both frightened and in awe of the variety of women that surround him, and they represent virtually all viewpoints of feminist issues - from angry man-haters to whores to crazy teenage girls to dancers to roller skaters to older, more motherly women. Throughout the film the women are clearly in total control, and I interpret this film as a womanizer&apos;s nightmare, which makes perfect sense.\n\nThe film is perfect by no means, but it&apos;s still a bit of a treasure if you&apos;re a Fellini fan who has explored most of his body of work, and yet are still starved for some Felliniesque fun. This film has that, and a lot of it. The greatest scene in the film is toward the end, where Snaporez crawls under a bed and comes out inside a bright beautiful carnival. He slides down a stylized rollercoaster and mentally goes through some of his life&apos;s most memorable sexual situations. This was a marvelous scene, with a beautiful carnival set, and above all, brilliantly scored by Luis Bacalov.\n\nOverall, I have no idea who will like this film. Even Fellini fans seem to dislike it, or even hate it. I found it to be a lot of fun, and visually marvelous."

I really enjoyed the character named &quot;Son of the Gun&quot; in the movie very much... \n\nThe song &quot;Gun Ganapathy&quot; was choreographed and filmed humorously. The race sequences are very interesting and not boring. From the way the movie ended, I believe the directors are planning for a sequel for this movie...\n\nI really appreciate the directors of this movie for attempting Guy Ritchie style movie making in Tamil cinema.\n\nWatch this movie in theaters with your friends and enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "The Secret Ways is one of the more obscure Richard Widmark films ever done. Oddly enough it was a family project with him producing it and his wife Jean Hazlewood writing the screenplay. \n\nIt&apos;s easy to base a film on an Alastair MacLean novel, but hard for director Phil Karlson to make a boring film, but that&apos;s what Widmark and Karlson succeeded in doing. The cinematography was so drab in Vienna and in Zurich Switzerland standing in for Budapest that I fell asleep. Color might have helped, but one of the best espionage stories ever done was also filmed in black and white in Vienna, that being The Third Man. That is certainly not boring.\n\nRichard Widmark plays an American agent who is asked to do a job and get a Hungarian resistance leader in Walter Rilla out from behind the iron curtain. Rilla is reluctant to go and at first his daughter Sonia Ziemann is reluctant to cooperate.\n\nFor a MacLean novel it has a lot less plot twists than normal. You want to see MacLean done right for the big screen checkout Where Eagles Dare.\n\nDick Widmark never produced another film again, wonder why.",

      "reviewBody": "Joseph Losey established himself as a gifted filmmaker in the late &apos;40s with The Boy with Green Hair, my favorite film from childhood. The thing about genuine artists is they can&apos;t kick the truth. Regardless how wayward they become in their obsessive lifestyles or imaginations, their deepest obsession remains with the truth. Losey would eventually make in the early &apos;60s what was up to that point the best film exploration of the sado-masochistic impulse, The Servant, with the great film actor, Dirk Bogarde, and during that same period the effects of child sacrifice in The Damned. He would later explore the very dark dead-end of multiple sexual partners as a way of life in his film adaptation of Mozart&apos;s Don Giovanni (1979). But his great masterpiece, in my view, is his penultimate film, La Truite (The Trout, 1985). He must have experienced great satisfaction in knowing that every critic missed the central theme and all the deeper nuances of what he was conveying in the film, most thinking that it was simply a comic film about a cold-hearted bitch, played perfectly by the ever-surprising Isabelle Huppert. I will not dwell on the complexity of what this film is about, only to mention that it involves a precocious child, Frederique, who discovers much too early in life the sado-masochistic matrix of the world and begins her trek on finding ways to adapt to it while not allowing a core innocence to be destroyed by it, to keep an upper-hand in distance, a postmodern Fanny Price who is elevated not by dominance but by a detachment that, in its severance from God, borders on being the ultimate act of cruelty, indifference. She keeps in tow a hyper-sensitive, self-destructive husband who is gay and who, in discovering the dead-ends of sado-masochistic delight, is devastated every second of every moment by looking long and hard into the reality of love lost in the only territory he knows, the valley of the void where he commits to drinking himself to death. The heroine played by Ms. Huppert has only one ally, an elderly Japanese man who has achieved a similar detachment in his life, and they become spiritual friends. This film is not about a bitch, but about &quot;misdirected transcendency&quot; (Girard) in a world that is severed from God.",

      "reviewBody": "Turkish Marxist writer Yashar Kemal wrote his well received 1955 novel, upon which this cleverly composed film is based, in a neo-realistic albeit folkish style telling of a legendary outlaw of Southern Anatolia whose exploits in and near the Taurus Highlands are in support of poverty shackled small farmers with their struggles against oppressors: landowners of large estates and of surrounding villages. Peter Ustinov adapts Edouard Roditi&apos;s English translation while producing, directing, writing the screenplay and starring in this widely tailored version, titled THE LION AND THE HAWK for video distribution and, although the work is disdained by some critics, it is replete with Ustinov&apos;s finely honed wit. The year is 1923 as a regional governor, Agdi Agah (Ustinov) is confronted by a rebellious peasant, a more courageous than wise Memed (Simon Dutton) who is courting Hatche (Leonie Mellinger), a young woman equally smitten of her brash suitor, despite her having been selected to wed Agdi Agah&apos;s disgustingly slovenly nephew. When an attempt to kill the tyrant miscarries, Memed flees his village, joining a band of brigands whose plundering under Memed&apos;s eventual leadership is bothersome to wealthy property owners who are blind to basic needs of the region&apos;s peasantry. The Turkish government&apos;s customary offers of amnesty to the brigands are undone when revenge becomes a primary issue, and as the film&apos;s climax approaches, it must be hoped that the principal triumph will be enjoyed by the underprivileged masses, as in Kemal&apos;s novel. Filmed in the beautiful former Yugoslavia with a modest budget, this English/Yugoslav co-production is charged with enormously witty dialogue, and while Ustinov&apos;s fondness for satire and other forms of sardonic irony have caused admirers of the original to fuss a bit, a close scanning of Kemal&apos;s text reveals his consistent appreciation for life&apos;s inherent comedic elements, notably when amid scenes of tragic violence. A splendid internationally flavoured supporting cast is on board, including such as: from the British Isles, T.P. McKenna, Michael Elphick, Siobhan McKenna, Michael Gough, and Walter Gotell, with the latter gathering in the acting laurels for his turn as a Turkish Army sergeant who refuses to waive his ethics; Vladek Sheybal of Poland; and the Czech, Herbert Lom. Cinematographer Freddie Francis uses a full palette supplied by Panavision lenses to create striking visuals that mate well with an interesting storyline. Ustinov&apos;s penchant for giving other players free rein with role interpretations is the work&apos;s principal failing, with their characters upon occasion working at cross-purposes within and from the scenario; nonetheless, there is more than enough solid production quality here to satisfy most viewers.",

Cia Lowgren is gorgeous here, even tho Ole puts the song over better and the strip poker scene is ridiculous. Eva Weinreich, too, in a quite different way. Anne Bei Warburg does yet another alluring scene with her husband. And Louise Frevert is given ample room to display her ample charms and irrepressible overbite. She is also an incredible dancer. I believe Barbi Benton can be spotted (easily, since the camera zooms in on her) shaving her legs alongside Kate Mundt in the women&apos;s locker room.. There&apos;s plenty of nonsense, too, for example when Hans Jorgensen (I think) interrupts repeatedly with his inventions - long-playing vinyl records, stereo and television, etc - and is summarily ejected from the office, And a lot of fake mustaches and a beautifully restored Packard convertible.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Quite possibly the sleaziest film ever made in Britain&quot;. These aren&apos;t my words but a quote from a certain I.Q. Hunter, who&apos;s a respectable author and acclaimed cult cinema expert. Mr. Hunter was a guest at the local film festival in my country and provided this film – as well as a few other flamboyant British horror outings – with an interesting foreword. This man surely knows what he talks about and I definitely enjoyed listening to the trivia items that he shared with the audience, but I&apos;m really not sure if I agree with this review&apos;s opening statement. &quot;Killer&apos;s Moon&quot; is a sleazy piece of work, no argument there, but I still don&apos;t think it compares to – for example - &quot;House of Whipcord&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot; or &quot;Inseminoid&quot;. What struck me most about &quot;Killer&apos;s Moon&quot; is how much better and more significant it easily could have been This film doesn&apos;t necessarily require a bigger budget, nor a more professional cast or even more action/atmosphere. It already has everything, only a slightly more skillful direction and a bit of coherence in the script would have been welcome. The ramshackle bus of a school of choir girls and their two uptight teachers breaks down in the middle of the godforsaken English countryside, and they are forced to spend the night in a castle-hotel that normally is closed for the season. Not a problem, you&apos;d think, except for the fact that four escaped asylum patients are at large in the area. As a result of oddball drug-experiments, these four are high on LSD and under the impression they tripping around in a dream. They break into the hotel and joyously begin raping, murdering and philosophizing, whilst the shrinking group of girls seeks the help of two tough campers. It&apos;s a rather preposterous and laughable to assume that mental patients are fed LSD as treatment, let alone that they can freely run around without any kind of authorities searching for them. There are numerous of other improbabilities in the script, like characters suddenly vanishing and that sort of stuff, but I advise not to let them bother you too much. Furthermore &quot;Killer&apos;s Moon&quot; is stuffed with gratuitous nudity and &quot;incorrect&quot; misogynic dialogs (&quot;you were only raped, as long as you don&apos;t tell anyone about it you&apos;ll be alright. You just pretend it never happened&quot;), like a truly rancid product of the late 70&apos;s ought to be! Writer/director Alan Birkinshaw&apos;s decision to dress up the four lunatics and let them behave exactly like Alex DeLarge and his companions in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is either a funny homage or a shameless imitation, I don&apos;t know. My guess is that it was just a silly idea that popped up in his mind, like the heroic three-legged dog.",

Akshay Kumar is just funny as hell in this film, playing his character Sidhu is just lol. I think he acted very well.\n\nDeepika Padukone is lovely as ever! Playing a double role again (First being (Om Shanti Om) she was great. I liked her character Meow Meow, i think that it is a cool name and a very cool character. Her action scenes at the airport was fantastic. She looked great in all her costumes and her hair/ make-up was very beautiful! Her other character was also funny Ms. TSM.\n\nDada was great same as the other star cast in the film.\n\nThe songs in CC2C was funny. I love the title track Chandi Chowkt to China and Tere Naine (The sky song)...\n\nOverall this film is a great watch! My rating for Chandi Chowk to China: 7/10",

It consists of some rather ear-piercing music playing very repetitively as the female narrator drones on and on about the ancient city of Caeseria and its destruction. During all of this, various statues you can see around Paris are shown--though they seem to have nothing to do with this city. It seriously seems like the filmmakers deliberately made the film as dull as possible.\n\nWhile I adore French films and have seen hundreds, this artsy short is the sort of thing that might make people think all French films are pretentious and dull--which is far from true.\n\nI honestly would love to hear from you to know what you think--is it as marvelous as the other reviewer thought or as awful as I thought?",

The film has many elements of the classic Western including a chase, cattle drive and gunfight but it also tries to add some melodramatic, pure story based elements - though one major plot point was so well signposted, it might as well have been included in the opening credits.\n\nKirk Douglas, as Brendan O&apos;Malley, provides the barely controlled dynamism at the centre of the film. Unfortunately, not all parts of the film are to this standard. Rock Hudson has difficulties with the role of the upstanding sheriff. A strong supporting cast, from Joseph Cotton to Jack Elam, provides a wide, interesting range of characters.\n\nOverall, a solid if unspectacular film, recommended for Western and Kirk Douglas fans. 6.75.",

A gang robs the train where Link is traveling, including his luggage with the money, the train successfully escapes from them, but the singer Billie Ellis (Julie London), Sam Beasley (Arthur O´Connell) and him are accidentally left behind, in an isolated place many miles far from any city. The next train will pass by the region only a week later, and they look for a shelter for the cold night. They find an abandoned ranch where Link used to live. However, the gang who stole the train is lodged there, and further, Link was a member of this gang. He introduces Billie as his wife, and says that he decided to return to the group. A tense, dramatic and violent relationship develops between Link and the group, with tragic consequences.  This western is very different from the others, without action, but having dramatic psychological drama instead, including a claustrophobic situation in the house. Gary Cooper plays a protective good man who wants to forget his past; Julie London&apos;s role is a lonely woman, who does not love any man or anything, but who falls in love with Link; and the performances of the `bad guys&apos; are fantastic. This movie is really a classic western. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `O Homem do Oeste&apos; (`The Man of the West)",

The latter because the way it is presented is somewhat obscure and must be highly confusing for some people. Rather like a painter on canvas the work which is created may be obvious to the artist, but others can see it differently or simply not see the same as the artist or indeed not see it at all. Nevertheless I found this film generally good and interesting.\n\nA middle age successful man is shortly to go into hospital for a routine procedure but is troubled by a recurring dream. After he awakes from the procedure he is subjected to a series of horrendous events in the hospital. Are these events really happening or as I interpret it: is he simply going through a nightmare and experiencing his fears etc?\n\nAll the performers are excellent, the design of the film is first rate and the music is often brilliant. I myself consider this movie more like a black comedy/horror and overall I conclude it deserves: 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This may be an overlooked Howard Hawks film. It&apos;s really a thoughtful film with substance under the guise of Hollywood famous stars and lively screenplay banters. Subject touches on death just 20 minutes into the film. Certainly no dull pacing. It has golden segments, like the exchanges between Grant and Barthelmess, Grant and Mitchell, Mitchell and Arthur, Arthur and Grant, and 10 minutes later, we see people gathered round by the piano singing songs and cajoling - not without sorrow beneath. Be not fooled, sentiments are there for friends passed away. It&apos;s not, but it is, a way of handling grief.\n\nIt&apos;s life, matter of fact and not hung up or lingering, simply moving on, devil may care, with boldness, dare, and risk-woe-begotten (or forgotten, for that matter). Men - one track-minded, to fly to deliver no-matter-what. Women - worry, or why worry. To love the man, much of letting go and let him be comes with the territory, even if it&apos;s Jean Arthur or Rita Hayworth. The story revolves around not just Cary Grant&apos;s Geoff leading the pack in the Andes, but also Thomas Mitchell&apos;s brother gone, Richard Barthelmess&apos; past recur, Rita Hayworth&apos;s nostalgic fear, and the spunky, sentimental Jean Arthur&apos;s Bonnie wraps it all up. The supporting cast aptly contributes from the restaurant-hotel-mailing service owner, the lively South American accents and melody, to the pilots who are green and know not what peril is, and the lone fog-watcher and his donkey. Secrets revealed, conflicts challenged, and there&apos;s a growing promotion of trust through it all. Between business partners, colleagues, friendship or marriage - that unquestionable trust, without asking out loud but understood within - is what life and dare all about.\n\nThis film grew on me. I first saw it on cable TCM the latter half and couldn&apos;t wait to catch it again for the full story. Screenplay by Jules Furthman, music score by Dimitri Tiomkin, directed and produced by Howard Hawks, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; 1939 (available on DVD) is full of life, humor, drama, adventurous spirits, and non-stop exchange of word deliveries - entertaining, enjoyable, and heart-warming.",

      "reviewBody": "`Dances With Wolves&apos;\n\nWhen I first saw the movie Dances With Wolves several years ago the story affected me in a heavy way, so much so that I decided that it would be a long time before I watched it again.  The story is not entertainment.  It is a lesson.  Last week I watched the movie again with a new understanding. Many of the published reviews seem to dislike the movie for various reasons. They are the ones that missed the point of the story.\n\nThe story is, of course, fiction based on a novel by Michael Blake. Fortunately, Michael Blake also wrote the screenplay for the movie insuring fidelity with his vision.  To the credit of Kevin Costner, who was one of the producers and the director, he allowed the story to be what Michael Blake had originally created.  Costner showed great sensitivity in not only capturing the personalities of all the major characters, but making the land itself (in this case South Dakota) one of the major players.\n\n The land was not just a backdrop or playing field.  It was the main character and very much alive.  The cinematography was some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen and in the tradition of the great movie director, John Ford. Ford had an ability to present the land in all its beauty, which also just happened to have a story occurring on it.\n\nIn Dances With Wolves, the land of South Dakota might initially appear to be a bleak place, but as Lieutenant Dunbar (Costner) spends more time at his isolated fort, he somehow slowly merges his soul with the surrounding territory.  The life on the land eventually stumbles onto his location, including a wolf and a tribe of Sioux.  The Sioux and Dunbar mistrust each other initially but through curiosity learn how to communicate with each other, however painfully slow. The wolf too was curious about the soldier, but kept his distance for a while.  Finally, the wolf trusts Dunbar enough to play with him on the prairie.  The Sioux see them playing.  Here was a white man not killing the animals.  He had earned a new name: Dances-With-Wolves.\n\nThe main difference between this movie and a John Ford movie was the way Costner humanized the Sioux characters.  In a John Ford movie, most Indians were the enemy.  The only &apos;good&apos; Indians were the cavalry scouts, but we never really met these scouts as people.  John Ford hired Navaho people to play the parts of Indians in his cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande, which were filmed in Monument Valley on the Navaho Reservation. Years later, Ford attempted to humanize the Native Americans in a movie called Cheyenne Autumn, but by then Ford was an old man and had lost most of his creative genius.  It is a hard movie for me to watch.\n\nCostner&apos;s movie takes great pains to allow us to know the Sioux characters. The story is about them as seen through the eyes of a perceptive white man, who had been given a new life by the gods when his attempt at suicide ended with his recognition as a war hero.\n\nWhat I see when I watch the movie: I see ten thousand years of evolution and experience of a human tribe on the North American continent with the most recent characters at the leading edge of the current (1860) time. The character&apos;s lives are so well presented that I sense the history of their past  In other words, I understand why they do what they do.  What depresses me about the movie is that I know the ending but the characters don&apos;t.  I know that their natural way of life is coming to an end.  The characters don&apos;t know.  To me, the movie is a story of the 4 billion, six hundred million years of natural evolution which is about to meet technology. Technology will be as devastating to this tribe and the land as if an asteroid had hit the earth.\n\nThe beauty of the Sioux life is so precisely shown in this movie.  Their everyday routine of just living off the land is seen the same way as a buffalo eating the grass.  The Sioux adapted to the land the way it was. You see the grass move in waves like the ocean does when the invisible winds touch the surfaces.   You see the effects of the same winds that blow across the face and hair of Stands-With-a-Fist.  You hear the same winds.  The same winds take the smoke from the lodges away from the village. The land and air and life merge in a poetic movement.\n\nThe horses seem more natural and free in their herd next to the village. They are part of the tribe.  You can see the magnificence of the Sioux riders as they become one with the horse as they hunt the buffalo.  I suppose, in a way, the horse was a step in technology for the Sioux since they didn&apos;t have the horse until the Spanish Conquistadors brought them. But when they adapted their life to the horse, they became a great people. I look at it as a step in evolution, not a step in technology.\n\nWe find that the holy man, Kicking-Bird, played by Graham Green, was a hen-pecked husband, something we can all identify with no matter what race or ethnic group.  His wife saw more than he did, especially the budding love between Lieutenant Dunbar and Stands-With-a-Fist, who was played by the heavy-duty stage actress Mary McDonnell.  She is important to our story because we understand the Sioux from her translations.  As an actress, she was so convincing in her struggle to remember long forgotten English words from her childhood, from the time before she came to live with the Sioux. Kicking-Bird on the other hand represented the soul of the Sioux People. He was patient and was the type of person you would want as a friend.\n\nWe have Rodney Grant playing the part of Wind-in-His-Hair, the warrior who was quick to anger but was smart enough to listen to his elders and not kill the white soldier.  Rodney Grant represented the beauty and pride of the Sioux People.  He speaks the last relevant words in the story by proclaiming that he is the friend of Dances-With-Wolves.  Before Dunbar became Dances-With-Wolves, Wind-in-His-Hair would have been happy to kill him.\n\n`Red Crow&apos; Westerman played the part of the chief, Ten-Bears.  We&apos;ve seen him play the part of a shaman in other movies.  He represented the wisdom and of the Sioux People and was also their prophet.\n\nWhat movie about Native Americans could be told without Wes Studi?  In this movie he plays the enemy Pawnee so convincingly that you really hate him. Not only is he the enemy to the white man but the Sioux also.  Wes Studi can be very intense in his savagery, but in the eyes of the Pawnee, he was only protecting his tribal interests.\n\nSo we see the Sioux and, to a lessor degree, the Pawnee in their soon-to-end natural states.  We immediately feel at home with the Sioux.  The Pawnee aren&apos;t quite as lovable, especially when we see Wes Studi scalping the muleskinner.  The first disturbing scene is when the Pawnee attack the Sioux village and we see that to save themselves, the Sioux need the technology (the rifles) of the white soldier.  The Pawnee were so fierce looking (again convincingly by Wes Studi) that we fear for the Sioux tribe but see that the rifles are out of place in this natural world.  It is another technological step in the same magnitude as the horse.  But for all their beauty and greatness, we know they cannot win the final battles with the white civilization because they are so grossly outnumbered.\n\n There is the core of the problem.  The over-population of the modern civilization overruns their own land so they come to the land of the Sioux and destroy without asking.  You could see it in the face of every tribal member as they walked past dead and skinned buffalo which were left to rot in the sun after the buffalo hunters had skinned them for their hides. They were absolutely stunned and sick at the sight.  Whoever did this had no soul.  I extend the message of this movie to today and see population running amuck, stripping the land of resources and changing the atmosphere. It is too painful to contemplate.\n\nTo emphasize the loss and waste of the beautiful prairie life, near the end of the movie we see the soldiers shooting at the wolf for fun.  The wolf is confused and doesn&apos;t understand that bullets are hitting near him. Eventually a bullet strikes the wolf and we hear him cry out.  For me that was the most painful scene of all because I know that&apos;s what people do.  I see people kill a beast for the trophy.  They take it home and hang it on the wall.  The soul of that animal has been cast aside by a human, which has no soul.\n\nThe beauty is not in the trophy.  The beauty is in the life.  The ending for the wolf represents the ending for the Sioux and all the other tribes that lost the natural way of life.  Therefore I am just as disturbed for the Sioux as I am about the wolf.  I am disturbed for the future of the Earth."

      "name": "A Very Merry Christmas with Disney",
      "reviewBody": "As has been said many times, have always been a massive Disney fan, films, shows and short films. Mainly for the animation, music and characters (the best of them magnificent and in many cases iconic) on top of some timeless stories (it never mattered to me whether their films were faithful to the source material or not). With a broader knowledge of all things animation, appreciate animation and Disney even more now through adult eyes, a vast majority of their work still holding up splendidly. \n\nHave always loved Christmas, always was my most anticipated holiday due to loving the atmosphere, the childhood memories and seeing all my favourite Christmas films, cartoons and videos, oddly enough most of them Disney. In later years, this has been slightly replaced by lots of festive commitments and listening to oft-played recordings and CDs of timeless but somewhat done to death Christmas carols and classics. Still watch Disney&apos;s Christmas films, cartoons, videos and specials and cannot get enough of them. \n\n&apos;From All of Us to All of You&apos; was not one of the Christmas specials that was a Christmas staple, having not heard of it for a long time until researching what other Christmas output Disney did other than the ones seen and not being able to find it for a while. Seeing it finally via two versions (one longer and the other with a longer introduction in black and white) online, it really should have been one of those Christmas staples. It captures the spirit of Christmas so well, giving such warmth and nostalgia, and sees all the memorable Disney characters and scenes featured on top form. Will admit actually to being familiar with a lot of the content included through being cartoons or excerpts that were part of my childhood and through the video &apos;Jiminy Cricket&apos;s Christmas&apos;, but that doesn&apos;t matter.\n\nLoved how &apos;From All of Us to All of You&apos; was introduced by narration that educated and entertained delivered in a way reminiscent to the narration in the Goofy &quot;How to&quot; series, rare hosting from Walt Disney himself and magical setting up by TinkerBell, something of a Christmas icon for Disney characters. The black and white is surprisingly well edited and changes seamlessly to colour once Jiminy Cricket arrives on screen in warm, inviting fashion. This continues in the very catchy title song.\n\nThroughout, the animation is colourful and meticulously detailed, both in the segments and the bridging sequences. Cannot fault the music either, which is magnificent and featuring some of the studio&apos;s best ever songs. Jiminy is a host that makes one want to continue watching and the bridging sequences don&apos;t go on for too long and compared to most bridging sequences in animated anthologies a lot of care is done in keeping to the style and tone of the featured footage. \n\n&apos;Santa&apos;s Workshop&apos; is a Christmas classic, with a jovial Santa, seeing how the elf helpers work and especially the march with the toys beautifully accompanied by an orchestral arrangement of Schubert&apos;s &quot;Marche Militaire&quot;, one of his most famous works originally written for &quot;piano four hands&quot; (two people on a single piano). If you love Donald and Chip and Dale together, like me, &apos;Toy Tinkers&apos; while not one of their best is a great representation of them. Very well made, very funny with delightful character interaction, the ending is hilarious.\n\nWe also have excerpts from some of their most famous films, my favourites are the &quot;You Can Fly&quot;, Bambi on Ice and &quot;Bella Notte&quot;, the three most iconic segments of those included. &quot;I&apos;ve Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Silly Song&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&apos;s Work Song&quot; (my least favourite, &quot;Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo&quot; would have fitted the theme more, but very cute) are also great, and then &apos;From All of Us to All of You&apos; ends on a poignant note with perhaps the most famous Disney song of all time &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, always made me cry, still does.\n\nCannot fault &apos;From All of Us to All of You&apos; at all. If being nit-picky, and in no way are they criticisms to bring the quality down, would have liked it to have been longer, due to loving it so much and sad that it ended, and &apos;Fantasia&apos;s&apos; &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; (quite famously associated with Christmas) and &apos;Mickey&apos;s Good Deed&apos; could easily have been included. That&apos;s personal preference though and not criticisms at all as the special was just fine as it was.\n\nOverall, Disney festive magic, a must for those who love Disney and Christmas. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

You can&apos;t go wrong. &quot;Still Breathing&quot; is a perfect example of this.\n\nA cool breeze of delicate moments, tender surprises and disarming understatement, it achieves a magic that clunkers like &quot;Simply Irresistable&quot; can only dream about. It understands that romantic comedies are all about the hesitations, the silences, the searching looks - NOT contrived situations and screwball antics.\n\nIt also realizes that the actors who are paired have to BELIEVE in the material, in each other, and aren&apos;t just there because their agents thought it would be a good career move. Brendan Fraser and Joanna Going trust the script completely, they surrender to it. You can tell by the offhand, unforced way Fraser says his lines - knowing there&apos;s really no way he can foul them up. And Going; who looks like Winona Ryder, Teri Hatcher and Alyssa Milano (depending on the angle) shows the emotional turbulence of going from someone who is very sure of herself to suddenly not being very sure about anything at all. She&apos;s lost her innocence, then found it again but it&apos;s been so long she&apos;s lost it that she has a hard time recognizing it. It&apos;s also great to see veteran actress Celeste Holm infusing the film with her sparkle and intelligence.\n\nA real pleasant surprise, you just find yourself melting into its gentle rhythms and not wanting it to end.",

      "name": "Another Curiously Frustrating Horror Film Sequel",
      "reviewBody": "JAWS 2; HALLOWEEN II; THE RAGE: CARRIE 2—all of them horror film sequels that I can only label as &quot;curiously frustrating&quot;, in that there&apos;s enough in them to like, but just as much to be skittish about. This is also true of POLTERGEIST II: THE OTHER SIDE, the 1986 sequel to the highly acclaimed and highly successful 1982 Steven Spielberg co-produced/co-written horror film classic that Tobe Hooper (of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame) directed, and which ranks with THE SHINING as one of the few true horror classics of the 1980s.\n\nThe film picks up one year after the events of the original, as the Frelengs, led by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams, have now moved off to a desert suburb of Phoenix, Arizona while trying to get a new start, living with Williams&apos; mother (Geraldine Fitzgerald). Nelson is having a rough go of it trying to be a vacuum salesman; he had been in real estate, but the Cuesta Verde incident left him out in the cold. When Fitzgerald passes on, however, it lets open the door for some literal ghosts of the Frelengs&apos; past to haunt them. They become terrorized all over again; and this time, getting in contact with both the famous medium Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) and an Indian (Will Sampson) well versed in the supernatural, they figure out why. Back in the 19th century, a group of White settlers were confronted by Indian warriors in what was to become the Cuesta Verde Estates, resulting in a horrific Sand Creek-type massacre that resulted in a mass graveyard that Nelson&apos;s former employers had built Cuesta Verde over. The spirits of those survivors, including especially a deranged preacher named Kane (Julian Beck), have come back to snatch O&apos;Rourke and to lead them to the Light because they are still not at rest, but they seem to have no intention of bringing her back. Rubinstein and Sampson insist that the Frelengs must return to Cuesta Verde to confront Kane and his minions by entering the Other Side, that netherworld between life and death that Williams and O&apos;Rourke crossed in the original. In between, though, they are confronted with a whole host of horrific things, including a &quot;Vomit Creature&quot;, and a supernatural chainsaw that threatens to tear Nelson&apos;s station wagon apart as they head out for Cuesta Verde.\n\nUnlike a lot of horror films, POLTERGEIST II maintains a good solid position of having five of the principals from the original film (Dominique Dunne, however, had been killed in real life shortly after the original film had been released), plus the solid special effects work of Richard Edlund, who had worked on the original. What POLTERGEIST II lacks, however, is the effective and incisive direction of Hooper and both his and Spielberg&apos;s understanding of the genre and of family. Mark Victor and Michael Grais, though they co-wrote the original&apos;s screenplay with Spielberg, somehow fail to grasp those concepts of the original; and Gibson, who directed the 1980 film BREAKING GLASS and later did 1993&apos;s WHAT&apos;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, is not really in Hooper&apos;s, let alone Spielberg&apos;s, league. The mayhem may very well have been accelerated from the original, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it&apos;s better.\n\nTwo additions, however, do work quite well. Sampson, a real-life Native American who starred in films like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO&apos;S NEST and THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, is extremely good as the Indian shaman who, along with Rubinstein, assists the Frelengs in their confrontation with the ghosts. And Beck is incredibly grisly and frightening as the deranged preacher out to permanently possess O&apos;Rourke; he comes off as a supernatural version of Robert Mitchum&apos;s role in the 1955 classic NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.\n\nThe most welcome return on POLTERGEIST II, besides Edlund&apos;s special effects, is Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s intense orchestral score. These things do keep this film from being just another Hollywood exploitational sequel. But what is there is still strangely empty; and that, in the end, is due to the absence of both Spielberg and Hooper in the basic involvement of things.",

The movies and Charles Bronson hit a nerve, with cracking down on criminals. Now I assume many things will not sit well with people and their views today and maybe further in the future, but it is what it is.\n\nWhen Bronson has someone near to him being harmed, he goes ballistic. Though as we know from the first movie, he does not have any love left for the people he would consider scum. This mixes a bit of what made westerns succesful. So after being inspired by Dirty Harry, this has also elements of the Man with No name trilogy by ... Clint Eastwood. At least that is what you can call Bronson playing two sides of crime families ... nice touch overall if you are not too sensitive",

      "reviewBody": "In dramatic content, «The Timekeepers of Eternity» is not much different from other Stephen King stories that have been filmed. King is at his best, to my taste, when he&apos;s irrational and basic, like in «Carrie» and «Christine», or melodramatic like «Stand by Me.» But when he gets pompous, like the Woody Allen of American fantastique, discussing time and eternity with eye-rolling cavillations, just like when Woody flirts with childish concerns about the existence of God, King&apos;s literary limitations become transparent in their emptiness.\n\nThis is the case with «The Timekeepers of Eternity», which also does not reach the level of a cross between the pompous and the irrational, such as in the overrated «The Shining». What is mostly interesting here is the work of Greek director Aristotelis Maragkos, who turns his movie into obligatory viewing for creators of visual effects and animation. With support from the Onassis Foundation and the University of Kent, Maragkos (thankfully) reduced Tom Holland&apos;s three-hour miniseries «The Langoliers» (1995) to 62 minutes, based on King&apos;s novella of the same name. Maragkos copied the frames onto paper and animated the material using collage techniques.\n\nWe have seen the story many times in different versions: here, a plane takes off, crosses an aurora borealis and almost all the people on board disappear, except for 11 who together penetrate the &quot;twilight zone&quot;, while a violent domestic drama is resolved. Businessman Craig Toomey (Bronson Pinchot) is haunted by the memory of his father, who assured him that, for being a bad boy, he would be eaten by creepy and voracious creatures known as &quot;langoliers&quot;. And while he fights it, all the others are trapped in his hysterical nightmare.\n\nSo, a writer (Dean Stockwell) recites possible versions of the events, a blind girl (Kate Maberly) keeps saying something smells really bad, and the businessman gobbles up his colleagues with his uncontrollable portrayal of the overbearing Toomey. And the story gets more and more verbose and boring, but it ends soon.\n\nThe visual impression remains, the memory of what we saw and what dazzled us. The film allowed me to estrange myself from the story and see it as the work of a great craftsman, a lucky human being who had a university and a foundation to support his creative exploration. For this reason, I have worked for 43 years to create a film archive in Panama with all the wonderful creations of filmmakers from all over the world available to the public. This movie has already been added.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Inconsistent story line, way too long, camera shots that last forever, mute characters, scenes that have nothing to do with the story, etc. E.g. why do we have to watch the protagonist practicing his martial arts moves? Especially when it&apos;s a bad move like when he teaches his girlfriend to defend herself from being choked. I hope no female viewer will memorize that move, because it will not work at all but even put her in greater danger.\n\nA typical poor German movie, I have seen many of this kind. Heavy stuff, always trying to explain the world to us, and/or trying to educate the audience when it is not called for.\n\nThe story could have been told in 90 minutes (max). But it drags on and on and on.\n\nBut the worst is the sound, there is a constant background noise. The sound editor should be put in jail for this masterpiece, at least he should not edit another movie.\n\nWhat a waste of time and money.\n\nDr. Marre (ph.d.guy)",

      "reviewBody": "Out of Universal Pictures, Horror Island is directed by George Waggner and stars Dick Foran, Leo Carrillo, Peggy Moran, Fuzzy Night, John Eldredge, Iris Adrian &amp; Lewis Howard. Screenplay is written by Victor McLeod &amp; Maurice Tombragel from an original story by Alex Gottlieb, music is by H. J. Salter and cinematography comes from Elwood Bredell.\n\nThought to be the cheapest made of all the Universal Pictures releases in the 1940s, Horror Island is in no way a great movie. However, if viewed on its own fun comedy chiller terms it delivers for those of the Dark House mystery persuasion. Plot sees a group of dissimilar human beings gathered on the titular island of the title under the guise of searching for hidden treasure in a haunted mansion. Quelle surprise as things actually do start to go bump in the night and the group start being picked off one by one. Very much in the flavour of Ten Little Indians, but with Universal&apos;s trademark sets and atmosphere building (Bredell always impressive whatever the budget), Horror Island (ignore the foreboding sounding title) is a whole bunch of fun. Some of the plot doesn&apos;t add up, but that adds to the mystery; which why we are on the subject, the mystery reveal of the villain is a pleasant surprise. While the cast have fun and play it accordingly, particularly the delightful Adrian and Foran with his little knowing looks throughout.\n\nFull of creaky doors, moving floors and all that sort of ghost house stuff, Horror Island is hugely enjoyable horror comedy fare for the discerning old time viewer. 6.5/10",

The six founders are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.&quot; And the movies deal with the disappointment of people who live on a border located on three countries :Belgium,Germany and the Netherlands.Neither the smugglers nor the customs officers were smiling when the frontiers disappeared ,in spite of the parades on the street.Neither were the workers:Germany canceled their order (shoes),and the Belgium factory stands in great danger to be relocated abroad ,cause Dutch prices are cheaper -their workers&apos; salaries are 10% lower.The scene when the boss walks across his empty workshop with its silent machines and lots and lots of pairs of shoes is revealing.\n\nNot really a documentary,not really a story with stars (the most famous name is Françoise Rosay, who plays only support);although relocation is still a burning question,the movie has not worn well."

      "reviewBody": "As someone who was quite entranced with the (decidedly early) Black Metal scene as an impressionable teenager way back in the early to mid 90&apos;s, a documentary like this is more a walk down memory lane than a revelation. As such, some prior knowledge of the genre is required before sitting down and watching this documentary. Do not expect a musical walk through, nor an explanation on the aesthetics of the genre, what you&apos;ll get is an account of the ideologies of the musicians, their perception of a bankrupt society with a complete disclosure of their (questionable) morals.\n\nThe interview with Varg Vikernes of Burzum should be taken with a whole bag salt: it comes over as an apologetic discourse of his past crimes, his idealogical and political standpoints are more then questionable. The true star of this docu is without a doubt Fenriz, whose down to earth attitude is refreshing and serves as a stark contrast to the somewhat pompous and overblown pose of Satyricon&apos;s Frost and Mayhem&apos;s Hellhammer. Fenriz (Gylve Nagel) offers insight in the dealings of the Black Circle, the going-ons in Euronymous shop &quot;Helvete&quot; and power struggle of the main antagonists in the early black metal scene without ever going too far. \n\nThe documentary is well constructed, through a collection of interviews it focuses on the people in the scene and as such there is no overdubbed narrator. The soundtrack fits rather well, ambient pieces (by Burzum, Mum and ulver) mixed with furious early day black metal (courtesy of Mayhem, Darkthrone, Thorns and Burzum) serve to pinpoint the resemblance and the blend of the two genres. The ambient pieces also stress the ferociousness and ugliness of black metal, something present day black metal sorely lacks. \n\nNo frills, no bs, no plastic bands and no Gorgoroth: highly recommended for fans of black metal, present and past (like me)!",

How many years ? months?&quot; The screenplay ,based on an obscure forgotten book,was written by one of our genius ,Henri-Georges Clouzot,the only French director who enjoys two movies in the IMDb top 250.Clouzot&apos;s touch can be felt in the scientist character: from the first sequence we know he is a very cynical man ,in spite of his nice look:he tries to use a prostitute as a guinea pig to test the machine;as his friend ,the &quot;good&quot; doctor says :nothing can move you,friendship,love ,despair.The two characters can be seen as the two sides of the same person,which the last scene,with its unusually inventive use of light and shadows ,its dark faces and the symmetrical roles of the two characters,brings out :Clouzot would take this technique to its absolute perfection in his second work ,the celebrated &quot;Le Corbeau&quot;.\n\nJean Durand is evil,and his ambition knows no bounds ,he goes as far as to say that it&apos;s the 8th day of the creation;but his fiancée &apos;s father (Erich Von Stroheim)is as cynical ^;his rapaciousness shows when he wants to use the machine to swindle the life assurances .\n\nAn alternate title is &quot; the revolt of the living&quot; :when people know their days are numbered ,they want to drag the others with them .Another hint at the Bible mentions Samson destroying the temple .\n\n&quot;I do not want to know&quot; says a character &quot;I couldn&apos;t go on living if I knew&quot;.Could you?",

Something goes wrong with the politician and all the girls are murdered by the security of the host to avoid witnesses. However Cat escapes and brings a hard-drive with classified information with her. There is a manhunt for Cat and the cruel assassin Helen Bingham (Janet McTeer) is hired to retrieve the HD and kill Cat. \n\nMeanwhile the Americans Julian Simms (Alphonso McAuley) and Anthony Hester (Scott Mechlowicz) decide to open a detective agency to raise money. When they see on the newspaper that Cat is being chased, they decide to seek her out expecting to receive a reward. However, they cross the path of Helen and they end protecting Cat from the killer. When Helen is betrayed by those who had hired her, she decides to help Anthony, Julian and Cat to retrieve the HD and their freedom.\n\n&quot;Cat Run&quot; is an action-comedy with a heavy handed direction and lack of humor in a rip-off of Guy Ritchie style. Unfortunately the plot is silly and absurd and never works. In addition, Alphonso McAuley is not funny and Helen Bingham is a cliché of other assassins. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Gata em Fuga&quot; (&quot;Cat in Flight&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Angelina Jolie returns as a distaff Indiana Jones in &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life,&quot; an action/adventure film (based on a video game character) that is just goofy enough and inane enough to be almost entertaining.\n\nIn this follow-up adventure - which is designed to give historians and social studies teachers a severe case of the heebie-jeebies - Lara, the world-famous archaeologist and adventurist, finds evidence that the mythical Pandora&apos;s Box is really no myth at all, but rather an actual object loaded with enough plague and pestilence to wipe the entire human race off the face of the planet. It lies buried somewhere, hidden by Alexander the Great in the 4th Century B.C. when he discovered how virulent and deadly the contents of the box really were. Now, twenty-four centuries later, Lara has to try and prevent an evil billionaire capitalist from locating the container, prying open the lid, and bringing an end to civilization as we know it.\n\nThough the storyline is clearly not one to be conjured with, all that really matters in a movie such as this one is that the action move quickly and the stunts be sufficiently enterprising to engage the audience. Credibility is the last prerequisite in a Lara Croft adventure, as evidenced by the fact that if Lara isn&apos;t parachuting smack dab onto the deck of a ship or into the passenger seat of a moving jeep, she&apos;s hitching a ride on the back of a great white shark and riding it to safety. Ah well, it&apos;s all in good fun, I suppose, and Jolie not only looks stunning in all the outfits she&apos;s been given to wear, but seems to be having a fine time playing along with the joke.\n\nThe ending is inevitably anticlimactic, but viewers can have a pretty good time getting there at least.",

Time hasn&apos;t been all that kind to this film, and it seems a bit croaky all these years later, but c&apos;mon, Charlton Heston fighting albino bikers has gotta be worth SOMETHING! The Woodstock scene is priceless, Zerbe makes a wonderful baddie, and remember Paul Koslo? What a dude. This movie is a hell of a lot of fun."

      "reviewBody": "The coastal Florida town in Lawrence Kasdan&apos;s Body Heat brings to mind remote colonial outposts in movies like The Letter (nearby Miami, here, seems as far away as London). A sweltering spell of weather settles down for a long roost, and the distant glow of an old hotel  a relic of the peninsula&apos;s past as an exotic getaway for northerners with money  lights the opening scene; it&apos;s been torched for the insurance, an occurrence so common as to warrant little comment. \n\nIt&apos;s a town where William Hurt, a lawyer who&apos;s neither very bright nor very scrupulous, ekes out a modest existence that seems to suit him; he can dine at the best restaurant in town once a month so long as he doesn&apos;t order an appetizer. The rest of his time he spends lazily with bourbon or beer or in bed with whoever obliges him. \n\nThen he meets up with Kathleen Turner, who hangs around cocktail lounges when her wheeler-dealer husband (Richard Crenna) is out of town, which is a lot. After the ritual game of cat-and-mouse, Turner and Hurt kindle a torrid romance, despite the enervating heat that keeps everything else limp as dishrags. Soon, the pillow talk works around to murder....\n\nOf course, Body Heat is a latter-day version of the story for which Double Indemnity serves as archetype: Duplicitous woman seduces lust-addled stud into killing rich older husband, then leaves him to twist slowly, slowly in the wind. There&apos;s not even enough wind to stir the chimes that festoon the porch off Turner&apos;s bedroom -- can&apos;t the rich old cuckold spring for air conditioning? Hurt and Turner are reduced to emptying the refrigerator&apos;s ice tray into the post-coital bath they share -- but Hurt&apos;s left twisting nonetheless, in one of the better updates of this ageless tale. \n\nIn her movie debut, Turner makes her deepest impression with her best asset, that dimple-Haig voice of hers, all silk and smoke (but neither she nor Kasdan, who also wrote the script, quite justify her character&apos;s long and intricate back-story of ruthless scheming). With his long, lithe college-boy&apos;s build and wife-swapper&apos;s mustache left over from the &apos;70s, Hurt embodies the self-satisfied patsy whose zipper leads him through life. Crenna (who played this Walter Neff role in the 1973 TV remake of Double Indemnity) now takes on the role of the disposable husband, the victim (or rather, the first victim).\n\nBut it&apos;s two smaller parts that give the movie a special shine. Mickey Rourke, as the local arsonist whom Hurt once helped out of a jam, ups the voltage in his two scenes, warning the heedless Hurt, then warning him again when it&apos;s all but too late. And, as Hurt&apos;s amiable adversary in the town&apos;s tiny legal circle, Ted Danson proves surprisingly spry and intuitive an actor (and he contributes a lovely little idyll, doing a soft-shoe routine under a street lamp on a pier). There&apos;s a twist or two too many in Body Heat -- it&apos;s a bit gimmicky -- but, after watching it, you feel as though you, too, should be stripping off your clothes, if only to wring them out.",

Nathan was great of course - all of his nervous business was hilarious. It was fun to see him playing a sensitive guy. And I loved Cheryl Hines.\n\nI enjoyed the story a lot, although it does tend to get a little cloying. There&apos;s plenty of acid humor to balance it out.\n\nI was hysterical crying at the end of the film, thinking what a horrible tragedy it is that Adrienne Shelly won&apos;t be making any more films. She definitely had a lot of talent - I can&apos;t get her &quot;Gonna Make a Pie&quot; song out of my head.",
