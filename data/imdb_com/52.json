      "reviewBody": "Whenever you talk of Lucio Fulci, you immediately think of the his role as the Godfather of Gore. Films like Zombie and The House by the Cemetery are more well known by this director, but he made many films before that were comedies and westerns. This is one of his satirical comedies that is both surreal and a major did at the Catholic Church and Italian politics.\n\nI would not presume to get all of the jokes in this film, as most are not known outside of Italy, but it was funny enough when they lampooned the Catholic Church and their involvement in Italian politics. There are also laughs aplenty at the military and the police as they attempt to stage a coup. I would not like to give away military secrets, but the clandestine operations in this film remind me so much of what our country does to it&apos;s &quot;friends,&quot; and vice versa.\n\nThere is even a nunspoitation aspect to this film as the Presidential candidate goes to a convent to get treatment for his particular paraphilia, and manages to deflower 21 nuns in a single night. His dreams had nuns in lace habits that exposed their breasts and buttocks so that he could grab them. A nun who got left out managed to find him and they enjoyed a night of passion.\n\nThis was hilarious and sexy and surreal and irreverent. Fulci at his best.",

      "reviewBody": "RGV rocks with Naach. Naach is when two personalities meet - an individualistic and objective artist (dancer), Reva and an ambitious but succumbing actor, Abhinav. Reva wants to stamp her identity in her work. Abhi wants to be famous and rich although he realises that it makes him look foolish. Reva is sure; she is sure that she is right; she is sure that her way is the only way; so she is ready to wait for the world to bow down to her feet. Abhi is insecure. Abhi is pathetically in love with Reva because deep inside he desires to be what Reva is. Reva loves Abhi because he is among the few who know she is right.\n\nIf you have read Ayn Rand&apos;s The Fountainhead then you will find that Reva is a Howard Roark while Abhi is almost a Peter Keating!\n\nNaach is a must watch  for its choreography, for its camera, its writing  which is minimalist, and the performance of the actors. The effort RGV puts into making the characters credible is praiseworthy. You will have no problems believing that there are people like these. The movie keeps you restless throughout the movie, an RGV trademark.\n\nSome people will go to the theaters for Antara&apos;s skin, but the once who have seen enough skin and muscle in their lives will be able to tear through the distorting mesh and enjoy the movie at a higher level.\n\nThe negative to the movie is its music  not very good music for a musical. The music was experimental, as it should be, but wasn&apos;t experimental enough.\n\nThe humour comes in the form of spoofs and sarcastic takes on Bollywood and it&apos;s so called Gurus.\n\nThis movie does rock.",

      "reviewBody": "What I like about the movie is that the Critters are back in this supercharged sci-fi space adventure! But these are no ordinary Critters they&apos;ve a super strain of genetically engineered mutants designed to take over the universe. This time they&apos;ve hungry to conquer the galaxy, with an appetite for mankind that&apos;s out of this world. There are scenes where a malfunctioning computer traps a character in an elevator, characters are nearly jettisoned into space from a garbage disposal, malfunctioning doors force characters to climb through access panels, there&apos;s an attempted rape from a drunken ship captain, the lingering threat of a nuclear core meltdown even the climax of the film fails to account for the Critters, as the big moment is a standoff between Charlie and Ug.\n\nAnd can you believe how many &quot;good&quot; actors have appeared throughout the Critters franchise? Everything from popular voice actors (Scott Grimes) to scream queens (Dee Wallace) to niche personalities (Eddie Deezen) to Broadway superstars (Terrance Mann) to talented character actors (Brad Dourif) to motherfucking Leonardo DiCaprio. And that&apos;s not even getting to Billy Zane, M. Emmet Walsh or Angela Bassett, all of whom have offered celebrated performances in their time. And even the actors who didn&apos;t go on to become big names are all highly competent; there really isn&apos;t a performance in any of these movies that made me want to pull my hair out. Call it an act of providence, but the Critters series is more than solidly cast from beginning to end and that&apos;s.. that&apos;s just phenomenal, considering the material we&apos;re discussing.\n\nAnyhow, Critters 4 had the resources to be a good Critters movie, but it didn&apos;t want to be a Critters movie, so it wound up just sort of amounting to nothing. There are good moments sprinkled about the film and I enjoyed the stuff with Charlie and Ug, but most of it is just boring and frustrating.\n\nOverall rating: 4 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Am another person who didn&apos;t care at all for &apos;The Purge&apos; from 2013. It wasn&apos;t completely unwatchable with a couple of reasonable performances and decent production values but was so tension and suspense-free and full of irritating characters, illogical character behaviours, a dull pace, a cheesy script and tired clichés.\n\nHad seen and heard numerous times people saying that &apos;The Purge: Anarchy&apos; was a much better film. Will admit that due to disliking &apos;The Purge&apos; so much, part of me was very unsure as to whether to watch &apos;The Purge: Anarchy&apos; and very nearly didn&apos;t watch it. Seeing it, it was indeed a much better film. Decided too to see &apos;The Purge: Election Year&apos; to see whether the series would continue to improve or whether it would wear thin. Having watched it, &apos;The Purge: Election Year&apos; is far from great and has major flaws but it was not a bad watch, as far as &apos;The Purge&apos; films go it is an easy second best, the best being &apos;Anarchy&apos;.\n\nVisually, the slick and gritty look suits the film well and the effects and such are not as sloppy as before. It&apos;s ominously and not overbearingly scored and assured enough, while boasting enough, though with much room for more, fun, tension, eeriness and shocks. &apos;The Purge: Election Year&apos; starts quite well and elaborates upon what happens before and approaches it from a different angle instead of being a re-hash.\n\nFrank Grillo is a fully committed lead, although his character was far better written in &apos;Anarchy&apos;. Elizabeth Mitchell matches him with dignity and professionalism and their chemistry gives some urgency and heart. Mykelti Williamson is good fun. \n\nHowever, the story execution doesn&apos;t feel fresh, with tired clichés, very variable attempts at twists and too many parts that don&apos;t ring true and not always plausible. The character development is still wafer thin, with the villains being ciphers that are not threating and actually being pretty stupid and a few characters don&apos;t serve much point. None of the characters are quite as annoying as those in &apos;The Purge&apos;, but the questionable and illogical decision making and behaviours remain still. \n\nDialogue continues to be rather weak, lacking tautness and being awkward and silly, complete with rather heavy-handed and over-emphasised political elements. Would have liked more tension and suspense, while they are here there is not enough of either, and tighter pacing would have helped, the middle act does drag.\n\nOverall, not much special but has its moments. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

Now serving as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), his mission is to protect her in a run for president and survive the annual ritual that targets the poor and innocent. But when a betrayal forces them onto the streets of D.C. on the one night when no help is available, they must stay alive until dawn ... or both be sacrificed for their sins against the state.",

The reason being that &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; features scenes in which they can compare and contrast the thespian skills of both Danza and orangutan. For my money the orangutan wins easily. Beyond the Danza versus orangutan intrigue the film may fail to generate much interest for them. While the large cast seems to be having a blast hamming it up on the open road, the end result is that this movie is pure road kill for viewers. I&apos;ve been in car accidents that are more fun than this flick."

      "reviewBody": "Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the U.S. as &quot;Distant,&quot;\n\nwas directed, produced, written, and filmed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan.\n\nThis movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a &quot;city mouse,&quot; Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a &quot;country mouse,&quot; Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. \n\nBoth men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)\n\nIn most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. In this film, there&apos;s little humor or even warmth. Both men have lost touch with human society. Mahmut &apos;s work as a commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he clearly still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.\n\nMahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn&apos;t have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. He&apos;s clearly a warm and caring person, but can&apos;t express these qualities in an urban environment.\n\nThe cousins don&apos;t relate well to the world, and they don&apos;t relate well to each other. Neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. \n\nIn a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. \n\nConceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other&apos;s life. Instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. The two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film&apos;s title.\n\nOne of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds detail upon detail. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.\n\nUzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It&apos;s not a &quot;labor film&quot; in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf).\n\nThis is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. Although it doesn&apos;t make for happy viewing, I walked out of the theater realizing that I had seen a truly creative and important movie. This film is worth finding and seeing!",

      "reviewBody": "It would be nice to see Weibang Ma-Xu&apos;s other films. He was a busy director logging up credits till the sixties. This is his film which got most attention, though Chinese intellectuals were apparently dismissive of it. Now that the circulation of mainland DVDs has made the pre-WW2 Shanghai films accessible, SONG AT MIDNIGHT turns up in a battered but watchable copy and is unusually intriguing.\n\nEven without sub-titles, the story can be followed. Viewers are helped by familiarity with the &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; origins and Ronny Yu&apos;s accomplished re-make which drew on another half century of technique and a bigger budget. You can also see the influence of the Lugosi Dracula here but this is a much better film.\n\nThe plot has a traveling operetta company arrive at the run down provincial theatre. Their juvenile is having problems but he is coached to triumph by a mysterious hooded figure, who a flash back reveals is a star disfigured by the local power cartel, when he romanced the daughter of an influential family. The young performer sings under the window of the phantom&apos;s old love now deranged, who takes him for her former lover. When his old nemesis menaces the ingénue of the company, the Phantom attacks him and is burned in a tower building by an angry mob. This is not a film that coasts on subtlety.\n\nThe film making, while not polished, gets by and is full of imaginative touches and striking images. The actor playing the phantom was thought of as one of the country&apos;s best at the time and it is interesting to see his work here.\n\nThis is certainly more entertaining than much of the more purposeful work that makes it into critical histories. Anyone with a serious interest in film should seek it out."

It is definitely as good as the current made for TV movies. As a who-done-it, it is moderate in its effectiveness, although it did take me a while to guess who the guilty party was. There were some surprising revelations along the way that greatly added to the quality of the story--revelations that were made in a low-key but effective manner and that served to define the politics and technology that made the story a true science fiction of the hard type.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1888, Sherlock Holmes (JOHN NEVILLE) and Dr Watson (DONALD HOUSTON) discover the identity of the Whitechapel serial killer known as Jack The Ripper.\n\nAn enormously enjoyable fictional confrontation between Conan Doyle&apos;s most celebrated detective and a true crime, which has caused constant fascination since it occurred over one-hundred years ago. The script writers Donald and Derek Ford came up with an excellent screenplay that succeeds in capturing all the eccentricities and intelligence of Sherlock Holmes and his solution to the Ripper killings are quite believable made up of many facts and myths that surround the case that looks never to be solved. Director James Hill who was more famous for his animal adventures with BORN FREE (1965) and his attempt to take swinging sixties pop to the seaside in EVERY DAY&apos;S A HOLIDAY (1964) shows that he was a most versatile film maker who could generate excellent suspense and disturbing horror sequences. Just check out the last killing which is brilliantly shot from the Ripper&apos;s point of view with hand held cameras (presumably!) and gaudy lighting saturated in lurid reds. Hill recreates the Victorian London era with great enthusiasm and he is most ably assisted by cinematographer Desmond Dickinson (who is this author&apos;s favourite cameraman) and there are first rate performances from Neville as Holmes and Robert Morley as his brother Mycroft. There is a classic scene where Holmes is probing a clue over his violin and Mycroft asks &quot;Why in all these years have you never learned to play that infernal instrument?&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "A diminutive classical tenor and his two equally penniless performing buddies seek fame and love in 1930s Venice. Eventually Richardo succeeds in radio, but his stature hinders his dream of starring on stage. And will it also prevent him from finding love? The answer will surprise you. The movie features plenty of singing by Schmidt plus some great exterior location shots in Venice, including gondola travel and an extended walk along quays and over bridges in a city still spared the intrusion of the automobile.\n\nThis film can appeal to fans of various genre: German cinema, Holocaust periphera, Venice, and great tenors. Schmidt reportedly was unhappy with the subject matter-- his own shortness (in life he was sometimes referred to as a &quot;pocket Caruso&quot;. But the film works and it partly truly reflects his own life, where he succeeded much better in recordings and film than he did on stage. He continued to make German film until 1936, and remained popular in parts of Nazi-occupied Europe until his escape to Switzerland in 1940, where he died in an internment camp two years later. The IMDb lists him at 5 foot (1.52m), and that may be generous; in the movie he wears elevator shoes that must give him 6 inches (15cm).",

The movie begins with two weary young women who have just ended their Mexican vacation, and need a ride back to town. They board the airport shuttle bus, and are taken hostage along with the other passengers. How will this divergent group free themselves from their psychotic abductor? The plot is straight-forward to the point of banality, yet here is where the story begins to lose plausibility. The fiendish driver takes them on a late night journey that seems endless and lasts most of the night. It really stretches credulity that no one would notice this out-of-control bus, and it would seem that they would have encountered more traffic if the airport had been located in the wilderness of Alaska. Their malevolent driver is menacing to the extreme, and a maximum of physical and psychological torture is dispatched. It is only in the final few minutes that the true motive for the kidnapping is revealed, and this electrifying final impression of abject loss makes the suspension of believe just about worth it.",

      "reviewBody": "I only read the most recent 12 reviews, but it seems you either really appreciate this film or you think it sucks.  Apparently, some folks see art in the tragic and angst-ridden characters, and others are disgusted by their actions and the depressing imagery.  Personally, my motives were not too sophisticated:  I found it in the &quot;horror&quot; section at the video store and it looked pretty stylish and of course, Aragorn was in it, so I said what the heck.  I thought the film, though disturbing, was indeed a fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinematic art.\n\nAnyway, I&apos;m wondering if Philip Ridley was commenting on the narcissism, arrogance, violence, and corruption of U.S. culture.  Not that others couldn&apos;t be accused of similar vices, but...  I think the boy Seth and the other lead characters symbolize our national conscience.  We run around blowing up frogs and tearing up peoples&apos; property with no remorse, then create our own moral/spiritual sources to console us out of empty, dead things (like a stillborn child).  We wallow in our domestic dysfunctions, while excelling at denial about them (like the nutty mother).  We like a good witch hunt, accusing the depressed widow or the agonized former pedophile, while ignoring the obvious handsome suspects in the nice Caddy. We flit around wrapped in our flag thinking we&apos;re innocent, all the while nuking children in war only to focus on how their radiated skin looks like a mirror in which we can see our lovely reflections.  But someone else gets the last laugh, since we&apos;re all self-destructing as a result of it all, and while at first Seth&apos;s screaming frenzy as the finale confused me, I realize now it&apos;s a fitting end to that interpretation.\n\nOr something like that.  It might just be about a bored rural kid with no conscience and a wild imagination whose failure to tell the truth ends up hurting everyone around him.  Or about the price of tea in China.  It&apos;s worth the view, though, if you like Gothic thrillers."

If the film had difficulties back in the day it would seem it has even more now. The young men look far too old to be going around acting in the way they do yet we are presented with this bunch of alienated persons, alienated either by their own existentialist attitude and stated beliefs or their immigrant status. One has fled Spain another the fruits of Mccarthyism in the US and all meet and disperse, foretelling of doom, murder and suicide. At the same time a production of Shakespeare&apos;s Pericles is being attempted and although I do not know the play I understand the problems of staging it is an ongoing feature and the unresolved nature of much of the play is reflected here in the story of alienated &apos;youth&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Too many threads weaving too many fractured scenes in a dissembled conglomerate of randomly disparate pieces of meaningless dialogue make this a muddled concoction of a cinema buffet of tasteless morsels more of a snack for a buffoon.\n\nThis mixture of Die Hard and Leave It to Beaver leaves much to be desired as action in one place seems so unnecessarily unrelated to the main action in the other. The threat of needing to kill an entire family by blowing up their home with them in it over a mere collection of gold coins does not equate with the need to blow up a building in Die Hard along with all the hostages for 700 million dollars in bearer bonds. \n\nThe bad guys at their best are exaggerations of futility and at their worst are unbelievable as weak-minded antagonists. Melinda Clark would have been better cast as Cat Woman and Derek Hamilton as a schizophrenic, psychotic misanthrope all mouth and no menace. Mel Harris does a credible job as a caring parent but does not show enough of the fear that would be more natural for a parent in that situation with pistols aimed at them in a continuous &quot;I wanna shoot you but won&apos;t&quot; series of idle threats. \n\nCameron Bowen as Nick is the MacGyver of the family with unique and fearless ingenuity despite his seemingly superfluous asthma while Michelle Jackson portrays one of more credibility had she been in Ferris Buhler&apos;s Day Off. As for Fred lane, he might as well have been MIA since he had no meaningfully significant role other than to be there as a reference.\n\nThe shift from scene to scene, house to house, set to set makes this more of a bad soap than a good action-less mystery. The title is a misnomer but it is certainly better than the original, Dynamite, because with either one, as a success, certainly all blows up in their collective faces.",

      "reviewBody": "This is another early Marilyn Monroe picture; in this case, it&apos;s a compendium of stories involving a handful of marriages  presided over by reliable Victor Moore  which are discovered to have been illegal because his term of office hadn&apos;t yet officially started when the ceremony was performed! So, he&apos;s made to send each of these a letter explaining the awkward situation and, according to where they stand at that particular moment in their married life, see how they decide to act upon it. The couples are played by Fred Allen and Ginger Rogers, David Wayne and Marilyn Monroe, Paul Douglas and Eve Arden, Louis Calhern and Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Eddie Bracken and Mitzi Gaynor. The least episode is the one with Douglas and Arden, where the latter becomes suspicious of just what goes on during the former&apos;s business trips; the Calhern-Gabor episode is mildly interesting for having her turn out a schemer  planning to appropriate her husband&apos;s fortune with the help of shyster lawyer Paul Stewartuntil he&apos;s saved by the propitious arrival of Moore&apos;s letter!; Wayne has a hard time adjusting because of Monroe&apos;s triumph in a &quot;Mrs. Mississippi&quot; contest  believing his troubles over when the marriage is revealed to have been null, his &apos;wife&apos; promptly enrolls in a &quot;Miss Mississippi&quot; competition (which, naturally, she wins); Bracken is a soldier who goes AWOL in order to consolidate his wedding vows when it transpires that his child (whose birth is imminent) may be declared illegitimate  Lee Marvin appears briefly as Bracken&apos;s buddy in this, one of the two most satisfying episodes; the other is the one featuring constantly-bickering pair Rogers and Allen, which unbearable situation threatens to sink their early-morning radio show (where they&apos;re ironically billed as the ideal married couple)! Again, the film is handled with utmost professionalism  and is undeniably entertaining while it&apos;s on  but which now feels dated and undistinguished.",

Not that I find him to be a great actor or anything like that but I enjoyed a lot of the stuff he was in. I though this actor never ages but in this you can tell the guy is getting old now. And although I never found Reeves to be a great actor he fit in very well for a role like this. &quot;If you did the time you might as well have done the crime&quot;. Is one of the quote in this movie and that is what the character Henry(Keanu Reeves) goes by after getting out of prison for a crime that he was unintentionally a part of. But his motives are quite different than most criminals that tries to commit a crime. Yeah Keanu although entertaining to watch his presence in movies is bashed upon for not being a great actor like I said before. But in a role like this he fits right in and is actually believable. As a character who is a quite, reserved person and is also a person that lacks ambition but has a kind heart. I didn&apos;t find the chemistry between him and the actress Vera Farmiga all that great since the actress isn&apos;t likable at all. And just comes off loud and selfish in my opinion but who am I to judge when it comes to someone falling in love. I gotta say though the actress is really good and her acting was top notch and believable, like as if she is like that in real life. Overall I didn&apos;t find this movie all that entertaining and found the chemistry to be lacking, but it&apos;s passable barely.\n\n6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "One adjective frequently associated with the cinema of Shimizu Hiroshi would be &quot;humane&quot;. Both before the war and after, the director showed considerable insights and understanding of human nature in his works, specially those that deal with the psychology of children. But alas, during the war-time, Shimizu&apos;s filmography included a dark chapter. Back then, all Japanese cinema was under the control of the state, and if you wished to work, you did the films you were assigned. At least hopefully that is the case, it would be depressing to think that a guy like Hiroshi would do a film like this willingly.\n\n&quot;Sayon no kane&quot; (Sayon&apos;s Bell, 1943) is based on an alleged true story of a young Taiwanese girl, who drowned while helping to carry the luggage of her Japanese teacher, in 1938. This is a clear propaganda narrative, a tribute to those loyal servants in occupied Asian nations like Taiwan. The film opens nicely enough. Shimizu opts for a documentarist touch, and shows the Taiwanese countryside and the people living there extensively. The cinematography is good and you can see that Shimizu is a storyteller from the silent days, he does not need the dialogue, even though this film eventually starts having some.\n\nIt is the purpose of the imagery which is tasteless. The film strives to show the Taiwanese as undeveloped, rural people, who lack the civilized ways of the Japanese, and should therefore become their servants. Of course, happily and out of free will. The film is very heavy-handed with Japanese symbols, kicking off with characters bowing to the flag, later incorporating the national anthem and other patriotic songs, and featuring the Japanese as teachers, from whom other nations can learn from, after acknowledging their superiority.\n\nThis film is all-but-impossible to watch because of the slimy nature of the narrative, which is a real shame. The star, Yamaguchi Shirley, is charismatic, and Shimizu is a pro who at least can make the film look nice. But one can not set aside, that Shimizu is clearly on the wrong side of history here.",

Fifty year old Leo picks up twenty year old Franz and brings him home for the night. Franz stays, becoming his lover, his houseboy but mostly his slave. There are only two other characters in this slight, stage-bound piece; Anna, Franz&apos;s vacuous former girlfriend and Vera, Leo&apos;s former transsexual lover.\n\nFundamentally it&apos;s about love, of the destructive, unwholesome kind maybe, but love nevertheless. Whatever hold Leo has over Franz, (and Vera), they both love him though it could hardly be said that it is reciprocated. Leo is very much the master and everyone else is his slave. Whether he is capable of love is debatable.\n\nOzon makes the piece both erotic and humorous but it is never quite as touching as it ought to be. All four players give good performances with Malik Zidi quietly outstanding as the boy.",

      "reviewBody": "I was privileged to be able to attend the premiere of 41 and it was an experience I will not soon forget. I had known about the Station nightclub fire in Rhode Island that claimed the lives of 100 people. But I had not known Nick O&apos;Neill, whose story is so compellingly told in this documentary. Nick&apos;s life had a tragic ending, but somehow 41 manages to be uplifting. Intercutting between Nick&apos;s story and his own journey as a filmmaker, Christian de Rezendes has produced a moving portrait both of the creative, rebellious, and charismatic Nick, and of his own skepticism as an objective observer to Nick&apos;s &quot;afterlife&quot; as a presence for his family and friends. This is a brilliant film, documentary film-making at its best. You won&apos;t think about life and death in the same way again.",

      "description": "On February 20, 2003, the 4th largest nightclub fire in American history claimed the lives of 100 people. This film is about 1 of them.  In the winter of 2003, a catastrophic fire erupted in a Rhode Island concert club, ultimately claiming 100 lives. For this state of just over a million residents, the devastation was profound, leaving unanswered questions and deep scars in its wake. But out of the ashes of the tragedy arose an equally profound story of hope. One year after the fire, a community theatre in the small city of Woonsocket gathered together to perform a play written by the fire&apos;s youngest victim close to the end of his life - a play that many felt could only be described as prophetic. &quot;41&quot; tells the story of Nicky O&apos;Neill, the young actor, writer and musician who left the world at age 18 but who left behind a message. &quot;41&quot; weaves together the story of a life cut short, the saga of a community in mourning, and a family finding its way out of the darkness. Written by Christian O&apos;Neill, co-director of 41",

Their only child George grows up a spoiled arrogant brat. Everybody in town is looking forward to his comeuppance. George falls for Lucy Morgan who is the daughter of Eugene Morgan. Eugene is in the new automobile business which George ridicules and belittles at every chance. George ridicules everybody and their professions while having an aimless outlook himself. After Wilbur&apos;s death, Isabel and Eugene rekindle their romance and enrages the petty temper of little George. While the Morgans gain greater and greater success through their automobile, the fortunes of the Ambersons decline.\n\nGeorge is such an annoying petty character that it&apos;s hard to base the movie around him. He&apos;s really the villain in Eugene and Isabel&apos;s lives. Orson Welles is a magnificent filmmaker and everything looks terrific. It&apos;s just hard to care about this character. Like the rest of the town, I&apos;m just waiting for his comeuppance and I don&apos;t like that feeling. I&apos;d rather have his redemption where he learns generosity. At least, he gets to responsibility but that part is short and the movie rushes to its ending.",

      "reviewBody": "This moving thriller displays drama , action-packed , thrills , and wild fighting images . It is an action-filled and violent film , being utterly filmed in France and Turkey . Set initially in Paris , there appears several stabbed and bruised victims . A tough and young but experienced detective called Paul Nerteaux (Jocelyn Quivrin) carries out the hard investigation . The corpses belong to women illegal Turkish immigrants . Paul then decides to ask for help an old detective , Jean-Louis Schiffer (Jean Reno) , and as he join forces with the retired police inspector with very sharp skills to pursue the serial killer . Both of whom infiltrate in the Turkish immigration mafia attempting to resolve the heinous killings . Meantime , a woman named Anna Heymes (Arly Jovert) undergoing an illness treatment and has confuse vision and rare breakdowns , as well surprising outbreaks . She is helped by an obstinate psychiatrist called Mathilde Urano (Laura Morante) . At the end , Paul discovers the nasty Turkish organization &quot;The Wolves&quot; , led by an ominous mobster called Kudseyi (Vernon Dobtcheff) , is behind the weird crimes and after that , he goes to Turkey .\n\n¨L&apos;Empire Des Loups&quot; or &quot;Empire of the Wolves&quot; contains sinister mysteries , emotional thrills , action and suspense . This is a highly mysterious and cerebral thriller , filled with plot twists , including a spectacular denouement in its final part . The main premise is the following : various slashed female corpse of immigrants show up and two detectives to investigate it and to chase a serial murderer . This original as well entertaining premise is overspread across the movie adding some brief conventional pitfalls . Along with the astonishing crimes is developed an intrigue about women exploitation , illegal immigration and drug smuggling . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , fierce combats , shootouts , and groundbreaking struggles . ¨Seven¨ atmosphere and style psychological mystery , being decently directed , though hard to follow . The only scenes that used CGI are when Jean Reno falls down spiral ladder at the graveyard with CG stairs , bricks , rocks surrounding him . The cast is frankly fine , such as Jean Reno who gives a good acting as a dark retired Police Inspector Jean-Louis Schiffer . This one belongs to the last period in his long career playing strong cops or mobsters as ¨Antigang¨, ¨22 bullets¨, ¨Armored¨, ¨wasabi¨ and especially ¨Crimson Rivers¨ and &quot;Crimson Rivers 2: Angels of the Apocalypse&quot; and TV series ¨Jo¨. And nice Jocelyn Quivrin as two-fisted young detective as well as Arly Jover as unsettling girl who suffers severe headaches and glimpses of records . Special mention for Laura Morante as a cunning psychiatrist . The picture is pretty well , though sometimes complex ,and it has a lot of turns . However , being entertaining for its continuous suspense . \n\nDark and rainy cinematography in ¨Seven¨ style by Michel Abramowicz . Strange and moving musical score fitting to action , including oriental sounds from Turkey . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios , including Paris , Istanbul , Uchisar, and especially Cappadoccia, Turkey . This stirring film was lavishly co-produced by producers Andrew Colton , Patrice Ledoux , Francesco Pamphili and professionally realized by Chris Nahon , though it has some flaws and gaps . Filmmaker Nahon establishes his signature style of kinetically-paced story-telling through sumptuous imagery , leading to international critical acclaim . Chris Nahon was born in France , he is a good director and writer, known for Empire of the wolves (2005) , Blood: the last vampire (2009) and Kiss of the dragon (2001) . Rating : 6/10 , passable and acceptable . Worthwhile watching .",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie in 1968 when I was 14 as an assignment for school. The other day I saw it again late one Saturday night on my local PBS station. I remembered how entranced I was in the mood and the music, and that was still the same now. The movie was nominated for a Golden Globe as best picture(drama) and it won for best score.\n\nBut after living for 30 years I really see it as a great story about the relationship choices we make in life. It really made me reflect on my own choices in life.\n\nThe main character is played by Julie Christy age 26, who is the owner of a sheep farm in England. She is very beautiful and more than one man is in love with her. I won&apos;t say which man she marries but even after the movie was over I felt perplexed as to any one right outcome. That we all make choices at different times in our lives and sometimes the reasons are the same and sometimes they are different. Sometimes we make emotional choices and sometimes intellectual ones. But they are all choices we have to live with."

      "reviewBody": "Clint Eastwood could do no wrong in the early Nineties.\n\n Hot on the heels of Unforgiven, he teamed up with The Perfect Storm director Wolfgang Petersen for one of the best thrillers of the decade - In the Line of Fire.\n\nImagine a cross between The Day of the Jackal and The Bodyguard and you get the idea. \n\nHollywood&apos;s craggiest leading man plays Frank Horrigan, a troubled bodyguard assigned to protect the US president against a psychopathic assassin.\n\n John Malkovich delivers a stunning performance as the man on the end of the trigger and acclaimed German director Petersen directs with such skill, Eastwood even asked his advice when he came to direct A Perfect World.\n\n Clint was 63 when he made this and brought a lifetime of experience to the role of a world weary Secret Service agent haunted by the fact he failed to save President Kennedy from the fatal bullet. \n\nThe clever use of a doctored photo by Hollywood whiz kids shows the actor/director stood at the side of JFK. A nice touch which is well worth looking out for.\n\nTo be honest, ITLOF is a cliched thriller, the sort of story which crops up most weeks as a glossy, no brain offering on Channel 5.\n\n However, both director and stars took the well worn material and gave it a fresh spin, upping the tension several notches with each passing scene, resulting in a spectacular finale which is great value for money.\n\nRene Russo is so good she could play the part in her sleep. The former model adds a degree of mature charm to her role of an agent who Horrigan believes is mere `window dressing&apos; for the department.\n\nAs with all of Wolfgang&apos;s movies, believability is everything. A rare degree of authenticity was achieved during the crowd scenes when the German film-maker integrated his fictitious President with the crowds from the Clinton and Bush election campaign. \n\nThe cost? A cool $4million.\n\nThe script had been knocking around Hollywood for a decade before it was dusted down and given a green light. It was originally to star Dustin Hoffman (who signed up for Petersen&apos;s follow up, Outbreak). \n\nBritish director Michael Apted (The World is Not Enough) was due to direct the Hoffman version, but when David Puttnam took over as the head of Columbia in 1987, the movie was put on hold.\n\nProducer Jeff Apple (a man more known in the trade for his interactive shopping shows than films) brought in Jeff Maguire to polish up the script.\n\nThe idea of Horrigan as an agent who failed to stop JFK&apos;s untimely death gave the movie a twist that Hollywood execs found delicious.\n\nBefore long, there was a feeding frenzy over the new, improved script and eventually, Rob Reiner&apos;s Castle Rock company snapped it up for a million dollars with Clint Eastwood on board.\n\nPetersen had wanted Harrison Ford, but eventually cast him as the President in Air Force One (which you may remember was the film of the week a couple of weeks ago).\n\nAs any Clint fan knows, he&apos;s a jazz fan - a passion shared by Horrigan in what seemed to be a tailor made role adapted for old Mr Squinty after he signed on the dotted line.\n\nHowever, Frank&apos;s love of piano and jazz was already on the page - a happy accident which helped turn Horrigan into one of Clint&apos;s most likeable big screen characters.\n\nTop drawer stuff."

Gustl Bayerhammer is a very evil bad guy, something one would not never think he could pull off, but he did, very convincingly, I might add. His character, the Ertl Bauer, is very similar to Helmut Qualtinger&apos;s in Peter Turrini&apos;s Alpensaga. The narrator is outstanding. He speaks archaic language, talks as if he would fall asleep any second, but it fits the mood of the piece just right. I do not know why not more people know this, it is pretty unknown. Helmut Fisher of Monaco Franze fame has one of his last roles before becoming famous, the same with Martin Semmelrogge (Das Boot). Cinematography is not outstanding, which is a good thing, it is subtle and only adds to the almost documentary style of the three part miniseries, something I am sure the director intended.",

      "reviewBody": "Most people will say I&apos;m crazy but I actually liked this movie.  I think Tsui Hark is a very clever action director.  I seen his American efforts with Van Damme, even though I hated both movies i did like some of the action sequences.  Like in Knock Off I really liked the last shootout and in Double Team, when Van Damme&apos;s character escaped from that island. \n\nAs for this movie Tsui Hark is really given the chance to shine and this time with better actors.  I thought Nicholas Tse and Wu Bai did a great job with they&apos;re roles as did Candy Lo.  I was expecting more screen time with Cathy Liu&apos;s character.  The acting is pretty good for a Hong Kong action movie.  In other words it seem more naturalistic than compared to many other Hong Kong movies where a lot of the time the actors overact.  I really liked how the movie was shot.  There was this one shot where Wu bai&apos;s character jumps from the window of a apartment building and the camera follows him as he decends.  It just makes me wonder how they did that. \n\nNow for the flaws, there are a lot of characters that just show up.  The plot gets confusing at times and what could of really made this movie better was a better script.  I wished they could of build of the Tse and Liu&apos;s story a lot more.  It was a good attention grabber in the beginning but then it gets ignored at the end and maybe more of Tse&apos;s narration of the movie. Despites all these flaws this movie was still good because of the stylish action scenes.  So basically look for the action scenes and good performances by Tse, Wu Bai, Lo, and Liu.  It&apos;s a good popcorn flick to just enjoy."

A masterful achievement without concessions to the larger public who doesn&apos;t know or care about Italian politics. The film has a life of its own. It&apos;s like a Shakespearean adaptation of a modern Mephistopheles. If you don&apos;t know who Giulio Andreotti is you will want to know because it feels and looks like a fictional character. How is it possible that someone so obviously guilty of undiluted evil could sit, still, in the senate and being treated like a celebrity worthy of absolute respect. Someone said, only in Italy, but I think that&apos;s far too simple. True, Italy seems to award some kind of venerable status to some big criminals that got away with it, one way or another. All of it is here, in &quot;Il Divo&quot; a riveting study, a wildly entertaining X ray of one of the most puzzling figures in modern political history.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Skyjacked,&quot; one of many &quot;air disaster&quot; films from &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; to &quot;Airport&quot;, is one of the best in the genre. Featuring a star-studded cast headed by Charlton Heston (as the pilot, of course) and Yvette Mimieux (head stewardess), it&apos;s a fast-paced, efficient study in suspense. Basically a story involving the attempted hijacking of a commercial airplane, it focuses on a small group of first class passengers who provide both the drama and occasional (intended) humor. Among them are a middle-aged couple (Ross Elliot and Jeanne Crain) worried about yet another job transfer, a senator and his son (Walter Pidgeon and Nicholas Hammond) a &quot;hippie girl&quot; (Susan Dey, on leave from &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; in her screen debut), a jazz musician (former football great Rosey Grier) and of course, a pregnant woman (Mariette Hartley), who is due any minute (apparently, the nun missed this flight). Also aboard is a young sergeant (James Brolin, who fit this in between seasons of &quot;Marcus Welby MD). Last, but not least is Leslie Uggams making her film debut, as an assistant stewardess. \n\nDespite the occasionally unintentionally funny dialogue and predictable situations which, let&apos;s face it, go with the territory, the film has enough action and melodrama to be consistently entertaining. The cast give it their all. Far more interesting than the love triangle between Heston, Mimeux and co-pilot Mike Henry (which is established in a few ludicrous, but mercifully short flashbacks) are the performances of those who play the passengers. Crain, as lovely as ever, (in her first film in five years,and her last) gets to assist in the delivery of Hartley&apos;s baby,(neither she, nor &apos;&apos;Co Midwife&apos;&apos; Mimieux can sing, and Grier won&apos;t turn his guitar loose, so we are spared an in-flight, improvised ballad) as well as a chance to attack the villain. Pidgeon doesn&apos;t have to say much to give his character authority, Hartley is charming, and Susan Dey is both natural and appealing. As for Grier, he displays a genial screen presence while Brolin even evokes a bit of viewer sympathy. \n\n&quot;Skyjacked&quot; was a big hit when it was first released and got a big audience rating when it was shown on television as &quot;Sky Terror&quot;. The photography is excellent, the music by Perry Botkin, Jr. (&quot;Nadia&apos;s Theme&quot;) is unobtrusively effective, and the main theme is beautiful. Although &quot;Airport 1975&quot; was waiting in the wings, so to speak, &quot;Skyjacked&quot; holds it&apos;s own. It will be released this June on DVD in it&apos;s original Panavision aspect ratio. I for one, can&apos;t wait!",

      "reviewBody": "Most impressive feature, made at the end of the 60s, with Russian troops already on the streets, and not released until 1990. Shot in stark b/w, very much with the look we came to expect of the Czech New Wave of the 1960s but lacking that romantic twinkle. Here we are plunged in to the tale of a couple, she drunk, he concerned and trying to get back into their house after a lavish State function. We cut back and forth between the childlike but ominous activities at the official do and the struggle without lights or door keys at home. Much of the action between the husband and wife is shot in close-up and the discord and insult exchange is reminiscent of Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf? But things get worse as the real paranoia of who might be listening in to their conversations becomes more worrying. The omnipresent &apos;Ear&apos; probes a considerable level of paranoia and we too become involved in a terrifying scenario which may or may not imaginary. Stunning ending, both happy and very sad.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Raiders of the Living Dead&quot; is a low-budget zombie rip-off that is inexplicably and consistently interesting; if nothing else, it has imagination and innovation on its side. A reporter and his partner scope out an ominous locale in the dead of night and stumble upon zombies. A child genius works on his doctor grandfather&apos;s laserdisc player and winds up creating a laser. And a zombified Scott Schwartz (the kid from &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;?) hijacks a truck for no reason and tries to blow up a nuclear power plant, only to be claimed by the zombie menace. While slow in spots, and sporting more of a 1980s look than a Sears catalog, &quot;Raiders&quot; exists in some weird limbo between &quot;Children Shouldn&apos;t Play With Dead Things,&quot; &quot;Burial Ground,&quot; &quot;Return of the Living Dead II,&quot; and even &quot;Zeder&quot; (the climax takes place in an abandoned prison). Is it a masterpiece of cinema? Certainly not, and perhaps my generous &quot;5&quot; rating is due to the fact that I watched the atrocious &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; earlier today. Still, it is a diverting item with OK makeup effects, a cheeky attitude, and a toe-tapping, synth-heavy theme song.",

They have never met each other because of the occupation of the area by Israel since 1967; when Mona moves to Syria, she will lose her undefined nationality and will never be allowed to return home. Mona&apos;s father Hammed (Makram J. Khoury) is a political activist pro-Syria that is on probation by the Israeli government. His older son Hatten (Eyad Sheety) married a Russian woman eight years ago and was banished from Majdal Shams by the religious leaders and his father. His brother Marwan (Ashraf Barhoum) is a wolf trader that lives in Italy. His sister Amal (Hiyan Abbass) has two teenager daughters and has the intention to join the university, but her marriage with Amin (Adnan Trabshi) is in crisis. When the family gathers for Mona&apos;s wedding, an insane bureaucracy jeopardizes the ceremony.\n\n&quot;The Syrian Bride&quot; is an impressive movie, especially considering the nationality of the Israeli director Eran Riklis. I had no idea that in the twenty-first century could exist a place where people has &quot;undefined nationality&quot;. The metaphoric situation of the Druze people, represented by the bride and her family, trapped in the non-sense bureaucracy, lack of interest from the governments in resolving the problem and having to face arrogant heartless authorities represented by the despicable chief of the Israeli police is amazing. The acting is top-notch, the plot is original and unique and I really loved this great movie. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Noiva Síria&quot; (&quot;The Syrian Bride&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I have to confess absolutely loving the first &apos;House&apos; film. Yes, the (now iconic) marketing poster of a decomposing severed hand ringing a doorbell may have been a tad misleading. You may think you were in for one scary experience when, in fact, you received one hell of a tongue-in-cheek black horror-comedy. The (inevitable) sequel was so-so, but by this third instalment, it had well and truly lost its way.\n\nWhere as the first two &apos;House&apos; films were both heavily linked to - surprise, surprise - a house, this film seems to forget why it&apos;s called what it is. In fact I believe in some territories when the film was released the &apos;House&apos; part of the title was completely dropped in favour of a more ambiguous &apos;The Horror Show&apos; title. I guess this tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the project, i.e. it&apos;s not really a sequel but more of a horror script that was sort of crow-barred in under the familiar (and therefore profitable) &apos;House&apos; brand in order to increase sales. But is it any good?\n\nUnfortunately, not really. Even by a stand-alone horror film it&apos;s a bit lame. However, that&apos;s not for the efforts of leading man Lance Henriksen, who does everything in his extensively-cool acting range to bring some drama to the proceedings. It&apos;s starts okay enough - Henriksen is a cop tortured by his previous experiences with a serial killer, only for said nasty to come back from the grave to haunt his family (in the house, in case you were wondering). Then it all kind of falls apart as the scares become fewer and further between and the plot descends into predictability. The serial killer is portrayed by (Bladerunner&apos;s) Brion James and he too does his best to add some terror with the limited script available to him. However, in the end, both main actors end up just chewing up the scenery in an attempt to try and elevate what is a particularly forgettable B-movie into something vaguely memorable.\n\nThere&apos;s some nice practical effects here and there and it&apos;s always nice to be reminded of a time before CGI gore ruled the horror scene. But, at the end of the day, it&apos;s not enough to save this film. I&apos;m a big fan of Lance Henriksen and watch most of his output, but even I would struggle to sit through this film again (I&apos;ve watched it twice - the first time over twenty years ago and completely forgotten it. Therefore I&apos;ve just seen it again and felt I better review it before everything about it escapes me again). The first &apos;House&apos; film is a classic. Just stick to that.",

      "reviewBody": "Neil Simon&apos;s 1978 film, California Suite, is four vignettes of couples descending upon Los Angeles at Oscar time: one couple (Maggie Smith and Michael Caine) for the Oscar ceremonies, two couples for vacation (Richard Pryor, Gloria Gifford, Bill Cosby, Sheila Frazer) one couple for a bar mitzvah (Walter Matthau and Elaine May), and one divorced couple (Alan Alda and Jane Fonda) to discuss their daughter.\n\nThe film is a mix of comedy, slapstick, and drama, with the Fonda-Alda segment witty but serious, the Matthau-May segment hilarious, the Cosby-Pryor segment slapstick, and the Smith-Caine segment a classic. Their conversation in the hotel suite before the Oscar ceremony is one of the best acted, best written scenes ever written. &quot;I&apos;m a dark horse,&quot; Smith says of her Oscar nomination, entering the room in a gown. &quot;They must have seen the dress,&quot; Caine concludes. This is probably the most fully fleshed-out story, with the truth behind their marriage emerging as Smith descends into drunkenness later on. That and the Matthau-May vignettes are the best, with the Alda-Fonda scene coming off as somewhat dated today. The weakest is the Pryor-Crosby.\n\nEntertaining - if you don&apos;t feel like watching the whole thing, just watch the Caine-Smith and Matthau-May.\n\nBill Cosby and Richard Pryor try their best as doctor friends who are having an awful time on their vacation with their wives. It&apos;s just not that funny, despite them both being extremely likable.\n\nAlan Alda and Jane Fonda do well in their dramatic story of separated couple meeting after nine years to discuss their child. Their segment is too short to really have an impact, might have worked well as a feature film. It&apos;s not all that involving.\n\nMichael Caine and Maggie Smith are both excellent in their little segment, with Smith portraying an actress who&apos;s up for the academy award. Caine plays her show off gay husband. The two stars really shine in an otherwise average story, not all that interesting.",

There was very little use of music also, which made the majority of the movie feel empty in a way. I think that it perfectly paralleled Ariel&apos;s feelings toward his estranged father. He felt a lot of animosity toward his father because it seemed like he left Ariel and his mother without a valid reason. Since Ariel was the main character in this film, it caused the viewers to take his side, and sympathize with him. That is why I found myself feeling hatred toward his father as well, and when he appeared at the race, I felt that something terrible was going to happen since I viewed him as a bad guy. This opinion of him was formed too prematurely, and at the end when I discovered the truth about Ariel&apos;s father, I felt remorseful. It is definitely important to keep an open mind when you are watching the movie, especially for the first time."

      "reviewBody": "Ray Bradbury and the makers of this film ventured into foreign territory for the Disney Studios, they went to explore the dark side of humanity and came back with the honest truth that much of humanity is plagued and there are shiny bright spots within.  This film explores the petty desires of everyday people, their eagerness to give what is really important in life up for things like vanity, lust, money, etc...  The story centers around two small boys, Will and Jim, and how their lives change and the townfolk around them when a carnival comes to town.  The atmosphere is chilling to say the least. It is easily the darkest of any Disney film(even considering the outstanding The Hunchback of Notre Dame).  It uses dark landscapes, eerie haunting music, and bleak characterizations to perfection.  The acting is good all around with two standouts.  Jason Robards plays Will&apos;s father, and is the epitome of flawed goodness.  He suffers for his goodness but has strength of heart.  Robards is wonderful, and I felt myself wishing this man had been my father(or my father more like him).  For an actor to be able to create that appeal is a true feat of integrity of performance.  On the other side, in a simply sinister portrayal of evil incarnate is the performance of Jonathan Pryce, an overlooked and underappreciated English actor.  His performance is scary, and he chews up every and each scene he is in.  The script by Bradbury himself, based on his novel, is full of rich texture and subtlety.  As with just about every film adaptation, the film is not the book...but then if you wanted that you only have to sit down and read...one page at a time."

Play down the sci-fi elements and up the arty to farty levels and you can pretty much guess how this following plot is represented:\n\nA man dreams he&apos;s shot in a marketplace and wakes up in bed on 32nd July. He is interviewed as he walks to work and interviews people as part of his job. Every night he can&apos;t get it up for his wife and then he dreams he&apos;s shot in a marketplace, leading him to wake up on 32nd July, get interviewed on the way to work, then interview people blah blah blah.\n\nWhere&apos;s the eggs that make people explode? Where&apos;s Lou Ferringo throwing a bear into space? Where&apos;s David Hasselhof wearing mascara and fighting stop-motion robots? Where&apos;s that bit from Demons Six where the entire cast dies halfway through the film? What about Hercules turning into Godzilla and fighting King Kong in space? Come on Luigi, think outside of the box.\n\nLuigi Cozzi would go on to make some of my favourite Italian genre films but here thing were almost reminding me of Jess Franco&apos;s Succubus. That&apos;s not a good thing. Cozzi&apos;s overactive imagination is still here, but the material completely lost me here. Next!",

      "reviewBody": "New York 1953.  Bill Lee is a bug exterminator who follows his wife down the road of using the bug powder as a hallucinatory drug.  When he is picked up by the police for suspected drug use he is left in the cell with a large bug that tells him that he is on a mission and must watch his wife.  When he accidentally kills his wife he flees to Interzone to prepare his report, increasingly losing his grip on what is real and what is not.\n\nI have seen this movie several times and am always taken in by it.  In terms of narrative it is not the strongest film you&apos;ll ever see.  In all honesty the plot is pretty thin and the film is best seen as a journey into destruction with Lee&apos;s drug addled writer slowly but surely losing grip on reality with every passing moment.  The journey is reasonably interesting, even if it doesn&apos;t have enough pace to really be fascinating.  What does hold the attention is the imagination of the film and it&apos;s ability to put onscreen a decent representation of Lee&apos;s hallucinations.\n\nThe effects are very good but it is their use that is better.  While it does have a certain amount of gore, the creatures and hallucinations are actual characters (creepy characters at that) that are used well within the story, rather than just being effects or gore.  The cast can&apos;t all say that and some of them are distinctly average at times.  Weller is as good as ever in a dead eyed performance that gives way to madness and fear at times. Davis is every bit as good, delivering two roles and be riveting in both.  Holm is OK and it&apos;s not his fault that I couldn&apos;t get Bilbo out of my mind!  Sands and Schneider don&apos;t have enough to do but are interesting faces.\n\nCronenberg is the perfect choice for director, but it is good that he holds back from the full on gore or body horror, call it what you will.  He uses a measured camera to film the hallucinations rather than using swinging `crazy&apos; angles to portray mental state - that is a lazy technique.  Here Cronenberg (and Weller&apos;s blank face) calmly and methodically fall into despair and it is good to watch.\n\nOverall, this is not a perfect film - it is slow and the narrative doesn&apos;t totally grip, however it manages to make a good fist out of filming a descent into a hallucinatory nightmare.  Worth seeing it once, but I can&apos;t imagine that the word `enjoyable&apos; would really ever apply to this film."

      "reviewBody": "Reversal of Fortune sent more chills down my spine than any horror movie. The story once more proves why real murder cases are so interesting: It is not a (supposed) criminal act or the lawsuit that fascinates but the detailed insight into human relations and behavior patterns which a investigation of the circumstances allows. Barbet Schroeder, certainly a brilliant observer, seems to share this view and created a wonderfully stylized, finely crafted, superbly cast movie around the Claus von Bülow trial.\n\nFotography, lighting and the set design really are of the first order. The main &quot;stage&quot; of the film is a big mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. I don&apos;t know how much of the movie was shot on location - in any case the place reminded me strongly of Manderly, the country home in Alfred Hitchcocks &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Somehow Sunny von Bülow, she is seen lying in her state of eternal coma and heard recounting events and musing about them in a voice over, is the mythical Rebecca Hinrich become flesh and blood in the most gruesome way imaginable.\n\nThe home of the von Bülows has the feel of a funeral parlor. The most important room is Sunny von Bülow&apos;s private bathroom, the door of which is flanked by two porcelain busts on high pedestals, like some gate of doom. Despite the warm colors, the opulent furniture, the glossy surfaces (they seem to come out directly of an old fashioned women&apos;s magazine), it is deadly cold in the world of the von Bülows. The emotional detachment of the whole family - apparently even the children - is truly horrific. The most hilarious scene is ever expressionless Claus von Bülow joining his wife in the marital bed with a thick sweater, a scarf and a woolen cap (Sunny von Bülows insists on keeping the window open on principle even in freezing temperatures). He turns away from his wife and, as the last act before turning off the light, puts his earplugs in. \n\nOh, and then there is law professor Dershowitz and his team. What has he got to do with this movie? Very little, I should say. The bubbly intellectualistic crowd occasionally allow the viewers to relax a little, but their sporadic intrusions into the &quot;circle&quot; of the von Bulows in no way counterbalance the weight and the frigid opulence that comes to dominate Reversal of Fortune. And that&apos;s just fine with me  as far as cinematic art is concerned."

      "reviewBody": "The best way to watch this movie is ignorantly. Go to Netflix now, put the movie at the top of your queue and watch it when it arrives. Read about it later. If you enjoy sci-fi classics like &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and &quot;Them!&quot;; if you love the Britishness of the Hammer horror pictures; if you prefer a well-told story, rich suspense, sympathetic characters and black-and-white photography to special effects, color and gore, you will want to see this film right away.\n\nThe movie begins in Midwich. We meet the scientist Gordon Zellaby having a telephone conversation. Mid-sentence he passes out. At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. When the army gets involved, we discover this force has precise boundaries. One soldier, after being lassoed around the waist, walks past the boundary, loses consciousness and immediately revives when his fellows pull him out of the infected area. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant.\n\nWatching this science-fiction movie paired with almost any modern one demonstrates how storytelling has devolved as special effects have advanced. It also demonstrates how one simple effect can be more memorable than a thousand complex ones. I happened to see this just before watching &quot;The Forgotten&quot; (2005), a stupid movie with expensive effects; but not of those expensive effects is as potent as this movie&apos;s signature device. When the blonde-haired Midwich children wreak psychic havoc, the picture freezes and their eyes glow. That inexpensive trick shot is worth the millions blown on &quot;The Forgotten.&quot;\n\nAnother nice effect: George Sanders. He plays the hero, Gordon Zellaby, a scientist who becomes a dubious father to one of the Midwich freaks. Sanders plays rogues in almost every other movie, but here he is sweet-natured and convincingly so; he betrays not a shadow of his usual cynicism. Were this his only surviving film, one would think he was born to play kindly old men. The excellent cast has one other outstanding performance by Martin Stephens, who plays Sanders&apos;s cold-hearted &quot;son.&quot; Would you be surprised to learn his voice was dubbed by a female actress specializing in children? I was surprised to learn it wasn&apos;t. That is the boy&apos;s own eerily precise diction.\n\nSpecial praise must also go to the director and photographer, Wolf Rilla and Geoffrey Faithful, who give the movie the detached air of a documentary. The script, credited to Stirling Silliphant, George Barclay and Rilla, is an excellent adaptation of a fine book, &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; by John Beynon Harris. Fans of this movie will want to read it. The book has many enjoyable details that were necessarily and wisely cut from the adaptation. To note one difference, the children in the movie are psychically linked: what one knows they all know. But in the book, the boys are psychically linked with the boys, the girls with the girls; but there is little or no link between the two sexes. The reasons for this are fascinating.\n\nI haven&apos;t seen the John Carpenter remake, and I don&apos;t want to. What would the ideal remake of this film look like? It would look like the original: black-and-white, set in the late fifties, cast with Brits and scripted with the same restraint. Maybe modern resources could add a piquant touch or two; it would be amusing to see all those sheep fall asleep in the opening scene. Oh, and that awful model shot of the school could be replaced. Otherwise, we have the film we want, so why remake it?"

      "reviewBody": "Sybil Seely, Marceline Day, Brown Eyes: All of Buster Keaton&apos;s best on-screen partners were female. All but one. Snitz Edwards here plays Buster&apos;s faithful valet, a gnomish, gentle character whose eagerness to arrange whatever his master wants lands him in trouble.\n\nBuster is Alfred Butler, rich and so passive he lets Snitz tap the ash off his cigarette. While on a camping trip, he meets a girl (Sally O&apos;Neil) who strikes his fancy. Her father and brother disapprove of her going off with a &quot;jellyfish.&quot; Snitz to the rescue: He tells them this is the same &quot;Battling Butler&quot; who just won the lightweight boxing crown. Alas, the ruse works too well.\n\nYou can argue that Snitz plays the title character here as much as Buster or Francis McDonald, who plays the boxer Butler. Whether laying out a ridiculously ornate table at Buster&apos;s camp site or laboring to keep up with his boss during an arduous run through the mud, there&apos;s no give-up in the guy.\n\n&quot;I&apos;d like to marry that pretty little mountain girl&quot; Buster says.\n\n&quot;Shall I arrange it?&quot; Snitz answers. Buster nods, setting the plot in motion.\n\nLike a lot of silent comedies, this is a film of pieces. The first half, of Buster and Snitz roughing it in the outdoors, could be a clever short all by itself. Buster&apos;s idea of duck-hunting is to row up to one wading in the water, and then lean out of the boat to point a shotgun at it at point-blank range. You expect him to fire and roll off from the gun&apos;s kickback, so naturally that&apos;s the one thing that doesn&apos;t happen.\n\nThe transition to the boxing comedy is well done, helped along by Snitz, McDonald, and O&apos;Neil, really a cutie with her Zooey Deschanel eyes. It&apos;s O&apos;Neil&apos;s desperate desire to see her man in the ring duking it out that forces Buster and Snitz to scramble in the last half-hour or so, coming up with all sorts of ruses. The comedy wears a bit thin at times with some protracted workout scenes in the boxing ring, yet Buster goes a long way to selling them with his amazingly elastic physicality.\n\nBuster doesn&apos;t wear a porkpie in this film, and his pampered lifestyle distances you a bit more than his inexpressiveness usually did, but he has that dogged quality of classic Keaton heroes. He may not be the champion boxer his girl thinks he is, but he&apos;ll not give her up without a fight. &quot;I&apos;m going back and tell her the truth,&quot; he tells Snitz. &quot;I&apos;d rather lose her that way.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s funny how &quot;Battling Butler&quot; doesn&apos;t really engage a lot of Keaton fans. Perhaps there&apos;s some resentment there because it was a hit for Buster right before &quot;The General&quot; flopped. Taken on its own merits, &quot;Battling Butler&quot; is a clever and engaging comedy with a likeably different lead role for Buster and a surprising double-twist ending, in which Buster (and the audience) have the wool lifted from their eyes one minute, only for Buster to do the same with us the next.\n\nMaybe &quot;Battling Butler&quot; isn&apos;t as inventive as Keaton fans are used to, but it has its share of arresting visuals and a solid mix of varied comedic moments that still connect. Plus it works as a story all the way through. Finally there&apos;s the winning chemistry of Buster and Snitz, The Great Stoneface and The Great Cragface.",

      "reviewBody": "Bud and Lou are two down and out adventurers in Egypt struggling to get some quick cash for a trip back home. They learn that a certain Dr. Zoomer has recently unearthed the mummy known as Klaris, &quot;the Prince of Evil&quot;, and requires two good men to help him transport it back to the states. But before they can volunteer their services, Zoomer is murdered by two devoted followers of Klaris. Abbott and Costello then become absorbed in a three-way tug of war to secure the mummy and possess a sacred medallion which could lead to the discovery of the tomb of Princess Ara and her treasure in the bargain. Also competing for the prize is the dangerous Madame Rontru (played by sultry Marie Windsor) and her two henchmen (one played by Michael Ansara). But the Cult of Klaris (headed by Richard Deacon, who seems bland and awkward in this role) is determined to intervene and reclaim the mummy and the medallion of Princess Ara for themselves and preserve the legend.\n\nThis was the next-to-final film for the aging Abbott and Costello, but yet it works decently considering this late period. The crazy plot helps to create some humorous shenanigans including a classic routine where Lou accidentally eats the sacred medallion hidden inside his hamburger, and another where he gets frustrated telling Abbott to &quot;take his pick&quot;, yet Bud keeps choosing to dig with a shovel. The murder of Dr. Zoomer and the attempt by the killers to hide the corpse allows Costello another chance to go through his &quot;disappearing bodies&quot; shtick, though it&apos;s better done here with less repetition than it was in ABBOTT &amp; COSTELLO MEET THE KILLER. Both comedians are in great form throughout this comedy, and they&apos;re given some funny lines steadily throughout the picture (BUD: &quot;How stupid can you get?&quot; LOU: &quot;How stupid do you want me to be&quot;?) \n\nFor monster movie fans, it&apos;s something of a letdown. The mummy Klaris (one wonders if this name was intentional or an error by the writers if they really meant him to be the same &quot;Kharis&quot; as in the 1940s mummy series) does not appear very often, and he&apos;s pretty poor looking; his bandaged carcass looks more like an over-sized pair of white pajamas, and his mushy face resembles a left-over egg roll. Klaris is played by Edwin Parker, a stuntman from back in the heyday of the classic Universal monster films who used to stand in as Frankenstein&apos;s monster, the Wolf Man and even &quot;Kharis&quot; himself. \n\n**1/2 out of ****",

I am from kerala and usually i don&apos;t like Telugu films except allu arjuns movies. I don&apos;t know Telugu language but even then also i really enjoyed a lot. Kudos to the team of this movie. And i am now a fan of ram charan teja.the start of the movie was surprising but after 10 minutes it changed to different. But the first 15 minutes seemed little bit boring to me. I mean very very little. the love scenes between ram and kajal was very beautiful. And i literally had goosebumps on the scene where teja chase the bus in a horse. Songs were good. The real excitement begins after the interval. From there the movie is like, like? i cant describe it in words. The 100 men fight scene was excellent though its inspired from 300 which is also my one of favourite movies. All in all this is something special!!!",

The weak point is the acting. And while you have to give the movie kudos for tackling some serious themes and especially being made in the then eastern part of Germany (with quite some serious trouble in the movie making process), it just doesn&apos;t make the cut.\n\nAt least in my book. At the Berlin Film Festival it seemed to strike some nerves, but then again, it might have been some political reason too (see &quot;West vs. East Germany&quot; after the second world war). If you like slow pacing movies and don&apos;t mind the stiff acting, you will enjoy this movie though.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m giving this movie 5 out of 10 stars because there are a lot of very good things about it, even though the sum of it is absolutely terrible as an exercise of narrative. Ie: the story is very shabbily told, it is full of holes and ellipses, cheesy visual effects and silly scares, to name but a few big faults. It is, in fact, quite boring, and has near zero suspense. A lot of the acting is mediocre, and the directing work is full of errors typical for a first-timer (behind all of which, we can see very promising manners).\n\nThe germinal talent is one of the good points of the movie. There are more: for example, the leit motiv is very original, and would make for a *terrific* horror movie, should the script be rewritten and more put-together, and the movie remade (Hollywood could pull a very entertaining and appealing horror movie from this -good movies have been made with a much, much poorer starting material). The settings are also very spooky and well-chosen, and a great point was, in my opinion, the surreal quality introduced by the distortion of an early twentieth-century style, lighting, and technology in a twenty-first-century story and setting (for example, not once do we see a computer, a cell phone -or a phone, for that matter- or a digital device, or traces that such technology is even known to the characters in this microcosm). This creates a very disturbing yet very attractive effect. The surrealism is enhanced by other implausibilities that ask for sustained suspension of disbelief, but create, in exchange, a very appropriate atmosphere, akin to the German Expressionism -paid homage to by the authors in the names of the school that the movie is set in, or in those of some characters&apos;-, or the English Neo-Gothic.\n\nThe acting is also quite acceptable, in general -one thing that hurts the movie in this department is, I believe, the fact that it was shot in English, which was not the first language for many of the leading actors (Alberto Amarilla, Alex Angulo and Leticia Dolera are all Spanish), and it must have affected their acting. However, they all do a nice job and you can tell they really try to bring depth to their characters. In my opinion, Leticia Dolera succeeded at it especially.\n\nI will admit that the first time I watched this movie, I absolutely hated it. And although it isn&apos;t a favorite of mine now, or even a movie I want to keep watching, I am able to appreciate the many positive sides of it."

      "reviewBody": "Keep it in mind when you&apos;re watching this, the main thing in this movie is all about the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob. So, that&apos;s already eaten much of the movie itself.\n\nFirst things first, &quot;Eclipse&quot; (in almost every scene) relates to the love triangle. Even the battle parts still have a connection between the love triangle. Everything (except scenes not in her perspective).\n\n&quot;Eclipse&quot; is also a kind of slow movie because of too many dramatic scenes which were pretty boring. Even though they had a brutal killing villain, tension wasn&apos;t even there as drama overthrew it on the screen.\n\nThere were some laughable moments too (and they were related to the love triangle). They were just not-so-funny moments but still can entertain you.\n\nAnother thing you have to remember watching this movie is to remember that &quot;Eclipse&quot; has tons of kissing scenes (and they are so long e.g. 10 minutes). It was so boring. It&apos;s just like watching some person watering the plants while whistling. And, when I saw it, I feel like it&apos;s going to be a very boring film which deserves a one-star rating.\n\nThe acting was bad. There were almost no emotions even for Bella. I say Robert Pattinson&apos;s acting on Edward was the worst of all. Bryce Dallas Howard on Victoria was not bad. Xavier Samuel on Riley was the best of all. But, the three main characters&apos; acting were almost emotionless. Of the three leads, Taylor Lautner was the best.\n\nThe action scenes were not satisfying. It was short and kind of brutal. Speaking of brutal, I say &quot;Eclipse&quot; has the deadliest, most brutal scenes in &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;.\n\nBy the way, a contributing factor to this movie is that it has many flashbacks or memories of the characters that also skip the fighting parts of it. The flashbacks were too long that it made me sleepy when I watched it.\n\nI&apos;m kind of shocked with the vampires in this movie. They look like crystals or something as there were scenes showing hands or heads decapitated and they look like shiny crystals.\n\n&quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; is another slow movie which always and always focuses on that love triangle. There were no really exciting moments in the movie and if they had shortened the kissing scenes, this film would have been shorter than two hours. I think this film just deserves a 5-star rating. But, believe it or not, it&apos;s currently the best Twilight film.",

      "reviewBody": "So many questions drifted through my head while watching &quot;Biohazard: The Alien Force&quot;. Why is an alien force referenced in the title of the film, yet no aliens appear in this movie? Why does Steve Zurk, playing the protagonist Mike Reardon, look disconcertingly like David Hasslehoff&apos;s brother?  Who dressed him? Why does the bed of a truck burst into flames after the vehicle bumps into a tree? Why does a rocket not markedly damage a car after a direct hit?  Why do none of the characters in the movie seem to have any peripheral vision? Who created the titles and special effects, and why they ever employed to begin with? Lastly, how could this movie&apos;s production have concluded without the filmmakers hiding in exile?\n\nThis is such a sublimely awful movie it&apos;s hard to describe. There are far too many moments of unintended hilarity to describe in this short passage. Suffice to say, this film gets more laughs than just about any comedy out there you could find.  I heartily recommend this film to any fan of campy cinema.",

This aunt, however, seems to be more than she appears, as the group is slowly torn asunder (sometimes literally) by the house in a variety of ways.\n\nThis film is an embodiment of avant-garde when that was still a new thing. This film reminds me a lot of Jean Luc-Godards &quot;The Weekend&quot; in its experimental and non-linear cinematography. This film is wacky, with each shot almost bending ones mind. Film gradients, props, music, effects and so on are bombarding the viewer constantly, and make even the mundane seem incredible. The story here is mundane. A group of students go to a house and are accosted by the possessed abode, as the aunt turns out to be a witch. The creative part here is what happens visually. The characters were fun. Each one is a literal representation of a specific idea or thing. Nicknames like Gorgeous, Fantasy, Kung-Fu and so on abound, with each nickname being a representation of the person in question. These traits come back to bite them (sometimes literally). Piano&apos;s chow down on fingers, mattresses attack, mirrors possess, and much more. At one point, a man is turned into a pile of banana&apos;s!\n\nThis film is wacky in many ways. It possesses a wonderful style, contagious charm, and many fun and interesting elements. It is not pure horror, certainly coming through as a comedy. I had a brilliant time with this film, and look forward to watching this film again soon. What a ride! Highly recommended for those looking for something interesting and weird.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; has been called the gangster movie of the New Deal. Previously, with such early-30s films as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;Public Enemy,&quot; gangster films at their best were engrossing actioners with charismatic but undeniably evil central figures. &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces,&quot; released in 1938, presents a more nuanced view of what makes the modern bad man tick. Is it a bad heart? Or is society to blame?\n\nCagney is undeniably great in the role that made him a legend. His practiced patter never wears thin, and his screen presence is electric throughout. (Especially at the end, and I don&apos;t mean that as a pun.) But the screenwriters never let us forget the good in the man. We see him come up against more ruthless elements of the underworld, people like Bogart (a real baddie here) who have no compunction about killing a man if it means avoiding payment of a heavy debt. We see him interact with a group of starry-eyed juveniles (The Dead End Kids) whose nickel-and-dime antics fill him with a poignant but heartily-amusing nostalgia. And we see him try to do right by his former partner in crime, now a priest played by Hugh O&apos;Brien.\n\nBut Cagney is trapped by the circumstances of his life. He can&apos;t walk away from a life of crime, which has made him what he is and gives him the only life satisfaction he knows. He&apos;s correctly on guard for double-crossers at every turn. When cornered, his cheery face becomes bug-eyed and menacing. We know he&apos;s bad, but we like him, and that puts us in the company of the audience-surrougate figure, Father Connolly.\n\nDirector Curtiz was an auteur before his time, filling his canvas with images of downtrodden street life. This isn&apos;t for mere effect, but to show us why Rocky is what he is and how come he finds little hope for his redemption. There are souls to be saved in this picture, but for Father Connolly, they are Laurie and the boys. He must take on his childhood chum, the same kid who saved Connolly from the perils of the Mean Streets and allowed him to become what he was.\n\nIt is a choice between God and friendship, and while Connolly has little doubt which way to go, the audience may not be with him all the way. The ending points up this spiritual conflict in some of the most harrowing terms ever brought to screen at that time. When you really think about what&apos;s going on behind Connolly&apos;s face in that final scene, it&apos;s a real tear-inducer.\n\nWas Rocky&apos;s last scene a put-up job? I guess it can be argued back and forth, but the real question of value is whether, if it was faked, was it enough to perform a miracle even the good Father Connolly wouldn&apos;t have quite believed in, the salvation of Rocky. The last image of the boys, desolately accepting the news of their hero&apos;s fall, is at once triumphant and bittersweet. Nothing comes easy in this world of ours.\n\n&quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; may strike a falsely optimistic note to some, but it is optimism well-earned by the honesty of vision expressed. Add to that clever dialogue, great pacing, and one of cinema&apos;s keystone performances by Cagney, and you have a real keeper here.\n\nP.S. It also features one of the finest Cagney impersonations ever, by William Tracey as the young Rocky. Funny stuff.",

Now you might think that would mean he would end up as an amoeba or a speck of nothing, but boy would you be wrong. Apparently, we are descended from lizards, and I know this because the scientist in question first begins to simply decay, then makes a brief appearance as a dinosaur (I kid you not) and ends up as a little lizard in a jar.\n\nThis movie isn&apos;t even in the remotest realm of good, but it&apos;s actually not horribly terrible either, at least not until its last 20 minutes or so. Those turn into a seemingly endless chase scene involving a little boy and his mother trying to get away from the monstrous scientist. But you have to stay with it to see the climactic howler of a scene in which a man in a felt dinosaur costume tries to horrify us with what the scientist has become. It seriously looks like something that would be worn at a child&apos;s birthday party -- if it were purple, it would look like Barney.\n\nWhere did movies like this ever even play? \n\nGrade: D+",

      "reviewBody": "Poor Brandon Routh. After snagging the iconic role as the Man of Steel, it&apos;s a little bit unfortunate that Bryan Singer&apos;s Superman Returns fell short of the studio&apos;s expectations, and he no longer plays a part in any future installments, starting with Zack Snyder&apos;s reboot. No matter, after all with that build and chiselled good looks, one can waltz into another superhero franchise, isn&apos;t it?\n\nUnfortunately, Dylan Dog is an Americanized version of the Italian horror graphic novel character, and as far as adaptations of comics from another culture goes, this one hits the mark in expectations, where the source material got extremely dumbed down, its unique selling points dissolved into mediocrity and bastardized. Save for the trademarked coat and red shirt, director Kevin Munroe&apos;s vision of this character became somewhat of a generic monster hunter type of film, though a plus point would be its treatment and narrative style in full detective noir, with Routh&apos;s Dylan Dog being reluctantly pulled from retirement by his client Elizabeth (Anita Briem) to investigate the death of her father, as well as that of his assistant Marcus (Sam Huntington).\n\nThis investigative trip of course introduces the audience unfamiliar with the Dylan Dog mythos that the undead, from vampires to werewolves to zombies, all have hidden human identities and walk the Earth quite undetected, with a truce in place to keep the peace and Dylan being the only trusted human for the monsters to go to when someone crosses the line or breaks the peace. There&apos;s a little backstory here on Dylan&apos;s origins and the reasons behind his forced retirement, but nothing truly to wow or build upon any depth to the character, which is potential that&apos;s wasted in giving Dylan more meat in background, becoming instead just another human detective on his rounds.\n\nThe thrill factor of course is the make up and effects in having the monsters look their nasty part, although they aren&apos;t something that hasn&apos;t been seen before on screen. Action sequences are ho-hum, with the nagging feeling that the story by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer can&apos;t quite decide how to empower Dylan, making him become as powerful as Routh&apos;s previous comic book outing in at least the indestructibility factor, while equipped with some funky weapons that we should see more of. And the trailer while pretty tacky, actually summed up the entire plot, having reveal too much and letting out that the filmmakers aren&apos;t quite confident with their end product, and the marketers a little bit clueless on how to sell this film, hence its verbosity.\n\nWhile Brandon Routh has a limited acting range, his physique actually suited him fine here and basically that was all that mattered, since you aren&apos;t going to remember much about his rather bland performance. Perhaps it&apos;s also because Sam Huntington, his co-star from Superman Returns as well as he played Jimmy Olsen then, scored much of the flak in this film being the very whiny assistant, whose wisecracks and constant shouting get onto your nerves, and you wonder when his character could shut up if at all for five minutes. The Marcus character doesn&apos;t exist in the books simply because of a potential copyright tussle if what was deemed as a Grucho Marx lookalike got interpreted, but this modern replacement was as unfunny as he was unnecessary in a lot of ways.\n\nDon&apos;t expect this monster squad outing to be too cerebral. It&apos;s filled with corny one liners involving various body parts, and in essence is a poor man&apos;s cousin to Men in Black, replacing aliens in our midst with that of monsters roaming around. If only it had stuck more faithfully to its source, then it could have been something quite unique.",

While both parts work, I preferred the comedy over the romance. Billy Crystal has some good one-liners and John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Christopher Walken all seem to be having fun as they satirize Hollywood. Even Larry King joins in the fun. However Cusack seems visibly disinterested in his romantic role opposite Julia Roberts. Roberts can perform this role in her sleep. The film is watchable though it would have been even better as a stand alone satire.\n\nOverall 7/10"

Once again, Yoram Globus is back clawing his way back to his original fervid 1980&apos;s stature that made (Up)Chuck Norris what he is today by trying to cash in on the direct-to-DVD movie serial craze of the 21st Century! So what if cousin Menahem isn&apos;t on for the ride? So, like the action fan girl shmuck I am, I decided to skip Delta Force II since I think Billy Drago&apos;s crowning moment was in The Untouchables playing the sadistic cool cat Frank Nitti brandishing a nickel-plated pistol (by the by I saw it on Ebay for around $400), but those white suits Armani had him in made him look like the lovechild of Ed Gein and Cab Calloway. But it looks like once again, video covers are deceptive (great marketing strategies BTW) and you think well that Brit (took his cockney accent for Aussie) has some impressive biceps, Norris&apos; son MIGHT have picked up a few pointers from dad, and Mitchum&apos;s grandkid looks like someone I could bring home to mom, and after 90-odd minutes you&apos;re left wondering why the f*ck I wasted my $3.50 on this when I could have had some Haagen-Dazs. Not even John Rys-Davies was able to woo me to say this bit of drek was mediocre! The characters were as developed as paper dolls (won&apos;t even get into the Greek actress playing the medic), the script was probably thought up after somebody finished reading Bravo Two Zero, and it makes you wonder if this is Globus&apos; pathetic hackney attempt to bridge the gap between Arabs and Israelis and lure Hollywood to the hellish Mid East. Nearly ALL the Arabs were portrayed by Jewish people (my BF is Jewish so I know what I&apos;m talking about). Also, you have think about these actors, I mean they must be destitute or something to take lead roles in movies like the DF and U.S. SEALs series. Or Bentley and Mike&apos;s acting attempts are that sincere w/o having to lean on their famous father and grandfather. As for our leading man, I know he&apos;s got a wife and 5 kids, but don&apos;t all California martial-arts champs open up their own dojo chains and get hired by the studios to choreograph stunt sequences? All I can say is the nuclear missile looked like the cardboard boxes it was built from, the pyrotechnics were borderline, the CGI was something a 12-year-old can put together on a PC, and the most expensive thing in the whole production had to be John Rys-Davies chess set. Also, I&apos;m confused was this action or comedy? Because the post-battle bios made little sense to me."

Very sad and very deep and very simple film. Just a day of a few people in their late youth, in a Belgrade suburb of tower blocks, illustrates the throes of an entire generation caught in the postcommunist period (or shall I say, the postcommunist abyss). \n\nLeaving everything behind and starting a new life somewhere else is not as easy as we know it from the movies. Staying, on the other hand, is a limbo. But when your heart is so kind, is ever a new beginning possible?\n\n&apos;Besa me mucho&apos; runs a hundred times, it is the only soundtrack. The grey concrete blocks are unexpectedly beautiful, it is the only landscape. The petty post-communist gangsters are confusingly human and sympathetic, it is the main characters.\n\nStefan Arsenijevic fairly got the director&apos;s award of the 2008 Sofia Film Festival &apos;for the humanity and lyricism of his style&apos;. The other Serbian entry, &apos;Hadersfild&apos;, was also a very powerful film.",

Compared to action movies made in US, this one is a gem. If they made more titles like this one than I would be in heaven. Alan Tang really does a good job as the father who tries to make a mends with his daughter. Simon Yam is the typical bad guy in these kind of movies,but still he delivers style to his acting. Andy Lau plays Alan&apos;s sidekick with flair. RA made in the eighties certainly is still enjoyable now in 2012. Watch it!",

But, don&apos;t expect a realistic post-cold-war scenario.  Would two colonels with so many years invested in their careers risk it all just to express personal dislikes of each other? And would the general pussyfoot around so long with an American colonel who&apos;s actions could at any time escalate them into a major confrontation? I think not!!!  But just watch the movie and you might disagree with this, since all you think about at the time is &quot;will World War III start over a snowball fight?&quot;.",

Consider: A powerful figure roaming around doing good deeds, speaking in a puzzling language that only believers understand, attended to by his apostles, befriending prostitutes. Suffering from inner demons he retreats to the wilderness (the farm) and experiences an epiphany through the physical manifestation of his creators, going back and finally confronting and conquering the demons. (Dirty D = Dirty Devil)Along the way he even awakens the dead (the knife wielder at the club), banishes a horde of false prophets (all the fake Pooties), and can bring people to rapture through sheer silence alone. Whew. Heady stuff. Sa Da Tay!",

Through a repression, changing values, and rapid changing scenery, he sticks out like a sore thumb with his family, his friends, and people. He then is on a destination to Chicago to stay with his daughter, but after he&apos;s thrown off a plane, he travels on a bus, but when his cat won&apos;t go to the bathroom, he&apos;s thrown off the bus and is stranded and decides to drive. On the way to Chicago he has an adventure meeting different people, people that are symbols of the changing society and he learns to cope with them and tries to adapt, yet can&apos;t find his place in society. Harry must find a place in the world and he intends to find one. This is a heartbreaking, poignant and engrossing view into a man&apos;s life in old age. Art Carney gives an excellent performance of a man conflicted with changing society, and a man who must force himself to adapt whether he likes it or not. Will he ever find his place in the world? You have to watch to see.\n\n*** out of **** stars.",

But the reason why I love this movie is because of the way we see Vada Sultenfuss has changed over the course of a few years. I loved seeing the sweet, innocent Vada become more of an adult &amp; still remain likeable as a character. I also love Austin O&apos;Brien in this movie; to date, he has not been in anything memorable, but I think the role of Nick was suited for him. I do find the relationship they have somewhat disenchanting, but it was what I was waiting for the whole movie. I think the plot was an interesting one, and Maggie Muldovan made this movie. It is, as another reviewer remarked, worth it to watch the movie countless times just to hear her sing &quot;Smile.&quot; I love all of this movie, though, so I would advise seeing it."

      "reviewBody": "Suspense fans tired of low-brow, explicit exploitation movies may want to check out &quot;The Silence,&quot; an absorbing German thriller that delivers the suspense without sacrificing the drama. At a confident and steady pace, the script allows the characters to develop powerful, yet subtle performances.\n\nOn July 8th, 1986, a eleven year old girl Pia (Helene Doppler) is raped and murdered by Peer (Ulrich Thomsen) while a second man, Timo (Wotan Wilke Möhring), watches with equal parts of disgust and arousal. The two dispose of the body and return home, but while Peer began to destroy any potential evidence, Timo has already packed and boarded a bus out of town. 23 years later, to the very day, another young girl goes missing with only her bike and bag left behind at the very spot where Pia was abducted years ago. Writer/director Baran bo Odar&apos;s film, &quot;The Silence,&quot; follows the distraught families, the police, and the two men behind the original unsolved case in a story that explores grief and guilt, obsession and duty.\n\nIt&apos;s a well-acted, emotion-charged drama whose murder mystery is almost secondary to the human element. It&apos;s a complex examination of the many facets of humanity in which even those who commit the most heinous acts aren&apos;t complete monsters. The film is about tragedy and the everlasting impact on those involved, from the victims to the perpetrators. \n\nDirector Baran bo Odar maintains a sense of morbid fascination in a film that in someone else&apos;s hands might become overwhelmingly unpleasant. Despite its nearly two-hour running time, it never becomes dull or depressing, thanks in part to large cast of characters whose nuanced portrayals strike a chord of truth -- terrifyingly so for any parent. Even though the conclusion isn&apos;t exactly overpowering, the journey is remarkably nuanced and compelling – and most certainly an uncomfortable one.",

      "reviewBody": "Pele (which means skin in Portuguese) is a movie about a young mulatto woman that in spite of being rich, beautiful and intelligent, feels discriminated because of the colour of her skin. The entire plot is in the early 70&apos;s, when Portugal had a dictatorial government, ultramarine territories and lots of racism in its society Issues like racism, female condition and the spoilt lives of the high-society are the main themes of this movie. \n\nOlga (Daniela Costa) is a rich young woman that is studying medicine and lives surrounded by wealth in a great house with a pool, family&apos;s driver, many employees She&apos;s living with the wife of her father, who raised her as her own child in spite of not being her real mother Her real mother was her father&apos;s mistress! He&apos;s still living in Angola (at this time an ultramarine Portuguese territory) where he met Olga&apos;s mother. After Olga was born, he sent her to Portugal and never saw her again But he will return and the relation between him and his daughter will not be easy \n\nThe film is a bit slow and the actors&apos; performance is not one of the best I have seen in Portuguese cinema for the last few years. In fact, I think Portuguese actors have improved their performances in the last years  we can see that in many recent Portuguese films  but, in my opinion, is not the case of this one! However, globally, the movie is not so bad, because the plot is interesting and the original idea too.",

      "reviewBody": "Guido Contini, a famous Italian director, is struggling with his next big film. He has no script and no inspiration, but everyone is counting on him. He tries to juggle both his new film, his wife, his mistress, his producer and his muse. Oh yeah, he also talks to his dead mother. \n\nNine is an ambitious film, I&apos;ll give it that. Rob Marshall, the director of the Best Picture winner Chicago serves up a mix bag with Nine. The film feels like Marshall is trying to rekindle the magic he had with Chicago, he comes up short, specifically with the musical numbers. For everything that I liked about it, there were two things I didn&apos;t. Nine needs to be more focused and shorter for it to be a film I would recommend. \n\nThe film is about film-making, yet the way Marshall presents the film to us is in the style of a stage play. Everything from the set-pieces to lighting screams stage play. It was an interesting touch, but felt out of place because it dealt with the art of film-making so much. The musical numbers, all uninspiring and rather boring, even attest to this. With the exception of Fergie, who gives us the best song and dance number that uses sand in a creative way, all the other numbers are generic and rather &apos;not good&apos;. When you have a Grammy winner singing a song and then have Kate Hudson sing one, there is a difference, and it is more noticeable than the filmmakers might have wanted.\n\nNine has a great cast, most of them are Oscar winners too. Daniel Day Lewis, with an amazing Italian accent, is the obvious stand out. He plays sexy and stressed all in one look. Penelope Cruz is the mistress, who has the sexiest scene of this movie, her career and this year. Her work in this film is pretty basic, the other lover who wants to be the one loved. With the exception of DDL, the only other actor that is given any kind of emotional depth is Marion Cotillard. She has to go through the realization that her husband is cheating on her and make the choice to stay or leave. Everyone else is pretty much there to fill up time and sing their one song. Judie Dench is the fashion designer and she plays a motherly figure, whereas Sophia Loren plays his actual mother, well his dead mother, but he still sees and talks to her. Fergie has her one scene in which she steals the show with her tune and then Nicole Kidman turns up at the end and makes you wince with her accent. Don&apos;t get me started on Kate Hudson.\n\nThe problem is that these are good actors, with just no material to work with. Daniel Day Lewis is great, but he&apos;s a hard character to connect with, he&apos;s sleeping around with a lot of women, it feels like half the cast. Emotional scenes don&apos;t play out as well as they should and the film drags itself to the finish line near the end. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner, but it kept going. \n\nOn the plus side, the choreography is great and the cinematography really grabs you, even if it is a little misplace with it&apos;s stage feel. The film is well put together and the editing is well done. It weaves it&apos;s story in and out of timelines from Guido&apos;s life, during the musical numbers. The film isn&apos;t bad, but it didn&apos;t do anything for me either. Leaving a musical not tapping your toes or even remembering the tunes may be a bad sign. I liked it enough to give it a good rating, the cast and style are good enough for me to do so, but everything else makes me lean on the side of telling you to rent this. It&apos;s well made, but has no real heart and the film is a little on the long side, you may be checking your watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Francis Veber hasn&apos;t only written and directed for himself, he has also penned scenarios for the others. Thus, he well served Edouard Molinaro for &quot;l&apos;Emmerdeur&quot; (1972), Pierre Granier-Deferre with &quot;Adieu Poulet&quot; (1975) and Jean-Jacques Annaud with this &quot;Coup De Tête&quot;. Shot before more ambitious plans would come to his mind (&quot;le Nom De la Rose&quot;, 1986 or &quot;l&apos;Ours&quot;, 1988), this film ferociously demystifies football and as it&apos;s a very popular game in France, it was a refreshing, necessary gesture even if the film didn&apos;t do very well at the French box-office for evident reasons: it lingered on the other side of the picture.\n\nFrom the outset with the choice of the scenery (the film was shot in Auxerre, a famous town for its football team) the first steps of the plot and the role of the characters, the authors&apos; intentions are clear: to seal an alliance between entertainment and onslaught. This is what underpins the film. Through François Perrin&apos;s (Patrick Deweare) fall and rise, Annaud and Veber vent their spleens on the unscrupulous leaders of the football club and the shameless actions or schemings they adopt to preserve their interests or their players&apos;. Violence, bribery, blackmail and the manipulative power they exert towards the players, the supporters even the population make the object of a specific, eloquent demonstration to amount to a simple, efficient denunciation. And when Stéphanie reveals what lies beneath the false rape accusation that hangs over Perrin, the attack is doubly intense. The plot deftly incorporates these doubtful actions and is helped by a laid-back Patrick Deweare who brews revenge in his glory hour. Perhaps Veber and Annaud should have more insisted on his bad temper.\n\nAnother tawdry aspect of football will be explored by Jean-Pierre Mocky in his &quot;a Mort l&apos;Arbitre!&quot; (1984): blind fanaticism that can grab rabid supporters and lead them to murder.",

      "reviewBody": "Thought-reader Joseph (Sebastian Saville) is undergoing a new procedure which mixes computer analysis, brain monitoring, and psychotherapy. It takes him deep within into his soul and causes him to reflect on his past, present and future. These thoughts are seen as snippets of footage on grainy surveillance-type video, newsreels that reveal Joseph&apos;s inner psyche and memories, and some seemingly normal scenes played out in various scenarios. These are all accompanied by Joseph&apos;s poetic voice- over, Jane Arden&apos;s score, and the occasional question or reflections noted by the analyst Professor Zanof (also played by Saville).\n\nThis film will be hard to review as I just couldn&apos;t come to any clear conclusions on the film&apos;s point or themes. It is clear to see that Joseph is in fact not a very nice man, peddling drugs when he&apos;s not reading people&apos;s thoughts at card games. This is pretty much the only thing that made logical sense. It is, however, not a film to be watched and enjoyed, but a film to experience. After a while, I just rested my brain and simply watched what was happening in front of me. The film is dazzling, confusing, eerie, atmospheric, and occasionally actually gripping. Co-director Jane Arden is something of a cult national treasure, who dabbled in theatre and feminism in her somewhat diverse body of work, and she brings intelligence and artistic flair in which what could have been a pretty dull art project. Thankfully the film stays just on the right side of pretentious.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

After 5 minutes, we wait for the movie or documentary or whatever it is to start; but at 10 minutes we see there is no more than that.\n\nFunny montages of classic films, interrupted by images of Godard with many books behind him, to show that he is an intellectual. Complicated textures of sometimes superimposed images, sometimes in slow motion, and with background music by Beethoven, Bach, Mahler, Schubert...; all mixed with some politics, with archive images of the Romanovs, the corpse of Lenin, Hitler, bombings, concentration camps...\n\nThe voiceover repeats phrases such as: &quot;Cinema replaces reality&quot;; &quot;a world according to our desires&quot;; &quot;all the stories that there will be, that there would be, that there have been&quot;; &quot;you have to dream&quot;; &quot;darkness, oh my light!&quot;; &quot;the theater is something too well known, the cinema something too unknown... until now&quot;; &quot;only the hand that erases can write&quot;...; or so-called brainy untranslatable puns like: &quot;Is it that the u in produire prevents it from containing &quot;dire&quot;?&quot;\n\nWhat can we think of comments on the function of cinema in times of war such as: &quot;1939, 1940, 1941, betrayal of the radio, but the cinema keeps its word. Because from The Death of Siegfried, and M, the Vampire of Dusseldorf, to the Great Dictator and Lubitsch, the movies had already been made, right? A simple 35mm rectangle saves the honor of everything real.&quot; This is the intellectual rigor of the discourse...\n\nAnd at the same time, as it is supposed to talk about the many histories of cinema, telling us the obvious about Irvin Thalberg or Howard Hughes, the American film industry...\n\nSome reputable critic alludes to Joyce and his Finnegans Wake, something only justifiable if you haven&apos;t read Joyce at all..., here we enter into an often insipid game of free associations: a shot by Jean Renoir, followed by Impressionist paintings by his father and with the music of Puccini: that is the inventive level at which we are.\n\nInteresting for movie lovers, due to the potpourri of unforgettable images from so many wonderful films, used as a source of free associations following a speech without interest in itself.",

      "reviewBody": "Why the Nazis chose to spend a lot of money to make a film about the Titanic during the middle of WWII I&apos;ll never know. You can see that the real story of the ship is twisted into a propaganda piece that both extols German decency and decries the evils of a Capitalist society. It does this by creating some Germans and making them all nice folks--particularly the First Officer that tries very hard to do what is right even though Captain Smith and the nefarious forces of Capitalistic greed are risking the lives of everyone aboard! In the National Socialist Germany, the importance of individual profit and gain was publicly forbidden and America and Britain were seen as dominated by selfish self-interest. So the &quot;nice Germans&quot; are always mindful of the ultimate good and the rich Americans and Brits are the worse stereotypes of Capitalism. And so time and again, the First Officer is good and dutiful and tries his best to protect the ship and passengers while industrialists/speculators Ismay and Astor do everything purely for self-interest. All this was meant to convince Germans of the rightness of their political system, though the ugly truth was that many rich German industrialists became immensely wealthy thanks to German re-armament.\n\nDespite the obvious propaganda in the film, the movie itself was surprisingly well-made. While the shot of the Titanic (using a model) was incredibly sloppily done (with VERY fuzzy camera-work to try to hide that it was a model), the rest of the film looks pretty opulent and the acting was very convincing considering it was made in 1943-- as things were turning VERY bad for the Germans. Sadly, although the film is watchable and VERY interesting, it was not shown in Germany and was only recently discovered--it deserved a wider audience despite its shortcomings.",

Is it a redemption tale ? If so then why does Lanie start out as a not unlikable person and remain a not unlikable person throughout the movie ? You see there&apos;s little in the way of character development and the situations and soul searching never seem to draw the audience into Lanie&apos;s fears . None of this is helped Stephen Herek&apos;s shallow direction either \n\nIn short this is a shallow film but while being confused as to what it&apos;s trying to say it&apos;s also fairly watchable too . Angelina Jolie is breath takingly beautiful and in many ways she&apos;s like a female Leonardo Dicaprio in that her good looks disguise she&apos;s a much better actress than critics give her credit for and imagine how worse the movie would be if her role was taken by say Sandra Bulloch while Dave Newman&apos;s haunting score also helps the movie greatly",

Interesting because of the Russian actors and locations, the film is somewhat disjointed, but certainly is not an intellectual insult like so many Hollywood low budget horrors. The visuals are interesting, and perhaps influenced other films with similar immortality themes. I believe most viewers will find the film to be dated, slow, and boring. With that in mind, only curious film buffs, and those who enjoy curiosities, should expect even marginal entertainment. All others would be advised to avoid. - MERK",

He is looking very much farward to a solar eclipse in the 1990&apos;s. One day the equally aged and long haired Alex from Bucuresti turns up on the bus, with a stylish bike and new music on the walk man. This meeting are profound for Mircea. They become close friends, until one of their actions will cause powerful consequences.\n\nThe kids are played by Dan Hurduc and Nicholas Bohor, and they do a fabulous job in this third movie by Radu Potcoavã, after a script by Cristina Bîlea.\n\nThe film succeeds in bringing back those early teen summers back then i your own life, which is it&apos;s main point until the story takes a turn.\n\nWell worth a watch, and after it came on Netflix the film has gotten a new chance of being discivered.",

After much scuffle the unlucky winner is soon liberated of the offending appendage, and Murphy&apos;s law being what it is they are rescued mere seconds afterwards. Fearing for their reputations everyone except obviously the victim agrees to lie and say that they had to cut his arm off because it was crushed in the collapse, but being quite perturbed because he can no longer clap and can only row boats in circles he vows revenge. Things start off a few years later when the man whom first suggested the idea receives a severed arm gift wrapped in the mail, and with few exceptions that&apos;s where this movie&apos;s creativity ends.\n\nNot particularly bad but overall pretty slow and boring, although there is a little bit of a haunting surprise at the end it&apos;s not enough to make it worth while. Be weary of the severely edited 83 minute version missing all the gore, its like the editors took a hacksaw to the film stock and made an already extremely weak movie worse.\n\n3 out of 10, strictly blood and guts, although it doesn&apos;t do that all that well either.",

Movies like these and Jackie Chan films were my staple diet during my growing days. Revisited it recently n found this to be extremely dated out.\n\nThose were the days when kung fu films used to have lots of sound/noises during a fight sequence. We have trainers with wierd moustaches, wierd eyebrows n beards n funny ponytails. The editing is a lil lousy. After the initial fight scene it cuts abruptly. Then again during the last fight sequence it cuts abruptly. Enoyed the training sequence those days but found it to be scientifically wrong n very lengthy now.\n\nFor the 1st chamber aka log rolling, strength, balance, and super fast footwork was required. Single leg squat wud have helped. The space given was so less that there were chances of the head hitting the side walls.\n\nSecond chamber, dumbbell side/lateral raise was needed. The training shown will definitely injure the rotator cuff big time.\n\nFor the 3rd chamber, more dumbell hammer curls n db reverse wrist curls were needed. The training shown wud have caused carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n4th one was more of proprioception n eye coordination.\n\nI don&apos;t advise the 5th one which is more like a football header n will cause neurodegenerative disease.\n\nSzu-Chia Chen (horror film Hex) is there for few mins only.",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t expect something like &quot;Ju on&quot; or &quot;The ring&quot;. It may appear similar but the approach is different from those movies. There is this Urban legend where the scares are build on. But look closely at the source and the main character and you will know something is off. There are two twists at the ending which will motivate you to watch the movie again! I think that for the avid horror fan there is not enough gore and action. The pace is a bit on the slow side. It would have made more impact if the movie had a faster pace and if there had been more murders. I understand that this movie is more about the atmosphere. The cinematography and location(the toll booth in the middle of nowhere) provide an ambiance which is creepy enough. In combination with the slow pace and the urban legend concerning 29 February you will be drawn in the movie. The main character is likable and not annoying. Even when you suspect something is wrong with her you will care for her. This is key for the two twists at the ending. I give this movie 6.8 points out of 10!",

He employs lots of quick wit, sarcasm, and slapstick self-deprivation.  The son does a mostly believable job with the typical fish out of water story.  He climbs out on the ledge of a Manhattan skyscraper and also climbs to the top of the statue of liberty to see the &quot;fire up the sky&apos;s butt&quot;.  The supporting cast puts in workman quality acting as well.  The real mom (JoBeth Williams) is believable as a post 60&apos;s Peace Corp leftover and villain played by David Ogden Stiers (M*A*S*H) is terrific as a scary and quirky Russian mafia boss.  It is a down the middle Disney pre-teen movie and fun."

      "reviewBody": "The Guest House Paradiso is situated right on the edge of the cliffs on the English coast with great views on one side and a nuclear power plant on the other. As if that wasn&apos;t reason enough to avoid it, the owners, Eddie and Richard, are about the least competent or hospitable people in the hotel trade  making Basil Fawlty looking like the best manager in the world. When a disaster in the kitchen proves to be the last straw for the few guests living there, Richard and Eddie finds themselves alone in the hotel. The blissful peace doesn&apos;t last long though, because a young family (The Nice&apos;s) turn up, with the Paradiso being the only place they can afford. This is bad enough but things are only going to get more complicated when an Italian film star, rubber swimwear and a dish called &quot;fish surprise&quot; come into play.\n\nIt is not always possible to say that a film is bad or good because sometimes they are aimed so specifically at a particular audience that if you&apos;re not in that group then it is likely that you will hate it while they think it is fantastic. In these situations it is possible that the &quot;majority rule&quot; is not necessarily right but Guest house Paradiso is an example of where you really want to be trusting the majority. Of course you could fall into a very small group of people who find uninspired crudity funny but, if that is you then you probably have more important things to sort out than to be watching this film. Those who like Bottom will love this but I would be surprised if anyone else found much to enjoy in this thing; the violent and crude slapstick is basically copied from that TV show, which is a problem because, as you might guess, I&apos;m not a fan of it at all.\n\nThe narrative here is pathetic though and makes Bottom&apos;s plots about sex etc look like highly polished works of literature. Here we have plots about Italian film stars, video tapes of rubber cavorting, nuclear fish and, when all else fails vomit, lots of vomit. The script doesn&apos;t offer anything other than crudity to work with and by the end of the film I had been worn down by shoddy jokes, crudity for crudity&apos;s sake and an endless feeling of being rather soiled by the whole affair. Normally I would sorry for the cast in this sort of film but since Mayall and Edmondson wrote and directed this they have nobody to blame. They can take a punch but they cannot make this tired old filth feel fresh or funny; by the time they are swimming in green vomit I really worried that they must have actually thought this was a good idea and worth doing. Support from Pegg is sad because he has shown himself to be much smarter than this with his various projects and this must have been like a low point for him. How on earth Casell, Nighy and Mahieu got involved is beyond me.\n\nOverall, if you think Bottom is the funniest thing ever then you will enjoy this film. For the vast majority of audiences though it is endlessly crude and constantly just aiming for the lowest form of humour that it can get; the &quot;big climax&quot; of loads of vomit just made me wonder what on earth the funders of this rubbish were thinking. I apologise to all the teenage boys who think this film is brilliant but I gotta call it like I see it and this is sh*t of the highest (or lowest) order."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s easy to pick on MEGALODON and call it a bad movie. It&apos;s not original, it lacks a bit suspense every now and then, the acting is just average and you can tell that the budget was low, to name only a few things. But if you manage to look beyond its mediocrity, you can see that the film-makers really tried to make it as decent as possible. And you can only appreciate that. Now , if it wasn&apos;t for CGI-technology, this movie simply would not have been made. Only the actors and a few sets were real, the rest all CGI. It looks real good most of the time(the helicopter in the beginning and the sailboat at the end,...) but sometimes it fails desperately (that same helicopter crashing on the platform).\n\nYou already know that this movie is about a prehistoric mega-shark rising from the depths and terrorizing the crew of an oil-rig. And with it&apos;s title being MEGALODON, I thought the mega-shark was considerably lame. There&apos;s only one fairly decent attack-scene when he bursts through the ice. Decent in terms of that he finally does something. The rest of its screen time you see him swimming around bumping into things. Well at least they didn&apos;t make him roar or something. And the explosion at the end was ridiculous: They just disappeared!? But still, this movie never becomes really boring, &apos;cause the CGI frequently provides nice images to look at, with the &apos;cave-exploring&apos;-sequence being a good example (nice glowing flubbery creatures). There are a few other shots worth mentioning. They&apos;re pretty pointless, but stylish. It was when they showed that smaller dinosaur-fish with the sharp teeth. The creature-designer actually made a real good-looking sculpture (no CGI) for this one.\n\nI admit, to some MEGALODON may not live up to its humble 4-star-rating, but I think you should at least appreciate the effort the film-makers made for trying to make it work. And even if it can&apos;t compete with most of the underwater-creature-flicks, it still is way better than that Casper Van Dien SHARK ATTACK-tripe.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Valter Brani Sarajevo&quot; is a movie deeply ingrained in essence of practically everybody born in former Yugoslavia. There probably isn&apos;t a person here than hasn&apos;t seen it at least once. Its popularity and fond memories of it span over four decades now and none of the similar genre movies made before or since ever came close, not even Bulajic&apos;s war epics.\n\nThe phenomenon of it is really simple - it was the first action flick set in the WWII period. Before that one could only see deeply indoctrinated (and indoctrinating) movies about &quot;just communist struggle against Nazi/bourgeois oppressors&quot;. This was the first time audience was actually able to just root for the good guys while not simultaneously being hammered by deep messages and propaganda. And the production crew did go to great lengths to make it happen.\n\nThere really is not much propaganda, if any, to be seen. There is hardly a mention of who the good guys belong to. There are no speeches of Tito, struggle, communism or proletariat. Germans are still bad, but you&apos;d expect that in any war movie done by non-Germans.\n\nThere are however a lot of clichés and silly plots and sub-plots, clumsy extras and stunt men, the stuff you&apos;d certainly expect in an action flick. There is also the most important ingredient - action. It&apos;s spectacular and there is lots of it. Silly script surprisingly doesn&apos;t detract from viewing pleasure and well paced directing really keeps it together.\n\n&quot;Valter&quot; stands the test of time just as well as its American spaghetti- peers &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; or &quot;Kelly&apos;s Heroes&quot;. Nowadays we are all a bit smarter and nobody is required to watch it with naive reverence. There is a lot of unintentionally funny stuff in there, such as various goofs regarding anachronism, laughable German strategy as depicted, or the spy plot in which every principal character easily fools the other side by wearing stolen uniforms and having an impeccable accent when talking to his enemy. Still, even with all that, its easy to put disbelief on hold and follow the movie in what it is dead serious about - being spectacular and fun.\n\nSpectacle and fun is what &quot;Valter Brani Sarajevo&quot; achieves and it not only makes for two hours well spent - it makes you wanna spend them again and again.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;MY LIFE AS A DOG&quot; is certainly  my best film. Especially when I feel somehow composed, this movie always let me notice that such an uneasiness in my heart has been washed by an extremely tender way. Instead of the eradicated dirtiness, unconsciously I get full of warm affection and mildness. About each occurrences in this movie, however, I cannot describe which scene is the most impressive, the sad, or comical, because I think there is no exactly deliberate scene but  just a boy&apos;s thought and life with his mother, brother, pet dog, other relative, friends, and other villagers.\n\nThe very basic natural humanity is vividly presented through those people. For example the boy, who is the main character, is normally of sensibilities and admirable as a 12 years old child. He is sometimes mischief and shows curiosity about girls, other time weeps missing his mom and his pet dog. While the boy seems to be about to get the sadness over and be going to grow mentally as well in the village. Because the people, to say the least, love to share something amusing with others.\n\nTherefore I say that the heartwarming wonderfulness produced by this movie lies in the whole elements. Any fragment cannot be separated even bright sun ray particle in a car, roof fixing noise, and so on. Every details have a reason for being in the movie actually, so feeling moved comes slowly and deeply, top that off, gently. To get a mild temper, this is one of superb movies. For me, this is the best."

It is really an extraordinarly drama of the life of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes portrayed by Louis Calhoun and his wife played by Ann Harding, and directed by John Sturges.  Judge Lewis Brandeis is played by Eduard Franz. Holmes always wanted a son and he called all 30 of his secretaries &quot;his sons&quot;.  One of the sons I recognized but just couldn&apos;t think of his name, so I looked it up; sure enough he was played by child actor Jimmy Lydon whom I always loved in films.  Lydon played the part of Secretary Clinton.  This truly is a well acted and enjoyable biography.  Highly recommended!",

His brother Walter has been gone for a while and he comes back hoping to make amends for leaving the family. Josh has what seems like a brother-sister relationship with Bella, but he really wants Emily, a cop who is several years older.\n\nJosh&apos;s parents died when he was very young, and he was adopted by the Minnells. Walter (who has gone back to his original name Schmeiss) knows the full story, which Josh has never heard, and what happened to them may explain why both brothers turned out the way they did. \n\n&apos;The Maker&apos; is the one who makes the rules in a given situation. Josh has that opportunity when he helps Walter and Felice in their &apos;transfer and storage&apos; business. \n\nI think of the pleasant character from &apos;What the Deaf Man Heard&apos; when I think of Matthew Modine. However, he can play bad guys too, and he made Walter likable and not really evil. As a con artist, Walter had to be quite a good actor too. I thought most of the lead actors gave good performances. Still, the movie was quite dark at times, and somewhat violent toward the end. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers effectively showed a young man having to make important moral decisions as he reached a point where he could have gone down the wrong road.\n\nIt was a worthwhile film, if you like this sort of thing."

It&apos;s one of those &quot;time-to-kill&quot; films that many people will enjoy, and many others will not. The jokes are not killer, and the script falls a bit flat, but the actors manage to make a good deal of it work. So many stars are in this movie (some not as famous as others), most very good in their roles, but if you are not interested in the big names in the film, then the plot might not hook you, either. All in all, Pandemonium is a movie which could have been better, but succeeds at what it is...a nice little boredom buster with some cute laughs and just enough camp to make this horror parody float."

Nice presence of various unique and funny characters and good topic. Feelings of desperation dominate, which is relevant for the situation or topic. Good topic - the president&apos;s visit, which is what very close to real life&apos;s event. High presence of soldiers, police, government, makes this quality. The best are emotions which even if negative are so real and deep, and remind me not only of war but also anything smaller than than that is desperate such as financial, relationship, religious problems. The way that desperation is presented is so convincing, religious, moral, and deep. But also funny and like fairy-tale or dream. So sad, funny, deep, serious, magical. Mixed feelings. The only bad thing is lack of some real action and too negative. Good actors which I recognize from other good movies and series, especially Bosnia ones.",

The &quot;Religion&quot; of High School Football gave them no other choice. H.G. Bissinger spent almost an entire year with his family in 1988 in Odessa, TX. He essentially became a part of the community and team in documenting and then writing his book Friday Night Lights. He said that due to depressed economic conditions, lack of higher education, and good paying jobs, the communities in West Texas looked upon the high school football programs as saviors from reality."

How the director couldn&apos;t once say &quot;Jason! This is Shakespeare! Step it up a bit!&quot;\n\nNo one likes anyone that chews the scenery but Robards is the other end of the spectrum. He sounds like someone giving the morning farm report reciting Shakespeare.\n\nThe saving grace of this film is Charlton Heston. It is obvious, he is too old for the role, but his mere presence and performance make up for his age and the flatness in the rest of the production. His &quot;Friends, Romans, Countryman,&quot; speech is the finest performance of that speech you will ever witness. It is worth watching this film, simply to witness Heston outshine everyone else in the cast. and make this film worth the watch for his performance alone.\n\nIt is sad. I think what this film could have been, had a better actor been given Brutus, but alas, that is not the case. Fast forward through the rest of the film and just enjoy Heston!"

Two years later, he escapes and returns to Paris to take another crack at the job; his former colleagues in the French Secret Service, who sold him out when the political winds changed, try to stop him.\n\nIt&apos;s one of those roles in which Belmondo does things, which is what made him so attractive as a New Wave anti-hero. He&apos;s still playing the anti-hero, of course, but there are no heroes, just middle-aged bureaucrats, thugs , and beautiful women. He lets you see the years and weariness creep up on him, particularly in the scenes with Michel Beaune. Mostly, though, he is what the title of the movie suggests, a thorough professional, who takes well-calculated risks that confound the people who try to stop him; they are worried about their jobs, their futures, their remaining ideals of right and wrong, and utility. He&apos;s just doing a job, and if he survives, well and good, and if not..... well, that was a possibility all along.",

It&apos;s very different from the series, as there isn&apos;t a complicated plot arc, nor is there an epic tale of good versus evil. There are 2 short, fast stories.\n\nThe first story, with Lochley, reminded me of old sci-fi short stories that I used to read when I was little. It was an interesting take on religion in the future and differed somewhat from the way I saw it in the series. While not what I expected, it was still fun and thought provoking.\n\nThe second story with Sheridan and Galen was more traditional B5, but felt a little rushed in how it developed. Still, it was entertaining and had the humor and edge that I loved from the series. It&apos;s still a heroic tale about the effect one man can have, but its not epic.\n\nThroughout the movie, the visual effects were mindblowingly better than the original. The station was glorious, the battle scene gorgeous, and the new designs were true to the original flavor while still being different.\n\nThere are some flaws, but nothing really made me cringe (except for one piece of techno babble).",

      "reviewBody": "What did the leper say to the prostitute? You can keep the tip! This is just one example of a stupid but unresistingly funny little joke that features in &quot;Revenge of the Radioactive Reporter&quot;; a pleasant little amateur horror discovery made by genre fanatics for genre fanatics. Actually, this is perhaps one enthusiast zero-budgeted amateur movie that deserves a little more attention and support, because the ideas and horror knowledge of the people who made this are remarkable and profound. Also the dialogs and cheesy magnified clichéd are bulls eye and quite frankly I don&apos;t understand why my fellow reviewers are so negative minded about this film. A young and ambitious journalist, who just proposed to his girlfriend in the most imaginative way I&apos;ve ever seen, wants to gain fame and reputation by bringing to the surface the malpractices of a local nuclear power plant. Because of their illegal dumping of toxic waste in the water, dozens of people in the area developed terminal cancer. The diabolical board of directors unanimously vote to eliminate the reporter, but he survives the nose dive into a tank of bright green goo and returns as the  Radioactive Reporter, duh! And it will be quite easy for him to get his revenge, because the same people who tried to kill him are now after his fiancée because she might know too much. The radioactive dude quickly adapts to his condition and learns to love killing his foes by the mere touch of his deformed hand or acid saliva. &quot;Revenge of the Radioactive Reporter is quite ingenious and well-written. There&apos;s a fairly original detail, for example, that our hero regularly has to the tank of radioactive waste for a dip in order to survive. His methods of murder are fresh and inventive as well. He kills a vainglorious woman by urinating in her bathtub and turning it into a acid hot Jacuzzi. Especially with his journalist&apos;s hat on, our anti-hero even looks quite a bit like Freddy Krueger. There&apos;s also a downright hilarious scene where he tries to write a letter to his fiancée, but he doesn&apos;t get past writing: &quot;Dear Richelle  How can I explain &quot; and then he has to start over because a piece of gooey and smoking skin fell on the paper. Fun stuff!",

I think the most interesting scenes are those where there is no dialogue but the camera follows the characters as they inwardly contemplate what this all means (Bill Pullman, Andie McDowell). Unfortunately, we as the viewers are also given (too much) time to contemplate what it means. Everything is WAY too understated. The movie slows to a stop in many places. You start to like it (the romance with Kat and the investigator, the interaction of Bill Pullman&apos;s character and the Mexican-American people) and then it doesn&apos;t follow through. The dialogue at the film school, in which the characters give a monologue for a class is probably the most interesting dialogue. Some rap, some tell a story, some recite their own poetry. That was the most moving part of the movie. While Wenders has a important point to make, it doesn&apos;t come through clearly and the viewer is left uncaring, uninterested. Maybe the only thing that could have helped the End of Violence is more good ole fashioned...violence &lt;g&gt;."

I did think that Lohan, Garcia and Kane gave solid performances even if the latter two didn&apos;t get as much screen time.\n\nThe film is far from the worst ever made, but it is definitely one of Lohan&apos;s weaker films, especially compared to the likes of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and &quot;Mean girls&quot;. I don&apos;t think the film is terrible per say just a little boring and very predictable. It was clearly a good children&apos;s book, just not compelling enough a story for filming.

She discovers she has been captured not by a Valentino-type, but by a middle-aged man with a bald head and a moustache. The rest of the film is a seduction and a motor tour through the desert, punctuated by this poor girl being painted with henna.\n\nUnless you are looking for a cure for insomnia, you would do well to give this film a miss and watch Valentino in The Sheik instead.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s interesting just to watch DeMille&apos;s first, silent film version of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, and the picture itself is pretty interesting too. It is also occasionally impressive, sometimes with the kind of DeMille flourishes that one expects, sometimes with a satisfying dramatic turn. It&apos;s quite different in its conception from the more familiar 1950&apos;s version, and so direct comparisons are not always possible, yet it holds up well by itself anyway.\n\nRather than concentrating on the biblical story, as in the remake, here DeMille first tells an abbreviated version of the Moses/Exodus narrative, and then uses it as the thematic basis for a modern morality tale. There are many parallels between the two stories, and while the parallels are occasionally forced, they often work surprisingly well. The modern-day story is similar to many other films of the 1910&apos;s and 1920&apos;s, but it is interesting and it is told well.\n\nAlthough DeMille is known for his lavish spectacles, he also knew how to create some more subtle effects when he wanted to. In the modern story, some of the developments are a bit contrived, but the characters generally ring true, and the story itself is worthwhile as well. While the lavish remake with color and sound is probably going to remain more well-known, this earlier version is well worth seeing, too."

      "reviewBody": "Oh! What a wonderful film!  The Invisible Man is fraught with witty dialogue, excellent character acting, inventive and creative special effects, insightful direction, and solid, tight scripting.  The story is about a scientist that develops a serum which turns himself invisible, for good intent initially.  The serum has negative side effects, one of which is turning the scientist into a raving,mad megalomaniac bent on conquering mankind and the world.  What is most surprising about the film is its rather perverse sense of black humour(a James Whale specialty) and its cruelty. The Invisible Man is not a benign horror monster but rather a frightening, destructive force capable of acts of violence, madness, and viciousness. The direction is the real star of the film as Whale combines script, acting, mood, and setting amidst the background of ground-breaking special effects that are still impressive to this day.  Whale laces his special humour throughout, and this film has no shortage of dark comedic moments.  The acting all around is very good with people like Henry Travers, Gloria Stuart, Una O&apos;Connor and William Harrigan especially as a jealous doctor giving all the support they can to a formless Claude Rains.  Rains&apos;s voice is magnificent and one senses he was made to play the part that would make him famous.  Look for Dwight Frye in a small role.  A wonderful film experience!"

It blends excitement, humor &amp; history - definitely from a British viewpoint - into an attractive package sure to entertain the viewer lucky enough to find it.\n\nIndian actor Sabu stars as the young Prince of Tokot who finds his life suddenly become very dangerous when he&apos;s forced to flee his usurping uncle and accept protection from the British Raj. Plummy-voiced Roger Livesey plays the Raj&apos;s stalwart envoy to Tokot who must find a way to stop the import of weapons to the evil new Khan, Raymond Massey, who is fomenting a rebellion. All three actors play their parts very well, with Massey especially attacking his villainous role with gusto.\n\nAlso in the cast are Valerie Hobson as Livesey&apos;s courageous wife; David Tree as a junior officer; and corpulent Francis L. Sullivan as the local Governor in Peshawar. Alfred Goddard appears unbilled as the hapless private Kelly.\n\n*************************\n\nBorn Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore&apos;s stables when he was discovered by Korda&apos;s company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disney&apos;s A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re looking for everything you&apos;ve ever wanted to know about horror, mystery, depression, and suspense, go take a peek into Ingrid Bergman&apos;s eyes.\n\nThe actress -- who would soon become blacklisted after her marriage to Italian director Roberto Rossellini -- can convey every emotion and nuance of her character through her amazingly expressive eyes. Completely believable in George Cukor&apos;s Gaslight as a wife whose husband (Charles Boyer) is trying to make insane, Bergman can show you all her turmoil and emotional stress just by looking around.\n\nThe plot is simple, perhaps even arcane. A famous opera singer is murdered in London, leaving behind no motive, no clues, and Paula, the young niece who discovered the body. Paula is sent to Italy, where she, too, studies music, until she elopes with an older, dashing pianist (Boyer). He convinces her to move back to the exact same house where her aunt was murdered, where nothing has been changed in all those years. And, naturally, here is where the movie really begins.\n\nSoon, her husband starts acting very strangely, and starts convincing her that she is very ill and unable to go out. Trapped in the house, alone with her husband, a somewhat-deaf cook, and a tart of a housekeeper, Paula soon starts to hear noises, see things, lose things, and even hide things. Or is she? Is she going mad? Or is her husband -- who she is supposed to love, honor, and obey -- making her mad?\n\nThe show is Bergman&apos;s to steal, and she does so with gusto, garnering an Oscar for her endeavor. With her performance, Bergman transforms the character of Paula Alquist from a weak, paranoid wimp of a wife into a woman struggling with her own identity and her role in marriage and society. Perhaps unintentionally, perhaps unwittingly, Bergman&apos;s Paula is a symbol and a superhero for all women trapped in an abusive marriage. Even today.\n\nGranted, the story line is somewhat contrived, and one can&apos;t help but wonder how Paula never notices that her husband is completely evil BEFORE the marriage. Also, Joseph Cotten, as the Scotland Yard detective smitten with Paula&apos;s beauty, seems to come out of nowhere. Still, the acting prevails over the plot, and what better actor to come out of nowhere than Cotten? His charm and charisma make up for his character&apos;s two-dimensionality.\n\n Although there are faults, Gaslight is an extraordinary film, generating its suspense not from an evil lurking in the shadows, but from the psychology of the mind itself. Perhaps one of the first &quot;pure&quot; psychological thrillers, Gaslight, just like Ingrid Bergman&apos;s eyes, contains the perfect blend of mystery, suspense, and beauty.",

      "reviewBody": "No need to recap the convoluted plot. The movie&apos;s a sleeper among noirs, thanks mainly to an unpredictable and well thought-out screenplay from writer Huggins. Just when you think you&apos;ve got things figured, you don&apos;t. I especially like the way Huggins subtly reverses Jane&apos;s (Scott) and Danny&apos;s (Duryea) competitive relationship. Watching the two circle each other is like watching two hungry sharks. Apparently, they want to mate but don&apos;t dare get too close. Note too, how effectively director Haskin uses the stylish wide-brimmed hats to veil the identity of men entering a room. I don&apos;t recall this clever effect in any other film. This is also one of the few noirs to make the central character a woman (Jane) instead of a man.\n\nThen too, it&apos;s a very well cast movie. Duryea is of course Duryea, a major icon of noir. On the other hand, Scott was always more a presence than an actress. Still, her presence here is used to good effect as a greedy spider woman, even if she doesn&apos;t achieve much depth. But I especially like the underrated Don DeFore. His trademark nice guy is also used to good effect in what turns out to be something more than just a nice guy. (Be sure to catch ex-Dead End kid Billy Halop as the cranky boat manager.)\n\nI guess the only missing element from classic noir are the angular shadows of moral ambivalence. Haskin does film a number of night scenes, but I don&apos;t spot the classic lighting. Perhaps that&apos;s because his specialty as a director was science fiction and adventure films. Anyway, I&apos;m not sure why this withering little drama hasn&apos;t achieved more recognition. Maybe it&apos;s because it was an independent production without studio backing. But whatever the reason, the movie remains a gritty little noir worth catching up with."

I went for going cold turkey not getting to watch him in Kung fu anymore to this wonderful piece of storytelling. The fact that the actress who played Karen Simms (also from Kung Fu) was a great addition. I wish TV would play this movie more often. Not a lot of actors play a similar character that they&apos;ve played for a few years on a TV show which I think is a shame. Most actors go from playing a good guy straight into a bad guy role. I&apos;m glad that he played a good guy in this movie. I wish people would make more good guy movies like they did in the old days. No one makes movies like John wayne or Jimmy Stewart did. Someone needs to take the time to make a couple and I think Hollywood would get the idea that they would be more accepted then they think they would."

However, the anxiety of the creature creates havoc in the laboratory that is burnt down and explodes, killing Frankenstein&apos;s assistants Dr. Zahlus (Quentin Crisp) and Paulus (Timothy Spall). Dr. Frankenstein believes the creature died too but he flees to the woods. Soon he meets and befriends the dwarf Rinaldo (David Rappaport), who gives a name to him, Viktor, and invites him to work in a circus in Budapest. Meanwhile Frankenstein and his house keeper Mrs. Baumann (Geraldine Page) teach Eva how to behave and to be independent. One day, Frankenstein introduces Eva to the high-society, telling that she was found amnesic in the woods and has become his protégée. But Frankenstein becomes obsessed of Eva while Viktor and she have a strange connection. What will happen to Eva? \n\n&quot;The Bride&quot; is a different version of Frankenstein story by Mary Shelley. The film is actually a romance that begins slow paced but well resolved in the end. Clancy Brown has an outstanding performance in the role of the naive creature. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Prometida&quot; (&quot;The Promised One&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The lives of gangster brothers Ray, Chet and Johnny are changed forever when Johnny is killed.  His funeral acts as a time to look back at the past but also to look inwardly and to the future.  The story is told in flashbacks that mix the past and present to see a gangster life style in all it&apos;s glory.\n\n The story here is straightforward  however it&apos;s multi-layered flashbacks and subplots make it too confusing at times.  In simple terms it is two stories  Johnny before he is killed, and the lives of his brothers afterwards.  The characters make it come to life but the drama inherent in the subject matter helps as well.  The story mixes `real&apos; lives, violence and some black humour to good effect  the overall point being the point made by Sciorra when she says `there&apos;s nothing romantic about it at all&apos;.\n\nThe cast are good  in particular the Ferrara regulars.  Walken gives a more emotional version of his King of New York character and carries much of the moral debate with himself and others.  Penn is also good as the self destructive brother and gives a powerful performance without becoming OTT (a la Nice Guy Eddie).  Gallo is good although his character is not fully explained  why did he look for trouble, why the interest in worker&apos;s rights? Rossellini, Argo and Soprano&apos;s Ventimiglia are all good and del Toro does yet another quiet cool role.\n\nOverall this is a good film  it is graphic and dark, but not as much as some of his other films.  The subject matter will appeal to the mass audience (most people seem to like mobster movies) and his unromantic spin on the genre makes up for the occasionally bitty storyline."

      "description": "The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers. These men are violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating. Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to Communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny&apos;s opinions.\r\n\r\nThe chief suspect in Johnny&apos;s murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.\r\n\r\nRay and Chez swear revenge. Ray&apos;s wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez&apos; wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband&apos;s obsessive nature.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who first claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend, but who later admits, just before Ray kills him, that he wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends.\r\n\r\nAs he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers&apos; lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray&apos;s house and shoots Ray&apos;s bodyguards, shoots his dead brother Johnny lying in the casket, shoots Ray, and then puts the gun in his own mouth and commits suicide as the family women wail over Ray as he too dies.",

      "reviewBody": "By the early seventies the western genre was in severe decline, and with the exception of Clint Eastwood the only other bankable actor within the genre who could return a sure fire hit was John Wayne. However having made a string or westerns in succession John Wayne was eager to broaden his horizons and undertake a new project, the project was to be a contemporary detective drama titled &apos;McQ&apos;.\n\nMcQ is set in Seattle and follows Lon McQ (Duke) in his pursuit of the gangsters whom murdered his friend and colleague Stan Boyle. As the quest intensifies McQ uncovers the motive behind his friends killing and uncovers corruption that stems right to the top of the police hierarchy.\n\nWhile the movie was slammed by critics and some anti Wayne elements its impossible to deny that John Wayne is well cast in this movie as a tough cop who is something of an outsider in a world of changing values. The Duke gives a fine performance with some good supporting players most notably Eddie Albert, Al Lettieri, Colleen Dewhurst and Diana Muldaur There are some well-staged action scenes including two high-speed car chases and an exciting climatic shootout. One notable if somewhat improbable action scene involves two lorries playing a large-scale version of dodgems with McQ&apos;s car that would have been very akin to a scene from a James Bond movie.\n\nThe movie delves into several interesting areas including corruption, family breakdowns and the shadowy underworld of drugs, one brilliantly directed and acted scene involves McQ exchanging drugs for vital information about an imminent drugs heist, this scene illustrates just how complex the drug underworld actually is and the chemistry between McQ and Myra is very evident.\n\nThe overall tone of the movie is notably grim and gritty and while the movie would have benefited from a larger budget, tighter direction and greater character development, nevertheless McQ was an undeniable hit at the box office and is a worthy entry into John Wayne&apos;s impressive portfolio.",

It has a nostalgic feel to it which many would appreciate, the characters are extremely memorable, the soundtrack is so comical that it ironically becomes good and while there were moments when the pacing lacked it is still an enjoyable movie from start to finish. The best way I could describe this movie is that its so bad that its good, you dont watch this movie for a cinematic masterpiece but rather a nice way to burn 2 and a half hours of yours day which it does very well.",

      "reviewBody": "The Breach (aka La rupture) is a film made by celebrated French director Claude Chabrol in the middle of his golden period at the turn of the 70&apos;s. Like most of his other films from this time, it is a psychological thriller that is more interested in character interactions than in suspense. While it is true that there is some of that present here too, there isn&apos;t a lot and the film only truly moves into thriller territory in its final quarter. In fact, the switch is quite jarring and has left some thinking it doesn&apos;t fit very well alongside what has gone before. I kind of liked the ending though, it isn&apos;t especially realistic and even becomes a bit surreal, yet the story on the whole has got an oddness about it generally, typified by the unsettling and somewhat off-centre musical score used throughout. The story revolves around a woman called Hélène who is the wife of a rich layabout drug addict. One day he attacks her and their child, leaving the boy hospitalised. Hélène attacks him back leaving him with a head injury. His rich father hires a sleazy friend of the family to befriend Hélène with the objective of incriminating her, leading to a divorce that would favour his son.\n\nLike a lot of Chabrol&apos;s best works this one stars his wife, the radiant Stéphane Audran who is, once more, extremely good and sympathetic as Hélène, Jean-Pierre Cassel is also impressive as her manipulative &apos;friend&apos;, while it would be remiss not to mention Catherine Rouvel also, who is a lot of fun as his highly sexed girlfriend who pleasingly spends most of the film in a state of undress (ooh la la). In fact, there is a plethora of oddball side characters in this one, most live in the boarding house where the majority of the action revolves around, such as three old ladies who continually play with Tarot cards, a mentally-backwards girl and an overly-dramatic actor. On top of this, it&apos;s nicely photographed, especially in the surreal park scene towards the end where things get a little trippy. The film criticises the bourgeois, with the rich grandparents acting like it is their right to dictate events purely on account of their financial strength. But the film works mainly as an off-kilter psychological drama/thriller, underpinned by fine acting and some good direction.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a well done movie. It said it was based on a true story, I don&apos;t know how much was true, but it was a sweet movie about a Doberman pinscher dog and a ten year old girl. In the beginning of the movie there are some scenes of dog fights that look brutal, but are an eye opener for those of us who have never seen a dog fight. If it isn&apos;t an issue you have ever personally thought about, this scene in the movie will make you an advocate against such brutal activity. The movie shows the devotion a dog has for a girl that saves its life after losing a battle against a pit bull. I had never heard of this movie, but decided to watch it since John Travolta was in it. It was interesting to see a younger John and it was a good part for him to play and he did it well. If you love dogs or are just looking for a movie that the family may enjoy, this may work for you. There is some cursing, but nothing that most kids haven&apos;t heard.",

Although there is not too much of a storyline, the slick action scenes combined with some very good performances from Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne kept me entertained from start to finish.\n\nWhile Passenger 57 offers nothing really new to the action genre, it does offer plenty of fast paced chaos and explosions and combined with some entertaining hand-to-hand combat skills by Snipes, it is certainly better than a lot of other standard action fares out there.\n\nSnipes gives a very good performance as the lead and Bruce Payne is brilliant as the mentally unstable villain. The other cast are somewhat overshadowed by Snipes and Payne, but do an adequate enough job.\n\nOverall I was very pleased by Passenger 57, so much so that it proudly belongs in my DVD collection. A very good choice for action fans and a must for Snipes fans. 8/10.\n\nAnd don&apos;t forget....&quot;Always bet on black!&quot;",

It added more drama this time, because Hugo actually finds the spoiled life of moviestars comfortable and luxurious which conflicts with his street-oriented and free-spirited friend Rita&apos;s relationship with him. \n\nAfter Isabella&apos;s fall into insanity in the first movie we now get her husband Conrad as the main antagonist. He has the same plan like that of the first movie, but will go to more extreme measures to get Hugo which makes him a more serious threat to Hugo. Nothing new, but the menacing actions make up for that.\n\nWe get more songs in this sequel and they are great! But bare in mind that the American dubbed version is terrible. I am from Denmark, so I know the original version and it was on par with the first movie.",

(Not &quot;White Chicks&quot; funny, more &quot;The Office&quot; funny). The plot is fairly simple: two young women kidnap the manager of the German telephone provider and start making strange demands while getting to know their captive a little better. The US remake will probably be shot on Imax, not on video, and have really exciting action scenes, but I think I&apos;ll take the funny action scenes in the original. The title of this film, in case anyone cares, means someone who starts to work in a profession for which they have no proper training. Literally: To step in sideways. And with the female article it means &quot;Females who step in sideways&quot;, which I suppose is fitting for this extremely entertaining film.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Otley&apos; is a definite film of its time, showing swinging 60s London and presenting Tom Courtenay in one of his defining but less-known roles, as someone who wants to be a spy but wonders what he&apos;s got into when he gets his wish. Otley is an inept spy, and was probably an even more inept drifter.\n\nFull of colour, with a great score, and many fruity cameos, this film should be better known as it is a lot of fun, with a great central performance and the chance to get really engrossed in the period. Courtenay and Romy Schneider are charming, while character greats such as Leonard Rossiter, Alan Badel, and Freddie Jones add to the overall spoof feel.",

      "reviewBody": "Way back in 1932---around the same time that Director Ernest B. Schoedsack was involved in production of the original classic &quot;King Kong&quot;----he also made another classic film entitled &quot;The Most Dangerous Game (MDG).&quot; Based on a famous story by Richard Connell, MDG tells the tale of a megalomaniac hunter who lives on a remote island. Ships would regularly end up wrecked on reefs near the island. Their passengers and crew would be rescued by our hunter----enjoy his sophisticated hospitality for a time---and then end up as prey as our crazy hunter indulges in his very perverse &quot;sport.&quot; MDG starred a very young Joel McCrea and two members of the original &quot;King Kong&quot; cast----Fay (I never met a scream that I didn&apos;t like!) Wray and Robert Armstrong. At 63 minutes in length, MDG is the model of an exciting and compact thriller film.\n\nSince the basic idea of someone being forced into the totally unexpected role of an innocent victim hunted down with the intention of becoming another&apos;s trophy kill is pretty powerful-----it has been remade into numerous films (&quot;Game of Death,&quot; &quot;Run for the Sun,&quot; etc.).\n\nThe plot device is essentially the same one that Cornel Wilde employed in his variation on MDG entitled &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; released some 34 years after the original film. Wilde makes his movie interesting by having a big game hunter becoming the hunted, and changing the megalomaniac hunter into a band of African tribesmen determined to chase down the Wilde character and do him in.\n\nWilde also indulges his film with numerous symbolic devices and sub-plot lines---but remains true to the basic premise of MDG. Survival is a battle of wits between the hunter(s) and the hunted, and only the most resourceful of preys can make it alive to the end of the tale.\n\nViewers who like &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; ought to seek out MDG to recognize yet again the practice often used by Warner Brothers in the 1930s: if the original film tells a good story, it is worth remaking----and remaking----and remaking......"

      "reviewBody": "The Mockbuster Factory returns with what may be their most audaciously titled/timed ripoff yet. The big budget sci-fi flick &quot;Battle: Los Angeles&quot; has just hit theaters and a day later &quot;Battle Of Los Angeles&quot; (note the &quot;Of&quot; in the title, people - totally different film!) airs as the SyFy Channel&apos;s Saturday Night Original Movie. I wonder how many people were dumb enough to tune in thinking that they were going to be getting the &quot;real&quot; blockbuster for free. If so - joke&apos;s on you!! Anyway, I haven&apos;t seen the &quot;real&quot; &quot;Battle: Los Angeles,&quot; but what I&apos;ve seen in the trailers, it appears to owe a lot to &quot;Independence Day,&quot; and therefore so does &quot;Battle OF Los Angeles.&quot; In both versions, a giant spaceship drops out of the skies over the City of Angels, apparently impervious to all Earth weaponry. In the &quot;real&quot; movie, the only ones who can do anything about the alien invasion are a platoon of tough-as-nails U.S. Marines. In the Asylum version, it&apos;s a small band of Air National Guardsmen stationed in the hills.\n\nIt must be said that the special effects in the first ten or fifteen minutes of &quot;Battle of Los Angeles&quot; actually look somewhat promising. While still characteristically Asylum/SyFy Channel cheap, the invasion/battle scene that opens the film looks like they at least put some kind of effort into it. I would imagine that the majority of the film&apos;s (small) budget went into that sequence, as the rest of the film doesn&apos;t come close to measuring up to it. \n\nFrom here, all resemblance to the real &quot;Battle: Los Angeles&quot; ceases. Instead of Aaron Eckhardt and Michelle Rodriguez, we get Kel Mitchell (yes, the former &quot;Welcome to Good Burger, can I take your order?&quot; guy from Nickelodeon) and Nia Peeples. Nia is a sword-swingin&apos; Area 51 ass kicker (aging gracefully in a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; style cat suit) who leads the band of military survivors through the desert (random observation: have you ever noticed how many Asylum films deal with &quot;a small band of survivors traveling through the desert?&quot; I&apos;d say it accounts for a good half of their filmography!)to a final showdown on board the alien ship. I realize this plot description is rather vague, but then that&apos;s because as far as I could tell, the film had no real plot to speak of. It&apos;s basically a series of random fight scenes, stuff lifted from other (better) movies, lots of people running, guns being fired and stuff blowin&apos; up (in the Asylum&apos;s trademark, laughably cheap CGI) and a whole lot of ridiculous dialogue. Shoehorned in for no apparent reason is a fighter pilot from 1942 (?) who is not what he appears to be, a grizzled old airman who tries to shoot down alien ships with a Colt revolver, and &quot;advanced alien weaponry&quot; that looks like it came off the shelves of Toys-R-Us. In short, if you tuned into this movie thinking you were getting the real &quot;Battle: Los Angeles,&quot; then you deserve what you got. Bad movie fans who are in on the Asylum&apos;s joke will have a hoot and a holler picking apart the usual round of inconsistencies (such as Peeples&apos; suddenly-appearing eye patch) and technical errors. Sit back with a six pack and enjoy. Judging from the reviews I&apos;ve read of the &quot;real&quot; &quot;Battle Los Angeles&quot; movie, this Asylum-ized version is probably more entertaining anyway.",

      "reviewBody": "This automobile lacks its basic ingredient of ignition itself, the spark plug.\n\nThere is so much fire sprawled in the film, but suddenly this fire does not have a spark that would encourage me. The starting titles go through fire, there are lot of vehicles blown in fire, men are set on fire, yet it seems so lackluster. \n\nDeva Katta took a well worked out story that was in movies since the age of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (remade as Ghulam in Hindi) of 1950&apos;s and added nativity and a load of action and more of unwanted songs to make this a Telugu film that has a certain format. An introduction of hero, well placed fights, an emotional backdrop that drives heroes motives, and even a routine comedy side-kick and a hero-heroine thing to bring the so-called romance. What I believe is that, he forgot to add that one-thing that makes a film a good film, that is the vision and voice of a director himself. \n\nSticking to safeguards, makes this film run of the mill affair and does not make it stand out. This film has nothing that was great and yes I agree most of the stuff was mediocre yet I would not be surprised if this film is embraced by Telugu audiences. \n\nIf I dig into the technicalities I find huge flaws, the production design was too lackadaisical and listless. The director did not even bother to take care and back date the film aptly. The film is completely lethargic in editing, songs come and go for no reason, the fights are too heavy when they could have been more subtle. The climax is so hurried that I thought the villain was built up well just to be wasted in the end. Veterans like Tanikella Bharani and even Brahmanandam are under used. \n\nThe biggest challenge I found was to bear Naga Chaitanya for nearly 3hours. That is one heck of a task and indeed one of the toughest when you are bound to seat in a movie theater facing him in your face. There is some serious problem with this guy. He makes awkward face as if biting his teeth unnecessarily, his eyes do not show any emotion and his body language is too plain, it seems as if his body below the neck is unresponsive. I wish he pulls up his socks and learns some serious skills in acting if he has to carry the film on his own shoulders.\n\nI must primarily say that I am not an average Telugu audience but rather an aficionado who is passionate about films, watch different kind of films and derive pleasure in varied stories and aspects of film making itself. Thus, I can say that I am not the right one to review Telugu films as I find most of them annoying. Yet, I dare to review hoping for a change and the best part is I still dare to review my rather too critical reviews too. \n\nThis was pure average film as per me and for those who thought that this film was good, I have no comments but will admit that perhaps, I am too critical. A 1/5 for this, just for some good dialogs which are actually wasted in the attempt to please the masses and pass off as a commercial film.\n\nhttp://braddugg.blogspot.in/2014/06/autonagar-surya-2014-telugu.html",

When the newcomer science teacher Mr. Rzykruski challenges the students to participate in the science fair, Victor&apos;s father forces him to play baseball otherwise he would not sign the necessary authorization for his son.\n\nDuring the game, Sparky chases the ball and is hit by a car. Victor recalls Mr. Rzykruski&apos;s class about the effects of electricity and successfully resuscitates Sparky using lightning. Victor hides Sparky in the attic but the weird Edgar sees the dog on the garden and blackmails Victor to learn how to bring the dead to life. Edgar does not keep the secret and soon Victor&apos;s envious schoolmates revive several creatures to win the science fair contest. When the town is invaded by the monsters, Victor and Sparky are the last chance to rescue the girl Elsa van Helsing from the claws of Mr. Whiskers.\n\n&quot;Frankenweenie&quot; is another stop-motion animation by Tim Burton in black and white with a great tribute to Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein with a happy ending. The story is actually an adorable tale of loyalty and friendship and it is delightful to see the frolic of Sparky. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;",

These opposite qualities work off one another and result in a gem of a movie.\n\nThe smart observations of the celebrity industry are right on the mark. Yet the movie doesn&apos;t drown in satire. Human touches are smoothly interwoven into the plot. Most noteworthy is a scene when Steve Buscemi is desperately trying to attain approval from his sterile, rather nasty old parents. Also a standout moment is the scene that takes place at Kharma&apos;s hotel, when she first brings Toby there. It is amusing to see Buscemi&apos;s character Les become unraveled at Toby&apos;s success. Somehow the ending seemed so right, again showing hope and the good side of human nature among the muck of a mercenary, dog-eat-dog world.\n\nThe cast is excellent and the acting superb. This is a little cinematic treasure that deserves some recognition.",

      "reviewBody": "Manzanares Del Real , Madrid , in a countryside manor called ¨La Jara¨ takes place a celebration for the centennial birthday of the matriarch (Rafaela Aparicio) , she is the old omnipotent grandmother of an upper-class family . There arrives the British Ana Boulton (Geraldine Chaplin) , an ex-nanny accompanied by her hubby (Norman Brisky) and meets the three little girls she cared are now grown-up . There also shows up Natalia (Amparo Muñoz) who falls in love for Antonio . In this meeting , Ana to be aware that the stiff military José (José Maria Prada who actually passed away a bit later on) died three years ago ; Juan (José Vivó) abandoned his spouse Luchy (Charo Soriano) and Fernando (Fernando Fernán Gómez) carries out unsuccessful attempts to fly by Delta-wing . Meantime , Ana and the rare family go successively to José&apos;s tomb to pray him . Besides , Anna uncovers Juan , Fernando and Luchy attempt to kill their mom to get the valuable inheritance and her luxurious mansion to built an urbanization .\n\nDuring the seventies Carlos Saura shot a trilogy produced by Elias Querejeta about the selfish Spanish bourgeoisie or middle-class formed by ¨Jardín De Las Delicias¨ or &quot;The Garden of Delights&quot; (70) , ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ or ¨Anna and the wolves¨ (72) and ¨La Prima Angelica¨ or ¨Cousin Angelica¨ (73) . Carlos Saura directed in 1972 ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ in which a nanny/Geraldine Chaplin goes to educate three little girls at a mansion , there Ana is seduced , harassed , mistreated , raped by the elder sons : Fernando Fernan Gómez-José Vivó-José Maria Prada and finally killed . But in &quot;Mama Turns 100&quot; the omnipresent Ana is alive and married to Antonio/Norman Brisky . &quot;Anna and the Wolves&quot; had a symbolic and thoughtful tone , as the manor represented the peculiar Spain ruled by a dark Franquist period and the sons were the different political factions which discussed by that time ; and it got a sequel : &quot;Mama Turns 100&quot; with uneven results , as this one has a less provoking style than the original , being more a comedy that a brooding drama . This &quot;Mama Turns 100&quot; results to be a black as well as merry Dramedy dealing with a dysfunctional and utterly broken family in which some ruthless sons are embezzling mother&apos;s money and subsequently killing her . It is a coral film , a piece of nonsense and absurdity with grotesque roles magnificently played by a great plethora of actors . As nice acting by Geraldine Chaplin as an ex-nanny who returns a manor where she worked many years ago . Carlos Saura filmed 7 movies with Geraldine (his then wife) , and this one resulted to be their final collaboration . Excellent Fernando Fernan Gómez , as usual , he plays a weird man who is still living with his mummy and attempting to fly a hang glider . Special mention for Rafaela Aparicio who steals the show as a sympathetic and bigmouth grandmother . The picture contains an evocative and colorful cinematography by Teo Escamilla , Saura&apos;s regular . Being shot on location in Torrelodones , Madrid . \n\nThis Spanish/French co-production dark comedy was well but slowly written/directed by Carlos Saura , at his usual style . Saura is a good Spanish movies director who goes on nowadays filmmaking . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed ¨Los Golfos ¨(1962) dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . Later on , he made ¨LLanto Por Un Bandido¨ or &quot;Weeping for a Bandit&quot; (1964) starred by an all European-star-cast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally , and in proof of it he won a lot of prizes among which there are the following ones : Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for ¨Peppermint Frappé¨ (1967) and the successful ¨La Caza¨ (1966) that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence and being full of political allegories . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for ¨La Prima Angélica¨ (1974) , and for ¨Cría Cuervos¨ (1976) . Also, the surrealistic and disconcerting comedy ¨Mamá Cumple Cien Años¨ (1979) got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film , and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival . He subsequently made ¨Deprisa , Deprisa¨ based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain of the 80s , as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentary-style cinema . In 1990 , he won two Goya , The Spanish Oscar , as best adapted screenplay writer and best director . Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as ¨Carmen¨ , ¨Amor Brujo¨ , ¨Bodas De Sangre¨ , ¨Sevillanas¨ , ¨Iberia¨ , ¨Salome¨ , ¨Fado¨ , ¨Flamenco¨ and even recently Opera as ¨Io , Don Giovanni¨",

The Hong Kong fantasy samurai film, end-of-the-world pictures, rock and roll musicals, and the obsession with Las Vegas.\n\nI had the fortune to see this film at a multiplex in Las Vegas, and was not disappointed. Buddy is a bad-ass rock&apos;n&apos;roller with a katana hidden in his guitar with his sights set on being the next king of Las Vegas. &quot;The Kid&quot; is annoying and has a ear-splitting shriek (Why wouldn&apos;t he? No playmates, no cartoons, just empty land and not a Gymboree or video arcade in sight!), and the various bad guys (loved the evil bald bowlers) come in just about every shape and size.\n\nElements of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, Sam Peckenpah, and God knows how many Kung Fu/Samurai films are in this, seasoned with a handful of self-conscious humor.\n\nLiving in the Las Vegas area, I&apos;m familiar with most of the scenes featured (The bombed out gas station is the ghost town of Rhyolite, Nevada), so it was a kick seeing some of those places in a film.\n\nIt isn&apos;t for everyone, and some will dislike it, mostly for it&apos;s campiness, but this is a film that doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously...and neither should you."

The sex is very pseudo, meaning they don&apos;t take off their underwear. They do take off their shirts a lot, but there is no frontal nudity or anything approaching eroticism. What they mostly do is get topless and wave their hands around each others bodies as if they can&apos;t quite touch one another, while bad music plays and the camera man misses all the good angles.\n\nThe loose Iron Man theme isn&apos;t very amusing after the first 10 minutes or so, although I did get a laugh out of the politically correct terrorists. That was the only laugh, the rest of the joke was on me and anyone else who watches this.",

The way he speaks is like he is trying too hard to seduce with his voice and it is like that in most of the scenes irrespective of the context and you cannot help but remember the fact that he used to be a radio jockey which makes it difficult to care for Varun as the portrayal seems fake.On the other hand Samantha as Nithya was great with the sultry voice of Chinmayi only adding to her performance. The confrontation scenes between Varun and Nithya are well written and so are the comic scenes involving hero&apos;s friend. Ilayaraja&apos;s music is an asset to the film and all the songs are good. A good movie with few flaws.",

In Paul Haggis&apos; intense thriller he chooses a wise and well crafted angle to lure you in and hold your attention. The development of John Brennan and his gradual transformation over time before your very eyes.\n\nMeet John Brennan, he&apos;s a normal average working man, slightly nerdy even, living a fairly dull routine life. When his wife is imprisoned for murder John, as you would expect of a normal average slightly nerdy working man follows the rules of appeal in an attempt to win her freedom. Three years pass and the realisation that his wife will remain behind bars for life hits home. When normal people find themselves in hopeless situations desperation can drive them to do very abnormal things. \n\nWhat Haggis works brilliantly into both his screenplay and direction is the gradual metamorphosis of Brennan&apos;s persona as he becomes fixated on breaking his wife out of prison. Brennan doesn&apos;t suddenly become the all American action hero capable of great feats of courage. We have a knowledge of his character from the beginning of the film and Haggis does not treat the audience as idiots, we know that Brennan cannot walk into a phonebox and there&apos;s a sudden change into superman. This would not work for John Brennan, the nerdy schoolteacher, what we see however is how little by little, piece by piece he falls more and more out of control, deeper and deeper out of his depth. We know this is not the normal behaviour of Brennan, but the screenplay is so well crafted and Crowe delivers the character to us perfectly that both the scenarios and Brennan remain at all times, believable. He makes tremendous mistakes and shows real human failings and frailties that as we ride along with him we&apos;re never far from the belief that it will all go very wrong, very soon. Haggis treats us to a wonderfully woven story that rolls along with ease, then suddenly the momentum builds into a Tsunami of real tension. Brennan is completely exposed and you fear for his outcome. \n\nIf a director can pull you into the story, make you care about a character, and if during the course of that film allow you to watch that character change in a very real and gradual way then he has delivered a truly great film.\n\nHaggis&apos; screenplay does not allow the audience to get ahead of the story. Developments are unexpected and plausible scenarios affect action and reaction. Some events have no bearing on the outcome but you cannot know which are red herrings and which are genuine avenues rather you find yourself wondering where this will all lead to, making The Next Three Days a complex and intriguing thriller very much in the cerebral and classical sense such as North by Northwest or Vertigo. \n\nA tremendous, faultless film.\n\n10/10",

SMITH and Antonio CANTAFORA have at least managed to come close to their larger-than-life role models.\n\nWith CARAMBOLA! A successful start was made, which brought in at least 143 million ITL into the box office. Horst FRANK (1929-1999) is also a Cinecitta Divo from Germany. The party was so successful that four more slapstick comedies were to follow: CARAMBOLA, FILOTTO...TUTTI IN BUCA / SIMONE E MATTEO UN GIOCODI RAGAZZI / NOI NON SILAMO ANGELI and IL VANGELO SECONDO SIMONE E MATTEO.\n\nPaul L. SMITH (1939-2012) also starred in films such as RED SONJA, DUNE (1984) and MAVERICK (alongside Mel GIBSON and Jodie FOSTER). Antonio CANTAFORA was seen in BARON BLOOD alongside German GOLDEN GLOBE winner Elke SOMMER.\n\nIn the German dub, the two whipping boys are called Toby and Butch, while in the original they are referred to as Simone and Matteo.",

Add in a bit of the corporate greed theme and there you have it - a somewhat depressing view of today&apos;s work world.\n\nThis is a bit different from other films of this ilk in that it also delves into the higher executive ranks and the impact decisions made for &quot;shareholder value&quot; has to all levels of an organization.\n\nA thoroughly depressing film that takes on a very serious issue and generally succeeds.\n\nPerhaps this should be mandatory viewing for all with the power over the careers of others.\n\nBen Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper and Craig T. Nelson all do extremely well in their roles as does Kevin Costner, although he strains a bit on his New England accent early in the film.\n\nAll in all, a very nice film of a very depressing subject.",

      "reviewBody": "Looking as if it were plucked from the dreaming ear of an impressionable adolescent with Fitzgerald&apos;s novel half-open on his bedstand -- and sometimes sounding, alas, as if it were scored by the guy who did episode #93 of Kojak -- there is no reason why this 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby shouldn&apos;t be better regarded than it is, or even included among other masterpieces of the fertile period.  Well, maybe one:  Mia Farrow gives an execrable, vaporish performance as Daisy Buchanan that will make you get down on your knees and thank god that we only have to deal with Gwyneth Paltrow.  In a way, though, even Farrow&apos;s neuroting fits, because this is Fitzgerald as seen through a Tennesee Williams filter.  The character of Myrtle&apos;s husband, a cipher in the book, is here a sweaty man in overalls who squeezes an oily rag in his hand whenever he stresses out over his wife&apos;s infidelities, which is pretty much all the time.  What we film folk might call the Karl Malden character.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, this movie was written by Francis Ford Coppola, and is another crown jewel to add to his annus mirabilis of 1974, when he also wrote and directed The Conversation and The Godfather Part II.  And what did you do last year?  Here he does a wonderfully subtle job with a thankless task, excising most of the celebrated prose passages and too-famous scenes. There&apos;s nothing worse than seeing desperate actors try to bring tension to overly familiar texts -- I can never stifle a groan when any actor says &quot;To be or not to be&quot; -- unless of course it&apos;s doing reverent voiceovers of Great American Literature.  Both of these fatal errors are mostly avoided, but for anyone who wishes the movie were more faithful, they retain the scene where Daisy weeps over Gatsby&apos;s shirts.  This episode has an intuitive poetic psychology in the book, but goes over like a lead balloon on screen because we expect clearer motivation from flesh and blood people.  Such are the limitations of film.   But to keep himself interested, and to prevent the proceedings from feeling too dutiful, Coppola gives strange, heretical tweaks to his notorious source throughout, including an assassination scene that likens Gatsby, brilliantly, to JFK.\n\nI don&apos;t know much about director Jack Clayton, except that he also did an ace adaptation of Turn of the Screw, retitled The Innocents... But maybe that&apos;s enough.  This guy FEELS literature.  Nothing in this movie looks less than how you idealized it -- even the sunsets are Jazz Age.  Robert Redford, too, perhaps sensing he was born to play this role, doesn&apos;t fold under pressure but gives a shrewdly understated performance to match the underwritten character, somehow keeping the myth of Gatsby alive despite his all-too-solid presence.  In the scene where we first meet him in his office, his solitude framed by the noises of the revellers down in the garden, he projects both neediness and the intimidating force field that comes with extreme wealth, seemingly without doing anything.\n\nA reviewer below me wondered why the men in this movie would go for the shrill, plain women, and suggested there was a gay subtext.  Cool.  Then the casting of Mia Farrow is subversive instead of insane.  I have to admit, when Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway tells Gatsby &quot;You&apos;re better than the whole lot of &apos;em put together!&quot; his delivery has something, shall we say, flamboyant about it, especially in comparison to his wooden restraint hitherto.  It&apos;s almost as if he stored up all his energy for that one line, to force us to see what a key moment it is between these two young men, and perhaps what&apos;s lost when Gatsby meets his end later the same afternoon. But enough speculation.  Here&apos;s a movie open to any and all interpretations -- sexual, political, poetical."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure how I discovered this little gem but I&apos;m very glad I did. This is a fantastic original story with a creepy moody atmosphere, fair to middling(tho not brilliant) acting and nice cinematography. The kid portraying the youngster is particularly good as well as being cute as a button, which makes things all the more creepy in certain parts of the movie. Unfortunately the actor playing his mother is very wooden which is a shame as she is central to the movie. There is definitely a lack of chemistry between her and the other characters which again undermines the quality of the movie.\n\nOn the plus side it has a great original story - this is so important and a bit of a rarity these days. The editing, direction and camera work is top notch and they don&apos;t resort to any fancy or pretentious camera tricks. This has it&apos;s down side as it could have benefited from at least a little more creativity in the camera work but on balance I&apos;d rather have straight forward visuals than obvious cliché camera tricks. Also worth noting is the special effects which are done extremely well and the, at times, brilliant set pieces. One scene involving a lady vomiting stands out and my favourite was the awesome but all-too-brief appearance of the &quot;guardian&quot;. If I have one real criticism of the movie it would be that it needed more scenes like that. I also appreciated the unique revenge sequences.\n\nThis is hugely under-rated and unfairly slammed in these reviews. Yes there are better horror &amp;/or ghost stories in existence but this one is definitely one of the better produced and more original of the also- rans. It&apos;s also clearly aimed at a family audience as opposed to &quot;adult&quot; so it has dialogue that seems a little unrealistic at times &amp; suffers because of it. But that can easily be over-looked. \n\nSteering well clear of typical clichés and delivering enough shivers &amp; scares to satisfy, this movie is perfect for anyone who enjoys creepy spook flicks. If you&apos;re looking for slasher/torture porn and the like you won&apos;t find it here. But if you&apos;re looking for an atmospheric and entertaining movie for the family to watch this is one of the better ones.\n\nI was also interested in the back story (relating to an animal welfare issue I wont disclose so as not to spoil the story) and impressed that it incorporated an issue that I have a personal interest in. I wish they&apos;d made a little more of that sub-plot but that&apos;s just my own interests. Mostly I was pleased to see it being raised in the movie - even as a bit of an aside.\n\nGrab this one and some popcorn &amp; beverages and gather the family round this Halloween.\n\nPS This movie is guaranteed 100% Shaky-cam Free!",

      "reviewBody": "The year is 2030 and America is in shambles. Big corporations run the country and the ozone layer has been depleted. A group of folks find themselves inside a remote TV station run by Lathan Hooks (Ralph Waite), who is secretly a member of a resistance group. And hiding among this group of 8 is a cyborg with &quot;crash and burn&quot; orders to kill. This was the third release by Charles Band&apos;s Full Moon Entertainment (following PUPPET MASTER and MERIDIAN: KISS OF THE BEAST) and the second he directed (after MERIDIAN) for his new label. Revisiting this after 21 years, I&apos;m surprised at how dated it now looks to me. It definitely fits into Band&apos;s world of futuristic desert wastelands also featured in PARASITE and METALSTORM. The acting is solid (co-lead Eva LaRue is now a CSI: Miami lead; Megan Ward makes her screen debut), but the plot is as flimsy as can be. The film also features the cheapest excuse to have a 80-foot robot (effects expertly done by Dave Allen and crew) on screen for a few minutes. It should also be noted that the DVD is an absolute mess with tons of ghosting issues. The source print used actually looks worse than the clips featured in the &quot;making of&quot; segment originally from 1990.",

Let me mention Michelle Rodriguez separately once more, not just because I always had a celebrity crush on her, but also because of her appearance in the climax scene. Pure Wow moment.\n\nIn short this a guilty pleasure movie, supposed to make no sense whatsoever. Shout out to Robert De Niro. He was... interesting..",

It&apos;s my favorite Burt Lancaster performance:  I can&apos;t imagine anyone else doing the role justice.\n\nWhen Neddy is ready to leave the garden cocktail party he has been invited to, he looks out across the valley and sees the row of pools, all belonging to his neighbors. He&apos;s obviously a poet, and sees the chain of pools as a river (Metaphor).  He decides to swim back home.  Little does he, or we, know at this point what going home means!  He goes from house to house, he greets his friends and jumps into their pools.  We become a little worried as things seem to get a little out of hand--a little more so at each house. It&apos;s not long before we realize that this &quot;river&quot; is (Meta-Metaphor!) a trip through time, through his life--and that he has made one fine mess of it. The ending is amazing, and almost unbearable."

The purpose is to tell the real story of Bonnie and Clyde, and Frank Hamer, the man who hunted them down and killed them. It was made in answer to the Beatty/Dunaway Bonnie and Clyde which twisted the facts and made the outlaw pair out to be more glamorous than they really were.\n\nThe film is brief 60 minutes, not much longer than the documentaries it resembles and tells its story is a meandering but not uninteresting manner. The film film wanders a bit simply because the film is telling two singular stories, that of the outlaws and that of the law, two tales that don&apos;t come together until the final fatal shoot out. The film&apos;s very strong anti-criminal pro-law stand point can get to be a bit too much but because of the films brief running time it never overwhelms the narrative.\n\nOn the plus side is the fact that we get to hear from surviving witnesses to the events and we get to see some of the guns and other items used and places in which the events really took place. This was made at the right time to connect it to the events just thirty years earlier.\n\nThe film is far from perfect but its enjoyable in the same sort of way that many History Channel documentaries are enjoyable when you happen to come upon them. If you should come upon it you could do worse than watch this for an hour. Certainly it would be an interesting co-bill with the Beatty film.\n\nI would also think that its a sterling argument for a big screen version of the life of Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, since in briefly recounting his life one gets the sense of a great story that needs to be told.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a strange movie. The IMDb trivia notes for the movie state that the director and writer spent five years working on the script, yet the story is disjointed and doesn&apos;t have a strong plot. The story basically follows the life of drug kingpin Frank White (Christopher Walken) after he is released from prison and re-enters the criminal world to reclaim his drug empire. However, there&apos;s not much character development and many of the characters are one dimensional. And the movie could be called over-stylized.\n\nYet, somehow it all works and this movie, while not a classic, could be considered a cult classic for its great cinematography, superb acting performances, tense action sequences, its cinematic risk taking and its outright coolness. For a movie shot in the late 80&apos;s (released in 1990) its ahead of its time.\n\nChristopher Walken gives a great performance as Frank White. Many viewers who may only know Walken from his more recent appearances as &quot;the weird but cool guy&quot; will be surprised by the multifaceted performance he gives here. The late Victor Argo&apos;s performance as White&apos;s nemesis on the police force, Roy Bishop, should also be noted. Argo gives a note perfect, yet nuanced portrayal, of a weary, &quot;seen it all&quot; cop who is determined to get his man.\n\nWesley Snipes and Laurence Fishburne were still early in their film careers while appearing in this movie, but you can clearly see the qualities that would make them stars. Both bring depth and realism to their otherwise stock characters. David Caruso also does a great job with his character. One of the shortcomings of the movie is that there&apos;s no strong female lead... Frank White has a relationship with one of his attorney&apos;s, Jennifer (Janet Julian), but the script leaves out a lot of details (e.g., why they are together in the first place). In fact, all the women in this movie look like models which only adds to the stylized unreality the movie creates.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the oldschool rap soundtrack which fits the proceedings to a &quot;t&quot;.\n\nIf you are a fan of crime/action movies, &quot;King of New York&quot; comes recommended, but fair warning, its not your typical gangsta flick.",

Her comedian acting skills in the movie are decent and likable IMO. But the movie as a whole is quite a stretch, not being very entertaining in long parts, sometimes even dull.

      "reviewBody": "An opera singer calmly walks thru a large room inside a beautiful piece of architecture, a deserted and dilapidated building being devoured by nature. His beautiful song bounces off walls littered with graffiti. Broken windows, piles of rubble, lost jobs, a city in decay, nowhere to go but up, welcome to Detropia.\n\nThis movie briefly takes us around Detroit and into the hearts &amp; minds of its sparse population. We see that the only thing surviving and thriving is the indomitable spirit of its citizens. Most documentaries take the approach of inundating us with information. Don&apos;t expect to talk to economic experts or politicians, we talk to the ordinary citizen. We watch them live with their difficult day to day existence as they watch the city decay around them, all the while trying to understand complex causes to a complex problem. Solutions seems so distant all they can hope for is a miracle.\n\nDetropia shows the viewer a microcosm of the human condition through conversations with ordinary folks amidst a sea of ruins. The lovely cinematography continuously compares and contrasts beauty with ugliness, despair with hope. We see small flowers growing among the rubble, a bird rests upon a heap of garbage, people smiling and clinging to what little joy they have as they struggle to make ends meet.\n\nThis is a wonderful and calm film that will require the viewer to have patience and be in a sombre mood. Expect sadness tinged with brief glimpses of hope and the answer to the question of whether your cup is half full or empty. I&apos;m left with the feeling that the spirit may be strong in Detroit&apos;s citizens, but the realities of the world are slowly crushing them. Let us hope the spirit conquers all.",

      "reviewBody": "What is love? And how does it exercise us? As, regardless of age or experience, we grope, or dance, or trot, or what you will, our way in life, is there not at some point, for some of us, a deep impact encounter with another person that challenges our expectations, our fears, even our love? Let alone the fact that, for example, a friend&apos;s fleeting remark can trigger an unpleasant memory. That much for frailty, for I do not want to deliver any kind of portentous philosophical or psychoanalytic sketch as a response to the film, but there was one thing, one thing if you may, that touched me profoundly, and although it shows, I think, an immense refinement and spontaneity of affect, it is of the simplest logical necessity!\n\nFirst things first! you may say, if you still read this.\n\nLike, this is a documentary concerning two men, two artists, in love, in a relationship for more than thirty years, along with geography, exile, backgrounds, celebrities, chronology, hilarity, love and its discontents making for a (dual) portrait. \n\nLike Chris Isherwood, a somewhat canonical writer, mostly for his Berlin stories, living the 20th century passion in an insouciant pre-fascist Germany, ends up in Hollywwod, California coming from rural upper-class England, and, past middle age, he encounters a charming adolescent who ends up the love of his life. A worthy artist, also. \n\nLike all that this entails, what is influence, what are the stakes, of youth coming into age, into art, jealousy, manhood, disgust for mushrooms (and even worse, where this, combined with canned breakfast, can lead to!), shock treatment, and what is the use of a horse being with a cat, along other matters. \n\nOr even why love is as rare as guts. I felt my saliva freeze in my neck and tears at the back of my eye-bulbs, when Don Bachardy raised to the camera the first drawing of Isherwood&apos;s dead head. \n\nOr why love is as frequent as ideology. If one bothers about the same sex marriage issue, thumbs up or down, mildly or not, that is if such a story can trigger a political, ideological statement or pronouncement, then one should bother also for re-balancing the debt towards people shock-treated. Recall how a broken, elderly Ted, Don Bachardy&apos;s brother, comes just a couple of minutes after the sly editing of his former, radiant and handsome self. And, even more sobering, how his brother&apos;s voice says, in a tone hurt, with all the could-have-beens of a life muffled, and still matter of fact: the shock treatment ruined his life. \n\nBut as this, too, begins to smell of ideology, I turn to what, how shall I put it, elevates to a higher degree the linear, ideological, biographical data of the film. \n\nThe day Chris Isherwood died, Don Bachardy commenced reading his diaries backwards. He wanted to reach back to their meeting. Now, for me, if there ever was an effective and affective definition of Jean Baudrillard&apos;s awkward phrase &quot;Things get their full meaning when played backwards&quot;, this is the case!\n\nTo make first things last, a true, a truly meaningful act of love!\n\nLike a poem by Elizabeth Bishop, namely her last one, simply and aptly called &quot;Poem&quot;. I would like to quote it in extent:\n\n(...) Our visions coincided - &quot;visions&quot; is \n\ntoo serious a word - our looks, two looks: \n\nart copying from life and life itself, \n\nlife and the memory of it so compressed \n\nthey&apos;ve turned into each other. Which is which? \n\nLife and the memory of it cramped, \n\ndim, on a piece of Bristol board, \n\ndim, but how live, how touching in detail \n\n\n* the little that we get for free, \n\n\nthe little of our earthly trust. Not much. (...)\n\nThank you."

Of course it isn&apos;t as good as the original, but this movie was just as gory, more action-packed, and had some very funny moments (they watched Mexican porno for a VERY long time in that motel room).  I was not disappointed watching this movie, because I didn&apos;t take it seriously.  I suggest you relax and give it a try, you&apos;ll laugh at how funny they tried to make this a good movie."

David Duchovny has good comic timing that hasn&apos;t really been tapped before, Orlando Jones is far better here than in Double Take and Say It Isn&apos;t So and Seann William Scott is a damn fine comic actor who uses his goofy charm to his advantage. Julianne Moore&apos;s constant falling over isn&apos;t funny, but you can&apos;t have everything. It&apos;s a shame that it flopped in the US, because it&apos;s really good. The special effects are decent, the turns are likeable and the script is loaded with sharp wit. OK, maybe some jokes go dead but seeing Orlando Jones getting lubricated after a bug enters his body and Scott singing to a flying monster in a mall is reason enough to go see this excellent summer blockbuster.",

Well of course they are no match for Myers, but Loomis does manage to capture Myers in chains and beat him to a pulp.\n\nGood performances, but badly filmed.  It looks like a made for cable movie.\n\n**/****",

      "reviewBody": "Elia Kazan&apos;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; is frequently listed among the greatest of all American films. It concerns a longshoreman&apos;s inner and outer struggles in exposing the corruption of union bosses.\n\nUnquestionably, the strength of the film is the acting. Brando&apos;s performance in particular is one for the ages. He won his first Oscar for this role and Eva Marie Saint also garnered an Oscar in her introductory film role. On top of that Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb &amp; Rod Steiger all earned Best Supporting Actor nominations. These accolades give an idea of the level of talent on display here.\n\nKazan&apos;s direction is well done as he strives for a gritty, realistic look. Shooting on location was an important part of that. Leonard Bernstein&apos;s score, on the other hand, is often overbearing. There&apos;s nothing wrong with the music itself, only the prominence of it.\n\nThe main area in which I feel the film doesn&apos;t quite deliver is the story. The film does a fine job of exploring the characters but I find that the underlying storyline doesn&apos;t really work for me. The main premise is a good one but after the initial confrontation I began to lose interest. The self-consciously &apos;inspiring&apos; ending doesn&apos;t help, either.\n\nAll things considered, I give the film high marks for the excellent acting and direction which, unfortunately, are in service of a merely average story.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was shown recently on cable; it was a refreshing change of pace. This 1948 movie, directed by Henry Koster, is a delightful experience for the young at heart and for those of us enchanted by the Irish folk lore.\n\nThe movie&apos;s plot is just a pretext to present Tyrone Power, one of the most handsome actors of the period, in a light comedy that takes him to Ireland, the land of his ancestors, to discover himself. The story is a fantasy, if not, how could we believe in Stephen&apos;s transformation by what he witness at the waterfall by the river, or his encounter with Nora at the inn? Not only that, but no sooner than he is back in New York, Horace, the leprechaun, makes an unexpected entrance in his life, and suddenly he discovers Nora riding the IRT?\n\nThis is a movie to be enjoyed because of the marvelous cast. Tyrone Power plays Fitz who is a different man from his experiences in Ireland. Fitz, evidently, having drunk the Irish whiskey, and eaten the Irish stew, is a changed man. Mr. Power plays this man effortlessly. \n\nEqually excellent is Cecil Kellaway. His Horace is a man that has all the magical powers to lure Fitz back to the &quot;old sod&quot;. Horace is a clever old man who can see right through anyone. Anne Baxter is also a great asset. Ms. Baxter and Mr. Power had a nice chemistry. Her Nora shows the right balance to attract Fitz and make him fall in love with her and with Ireland.\n\nLee J. Cobb&apos;s Augur, doesn&apos;t have much to do, but he is good as the man who wants to please his daughter above all things. Jayne Meadows made a rare appearance in the movie as Frances, the spoiled girl that wants Fitz for herself and will do everything in her power to get him.\n\nThis movie was a rare find. Watch it and cherish it with an open heart.",

You can tell that Richard O&apos;Brien and the film&apos;s producers had a bigger budget to work with. The songs are a match to the original (same song writer, same style...). Visually, a little too heavy on the reds, but this WAS 1981, after all. This movie will be enjoyed by those who will get the Rocky Horror references that are scattered throughout. Too bad Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon weren&apos;t there to provide a little more continuity to their characters. Jessica Harper does a great job though, she appeared in several off-beat movies in the 70s (&quot;Phantom Of The Paradise&quot; and &quot;Suspiria&quot; spring to mind) so playing in a Richard O&apos;Brien movie was not too much of a stretch for her it seems. This sequel was, to me, a lot sexier than RHPS. The original seemed to center on campiness and shock value, it&apos;s here as well, but there is a lot more eye-candy in this sequel.\n\nI&apos;m still waiting for a Richard O&apos;Brien / John Waters musical collaboration. Imagine the possibilities!"

      "reviewBody": "I became aware of this Italian Spaghetti Western only recently; it turned up both on late-night Cable TV (which is how I watched the film, though the English-dubbed German print bore no title or credits whatsoever apart from the concluding &quot;Ende&quot;!) and online. I had been impressed with the same director&apos;s subsequent effort in the same vein i.e. GATLING GUN (1968) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064013/usercomments-3 which, likewise, dealt with the American Civil War.\n\nA far-fetched subplot here, in fact, sees unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Andrea Bosic attempt to thwart the Peace Treaty signing between Confederates and Unionists because in that way his otherwise lucrative business would plummet! This is tied in with the central narrative which, typically, has a young man go after the villains who callously raped and murdered his sister – these happen to be members of Bosic&apos;s gang who ultimately first turn on their boss and then, out of greed, kill each other off!; along the way, our hero also saves nominal heroine Lea Massari and her younger companion from much the same fate!\n\nAs played by Craig Hill (from the recently-watched ASSIGNMENT TERROR [1970]), he evokes John Philip Law in the popular – and obviously superior – DEATH RIDES A HORSE (1967), proving an adept gunman but also getting a beating every so often (since he even has to contend with a corrupt sheriff, whose brash younger brother he had killed in self-defense, and his associates). The result, then, is a minor (and pretty forgettable) genre effort – but one that serves its purpose in the entertainment stakes; as is to be expected, the score (courtesy of Nico Fidenco) emerges as its main asset.",

      "reviewBody": "A British army colonel, pensioned off and embittered, assembles a motley group of specialist, criminal and deviant ex-officers who share his bitterness.  He has in mind a bank robbery.  They arm themselves, courtesy of their former employer, then execute the robbery impeccably, right in the centre of the City of London.  The bags of loot are filled, but, at the pictures, crime seldom pays....\n\nThat this film has been reviewed as a comedy demonstrates, once again, that British and American are two cultures disguised by a common language.  The humour here, of that characteristically British sardonic kind, is incidental to a drama of frustration, disappointment and inadequacy.  The humour is just the way the British speak.  \n\nThe clever and low key &quot;raid&quot; on the army training centre is finely done. So much so that it overshadows the robbery itself and therefore slightly unbalances the action.\n\nThis is one of those films, craftsmanlike and enjoyable, yet not desperately exciting, that finds its greatest value precisely in being a period piece. The League of Gentleman is a fascinating social document.  Made in 1959, it catches the moment in British history when, as its Empire dissolved, the social infrastructure that supported it and that had made Colonel Hyde what he had been, also disintegrated.  This aspect could almost have been deliberate, explaining the very long opening sequence (another unbalancing factor) that introduces us to the seven main characters.  There are shockingly frank moments: the honourable man with the overtly promiscuous wife; the gigolo; the religious fraudster (or pervert - the message is obscured); another of the heroes an &quot;other man&quot;, a homosexual; the pressure of life in a small house with a loud television set.  So, too, the casualness with which machine guns are used in a robbery by men trained in the code of gentlemen.  The dull and seedy presentation of Hyde&apos;s home and base, large but far from grand, is further evidence of the decline of his class.  So, too, a robbery that was intended as a hymn to the effectiveness of military planning, brought to naught by one stupid mistake and a small boy.\n\nYet this is not a sententious film, their is no preaching, none of that British nostalgia for the old ways, but almost a respect for the robbers and a recognition that life had to become more ruthless as a stiff society began to flex.  How it was elsewhere, I do not know, but this watchable film will show anyone what was happening in Britain just before the Sixties began to swing.",

      "name": "Varda is a genius.  This movie is unique.",
      "reviewBody": "La Pointe Courte (1955) was shown in the U.S. with its original French title. It was written and directed by Agnès Varda.\n\nAlthough this was Varda&apos;s first film, she already had the uncanny knack of knowing how to film intensely personal moments, how to film small group discussions, and how to film crowd scenes. She wanted to write about the village of La Pointe Courte, but instead decided to make a movie. She borrowed money, and she made this movie. Clearly, she was a genius, and we can see that when we watch to film. \n\nThe acting in the film was at a high level. Most of the actors were nonprofessionals, who lived in the fishing village of La Pointe Courte.\n\nHowever, the two leads: Philippe Noiret as Lui, and Silvia Monfort as Elle, were professional actors. (Although Noiret went on to become one of France&apos;s most popular actors, this was his first major role. Monfort was a professional who, by 1955, had already worked in theater and cinema.)\n\nWhat makes the movie unique is that it blended one plot--an ethnographic vision of the small fishing village--with another very personal plot. In the latter plot, Noiret and Monfort play a married couple who have come from Paris to La Pointe Courte, where the husband was born. They are having an existential crisis. That always sounds pretentious, but I really think it fits in this case. Husband and wife are questioning their nature as individual human beings, their relationship as a couple, and whether they still truly love each other.\n\nThey rent a room in La Pointe Courte, and then they talk. (Remember, this is a French film--an early example of what became the French Cinematic New Wave . That means the couple don&apos;t kiss, they don&apos;t make love, they don&apos;t fish or swim--they talk about their relationship.)\n\nMeanwhile, on the ethnographic side of the film, the people live hardscrabble lives because their income depends on the uncertainties of fishing. They are in a constant cat-and-mouse game with the public health authorities and the police, because they sometimes fish in contaminated water. As one character says, &quot;Yes, the water is contaminated, but I haven&apos;t heard of anyone dying because they ate our fish.&quot;\n\nThe good news is that the villagers help one another. It&apos;s clearly a cooperative situation, and that&apos;s how they survive. However, their life is hard, and they&apos;re always one step away from disaster.\n\nPhilippe Noiret, even as a young man of 25, gives us the first view of the talent that he developed over the years. Monfort was his equal as an actor. She was 32 when the film was completed, but looked no older than Noiret. She had an unusual beauty, unlike the perfect beauty of Catherine Deneuve. In fact, Monfort looks like an actor Ingmar Bergman would have chosen to star in one of his films.\n\nPeople have pointed out that some of the shots in La Pointe Courte resemble Ingmar Bergman&apos;s work. The fact is that Bergman&apos;s film Persona, which clearly has some similar shots, was completed in 1966, 11 years after Varda&apos;s film. My compliments to Bergman, who had the genius to recognize greatness in another director.\n\nIn many ways, the French Cinematic New Wave was a cooperative enterprise. The great director Alain Resnais was the editor of La Pointe Courte. Resnais had trained as an editor, but was already directing his own films in 1955. We can&apos;t tell how much his expertise helped fledgling filmmaker Varda, but my guess would be that his contribution was substantial.\n\nWe saw this film as part of an Agnès Varda retrospective in the wonderful Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester, NY. It would be better to see it on the large screen. However, if that&apos;s not an option, see it on the small screen. This film is both an aesthetic pleasure and a movie of historical importance. If you love cinema, this film is a must!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful film. On the surface it&apos;s about a musically gifted 13 year old boy from the country going with his father to seek fame and fortune. Underneath, it&apos;s about hundreds of things. Just like Tous les Matins du Monde it&apos;s about music but also about how people lose the love of music through the events that befall them. What I notice about &quot;Together&quot; (He ni zai yi qi) is the theme of ownership -- how it eludes those who seek it in music. The acclaimed music teacher, Professor Yu, reminisces in class on how much he loved music, how his love of Vivaldi flourished during the Cultural Revolution despite the threat he was under. But now at the height of his fame he does not enjoy music any more; he only enjoys power. The boy&apos;s other music teacher has lost his love of music by becoming dispirited and his life has become decrepit. But the film has many other themes. It could be about the inarticulacy of adolescence, especially one burdened with impossibly difficult feelings. It could also be an allegory about China. I watched it as &quot;Together&quot; with English subtitles, but one sensed that in Chinese it had other layers of meaning -- the notion of the scholar as venerated in Chinese society, for instance. There are some things not quite realized and the ending is soft-centered, but the acting by the son and especially his father is gripping. It&apos;s a film that would repay repeated viewings.",

Foster won a well deserved Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of a woman who is raped in a bar by a group of perverted drunks while everybody else in the bar encourages it. After the ordeal, she persistently seeks full justice for what she has suffered. Kelly McGillis, who had previously appeared as Tom Cruise&apos;s main squeeze in &quot;Top Gun&quot; lends credibility to her role as a tough DA. This genuine thriller of a film (which was based on a true story) deserves high praise for all involved."

      "name": "This Is... The Best British Film For A Long Time",
      "reviewBody": "I was lucky enough to attend the first UK screening of Shane Meadows&apos; latest offering, THIS IS ENGLAND, last Tuesday at the London Film Festival. Having been a fan of Meadows&apos; work since seeing TWENTYFOURSEVEN in 1998, I have anticipated each of his new films with excitement and great interest. Meadows&apos; films defy categorisation and always exceed expectation, as anyone who has seen A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS or DEAD MAN&apos;S SHOES will attest. THIS IS ENGLAND had a lot to live up to \n\nSet during the summer of 1983, THIS IS ENGLAND is the story of Shaun (Thomas Turgoose); a precocious twelve-year-oldcoming to terms with the death of his father. Shaun is soon inducted into a group of local skinheads; a fun loving bunch who spend days committing petty vandalism and listening to ska records. Although much younger than the other members of the group, Shaun endears himself upon them with his sheer determination and defiance, and is quickly embraced as their mascot. However, the frivolity and naivety comes to an abrupt conclusion when ex-member Combo (Steven Graham) is released from a spell in prison. Combo soon causes a rift within the group and becomes the catalyst for them becoming a militant, racist force.\n\nAnyone familiar with Meadows&apos; earlier work will notice many parallels between this and A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS; the film is told from a child&apos;s perspective and the corruption of youth/innocence is an underlining theme. Like ROMEO BRASS, THIS IS ENGLAND manages to balance the light-hearted and often hilarious, with menace and tension that&apos;s excruciating to endure. Many British films that attempt dramedy falter because one or the other/both is unconvincing, but Meadows manages to combine comedy and drama seamlessly; the laughs come thick and fact but the jolts come harder than a kick to the head.\n\nTypically for a Meadows film, THIS IS ENGLAND is exceptionally well written with some infectious dialogue and fully-fleshed characters, though one of the film&apos;s stand-out attributes is that of Danny Cohen&apos;s cinematography. Being a film set during the 80s, its look plays a significant part in the audience buying into the film. Many 80s-set films have been betrayed by garish lighting and ultimately end up looking like contemporary people parading around in 20-year-old clothing. Cohen&apos;s photography really manages to encapsulate the bleak feeling that was evident of the time, and is both gritty and dour. THIS IS ENGLAND is a film without polished aesthetics and one that has the raw visual style that&apos;s not be seen since the films of Alan Clarke (SCUM, MADE IN Britain, THE FIRM).\n\nIn addition to the film&apos;s look, Meadow&apos;s has raided the vaults for a whole host of archive footage leading thirty-something viewers on a trip down memory lane. The credit sequence alone features footage from Roland Rat, the Falklands and Knight Rider; As a child of the 80s, I literally sat in the cinema beaming  It&apos;s a great hook into a wonderful film.\n\nAs assured as Meadows&apos; writing and direction is, the film benefits greatly from its ensemble cast. Predominantly made up of teenagers, the cast of THIS IS ENGLAND excel beyond belief, without one putting a foot wrong. A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS&apos; Andrew Shim is superb as Milky, as is Stephen Graham as Combo - who gives a terrific and complex performance. However, THIS IS ENGLAND belongs to Thomas &quot;Tommo&quot; Tugoose  for a débutant child actor he is astonishing and effortlessly conveys the array of mixed emotions the material requires.\n\nIn conclusion, THIS IS ENGLAND is essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in film. Once again Meadows has set a precedent for British filmmakers and has eclipsed many of his contemporaries. THIS IS ENGLAND may not make for comfortable viewing but it is cinema at its best.",

Everyone was talking about the way Theron, &quot;the most gorgeous woman alive&quot;, transformed herself into Aileen. A prostitute who killed several clients. I thought Theron was just looking for success, another ambitious actress wanting a gold statue. That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn&apos;t matter for me then.\n\nBut everyone involved in this film deserve the credit. Monster is gripping. It&apos;s a film that makes you feel almost every emotion you can think of: sadness, anger, compassion, wrath. It confuses you. Do you identify with Aileen or do you disapprove of her actions? I guess both. You despise her for killing the men. But the film challenges that. You can almost explain (and thus condone) her actions. I guess the one thing that stayed with me was that it occurred to me what it must feel like to be really and utterly alone in this world.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the &quot;boys&quot; - Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy - it what many consider their last good comedy feature film, doing what they do best: short slapstick routines. It&apos;s almost a compilation of them, a series of routines more than a story with a plot. Stan and Ollie, between 45 and 50 years old when they made this film, were Hollywood veterans by now.\n\nFrankly, the comedy might be considered a little too corny for today&apos;s crowd but, hey, the movie is 70 years old. If you&apos;re a fan of these two comedians you should enjoy this film. Anyway, when anyone provides a lot of gags in just under one hour, you&apos;ll hit and miss a lot....but some things will always be funny. Some are still clever, too, such as the bit with the window shade being a shadow.\n\nYou can always count on Ollie being henpecked and Stan being an airhead (he&apos;s a WWI soldier who marched in a trench for 20 years not realizing the war is long over). Of course, if you think about it, that premise has more holes in it than the proverbial swiss cheese, but who cares? A good portion of this film involves the simple fact of Ollie and Stan just trying to walk 13 flights up the stairs to Ollie&apos;s apartment, and the adventures that happen to them along the way.\n\nAfter watching just 57 minutes of these guys pratfalls and slapstick routines, you&apos;ll be exhausted!",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the trailer to this film online and it seemed like a funny - yet unsustainable premise. I went to see it with friends anyway and I can&apos;t remember laughing so hard at a film in years. This movie takes a promising premise and knocks it out of the park. The cast is superb in this send-up of the psycho in the woods genre and the writing and direction take what I feared was an unsustainable premise and they give it surprising energy and humor. This is not Scary Movie crap. This is inventive and fresh and it has a beautiful heart. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the &quot;Hillbillies&quot; in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. Tucker and Dale never become plodding stereotypes of ignorant rednecks. They are portrayed with great wit and dignity and the actors never overreach or retreat into the safety and insecurity of broad camp. The cast trusts the writing and the director and it pays off. The script by Morgan Jurgenson and director Eli Craig is tight, smart and has a wonderful heart. These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC&apos;s 30 Rock. An especially guilty pleasure is the character of Chad, brilliantly played by Jesse Moss who channels some alternate universe version of a sociopathic Tom Cruise as the lead frat-boy. Eli Craig really guided home a winner with this film. The movie sets a course at the beginning and you know where you&apos;re headed in the first five minutes-- but Craig&apos;s the captain of the ship and this journey is filled with surprises and wonderfully subtle moments that give the film a fun trajectory and a brisk pace. You breezily travel through a fantastic, hilarious and utterly sublime entertainment. Bravo!",

Most of the jokes are only understandable for Hungarians or those who really know the language and culture of this nation. Magyar Vándor is gentle, funny and peaceful. The movie honours the great achievements of the Hungarian people and respects other cultures. Even the title is humorous, it refers to the gymnastic discipline invented by Zoltán Magyar, but it also refers to the story of the movie. I highly recommend it to educated Hungarians or those who live in a country with Hungarian minorities.",

      "reviewBody": "I just finished watching &apos;Batman: The Mystery Of The Batwoman&apos; on Cartoon Network, and was very pleasantly surprised! The franchise hasn&apos;t strayed from the Original&apos;s concept of telling a story well while keeping the tension going. &apos;Mystery&apos; is every bit as good as the first &apos;World&apos;s Finest&apos;, that featured Batman and Superman fighting the Joker and Lex Luthor!\n\nThe artwork, detail and sense of era (Love the 1940s Architecture and cars!) are splendid. The characters, solid. Especially Carlton and Katherine Duquenes. The plot, fairly straightforward. And the mystery and mystique of Batwoman is well kept. \n\nThere&apos;s just enough action. Right where it is supposed to be. Bane makes a surprising and admirable appearance. Though his voice really should be Ricardo Montalban&apos;s. The Penguin is just as slippery, sly, and cowardly as ever.\n\nIt&apos;s also nice to see Bruce Wayne having a little fun, without the Cape and Cowl.\n\nBig explosions. Cool Mini-Jets. Huge cliffhanger ending.\n\nWhat more could you want?"

      "reviewBody": "An admirable example of truth in labelling, Affair In Havana is about just that.  True, a couple of violent deaths result, but they&apos;re both crimes of passion, not the end-products of a typical thriller plot.  Affair in Havana, in fact, resembles nothing so much as a swift, steamy verismo opera, albeit one set to a Cu-Bop score.\n\nThis is the pre-Castro Cuba whose final days were so vividly summoned in The Godfather, Part II: Fulgencio Batista&apos;s venal, wide-open playground for wealthy Americans (the movie was filmed, by Laszlo Benedek, entirely on location).\n\nAt the airport, sugar-cane tycoon Raymond Burr, confined to a wheelchair and sporting a platinum buzz-cut, deplanes with his young wife (Sara Shane, who&apos;s again called Lorna, as she was the year before in Three Bad Sisters; judging by her performance here, she probably couldn&apos;t be counted on to remember yet another name).  Instead of heading out to Burr&apos;s baronial estate in the mountains, they dine at a Havana club where the high-strung jazz pianist (John Cassavettes) strikes Burr&apos;s fancy and so gets invited over to the table.  He seems uneasy, as does Shane, which is understandable, since they&apos;ve been carrying on a clandestine affair whenever she&apos;s in town. Nonetheless, Cassavettes accepts Burr&apos;s invitation to stay at the country place and play at his annual `fiesta.&apos;  There the points of the triangle spend suffocating, white-knuckle evenings sipping demitasses while Burr plays his tapes of native music at ear-splitting volume.\n\nWith, for the bulk of the movie, only the three principal characters on screen, Affair in Havana stays tense and claustrophobic.  This works only to a point beyond which It needs, however, something more in the way of incident and background.\n\nBurr seems to hold his wife responsible for an accident that caused his paralysis, but what happened is never revealed; He has also retained a private detective to take film of the illicit lovers, but we don&apos;t know what provoked him to do so, or when he first learned of her infidelity (was his asking Cassavettes to join them innocent or disingenuous?); And Burr&apos;s chauffeur/valet seems dog-loyal to Shane, smitten in fact, but we never learn why.  So when the plot threads converge in the final few minutes, it&apos;s not so much startling as abrupt.  Most of the movie doesn&apos;t prepare us for the end, leading us to wonder, Did the production suddenly run short of pesos?",

Time and place have been changed from the original version--we are now in 1913 Paris instead of 1900 Vienna--but the story is the same: a prostitute offers herself to soldier who resembles the only man she ever loved; the soldier goes on to seduce a housemaid, who in turn makes love with the son of her employer. Vadim and scenarist Jean Anouilh have eliminated the Raconteur (a fatal mistake), and so we are set adrift amidst well-upholstered sets and superbly dressed and coiffed ladies, lost among the vapid players, dull romantic talk and teasing glimpses of flesh. Jane Fonda lets her bare back steal her bed scenes. The dazzling opening credits sequence and Michel Magne&apos;s lovely background score are assets, as is Henri Decaë&apos;s rich color cinematography. *1/2 from ****",

I really like the costumes too. I think the kids were definitely the show grabbers for me. They were funny and acted business as usual which I found entertaining too.\n\nI found it odd that people were basically aware of the vampires and nothing was done about it\n\nThe movie isn&apos;t perfect but it is fun and I do recommend seeing it to judge for yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "Dr. Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) is in Tibet searching for the rare mariphasa plant that apparently only blooms under moonlight. Upon finding the plant his joy is obvious but it&apos;s quickly short lived as he is attacked by a half-man half-wolf type creature. He manages to fight off the creature but it does draw blood before retreating off into the mountains. Back in London, Glendon works tirelessly to get the plant to bloom under artificial light, neglecting his wife Lisa (Valerie Hobson) in the process. But that&apos;s not the only worry he has to contend with, with the arrival of the mysterious Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland) comes news of lycanthrophobia and the true value of the mariphasa plant...\n\nThe names Universal Studios and Werewolves go hand in hand (or paw in paw if you like). Automatically images of a pained Lon Chaney Jr howling at the moon come quickly into the conscious, yet quite some years earlier Universal had already ventured into the realms of lycanthropy. Firstly they had offered up &quot;The Werewolf&quot;, a silent short film in 1913 that sadly is thought to have long been lost in a fire in 1924, and then in 1935 they released &quot;Werewolf Of London&quot;. The first mainstream werewolf picture and first to feature anthropomorphic werewolves. It can&apos;t be understated just how important &quot;Werewolf Of London&quot; is in the pantheon of Universal classic horror. It also helps that it also happens to be a rather fine picture in its own right. Interestingly blending the werewolf legend with science fiction elements, the script is intelligent, the scenic sets impressive and director Stuart Walker keeps it taut and suspenseful.\n\nIn spite of what you may have read on some internet sites, the cast deliver the goods, particularly Henry Hull who it should be remembered is playing a vastly different type of werewolf to the one Chaney would play six years later. This is after all a wolf-man who pops on his hat and cloak and strides out into the dimly lit night. Hull also comes up trumps with the emotional aspects of Glendon. Observe the expressive acting as Glendon&apos;s cat turns against him, the hurt and then the horrific realisation of what awaits him is vividly portrayed during one heartfelt scene. Another sees Glendon proclaim &quot;Singularly Single, madame. More single than I ever realised that it was possible for a human being to be,&quot; this is fine stuff delivered with style and emotion by the well spoken Hull.\n\nThe support is very tidy from Hobson, Oland, Lester Matthews and Lawrence Grant, but they are unsurped by the comic relief that comes in the form of Ethel Griffies &amp; Zeffie Tilbury as batty bints, Whack &amp; Moncaster. A right couple of old dears who stick their noses in where they shouldn&apos;t and enjoy knocking each other out! I kid you not. Yet perhaps surprisingly this humour sits easily within the structure of the story. Another testament to the good work done by all involved. While rounding out the treats is the make up work from pioneer supreme, Jack P Pierce (AKA Janus Piccoulas). This is not one for the boo jump scare brigade, or even for those after a bit of old fashioned blood letting. This is tight story telling with a good production and acting to match. Twas a pleasant surprise indeed. 8/10",

Released in the Unites States a few years after its Italian premiere, the picture unfortunately was hacked to pieces so that it could afford more daily showings in theaters. What once was a nearly 3 hour epic was reduced to an incomprehensible 90 minutes. Nevertheless, the fairly large scope of the film manages to break through and the striking production design and visuals (even on a poor print in a less than satisfactory DVD transfer) somewhat make up for a severely truncated screenplay. A well-spoken English narration does help to tie the loose ends together. One can only imagine what the original cut of this film was like, but from the skeletal remains on view I suspect this was an above average sword and sandal epic.",

Martin Lawrence, on the other hand, has never been good or funny in anything he&apos;s every been in, ever, so no surprises from him.\n\nNow they&apos;re making a Bad Boys II.

She should not have even been a character. Her role has a slight effect on the movie but she seemed to ruin everything for Elio and Raul. You can tell that this film is not American by the way that the movie ends. It is a very harsh ending that most people do not seem to get unless if looked upon closely. In fact the ending of the film was the only part I did not full comprehend, if I was not for I my teacher I would have left the room thinking there was a decently happy ending.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Captain of Köpenick&apos; is a true story that could only have happened in Germany, where the authority of a uniform was (and still is?) obeyed without question.\n\nIn 1906, an obscure Tilsiter cobbler named Wilhelm Voigt (1849-1922) purchased the second-hand uniform of a Prussian infantry captain. Wearing this, he travelled to the borough of Köpenick and ordered a troop of guardsmen to place themselves under his command. He then declared the town hall to be under military law, ordering the arrest of the mayor and treasurer and confiscating all the funds in the exchequer. (In this version it&apos;s 4,000 deutschemarks, a tidy sum.) None of Voigt&apos;s orders were questioned, and he got away with the dosh. When he was eventually caught, the German people regarded Voigt&apos;s imposture as a jolly hoax that pricked the pomposity of petty bureaucrats. Although Voigt was clearly motivated by unlawful financial gain, he emerged from the affair as a folk hero.\n\nThis film is based on a stage adaptation of the original incident; I can&apos;t vouch for its accuracy. Some of the incidents here seem a bit far-fetched, but I accept that the original incident happened similarly to what we see here (although surely there weren&apos;t so many women involved). The movie is a comedy, and succeeds on that level. I was especially impressed with the performance of Fritz Odemar as the apoplectic treasurer. Still, in one sense this subject is no laughing matter. Let&apos;s recall what was the ultimate result of the Germans&apos; penchant for mindless obedience to authority figures. This story was funny in 1931, but a few years later nobody in Germany would be laughing. More as an artefact of its time than for its merits as a comedy, I&apos;ll rate this movie 7 out of 10.",

Jacques Tati was a fine physical comedian, in the same rank as Buster Keaton, and his Hulot character is perfect. If you like your comedy silent and beautifully observed, you will enjoy this film. \n\nWatching M. Hulot play tennis creases me up every time I see it. The character&apos;s whole physical demeanour indicates that he is not wired up in the same way as other humans, even when he is standing still. You could put this oddball in any normal situation and expect him to raise a smirk. \n\nTati does not carry the whole film and there is enough gentle comedy from the other characters for you not to get bored with his silent shtick. M. Hulot does not overstay his welcome.\n\nI guarantee that you will be humming the theme music for days afterwards. You won&apos;t have picked up any catchphrases from its eponymous star turn but it&apos;s an enjoyable, thoroughly French movie. If Steve Martin ever tries to remake it, he deserves to be shot.",

Many songs of her are about exile, the pain of losing your homeland and hope for a better future.\n\nThis documentary is quite neutral for those who are interested in Hayedeh work. Lots of footages have been used and story telling is perfect. The film is like a trip to Hayedeh&apos;s life which actually is a part of Persian history in 20th century. \n\nWith great admiration I have watched this documentary film a couple of weeks ago and I can only emphasize how much I enjoyed it. Not only was it a touching story, but also was I amazed by the great amount of material and information that the director have been able to collect on this legendary woman. The documentary beautifully outlines an honest narrative that I appreciated to fullest. From Hayedeh&apos;s honor and fame to her rumors and &apos;scandals&apos;; from her birth to the her post- revolutionary exile; from her death to her remarkable heritage.\n\nI hope Pejman Akbarzadeh makes more documentaries like this."

      "reviewBody": "The movie &quot;Margin Call&quot; depicts the events that immediately preceded the Financial Crisis in 2008 within a nameless Investment Bank. What I like especially about the movie is the fact that it doesn&apos;t try to explain the technical causes of the Financial Crisis but the psychological causes - human failures, which are the real cause for the Crisis: greed, egotism, ignorance. Many scenes in this movie deal with very little dialogue, instead the body language and the unique atmosphere speaks for itself. The ensemble is just brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.\n\nThe movie works solely from inside the nameless firm – apart from minor steps outside. It only portraits the people working inside this company - the &quot;normal world&quot; is completely left out. The effect is a very clever one: The life of these bankers seems totally severed from the outside world, they have no real connection with normal people and seem to – speaking exaggeratingly – lack an understanding of real human values, that there could be more behind life than just maximizing and making money. They are completely left behind in their own world, which somehow got out of control. Even when the imminent truth reveals and the consequences are becoming more clearer, it always feels like they are cut off; there is a scene in a taxi with Quinto and Badgley that underlines this.\n\nBut one can also witness the cold-blooded atmosphere in the system itself, where every person could easily be mistaken as a number. A key figure of the film, Eric Dale, who gets sacked in the beginning, is confronted with two managers in a scene like from &quot;Up In The Air&quot;. Either are these women robots or have never experienced something like social warmth. One widely held position is that eventually bankers themselves didn&apos;t understand their own system and products with Derivatives and Futures, etc. anymore. Almost hilarious, but sadly true is the fact that many people in these companies seem to have no understanding of Economics and just got into their position due to influence or money. When they are sitting in their conference room and discuss the incident, it feels somewhat grotesque.\n\nAlthough this movie works almost completely without music, the tension is so immense - thanks to the brilliant actors - that one is forced to focus."

      "reviewBody": "I guess this is a mockbuster of Avatar 2 but the only thing the two movie have in common is that the place is called Pandora. It had the feel of an unrelated sci-fi script that had the Pandora clumsily pasted on. It&apos;s pretty clear that the moon of Pandora was originally an asteroid for example. The spaceships look decent but all of the other effects are really cheap and bad. The water effects somehow look much worse than they did in The Abyss in 1989. The alien moon of Pandora is clearly just California with a blue filter. They don&apos;t even try to make it look alien. The director seems to believe that shouting=intensity. The characters are CONSTANTLY SHOUTING. Almost every line of dialogue is SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. The only actor who seems to know that his character is supposed to be in the military or something is Tom Sizemore. None of the other characters are at all believable as either military or scientists. They come across as more like a bunch of teenagers BLURTING out whatever comes into their minds AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. The plot is stupid. The reveal is stupid and you will see it coming a mile ahead of time anyway. That is if you decide to waste your time watching this thing. I would recommend not doing that.",

A single mom inherits a summerhouse in southern Sweden, and she moves there with her two children. There is poetry and mysticism surrounding their newfound existence but the children also experience difficulty adapting to their altered conditions. The story was originally a three part series made for television, and that may explain why it tends to get a bit whimsical but still quite sympathetic. The film did not fare well at the box office, so for a number of years Birger Larsen turned to the field of advertising. He also contributed to TV films and series before returning to feature films with another children film &apos;Superbror&apos;.",

Theresa addresses us frequently throughout the film, amongst her scenes, even telling us about a chicken spot that&apos;s not so good. We have a few flashbacks, showing us at one stage, she was married, and you&apos;ll love how her low class husband, thanks her after a meal. This was one of a few scenes I just didn&apos;t buy, and too the drama, gives away to comedy. Set really over the course of a day and night, the film has her nasty pimp (Benjamin Moulton, a great underrated actor) chasing her down. In some flashbacks, we see the two, making out, or going to dinner, and like me, Russell doesn&apos;t approve of Sushi, either. Moulton, who has a little time too, addressing the audience, really brings an uncomfortable side to his pimp role, and in being nasty, it isn&apos;t overplayed or forced. Coincidentally, he starred in another R Rated film, Basic Instinct, with a minor role, which came out the same day. I really liked Russel&apos;s performance, who&apos;s star double which happens to be Kathleen Turner, reminded me a lot of the Turner prostitute role in Crimes Of Passion, where the tone and speed of the voice are much the same. Freaky too as Crimes Of Passion was done by the same director. Whore is not what I call good, but it&apos;s interesting, where the movie really shows a funny if farcical (and I use that word heavily) side to the oldest living profession.",

Besides the fact that Arjun Rampal is doing a good performance, I found pretty hard to understand who had the money, who finally is good and bad, and why there are so many changes in the gangs&apos; composition. I kind of was lost but enjoyed watching it. It&apos;s action, action, action and lots of blood. Well, it&apos;s not Devdas or Yuva. But the mix between Bollywood and the famous scene in Switzerland is well done."

      "reviewBody": "After what seemed an endless parade of the same old clichés in Spanish cinema (down to earth comedy, ETA, boring introspection, plain cinematography, tiresome editing, reliance on the Filmax horror clichés) this film, &apos;Proyecto Dos&apos;, came as a much needed breath of fresh air.\n\nThe very first sequence is, simply put, stunning. The cuts and visuals - quite reminiscent of those of Tony Scott - rose eyebrows as a solid Adria Collado delivered his speech about how brain mistakes can create deja vu. All this was told in parallel with a private wake were a guy is putting inside a small box someone&apos;s personal belongings before saying &quot;Farewell, my friend&quot;. Only when he closes the box we realize that the character who is speaking about having all those deja vu is really dead. All the visuals and editorial effects were so cool and never before seen in Spain that you are already transported to a different way of seeing the movie.\n\nAnd that way is mainly non stop action and intrigue. All the time you are guessing what comes next. Probably one of the most shocking moments happens when **SPOILER** the main character is killed by a bus at minute 20 or so and, then, shortly afterward, he is entering is home **END OF SPOILER**. The plot thickens with each sequence and the more we learn about the main character&apos;s wife, the more interesting the characters become in this thriller about identity crises.\n\nLucía Jimenez - one of Spain&apos;s most beautiful and idiosyncratic actresses - is superb in her role of wife who keeps a huge secret, and show the expected prowess in the action sequences . She has the big, strong physic for that and she really delivers.\n\nBut the real standout of the movie are the last 40 minutes. No Spanish movie has ever attempted - and succeeded in doing so - to have that non stop action, including car chases, explosions, gunshots and a three-way parallel masterfully solved. The emotional climax on the rooftop is equally well solved in way that is quite reminiscent of Alejandro Amenábar &apos;Open your Eyes&apos;.\n\nIn short: the best Spanish thriller ever and - hopefully - a film that can show the way for different things in the predictable world of Spanish cinema.",

      "name": "The German JD Classic that Made Buchholz a Star",
      "reviewBody": "Most of German and Austrian mainstream cinema of the fifties was light musical comedy, sentimental drama or &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; (escapist love stories, set on the countryside - the Alps, Black Forest or Lüneburger Heide - glorifying natural environment, folklore and the &quot;virtues&quot; of the plain and simple country folk). There was hardly a realistic view of (West-)German society during the years of the &quot;Economic Miracle&quot;. Young author Will Tremper did not like that sentimental stuff. Obviously influenced by Hollywood teen dramas (&quot;The Wild One&quot;, &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;) he and director Georg Tressler in 1956 realized Germany&apos;s first look on juvenile delinquency, a film that is now regarded a classic of German post-war cinema. This one is hard, raw and realistic, omitting any false sentimentality or romanticism. Out of all German film made in the fifties it is my personal number one! The cast is fantastic, above all the lead triangle: Horst Buchholz as Freddy the leader of the pack, barely 16-year-old Karin Baal as &quot;Sissy&quot;, a teenage &quot;femme fatale&quot; (Don&apos;t mind her name, she has absolutely nothing in common with the Romy Schneider character!) and Christian Doermer as Freddy&apos;s ambivalent younger brother Jan. The rest of the gang are roughly characterized and do a great job as well. Paul Wagner and Viktoria von Ballasko as Freddy&apos;s and Jan&apos;s parents as well as Stanislaw Ledinek as the Italian running an ice-cream parlor also give great performances. The storyline is as follows - In an indoor swimming pool Jan meets his brother Freddy who had moved out after a quarrel with his father, an embittered tyrant. Jan knows that his parents need 3,000 Deutschmarks (quite a lot in those days) to pay their debts. Jan asks Freddy who pretends to have a good job if he could help them. Freddy says yes, while preparing a mail car robbery that would not only allow him to help his parents but to fulfill his dream - buying a Buick Cabriolet. Jan, who seems to smell something fishy, nevertheless accompanies his brother... No spoilers, but young Baal has a great scene as the &quot;bad girl&quot;. The film was shot on location in West Berlin and has nearly everything you are longing for - dark alleys, petticoats, leather jackets, American cars, dances, sex and crime. The only thing missing is Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll. The jukebox only plays conventional jazz music. But all in all this is of minor importance. In 1957 &quot;Die Halbstarken&quot; could be seen - in a dubbed version, titled &quot;Teenage Wolfpack&quot; - in Britain and the US as well. After &quot;Die Halbstarken&quot; Tressler made many films and TV productions until the 1990s. Tremper continued as a screenwriter and director of nonconformist films. He passed away in 1998. While Buchholz became an international Star and died in 2003, Baal and Doermer have made their own careers in German Film and Television. They are still (2006) around and can frequently be seen on TV.",

The attempt at a mystery ending fails lamely.\n\nThe production is poorly done, especially the audio which frequently over-peaks and causes voice distortion especially during outdoor verbal interactions. There is constant background &quot;music&quot; which amounts to pretty much noise and annoyance. Most of the dialog is fraught with echo from poorly placed audio microphones.\n\nIf the plot was at all intriguing or with proper development, this movie might have been fair to tolerable. But unfortunately for one of my favorites, Piper Perabo, the effort fails miserably."

Story kept me guessing all the way through which i like, i did think i had the plot figured out at one point but i was way off the mark. Loved the general pace of the story and the fact that the script was so honest and uncompromising. I also enjoyed the more general theme of our living in a society in which we are being watched constantly without our knowledge and the privacy questions that generates. Highly recommended.",

On the other hand, &quot;Beer&quot; is no more offensive than some &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits. The acting is very good, with Rip Torn, Loretta Switt, and David Alan Grier, especially memorable. Kenneth Mars, in a supporting role, steals every scene he&apos;s in. There is some slapstick, along with at least a bunch of dark humor. Three average guys become heroes to the average American beer drinker, while their commercials make Norbecker Beer sales surge. &quot;Whip out your Norbecker&quot;.

The Group of bad actors filled the screen with boredom There were some moments in the movie which failed to click I wish if they took some more time and a better director and the whole movie could have been a memorable one, The whole theme was good and could have attracted a large young audience but failed and the use of CGI were also useless.",

      "reviewBody": "A lot of the reviews have said that this film is one of the weaker recent Woody Allen movies, but I actually thought it was his best since Husbands and Wives. It&apos;s much more subtle but every bit as scathing as Deconstructing Harry. Everyone says Woody&apos;s films just aggrandize himself, but I feel that his latest few have been exercises in self-loathing.\n\nCertain people (in these very pages) have felt that one is supposed to sympathize with the Branagh character. Certain people, we must remember, are on crack. Branagh plays a low-life louse who gives the word narcissim a whole new meaning. He is looking to revitalize his life by entering the world of celebrities. He is contrasted with his ex-wife (the always amazing Judy Davis... who doesn&apos;t she do more films?) who is also looking to change her life, but not necessarily by becoming famous. She does become famous, and near the end she says what I think is the key line: &quot;I&apos;ve become the kind of person I&apos;ve always detested, but I&apos;m happier.&quot; My friend and I had an argument later about what the film was saying: a) that Judy has given up on seriousness and meaning by becoming a celebrity, but now she&apos;s happier, or b) that the &quot;entertainment products&quot; that these people turn out don&apos;t matter at all, and that if one can find personal happiness (Judy eventually becomes much more social and comfortable with people) by doing them, then that&apos;s great. I don&apos;t know, but this is a far more interesting treatise on finding happiness than the dreary &quot;Happiness&quot; was.\n\nThis is also the funniest Allen film in years, with two total laugh-out-loud lines which I won&apos;t spoil here.\n\nOverall, I felt the celebrity part, and all the walk-ons we not at all the focus of this movie, it just uses that world as a backdrop. This film is also very sweet and real, with the scene in which Judy Davis visits a psychic being one of the most intimate and touching I&apos;ve seen.\n\nOne last thing, it&apos;s fun to see a Woody Allen film in New York City, because you can watch the audience trying to identify all the places where the scenes are set.\n\n--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

Sword-and-sorcery saga with silly action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes with witchcraft and necromancy . This is a tale of fantasy , magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical primitive world of barbarisms. This is an amusing adventure saga inspired on Robert E Howard&apos;s pulp tale , it stars Brigitte Nielsen ( by that time married Silvester Stallone) who join forces with the mythic and valiant warrior Kalifor ( a super-swordsman Arnold Schwarznegger in a brief guest spot), a Hyborian Age hero , a Conan-alike , taking on heinous forces of devil and evil minions . A nasty sorceress kills the keeper (Janet Agren) of a powerful green bulb that gives her great power , but Red Sonja is sister of the keeper and seeks vengeance on villainess Gedren who also massacred her family . A selfish little boy prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his underling Falkon (Paul L. Smith), whose kingdom was wiped out by Gedren soon joins them . They undergo on a perilous trip to find the talisman , confronting magicians , spectres and dangerous adventures. Our heroine fights the evil hoodlums of brutal Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) who seeks the total power and leading a vibrant ending.\n\nThis exciting film packs noisy action, fantasy, adventure, witchery , and rip-roaring fights . Dumb images , unintentionally hilarious and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for an Italian/Netherland/US co-production and lavishly produced by Dino De Laurentiis , her daughter Francesca and Jose Lopez Rodero. This entertaining picture contains frenetic action , tension , necromancy, and moving action scenes . The film is full of freaks and bemusing situations ; it is quite entertaining because being a laborious and intriguing adventure tale with some humor . Colorful cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno , Federico Fellini&apos;s usual . Very derivative special effects , grand production design by Danilo Donati ,and matte paintings by Albert Whitlock and Emilio Ruiz del Rio . Impressive musical score composed and conducted by the master Ennio Morricone. The motion picture is middling directed by Richard Fleischer . He&apos;s an expert director , with adventure classics (Vikings, 20.000 leagues under sea) and noir cinema (Narrow margin,Clay pigeons,Trapped). The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with enough action to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Conan enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because thrills, action and adventures are brilliantly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 5,5 ; it&apos;s an old-fashioned B film on an acceptable scale and basically enjoyable because of it.",

What where they expecting from a movie with this kind of plot? \n\nOn the other hand, I found the movie a LOT more entertaining than expected! I had &quot;normal&quot; expectations for the movie, thinking that I would have sat having a decent time for a couple of hours. Instead I found myself laughing out loud most of the time! Eddie Murphy proved to be in great shape, as just his facial expressions were enough to set the audience on fire! The movie was also carried on in a smart way, without turning boring or too obvious. \n\nThis is STRONGLY suggested if you have kids!",

As a work standing on it&apos;s own it is wonderful, goofy, and good fun. An excellent piece of musical film-making.  The casting is superb and I still laugh throughout the movie.  Dated?  Somewhat.  Perhaps only superficially.  &apos;N Sync was just in town and their effect here makes me think there&apos;s something fundamentally timeless about the behavior of teenage girls.  I&apos;ve heard it was the same when Frank Sinatra was a young singer. And there may be something timeless about us guys too... I&apos;m still a sucker for the beginning and ending with Ann-Margret singing.  She opens the movie sounding like a whining petulant little girl and at the end her reprise is as a worldly sophisticated sex-kitten.  Just too cool."

      "reviewBody": "It would seem from the majority of the comments on this film that very few of the people making these comments have any real insight into film production or what some film makers are attempting to communicate to an audience. With that in mind, here are some things I discovered upon viewing this film: (1) The story is new and unique. Thank goodness for any film that is not a sequel, a remake, or a film based on some decades-old television program. (2) The director uses the Xenophobia most Americans have about Europe and the citizens of those countries to very good effect. He plays on those fears, throws fuel onto that fire, much like Tobe Hooper did with rural areas in the U.S. in &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. (3) I was impressed by the build-up of uneasiness leading up to the torture scenes, the prevading sense of something &quot;off bubble&quot;. If the characters had not been tenth-degree horndog party animals intent only on having a good time, they might have been more suspicious of the strange events taking place around them, which - in my mind - justifies the scenes of debauchery to show how oblivious these guys were. (4) A great number of things often have to be done in a film to appease The Studio. I saw several scenes that appeared to be included seemingly at the behest of The Studio for &quot;saleability&quot;, and were not necessarily included for story-telling. There is also a desire to &quot;one-up&quot; each other in the Studio System, which publicly decries sex and violence while unofficially tells Producers to &quot;give us more, and make it even more shocking than (fill in the blank)&quot;. All-in-all, while this film is not for the squeamish, it does have some things to say that create discussion and dialogue about a number of things, from how we view foreign cultures to how we treat each other. Any film that can generate that kind of thought while providing innovation deserves applause.",

      "reviewBody": "Full Moon entertainment was one of the main sources of new horror films during the early 90s. With low budgets and very creative minds, they put out some of the best horror movies of that decade, always walking in the fine line between horror &amp; tongue-in-cheek comedy. Among those movies was &quot;Demonic Toys&quot;, a very funny movie dealing with a demon possessing a group of toys.\n\nJudith Gray (Tracy Scoggins) is a cop who, after a failed undercover operation where she lost her partner (&amp; lover), gets trapped inside a warehouse while chasing for the criminals she was supposed to catch. One of the criminals gets hurt and his blood awakes an ancient demon. In the form of a kid (Daniel Cerny), the Demon will use his powers to transform the toys into killing machines, in order to posses &amp; become Judith&apos;s unborn child. To survive, Judith will have to join forces with the people who by coincidence or fate, was in the warehouse at the same moment.\n\n&quot;Demonic Toys&quot; is not a serious horror film, it is packed with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor that makes a very entertaining movie. The plot is an interesting one, and while it could had worked as a serious film, it is quite good as this silly comedy. This is one of those movies where all the negative parts just increase the camp factor and become watchable.\n\nThe acting is good for a movie of this characteristics. Tracy Scoggins may not be a good actress, but she is a beautiful lady and gets the support of the underrated Bentley Mitchum, as a young delivery boy in a role reminiscent of Bruce Campbell&apos;s Ash of the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series. Also, Daniel Cerny gives a remarkably good performance as the incarnation of the demon. He is definitely one of the most underrated child actors ever. The rest of the cast has good moments, but nothing really special.\n\nThe SFX are average for the most part of the film, but it also has well-done gore and specially a brilliant stop-motion animation in the end. While the dialogs are at times corny, the silliness makes the film better, as the toys are funny instead of scary. The &quot;baby&quot; is very good as comic relief and I would compare it to the humor of the recent sequels of &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot;.\n\nObviously, the film has big flaws, and most are caused by the low-budget. The lack of diverse locations make the film look always the same, and some of the SFX look really cheap. However, most of the times this just adds to the cheesy fun the film delivers.\n\nThis is definitely not a very good movie, but it is good material for a video night with friends. 6/10",

In this regard, the film is largely successful. It is, perhaps, most affecting when seen AFTER the Tarkovsky&apos;s oeuvre and documentaries.",

      "name": "A troop of commandos-for-hire led by Dolph Lundgren are sent  to an island to submit natives",
      "reviewBody": "Commando adventure in which ex-Special Force mercenaries carry out a dangerous mission set in a Thai island . This action-packed picture concerns upon a bunch of commando-for-hire who is assigned by two businessmen as financial backers to obliterate a little group of natives (B.D. Wong , Charlotte Lewis , among them) at an island of Thailand . But the financiers hire another bunch as back-up , in case they run into problems . The commando is led by a tough, two-fisted mercenary (Dolph Lundgren) . He contacts an inmate (Tommy Lister) , a soldier-woman (Catherine Bell) and several more (Tom Wright, Don Harvey, Anthony John Denison, among others) . The adventure starts when the expert band of mercenaries disembarks on the coast and goes to deep inside the jungle to destroy the village . But they decide to defend rather than destroy the inhabitants of the far island . As they help out the jungle&apos;s natives against other mercenaries( Trevor Goddard , Aldo Sambrell). The mission meets unexpected turns and twists when they&apos;re betrayed by their financial backers . Meanwhile they find some caves in middle of jungle where encounter the valuable Guano or bat&apos;s crap . \n\nThis fast-paced film packs adventures , large-scale blow-up, routine plot , drama , and lots of action for the most part . Based on the interesting screenplay by prestigious John Sayles , a magnificent writer and director . Has some weak moments which break up the continuity of the movie but generally is a good story and well told . It results to be a graphical depiction of a team of professional mercenaries driven by nothing but quest for power and money , being commanded by Dolph Lundgren in one of the best roles . Large support cast formed by various actors who subsequently would get successful careers as Thomas Gibson (Criminal minds) , Catherine Bell(JAG) , Don Harvey , Kevin Thige , Trevor Goddard and several others . Cinematography by Rohn Schmidt is quite nicely , capturing the atmosphere of everywhere , from Thailand to a pretty cool jungle , furthermore some stirring images filmed with camera above the shoulder . Vibrant musical score fitting to action by Gerard Gouriet . The motion picture picture is well realized by Perry Lang who also plays a secondary role . This is his second and last movie -the first was ¨Little Vegas¨- subsequently Lang would direct numerous TV episodes as ¨ Millennium, Charmed, One tree hill , Everwood, Alias, Weeds. .¨\n\nThe film was made in the wake of ¨Mercenary sub-genre¨ as the classic ¨Wild Geese¨ by Andrew McLagen with Burton, Moore and Richard Harris and ¨Wild Geese II¨ , plus ¨Dogs of war¨ by John Irvin with Christopher Walken and recently ¨Tears of the sun ¨ with Bruce Willis and Monica Belucci and many others . Rating : 6,5 . Better than average. Well worth watching .",

      "reviewBody": "While the muppets did exist before this, in skits, this is the first muppet story that was told. But except some interesting peeks at some early versions of a couple of them, most of the muppets in this movie are original characters. There&apos;s no Kermit. But there is Henson, Oz, and other puppeteers, and there is the creativity and love for the craft that you see in their later work.\n\nIt seems like the used the chance to explore the technological limits of puppetry, as there are plenty of whole body shots, muppets flying in/through the air, arms and legs being in use, and so on. There&apos;s some scenes with lots of activity going on, and there&apos;s full body costumes too. All in all, it&apos;s impressive how much you see them doing already in this TV movie, early on in their career.\n\nThe movie itself is alright. The plot is uninspired, but it does not take itself too seriously either. It&apos;s mostly an excuse for fun gags and technical experimentation, and for that it works brilliantly. I loved the gag where the elfs are gradually replaced by the bad guys, and how it affects the song they sing.\n\nAll in all it&apos;s a highly recommended watch if you like the work done by the Henson studio, and alright if you want a Christmas movie to see with your younger kids.",

Well needless to say it was such a cute story and had some funny moments and some really sad moments, my kids, along with myself really enjoyed it. It&apos;s definitely a Mexican classic and a great movie to watch with the ol&apos; folks, too. I only wish the DVD came with English subtitles. P.S. it&apos;s a great way to motivate our younger generation to be fluent in their mother language (Spanish). lol",

It lacks couple things that would make the audience believe in the story. The main problem, I believe, is the characters lack depth. The constant flashbacks waste a lot of time telling the same story three times. Therefore, although the movie is fairly long, there are not enough scenes for each character to develop and show us their personalities. The setting is also unbelievable as well. A bunch of Koreans in Netherland, especially one working as a cop and one working as an assassin, does this feel like a credible story? \n\nThe movie is somewhat entertaining, the actors and actress did a good job, the cinematography is pleasing but I just feel disappointed that all these good effort did not add up to a good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I have one serious problem with this film, which I will address in a bit. To begin, FRIENDLY ENEMIES was a dramatic play that ran an incredible 440 performances on Broadway from July 1918 to August 1919. The cast was made up of popular New York actors of the period, most of whom are today forgotten. The play was first adapted to the screen in 1925 and starred the Dutch-act comedy team of Lew Webber and Joe Fields. And therein lies the problem of this faithful-to-the-period talkie remake. Cast as two German patriarchs now ensconced in America are Charles Winninger and Charles Ruggles. Both Charlies were very fine actors with great comic timing. But for some reason director Allan Dwan had them emulate Webber &amp; Fields&apos; vaudeville-style Dutch accents rather than use more realistic dialects. He would have been better off using authentic German-American actors. Felix Bressart and Jean Hersholt would have been perfect. Ilka Gruning, who plays Winninger&apos;s wife, was Austrian and her authentic dialect was perfect. Much of the power of the dialogue was lost to distraction in the leading players&apos; exaggerated accents. As always, Otto Kruger is very fine as the villain in the piece, understated and chillingly threatening. As with all Edward Small pictures of this period, the production values are first-rate. And, as with most Edward Small pictures of this period, FRIENDLY ENEMIES is very difficult to see. Keep an eye out for it. It remains a timely and thoughtful story.",

A bit more levity and spice might have helped; this seems awfully tame for 1967. Welch&apos;s sassy installment involving the bedding of an elderly banker is the liveliest of the lot. *1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "I have actually gone in here and altered and added to my original comments to make them a little less one-sided.\n\nDid you ever have one of those mutant pets, like a cat with six toes on its front paws, or an extra ear? Well I didn&apos;t either, but you can imagine what it must be like. You&apos;d love the thing all the more because of its flaws, because it&apos;ll never be perfect, and because it needs someone to love it. And such is my love for &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979). It is an interesting story that is rendered and explored in a mechanical manner--although visually, in terms of its set design and special effects, it is really stunning. \n\nIt&apos;s a Disney product, and like &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture,&quot; it was put on the slates mainly to cash in on the space opera craze that &quot;Star Wars&quot; had ignited. Movies are commercial art, they exist to make money (hopefully entertaining us at the same time); and the Disney people got their best film-making talent together, assembled a dynamite cast, and cranked this out, in a very lavish and polished way, production-wise. The money is slathered all over the screen, and everything is handled in the tried-and-true Disney Studios fashion of preplanning and choreographing everything down to the tiniest of details (actors don&apos;t even PAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LINE unless it was dictated, planned and rehearsed that way)...this was very near the end of Disney&apos;s run as a major producer of live-action features, and &quot;The Black Hole&quot; is a fitting finish. It even features cute touches, like the way the nastiest demise is saved for Anthony Perkins. If you&apos;re gonna make a slow, mechanical movie, you can at least do it with style, and they did. It is an impressive production. \n\nIn a certain way you might say I love/hate the movie. The methodical way it&apos;s constructed seems lifeless. But at the same time, it is a strange joy to see its methodical construction. It takes tremendous energy to create something so controlled. It&apos;s certainly not a film made by accident or unconsciously.\n\n&quot;The Black Hole,&quot; manages to be strangely trance-inducing. Once I put it on, it&apos;s hard to turn it off."

      "reviewBody": "Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they&apos;re able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.\n\nFalsely categorized as &quot;torture porn&quot; (the violence and gore here are more in line with &quot;Seven&quot; than &quot;Hostel&quot;), this film was the first smart horror film of the 2000s. Intelligent horror fans not only got the blood they wanted, but a clever villain and a mystery to solve. Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of &quot;Lost&quot;, and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.\n\nThere has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze &quot;Saw&quot;, injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the &quot;militarization&quot; of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a &quot;military&quot; setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw&apos;s workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators&apos; intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to &quot;Seven&quot; to &quot;Saw&quot; with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Rope&quot; offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.\n\nYou can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film&apos;s writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key&apos;s location is revealed. I can&apos;t discuss this in a review, but let&apos;s just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen &quot;Saw&quot; yet, see it. And see the second film. After that, they start to go downhill. But the first two are quite good and must-see viewing for all horror fans.",

After that, it&apos;s mostly two-minute actualities from about 1900. That doesn&apos;t mean that this type of movie is unknown to me. Movies about people in sports coming to learn the true meaning of their game may not be as common a theme as people learning the true meaning of Christmas, but it crops up regularly. As an American, it&apos;s usually about baseball or our version of football.\n\nSo this movie about how Gustav Froelich is the best player on a small after-work soccer team, caught between the love of Evelyn Holt and the allure of Lissy Arna and her professional team is pretty much a cut-and-dried plot. It&apos;s also a bit slow and solemn -- William Haines or Joe E. Brown would have disposed of this story in 75 minutes with a lot more good humor. Co-director Vincent Korda shoots some interesting soccer moves, but the game is assembled through strenuous editing, very high-speed for the era --longer takes would have been better, but between the difficulty of shooting an extended sequence and the excitement of short cuts, it was the obvious and cheap choice.",

      "reviewBody": "We first meet Al Fountain (John Turturro) at a remote construction site in the country, where he is the foreman. Immediately, we recognize who and what he is: The Boss; obsessive and meticulous about the work, tenacious in regard to detail. At the same time, it is obvious that he is sorely lacking when it comes to his relationship with his crew. Not that he is a bad guy; neither overbearing nor abusive with his employees, he is, in fact, somewhat personable in his own way. It&apos;s just that everything in his vision is so clearly cut in black and white. In the world of Al Fountain there are absolutely no shades of gray. This is further established when he phones his wife and young son to check in and give her an update on the job. When he tells her that one of the guys has invited him to play poker that night (much to the chagrin of the rest of the crew), she is ecstatic and encourages him to go. Clearly, she loves him, but knows how he is. When he quizzes his son on his multiplication tables and the response is unacceptable, flash cards are ordered. When Dad gets home there will be another quiz. In a brilliant metaphor, we see the flash cards as they are perceived by the boy; they are huge, nearly as big as he is, Marley&apos;s chains he must carry wherever he goes without respite. \n\nWhen the job is abruptly closed down, Al finds himself with some time to reflect on his life, which he uncharacteristically embraces, prompted by an incident at the poker game the previous evening. At this point the story really begins, and we follow Al on a drive through the country, which ultimately becomes a journey of self-discovery. Along the way he meets &apos;The Kid,&apos; (Sam Rockwell), a charismatic, though somewhat naive young man who lives alone in the remnants of a trailer situated on a secluded parcel of land far off the beaten path. It is a lifestyle that Al, initially, simply cannot comprehend. When The Kid explains that he lives &apos;off the grid,&apos; it is beyond anything Al can fathom. In the end, this movie is a textured tale of awareness and the importance of setting one&apos;s personal priorities. Extremely well presented and acted, it is touching and poignant without the unnecessary burden (in this case) of undue sentiment. \n\nThe supporting cast includes Catherine Keener, Lisa Blount, Annie Corley and Dermot Mulroney. In &apos;Box of Moonlight,&apos; writer-director Tom DiCillo offers us a journey that is well worth the taking. I rate this one 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for &quot;Steve Pulaski Sees It.&quot; \n\nLiving in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan&apos;s unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan&apos;s legacy didn&apos;t stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.\n\nIf we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan&apos;s versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan&apos;s departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from &quot;Moron Mountain&quot; to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.\n\nThe Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the &quot;Monstars&quot; of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.\n\nAs an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray&apos;s interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.\n\nBecause both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would&apos;ve seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don&apos;t try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.\n\nStarring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird. Directed by: Joe Pytka.",

Direction and performances are restrained, which thankfully suits the film (none of the gimmicks that damaged the US remake of Ring). And the bleak ending really packs a punch. Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ted Bundy&quot; is definitely one of the most unpleasant viewing experiences I struggled myself through this year, but - then again - that is only logical since the actual Ted Bundy also was one of the most unpleasant persons to ever walk the planet&apos;s surface. And then still, I certainly don&apos;t have to complain about feeling unpleasant, because the (too) many people that crossed paths with Bundy, notably the victims and their families, truly must have gone through hell.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, there was a gigantic wave of true crime movies about US serial killers. Since horror cinema was going through a long non-fertile and uninspired period, this was a God&apos;s gift for many directors (*) because portraits of real serial killers don&apos;t much of a plot. All the notorious figures received one or even several biopics: Ed Gein, Aileen Wuornos, Zodiac Killer, John Wayne Gacy, BTK-killer, Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez, the Lonely Heart Killers. Ted Bundy could not be left out of this list, of course, but just as Bundy himself was an unusual killer who could not be classified within the known profiles, his biopic also can&apos;t be compared to all the routine and inferior films about other serial killers.\n\nWhy is &quot;Ted Bundy&quot; worth your time if you have the stomach for it? For starters because there was a multi-talented and promising (at the time, at least) director involved. Matthew Bright demonstrated, with the excellent &quot;Freeway&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Trick Baby&quot;, that he doesn&apos;t avoid sensitive taboo subjects like teen prostitution, drug addiction and child abuse. He was the ideal man to narrate the shocking but story of Bundy as raw, nihilistic, and disturbing as it really was.\n\nSecondly, Matthew Bright was enormously &quot;helped&quot; by how absurd and unfathomable the facts in the case of Ted Bundy were. His story is one of those that simply must be factual because, if it had been written as fiction, people would claim it&apos;s totally implausible and unrealistic. How is it possible that Bundy made so many victims and remained under the radar for so long, even though his modus operandi and means of transportation were so conspicuous? How can a woman remain so loyal to a man who abuses and humiliates her, like Bundy did to Lee? How can it be that someone like Bundy escapes from jail twice or receives declarations of love from hundreds of women after his conviction? The explicit violence and cruelty in this film is often hard to look at, notably the scene in the cabin and the &quot;submission fantasy&quot;, especially when realizing this freak and monster could do whatever he pleased for several years.",

      "reviewBody": "Long ago, I saw the original 3:10 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford, but I don&apos;t remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold&apos;s new remake. Instead, my review will focus exclusively on the new film.\n\nMangold&apos;s film is a tense, traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer, and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold&apos;s film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are, respectively, Dan Evans (Bale) and Ben Wade (Crowe). Evans is a would-be rancher and family-man whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord, and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan&apos;s eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while Wade&apos;s crew of murderers dogs their every step.\n\nTwo performances stood out for me - Bale and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Crowe was good, but it&apos;s not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles, and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely (Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda and others). The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.\n\nMore often than not, good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are &apos;shoot-em-ups&apos;. After all, it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die, or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story&apos;s development and the cinematography. For a western, there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film, coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him, and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protégé Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite, and Dan&apos;s son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn&apos;t being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gun-fight, it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising, ambiguous and more than a little ironic.\n\nHighly recommended for western fans.",

But I watched I love the 80&apos;s one time and they brought up this movie and it looked pretty funny. It had some really nice comedic moments with both Arnold and Danny, they were both so naturally funny and clicked so well together, you&apos;d almost believe they were related, they were so in sync.\n\nIt&apos;s about Arnold and Danny being separated at birth, it was meant for only Arnold to be born and just turn into the perfect human being, he pretty much is, he&apos;s kind, sensitive, funny, and disciplined. But there was a side effect and all the badness was born into Danny, Arnold learns he has a brother and flies to New York to see him. Arnold is more obvious as the one who wants a family while Danny is just trying to get his way out of debt with the Mafia.\n\nTwins is a fun little comedy that I think anyone could enjoy. Although, it&apos;s not my favorite comedy with either Danny or Arnold, they still had so much fun that you couldn&apos;t resist this film. Especially how Arnold sings &quot;That good ol&apos; rock -n- roll&quot;, just hilarious! \n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "PRIVATE&apos;S PROGRESS, the first of the Boulting Brothers&apos; series of satirical films - produced by themselves in association with British Lion - is a bit of a structural ragbag, with a comic look at army training followed by a dangerous (yet successful) mission to steal German art treasures.\n\nStanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael) is an upper-class twit studying at Oxbridge who is plucked from his safe life as undergraduate to serve as an officer in World War II. He proves totally incompetent in his army training, despite the best efforts of Sgt. Sutton (William Hartnell) to train him. He encounters a variety of colorful characters, notably Private Cox (Richard Attenborough) as well as Commanding Officer Hitchcock (Terry-Thomas) who is prone to describing his charges as an &quot;absolute shower!&quot; Having left camp without commission, Windrush is co-opted into a secret mission run by his uncle Bertram Tracepurcel (Dennis Price) that involves a trip to Germany. Disguised as a Nazi officer - although he knows no German - Windrush bumbles his way through the scheme, only to discover at length that its purpose was not what he first assumed.\n\nPRIVATE&apos;S PROGRESS follows a familiar path trodden by other Fifties service comedies, notably RELUCTANT HEROES (1951) and CARRY ON SERGEANT (1958) - with Hsrtnell appearing once more in the latter film as an exasperated sergeant. The Boulting Brothers seem intent on showing how many of those on active service during World War II were manifestly unsuited to the task; the fact that Britain actually emerged triumphant was almost in spite rather than due to their efforts. At the time the film was made Carmichael was gradually ascending to stardom; having played another bumbler in SIMON AND LAURA (1955), he was to repeat the same role in I&apos;M ALL RIGHT JACK (1959). The Boultings surround him with a gallery of other incompetents, notably Terry-Thomas, Kenneth Griffith, Victor Maddern and Ian Bannen.\n\nOn the other hand the film makes some serious points about the levels of crime that took place during the war. Con-artists such as Tracepurcel and Cox flourished at that time, taking advantage of their secure jobs in the services to instigate a series of illegal operations. The fact that are both are found out at the end of the film has more to do with the prevailing codes of censorship at that time, rather than their own ineptitude. Spivs made a highly lucrative living during the Forties, and PRIVATE&apos;S PROGRESS shows explicitly why that was the case.",

      "reviewBody": "I found the film immensely interesting. You see the decay of urbanity from the eyes of a woman (&apos;D&apos;) hiding in her bastion of civilisation, a council flat. Her impregnable retreat is suddenly breached by the intrusion of two factors, the imposition on her by an unnamed authority of an orphan called Emily, and her sudden realisation that beyond the wall lies the past? the future? or perhaps an alternative world told through the various incarnations of a house she visits as an unseen entity.\n\nWhile the brutalised orphans of the streets outside seem to be beginning to supplant the authorities and are accelerating the end of the world. D realises through her wall, that the condition of her society is not new. Society grows from strict disciplinarian routes, and when achieved embarks on a decaying relaxation of morals which inevitably ends in the collapse of society. Those that are necessary to rebuild society are not necessarily nice people, merely essential, thus we arrive at the Gerald character. Eventually Emily and Gerald rescue the savage (troglodyte) children of the subways, and with the help of D and the wall, take them to a new Eden, where the children will be able to begin a new society starting from caveman.\n\nIt is obvious because of the cannibalistic nature of the children that Gerald, Emily and D will not survive this process, but their action is essential to build anew, and the children will begin without the memory of their former civilisation&apos;s decay. Thus we are brought from the end of the world, to the beginning of a new world for the orphans of the old. Most people believed that the collapse of D&apos;s world was a prediction of the collapse of our own, but perhaps our world is actually the one behind the wall. That is up to you.\n\nThis is an intensely moving novel produced by a woman of feeling who had witnessed the brutalisation and savagery of war at close hand and understood the nature of the fall of society. Not an action film, but a masterpiece that many will not understand because of its intensely philosophical nature."

Jane discovers a printing machine for banknotes in her new home. Has she just married &quot;The Forger of London&quot;, or who else could be responsible for the counterfeits? Funny enough, Peter doesn&apos;t know that himself because he seems to be a victim of schizophrenia... which Jane once dryly describes to him thus: &quot;Can you imagine how interesting it is to have a husband who never knows where he wakes up?&quot; Typical music by Martin Böttcher, unusual story, powerfully directed by Harald Reinl - a good movie, even if none of the most popular in the series. Apparently the producers tried to break fresh ground here instead of repeating a formula, and this courage is one reason why the Edgar Wallace series lasted so long.",

      "reviewBody": "Evil Dead is a remake of the 1981 original &quot;the Evil Dead&quot;. I didn&apos;t have the chance to watch the original yet, so I&apos;m going to review this without comparing it with the original.\n\nThe movie actually starts out pretty slow, for the first 40 minutes there isn&apos;t any creepy parts and it actually bores me. Usually, movies start off slow to develop they&apos;re characters or stories, however, I find the first 30 minutes unnecessary. However, Evil Dead deserves its wait. Evil Dead has some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes I&apos;ve seen in movies. There&apos;s blood EVERYWHERE and the movie make them look real good! The movie mostly uses makeups and proves that a bloody movie can stand by its own without CGI. \n\nAnother thing I like about Evil Dead is the directing. There are many beautifully-shot scenes which makes the movie very enjoyable. For example, the director sets the cameras in different angles, such as the floor or close to the wall, which makes it extraordinary from other films.\n\nOn the other hand, Evil Dead lacks character developments, but for its own sake, bloody horror doesn&apos;t really need character developments. Characters make stupid decisions and eventually will die out one by one, so it&apos;s not really a big deal. \n\nThere isn&apos;t really a plot or twists in Evil Dead. Everything is presented directly. If you haven&apos;t watch this without watching the trailers, the movie is what you thought it will be. \n\nEvil Dead is enjoyable for a movie night if you do not care too much on the details. Just sit back and enjoy the gore, it&apos;s real fun.",

      "reviewBody": "When they say they don&apos;t make movies like they used to, this is the sort of film they are talking about. Despite its flaws (and there are some), it is easily one of the best musicals ever made. Beginning with the overture and the opening scenes of New York City, circa 1960, it almost screams &quot;classic.&quot; Some have criticized Natalie Wood&apos;s Maria (her dubious accent and the dubbed-in singing) or Richard Beymer&apos;s Tony (his slightly smarmy interpretation of the ex gang member gone straight), but the fact remains, their wholesome, fresh-faced characterizations defined the roles. And you simply can&apos;t top the film&apos;s instrumental score, its great songs (&quot;Maria,&quot; &quot;Tonight,&quot; &quot;America,&quot; &quot;I Feel Pretty,&quot; &quot;A Place For Us,&quot; &quot;I Have a Love,&quot; and &quot;Officer Krupke&quot;), its excellent choreography, or its very effective cinematography. Rita Moreno, as Anita, delivers what was probably her best performance in the movies, in particular her dancing and singing in &quot;America,&quot; while Russ Tamblyn, as Rif, the charismatic leader of the Jets, is seldom given the credit he deserved. Natalie Wood on the rooftop, anticipating another meeting with her newfound love, is a vision of grace and innocence, while George Chakiris as her brother Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, is very convincing as the persecuted immigrant/mean-spirited hoodlum. And its not as if these are the only actors who did a great job. A number of the other supporting roles are delivered with memorable professionalism, too. In fact, the cast as a whole is superb. \n\nThis movie poignantly (if simplistically) explores the purity of first love, while tackling intolerance and racism head-on, avoiding the tired, politically correct clichés that movies of today too often wallow in. Despite the simplicity of the story, it is always an emotional experience, no matter how many times you&apos;ve seen it. While it is true that the Academy Awards have become very politicized, and no doubt always were to a degree, this movie snagged ten of them when great movies were being turned out almost as often as mindless pap is today. Not to be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "The Last Kiss, a film by Tony Goldwyn (Yes son of Samuel Goldwyn) was adapted from the 2001 Italian film L&apos;Ultimo bacio, and written for the screen by none other than Paul Haggis. The Last Kiss goes through a number of relationships, spanning a number of different ages, and dissects the hardships of those relationships. Zach Braff seems to have upgraded his acting from Garden State and might actually become a more dexterous and talented actor than previously perceived. Paul Haggis&apos; wonderful dialog lends greatly to the reality and adversity that co-exist alluringly within this screenplay. This film has been incorrectly advertised as a romantic comedy that puts Braff in the middle of two girls, and he cannot decide which one he wants to continue his life with. This is simply not true. The film is about a group of people that have just seen what the rest of their lives are going to be like, and want to add a small bump in the road of life. Overall the film does a lot more than your average romantic comedy/buddy film, and shoves the afflictions and austerities of modern-day relationships in your face. This is not the greatest of date movies, like the trailer wants us to believe, and should be perceived as a more earnest and pensive film than it appears.",

I was originally expected Blair Witch Project type filmography, but the video was actually better than I thought it would be.  The movie on the other hand was absolutely dreadful!  Not only was their a non-existent plot, but the author completely changed the legend of the Jersey Devil!  No Mother Leeds? There were so many obvious errors in the movie, it was really an amateur production.  The theatre booed loudly at the end.  I heard no less than 10 people comment that it was the worst movie ever.

To to bring this again and again, but not telling about the awesome dubbing would not be justified for this movie especially, where the majority of the cast was from the hindi film industry. Two things can be suggested here. This movie has some shocking scenes which rocked the namby pamby facade of the then bengali film critics and their self made taboos.

The character arcs were compelling. However, the last part is absolute trash. While you could attempt to draw meaning from the chaotic final segment, the sad truth is that it feels like a forced attempt to meet certain Netflix requirements. This results in a disjointed and out-of-place segment that leads to an ending that ultimately goes nowhere.\n\nStill, I think it was worth watching, at least for the first half, especially if you are a fan of the first movie. The early brilliance somewhat makes it a worthwhile experience, even if it doesn&apos;t fully deliver in the end.",

He developed a deep. loving relationship with a gay ex-priest, which soon morphed from being lovers to the deepest of non-sexual friendships, so Miguel would prowl the night and take on sexual partners in the days before anyone really understood what a potential death sentence that had become. \n\nWith his illness he was pulled between his soul mate who wanted him to be himself, and his mother, who wanted him to repent his sinful life, so that he could get into heaven. Meanwhile, the rest of the family was to varying degrees at least more empathetic with Miguel&apos;s sexuality, but were afraid to anger his mother by questioning her.\n\nIn exploring this history many years later film-maker Cecilia Aldarondo discovers family secrets, torn up hearts and souls, and her own desire to make sense of her family&apos;s unresolved pain. \n\nA film full of deep emotions, but not histrionics, it quietly looks at how we all try to be what those who love us want and often end up pulled impossibly in multiple directions because of it.",

      "reviewBody": "Night Editor is directed by Henry Levin and adapted to screenplay by Hal Smith from the radio program of the same name - by Hal Burdick - and the short story, Inside Story, written by Scott Littleton. It stars William Gargan, Janis Carter, Jeff Donnell, Coulter Irwin and Charles D. Brown. Cinematography is by Burnett Guffey and Philip Tannura, and music is credited to Mischa Bakaleinikoff, though it&apos;s believed that Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco did the work.\n\n&quot;You are just no good for me. We both add up to zero&quot;\n\nA raging &quot;B&quot; pic out of Columbia? Absolutely! This is something of a film noir lovers delight. There is no getting away from the fact it has one of those endings that has proved to be divisive, so how it stacks up for first time viewers now may make or break your opinion of it...\n\nStory finds copper Tony Cochrane (Gargan) having a love affair with viper like Jill Merrill (Carter), this in spite of the fact he has a gorgeous loving wife and a son who worships him. During one of the illicit couple&apos;s love trysts they witness a violent murder, and fearing scandal Cochrane fails to uphold the law. From such decisions does life often spiral out of control...\n\nOkies. So we got hot and sweaty scenes, flashbacks, wet streets lit by lamps, alleyways, barely lighted rooms - particularly the station offices - symbolic and metaphorical sequences (oh my those crashing waves), but it&apos;s the barbed dialogue, the blend of sex and violence, and a femme fatale of considerable greatness, that ultimately makes this soar.\n\nPersonally I hate the ending, but as stated before, I do know noir lovers who find it cheeky and enjoyable. Yet even with my irritation at the finale - and of Carter&apos;s hair style (which pushes Phyllis Dietrichson for most unflattering look), there&apos;s just so much good here for noir lovers not to enjoy greatly. 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "A most delightful film with Cole excellent as the likable stooge in this very British kind of cold war satirical romp through a range of class and national stereotypes, specific to the 1950s cultural landscape. The perils of The Bomb and Communism are sent up with English understatement and in the camp machinations of a host of excellent supporting comic actors. The farcical but oddly understated farce drives along with a brisk pace &amp; under clever noir-like art direction. Much of the material is most topical for its time and so provides an interesting time capsule of British life emerging in the wake of war, including of the ubiquity of &quot;high&quot; indedible guest house kippers.",

      "reviewBody": "In New York, the Catholic Italian musician of the Stork Club Christopher Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Balestrero (Henry Fonda) is a simple man, married with his beloved wife Rose (Vera Miles) and having two sons. On 14 January 1953, his wife needs an expensive teeth treatment, and Manny goes to the insurance company, trying to raise a loan. However, he is wrongly identified by a clerk as the man who robbed the place twice, being arrested and sent to jail. His friends pay the bail and he tries to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Rose has a nervous breakdown, caused by her mistrust on his innocence, and is sent to an institution for treatment.\n\n&quot;The Wrong Man&quot; is a very sad and touching story of the injustice against an innocent man, affecting the health of his family. Henry Fonda is amazing in the role of an ordinary man, who accepts passively the situations, believing in God and praying for strength and justice. Vera Miles is fantastic in the role of a wife who believes she has part of the guilty for the action of her beloved husband. This movie was filmed in many authentic locations, and is a very different work of Alfred Hitchcock. Maybe due to the theme being so serious, Hitchcock appears only introducing of the story, and does not have any other small participations as he usually does in his movies. The black and white photography, with shadows, and the score of Bernard Herrmann, complete the magnificence of this great underrated movie. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Homem Errado&quot; (&quot;The Wrong Man&quot;)\n\nNote: On 10 November 2024, I saw this film again.",

More for the intellectual art-house crowd than those interested in &apos;J-horror&apos;. And while one can surely see where the film is going, you still find your breath tightening when you get there. Not a film for everyone, but I liked it well enough for what it is and didn&apos;t view it expecting it to be what is isn&apos;t.\n\nMy Grade: C+",

      "reviewBody": "Slightly disturbed and painfully shy Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) is sent away to summer camp with her foul-mouthed cousin Ricky Thomas (Jonathan Tiersten). Not long after Angela&apos;s arrival, things start to go horribly wrong for anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions.\n\nThis film is either loved or hated, and with good reason, but it has been embraced more and more as the years go on by fans of the horror genre. The acting is excessively cheesy, especially from Desiree Gould, but purposely so. The kills are grisly and nasty, even if not always shown on screen. When that curling iron strikes, you know the situation. And the pedophile cook? Oh man... that is pushing boundaries that even horror films dare not cross (Freddy Krueger can be a child killer, but not a child molester).\n\nOne cannot vouch for the next two sequels, which have little connection to this film, but the original stands as a true modern classic, and if you have not seen it, you are really missing out on an important piece of horror history. What could have been a ripoff of other horror slashers that take place at camp (notably &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;) turns out to be far different from any other title out there. And keep in mind the whole crew, more or less, had just come from &quot;Creepshow&quot;, so these were folks who knew what they were doing.\n\nWriter-director Robert Hiltzik (who graduated NYU with Ang Lee) mysteriously went decades without directing again. Many of the actors also never acted again, at least for a long time. And then you have Christopher Collet, going on to make such things as &quot;Prayer of the Rollerboys&quot;... does that make him the biggest success from this film?\n\nNot only does the film get better with repeated viewings (which make the humor and camp more fun), but there are actually some clever subplots that will likely be missed on the first time or two. Mel Kostic (portrayed wonderfully by the late Mike Kellin) not only is one of the best characters, but has his own story and relationship with the campers and counselors that may not be immediately evident.\n\nThe Scream Factory Blu-ray is ridiculously good and worth owning. Beyond the excellent presentation, it has three different audio commentaries, where you learn odd trivia like Felissa Rose&apos;s husband Deron Miller meeting her as a fan, and much more. There is even a short film showing whatever happened to Judy (although it is not very good).",

      "reviewBody": "Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th Century to work in the sugar cane fields. Most came planning to return to their homeland, but few were ever able to do so. Equally movingly portrayed is the fate of Japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15-years out of date, or were of some other younger man. They too worked long hard hours in the fields, while fighting homesickness and to preserve their dignity.\n\nDirector Hatta&apos;s portrayal of one picture bride&apos;s courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical duress, is, ultimately, inspirational and uplifting--a story of moral and cultural survival. There is a grandness and magnificence of sweep of character and landscape in Picture Bride that captures the alluring beauty as well as violent harshness of colonial Hawaii. This is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding.",

      "reviewBody": "One word sums up how I felt while watching W: uncomfortable.\n\nI went into this film expecting more of an absurdist comedy than a tragedy. The level of realism was far beyond what I expected. For the most part, the cast, makeup, and casting crew did such a good job with the characters that it was very easy to imagine that these were not actors on the screen but the actual people. Josh Brolin&apos;s characterization of W was certainly Oscar-worthy.\n\nEven better than Brolin&apos;s part was Phedon Papamichael&apos;s photographic direction. The job of the Director of Photography is to bring the story to life through the creation of images to draw the attention of the viewer where the Director wants. Few films are as good of an example of this as W. Papamichael used the camera to force moral and emotional perspective in a way that I have rarely seen outside of the films of Stanley Kubrick. I&apos;ve only seen the film once, viewing it as a complete work. I intend to watch it again to study the photography.\n\nOverall, I thought the film was fair in its treatment of the actual people involved. The most ardent Bush supporters will not like it, but to still be that supportive of him in the final months of his second term, you either have to not be paying attention or be uncritical in all of your thought. While artistic license was taken throughout the film, the portrayal of all events and people, with the possible exception of Dick Cheney, were far more grounded in reality and recorded history than I expected.\n\nThe film made me uncomfortable on multiple levels, which is why it succeeds and deserves such a high rating. The portrayal of Bush&apos;s relationship with his parents, especially his father, forces the viewer to feel sorry for him. The overt religiosity that pervades the public service portion of his life must anger anyone who believes strongly in the separation of church and state. There are many moments when, with any other characters, the film should have generated much laughter. Only one moment in the film actually caused more than one person in the theater to laugh. I guess 4000+ dead soldiers drains the humor out of even the most hilarious gaffes.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of historical events. I wish Stone had waited until Bush was out of office to make it, though. While it captures the major events that were involved in building the Bush legacy, it ends far too early.",

Like all of the Bard&apos;s works, his endurance is not only the mastery of language, but really in storylines that just never get old. Above, everything else, Hamlet is an interesting tale. Olivier&apos;s interpretation however, is very dark. Very deliberate. He shies away from the humor completely, and instead takes a slow, purposeful tack. To that, it might not appeal to some. In such a long play and movie, the humor is sorta needed to jostle you a bit, and break the overall bleakness of the tragedy. You don&apos;t catch a break here I&apos;m afraid. Id classify this therefore as for more advanced taste, and not for the average moviegoer. Olivier&apos;s other two attempts, Henry V and Richard III, specifically the latter, will garner more mainstream appeal."

      "reviewBody": "You can always rely on Enzo Castellari to knock things up a notch, and even though he had me worried (and a little confused) at the pacing of this one, it all leads up to major kick ass ending. \n\nAfter the film seemingly randomly shifts between Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Colombia and New York, the film finally settles in Rome, as we see Fabio Testi getting busted for carrying drugs into the country. At the same time and in the same place, another guy who&apos;s just arrived from Amsterdam is tailed by cop David Hemmings, who gets duped by the dealers as big old Romano Puppo gets away with the goods. \n\nYep, Hemmings is hot headed, potty-mouthed cop out to take down a huge drug cartel, and he&apos;s the only guy who knows that Fabio Testi is an undercover cop. Things get pretty difficult for Testi as he works his way into the dealer&apos;s trust via a junky guy with his own sub plot, and nothing ends up going to plan as everything results in a huge chase at the end that uses feet, motorbikes, and finally, planes. I think there&apos;s a deep meaning to all this, and that is &quot;If you deal drugs, Fabio Testi will shoot you.&quot;\n\nYou&apos;ve got the usual Enzo back up crew here: Massimo Vanni (who does his &apos;riding a bike downstairs&apos; bit), Joshua Sinclair as a suave dealer, Romano Puppo as another dealer, and even Enzo himself turns up to mug for the camera. Sherry Buchanan turns up as the junky guy&apos;s girlfriend, but she really just turns up to be naked for a minute or two.\n\nI found it strange that there&apos;s an obvious stunt double doing even the most routine of stunts for Fabio, but then it&apos;s Fabio himself doing all that crazy crap with the planes later. I did burst out laughing when a guy pulled a particularly strange face when getting shot in slow motion. \n\nIt does seem however that Enzo is kind of making some sort of comment about the hippy life being dead and leading to horrible addiction, because the drug taking here is shown in all its glory and when you see a guy licking spilled heroin from a toilet seat, it doesn&apos;t exactly entice you to go take the stuff. Well done Enzo!",

If you loath Nolte to the very depth of your being, you need to see it even more. His energy here would fill a dozen lesser films - only the remarkable supporting cast keeps him from single-handedly burning the movie down. \n\nA huge number of American films from this period are massively overrated.

I was gutted and after being granted only temporary accreditation, 3 days, I soon realized that I was at the most famous film festival in the world and I could not get in to see any films.\n\nHowever one day we investigated the film market, where I happend upon the troma stall, with severed heads dangling form the cielling and a short jewish man shouting to a crowd of people to meet tomorow for the annual Troma march, it was Lloyd Kaufman, I recognized him because a friend of mine is a Troma fan, but I was not.\n\nHowever he was the only guy there who had time for us, we explained the robbery and the nightmare we were having, he went out back and came back with &quot;all the love you Cannes&quot; on DVD. He gave it to me for free and said this is what I made.\n\nAfter watching it, and being at the festival myself, I can tell you that this is honest and real. You can see the frustrations of being a small time film company battling against the big guys, like warner bros. You can see the troma team attacking themselves and it feels like the whole thing will fall appart, but you also feel that next year they will be back again to fight on.\n\nAll the love you Cannes is funny ,informative, and very dramatic at times. Its rough around the edges but at least its honest, which is hard to come by. Ive got my tickets for Cannes 2004 (round 2) hope to see Troma there too.",

      "reviewBody": "Definitely a Dario Argento film here. No question about it. The film&apos;s plot concerns a young girl ,having read a book about three &quot;mothers&quot; who live in France, Germany, and her hotel in New York, investigating the place she lives in for a key. The girl contacts her brother going to school in Rome - anyone buy Leigh McCloskey as a student of musicology? - asking for help. The three mothers are...well, if you know you are a step ahead of me.\n\nThis Argento film is very problematic. On the one hand its genius cannot be denied when it comes to visual artistry and suspense building. Argento paints a scene like no other film maker I know, with the exception perhaps of Mario Bava(who worked on this film...his last). The vibrant colors used throughout the film are surreal, and some of the scenes are lessons in scene building. The underwater sequence is an awesome scene, yet its has virtually no place in the film&apos;s plot. Another scene involves a crippled man falling in water and slowly being devoured by rats. His cries reach a diner cook working late, who runs outside to stick a knife in the poor man&apos;s throat. His character or an explanation never come. How about the key? Never mentioned again. Visual brilliance cannot make this a good film, though it really works hard at it. I found myself not really understanding what was going on yet loving the scenery. As with most of Argento&apos;s work, we get plenty of bloody deaths, particularly young girls and crippled older men. Inferno is not a bad film nor is it a great film. It has many qualities found in Suspiria, but that film made a great deal more sense and had some actors that had a bit more talent than those involved with this. McCloskey&apos;s stage presence is akin to driftwood. He is a very poor lead. Alida Valli is back as a permed hotel manager. She gives a good performance though her part has almost no real significance in the film. I guess my gripe is that how can a director with so much obvious talent like Argento just cross the line too much between reality and imagination. If your audience doesn&apos;t have SOME guidance then how are they going to know what you are trying to achieve. Some reviewers say you need to watch this film many times to get its point. Balderdash! I could watch it ten more times and still would not be able to make the aforementioned connections in the plot. I could easily sit through the film again though, because of Argento&apos;s style of using film as a canvas. If Inferno had a better constructed plot, something along the lines of Suspiria, this very well could be a minor masterpiece. It is definitely worth a look; however, though it pales in comparison to Suspiria in every way."

      "reviewBody": "Random Harvest is very fondly remembered and loved by many and for good reason. It is such a beautiful film in so many ways and one of the most moving films I&apos;ve seen. Random Harvest is a splendidly made film, both sumptuous and Expressionist and still looking as fresh now as it did then. The period detail is rendered handsomely as well, not accurate perhaps but with the quality of how the film looks that doesn&apos;t really matter all that much. The music has that lush romantic feeling without being too syrupy, the use of Tchaikovsky&apos;s Swan Lake was apt and will be a delight for classical music enthusiasts(count me as one). The script has the right dose of warmth and pathos with nothing being corny or overly-sentimental; this is a script with heart. As has the story, which is romantic to the hilt, heart-warming and incredibly touching, you&apos;re guaranteed to need tissues when Charles doesn&apos;t return to Paula after going to Liverpool and when his memory starts to come back. I was so engrossed by the characters and so touched by the story that any improbabilities were easily forgiven. Mervyn Leroy&apos;s direction is masterly and the characters are sweet and very human, complete with one of the most realistic and heart-breaking portrayals of shell-shock on film. The supporting cast all give solid performances, Susan Peters is utterly convincing in her feistiness and confidence and Reginald Owen, Henry Travers and Edmund Gwenn are always watchable. But the two leads dominate and are a huge part of the reason why Random Harvest works so well. Ronald Colman was a revelation, wistful and dignified but it is also very difficult to not tear up at Colman&apos;s body language when his memory starts returning, a very telling piece of acting. Greer Garson is just radiant and is wonderfully sincere in her role. Their chemistry together is just pure magic. All in all, beautiful and outstanding film, cinematic romance at its finest. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The sixties were a very hard time for Julien Duvivier.He was despised,tried for academism by the burning court of the nouvelle vague. He did not realize that he was much more than them,and thus,he tried some new tricks,some coming from the &quot;modern&quot; artists:the baroque castle might evoke that of &quot;l&apos;année dernière à Marienbad&quot;,and he hired two young actors ,one Chabrol&apos;s favorite,Jean-Claude Brialy,the other George Franju&apos;s darling,Edith Scob,and he tried to imitate Godard&apos;s &quot;driving scenes&quot; in &quot;à bout de soufflé&quot;.\n\nWhat&apos;s bred in the bone comes out in the flesh.Like Marcel Carné before him(&quot;les tricheurs&quot;),Duvivier could not do &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; stuff,and anyway he&apos;s better at so many other things ,so why bother?John Dickson Carr,whose novels are extremely complicated, provided him with a very strong screenplay:the starting point is the authentic poisons affair,during the Sun King&apos;s reign;the marquise de Brinvilliers was one of the main convicts and she died on the scaffold,betrayed by a cop dressed up as a monk.In Brialy&apos;s and Claude Rich&apos;s uncle&apos;s desirable property,come an historian and his wife who is (believe it or not) a Brinvilliers&apos;s descendant.That&apos;s not all: the uncle is himself the cop Desgrez&apos;s descendant.And there&apos;s a curse,à la &quot;hound of Baskerville&quot; ,which has stroke every Desgrez since the marquise died. The uncle is a wealthy and ill old man whose death would be the welcome for his two nephews.It won&apos;t be long till it happens.\n\nDuvivier managed to sustain suspense throughout the whole movie,with excellent scenes :the bal,with the mourners waltzing to Strauss music\n\naround the coffin wide open;the foggy ,misty atmosphere of the park;the strange woman who seems to walk through a wall.But he did not succeed in linking the rational and the supernatural together.Edith Scob&apos;s character has no connection with the rest of the plot,and Dickson Carr&apos;s ending which allowed some doubt ,is turned to a complete &quot;normal solution,in spite of the last words of the captain .\n\nThose were hard times for Duvivier.Actor Alain Delon told he was suffering from not getting the esteem he deserved anymore.It was the final straight :three more movies and he was to pass away five years later.Since he&apos;s been restored to favor,quite rightly so.\n\nNB:Desgrez ,a historic figure ,was also featured in the &quot;Angelique Marquise Des Anges&quot; saga ,with a dog called Sorbonne."

The only moments my resigned boredom was interrupted was when one or two points where naivety touched comical levels caused amused giggles among the public (including me).\n\nThe director, Mark Donskoy, has shot The Childhood of Maxim Gorky and The horse that Cried, which, although not special, are passable movies.

By referring to him as a &quot;blue helmet&quot; they mean that he is a UN peacekeeper. Cremieux tells the story about his experiences in Bosnia, as still photographs are injected between the interview footage. With this film Marker gets back to his political roots working with SLON and Group Medvedkine. This is not one of Marker&apos;s pre-eminent works, but it is an interesting watch for Marker fans and completists. It originally aired on television, but you can find it kicking around online. 7 out of 10.",

This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn&apos;t have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It is horrendous to watch and Gossett Jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces:Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he&apos;s working. As I look at his post Oscar win. Some of his better movies include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. Of course Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar win work.\n\n* out of 4-(Bad)",

      "reviewBody": "Kung-Fu Cult Master (1993) is a strange film based upon a series of fantasy novels. This was to be the first of the films. Sadly, the movie didn&apos;t make enough money to warrant a conclusion. But don&apos;t let that keep you from watching this action packed fantasy film from the lens and pen of Wong Jing.\n\nThe movie follows the exploits of Chang Mo Kei (Jet Li). He&apos;s out to avenge the deaths of his parents and reclaim his rightful imperial title. Despite being afflicted by a deadly poison and his lack of fighting skills, he&apos;s determined to destroy all of those who ruined his life. During his travels, he encounters many strange individuals and characters whom he assembles into a group of fighters who join him in defeating the evil cult who swore to wipe out his royal lineage forever. Can Chang Mo Kei and his motley crew eliminate the Evil Cult before the can do the honors upon him?\n\nA very strange but highly entertaining film. I don&apos;t know how much this is based upon the fantasy novels but a lot of the dialog and situations are pure Wong Jing. The fight scenes )directed by Sammo Hung) are a sight to behold. This film has so many memorable characters that you&apos;d wish they had finished the series. \n\nHighly recommended just for the sheer madness.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s very much like a Troma film, it has cheap gore, bad acting, bad writing, and Lloyd Kaufman (Co-creator of Troma) in it. I personally don&apos;t like punk rock, I&apos;m a metal guy but this was still a fun movie. If you hate punk you&apos;ll like watching all the bands die in some creative ways, if you love punk you&apos;ll like this movie even more. This movie has (from what I&apos;ve heard) the highest body count ever filmed. The gore goes from too fake for my standards (after seeing Cannibal Holocaust) to holy crap how did they do that/man that was brutal! I wish more of the kills were done better, it starts like Blood Feast were the killing is off screan then you see the gory aftermath but then they hit you with some sick Maniac style effects to make up for it and the effects get better later on. Because the high body count not all the kills are very creative and a few are blood less but overall there is some wicked sick stuff to make up for it. There are lots of major punk bands in this movie and they do perform, to name a few NOFX, Tsunami Bomb, and Andrew WK there are at least 30 bands in this movie. The plot is simple a reporter gets to do an article on the Van&apos;s Warped Tour and bands start dying but the greedy man in charge (Lloyd Kaufman) will not stop the show, so the reporter must find out who the killer is. Pretty much every 5 minutes a person gets killed off so there isn&apos;t to much boring dialog, which is the Achilles heel of splatter films (too much talking between the gore which PRH avoids). I hope they make a sequel if there any bands left alive that is. This movie has it all swords, cannibals, zombies, tons of gore, a high body count, loud music with attitude, it&apos;s the ideal movie for punk rock fans and fans of low budget splatter films. All in all I would recommend it, especially if it&apos;s less than 10 bucks. It&apos;s a good movie to invite your friends over to see, order a pizza, and drink some whiskey (as long",

      "reviewBody": "This is easily Wim Wender&apos;s most pretentious movie to date, and that&apos;s saying a lot given that Wenders is perhaps the most pretentious director of his generation. There is so much symbolic Mumbo-Jumbo I don&apos;t know where to begin: Dungeons. Coffins. Dead people. Ghosts. Including Lou Reed as a black-and-white specter of himself. Flocks of sheep. A shape-shifting city skyline. Hooded strangers, shooting arrows and causing crashes. All of which I have seen before, and with more panache: In &quot;Dark City&quot;, in Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Crash&quot;, Paul Auster&apos;s &quot;Lulu on the Bridge&quot;, Tom Tykwer&apos;s &quot;Winter Sleepers&quot;, even in TV&apos;s &quot;Lost&quot;. I&apos;m not even mentioning &quot;The Devil&apos;s Advocate&quot;. At the height of his self-importance, Wenders has Dennis Hopper, in the part of Death himself, make a speech about the merits of analog photography. Sounds ridiculous? Go figure. But the weakest link is Wender&apos;s choice of Campino as photographer Finn Gilbert, the lead character. Campino, a German rock star in his day job, may be photogenic in an aging toy boy way, but an actor he sure is not. Anything he says sounds like a line from a script, and the script is weak enough to begin with. Wenders asks too much of him, and too little of his co-lead Giovanna Mezzogiornio, a fine actress restricted to sleepy smiles and sullen glances in this movie. Charming guest appearances by Jana Pallaske as a feisty arts student, Inga Busch as a sexy swimming instructor in Ugg boots and a bathing suit, and by the divine Milla Jovovich as her glamorous self. Nice enough soundtrack, featuring Bonnie Prince Billy, Nick Cave, and The Velvet Underground. Watch with your eyes closed.",

      "reviewBody": "Greedy has taken some of the plot situations in the Paramount classic If I Had A Million and carried them to incredible heights. It has a whole string of good performances topped off by one of the last performances by Kirk Douglas before he had his stroke.\n\nKirk plays the Richard Bennett part here, the millionaire who doesn&apos;t like almost all of his relatives, but gets a certain sadistic joy in seeing them perform like trained seals, trying to stay in his good graces. The only honest one of them is one of Ed Begley Jr.&apos;s young sons who is just like that kid in If I Had a Million who started playing that record of I&apos;ll Be Glad When You&apos;re Dead You Rascal You.\n\nUnlike Bennett, Douglas does not decide to drop parts of his fortune on eight random strangers. He just keeps putting his family through their paces until they decide to dig up Michael J. Fox, a nephew he actually liked when he was a kid.\n\nFox is a second string professional bowler who&apos;s got a TV producer he&apos;s involved with, Nancy Travis. The two of them invade Douglas&apos;s three ring circus of relatives and get put through their paces also. All the family is against Douglas&apos;s &apos;nurse&apos; Olivia D&apos;Abo who the family is afraid will get the whole inheritance.\n\nGreedy is a nicely paced amusing comedy which I think most of us can identify with. I know I&apos;ve had a relative or two I can&apos;t stand either, but am forced to be nice to for a variety of reasons. The relatives are all greedy, but Douglas is one sadistic creep as well. I&apos;d catch it the next time it&apos;s on the tube.",

      "reviewBody": "With Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller) and Jane (Maureen O&apos;Sullivan) nicely settled into their treetop des-res (complete with all mod cons), it was only going to be a matter of time before we heard the pitter patter of little footsteps (other than Cheetah&apos;s, of course). However, with the Hays Code in full effect, and our arboreal lovebirds not actually wed, they sure weren&apos;t going to be permitted to have a child of their own via the normal method.\n\nThe writers of the Tarzan series get around this problem by having a child delivered from the sky by &apos;the great metal stork&apos;—a plane that crashes in the jungle with a baby boy as the only survivor. Cheetah finds the wailing bundle of joy and whisks him off to Tarzan and Jane, who decide to adopt the lad, naming him Boy (Tarzan&apos;s second choice, after having Elephant rejected by Jane).\n\nFive years of blissful family life later, and an expedition turns up at the escarpment searching for the plane and any possible survivors. But Tarzan and Jane have become rather attached to their little tyke, and aren&apos;t about to give him up, especially when they discover that two of the visitors only want Boy for his vast inheritance.\n\nAimed at the matinée crowd, this particular instalment features none of the graphic nastiness or raciness that can be found in the first two Tarzan films (the obligatory native killing at the end of the film—via a huge skull-cracking device—is brief and non-explicit); instead, we get mild peril as Boy is attacked by pipe-cleaner tarantulas and a back-projected rhino, comic relief courtesy of Cheetah the chimp, and a lot of fun interplay between Tarzan and his &apos;son&apos;, the best scene being an impressively shot moment of underwater horseplay.\n\n6.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 7 for the bit where Cheetah turns her lips inside-out to amuse the new arrival (which makes me laugh just thinking about it).",

      "reviewBody": "Well, since it&apos;s Black History Month and I usually review films in chronological order concerning African-Americans in them during this time, this movie was next on my list. First, Louis Armstrong plays a horse trainer who&apos;s in charge of a horse named Jeepers Creepers and the only way he can tame that horse is by playing the song of that name on his trumpet. And he not only sings that song but another one called &quot;Mutiny in the Nursery&quot; along with Maxine Sullivan, the Dandridge Sisters consisting of Dorothy, Vivian, and Etta Jones, as well as white leads Dick Powell and Anita Louise. Eddie Anderson appears as a trainer of another horse named Lady Ellen. And someone named George Reed appears as a butler named Sam. Other fine supporting turns came from Walter Catlett and Thurston Hall. And since I always like to cite when players from my favorite movie-It&apos;s a Wonderful Life-appear in something else, here Ward Bond plays a cop who confronts Allen Jenkins when he has a horse walking with him at night on the road. Oh, and this was one of future president Ronald Reagan&apos;s early film appearances introing himself with an announcer-like speech not unlike when he was on radio previously. In summary, Going Places was a very funny movie with many entertaining musical numbers.",

It is what it is, a funny family movie with lots of forest critters causing trouble for Brendon Fraser.\n\nOf course Brendon has done better more artful movies, of course he&apos;s done more adult-themed action, but why all the hate for this movie? Sometimes I want a sophisticated cerebral comedy with witty satire and subtlety, just like sometimes I want a fancy meal. But there also times I just want to kick my shoes off, sink a beer, scoff a pizza, burp and watch a fun film. This is what you get with Furry Vengeance, and it delivers what it sets out to deliver.\n\nThe performances are exaggerated sure, and yes, you can tell no-one has spent months refining the CGI. But what the hell, the movies makes you smile throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments thrown in too, and the extras on the DVD prove that everyone had a good time making the film.\n\nChill out all you negative reviewers, appreciate this movie for what it is.",

      "reviewBody": "I like this movie very much and I am glad to read that most of you like it too. However, some comments here describe it as predictable and having the funny parts far from one another. It is not true. There are two more things that you cannot appreciate: 1) The background. I am a Czech myself and I remember the times which the film speaks about. There are many little details that probably come and go unnoticed for the foreigner eye but each of them is a symbol - it carries meaning that is so obvious for a Czech viewer. 2) The language is FUNNY! Sverak (the author) is a well known writer here. He is a GENIUS with the language, it&apos;s full of sweet little word puns that can never be translated into another language. You can translate the data, the information - but you lose the atmosphere. Believe me, even in the parts that look boring, there is something hidden between the lines - it&apos;s either funny, emotional, powerful... There is another great thing with playing with the differences between Czech and Russian. The languages are similar (to some extend) but there are differences that can result in misunderstandings - and they use it in the movie too. Czech people used to learn Russian language at schools so they can appreciate it.\n\nI am so sorry that there is no way that you could enjoy even these parts of the movie. (Unless you&apos;d want to learn Czech of course :-)\n\nJust please, please, bear in mind that this is not just a shallow romantic movie. Yes, it is lovely - but there is more than that.",

      "reviewBody": "Jewison&apos;s film is an old-fashioned biopic, complete with pivotal backstory, voiceover narration, and a character who enters the protagonist&apos;s life and changes it immeasurably.  It&apos;s one of those stand-up-and-cheer movies where everyone seems to be against the hero, but above all odds (and with more than a little help from some of his friends), he rises above The System and gets his belated due.  It&apos;s an oft-used scenario, with many scenes that could easily have been taken from Jewison&apos;s other films A SOLDIER&apos;S STORY or IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.  Yet despite the familiarity of the storyline, I&apos;ll be damned if I wasn&apos;t choking back tears of elation at the movie&apos;s triumphant conclusion.  It&apos;s a masterful piece of filmmaking that proves Norman Jewison&apos;s skill as a director, as he transcends the cliche-bound script and, with the help of Washington and company, makes it a powerful entity all its own.\n\nAs the Hurricane, Denzel Washington proves he is one of the best actors (if not THE best) in the business today.  He can run the gamut from cold hatred to hearty laughter like few others can. He brings dignity and class to every one of his pictures (he was the only thing worth watching in THE BONE COLLECTOR).  Here, he makes you FEEL every single thing he&apos;s feeling.  In times of righteous indignation, you feel morally outraged alongside him.  When he&apos;s at his most vulnerable, you can feel your throat constricting and your eyes watering.  He has an uncanny knack for reaching into your soul and making you part of the picture itself; it&apos;s almost as if he&apos;s channelling the viewer while acting.  Other actors delight in wowing the audience with grand theatrics and histrionics, but neglect to make the audience care; Denzel is usually soft-spoken and low-key, but always holds your attention.\n\nIn summary, THE HURRICANE was one of the most exhilarating motion picture experiences I&apos;ve had all year.  Norman Jewison directs with a deft surehandedness reminiscent of his late 1960s/early 1970s glory years, Denzel Washington delivers perhaps the most awe-inspiring performance of the year, and the audience goes home happy and feeling good about themselves and the world.  What more could be asked for?"

      "reviewBody": "In the annals of Allied history is one of the most secret and certainly most desperate covert attempts to destroy the Nazi&apos;s ultimate weapons. These weapons were called the Vengeance Rockets which nearly destroyed England and it willingness to survive. This story written by Duilio Coleitto and directed by Michael Anderson is comparatively close to the actual facts. The conclusion in England was that the V-1 and V-2 were wreaking havoc on London and the prime Minister (Patrick Wymark) called on his war ministry to design a plan to destroy them. Innically, the secret operation was called &apos;Operation Bodyline&apos; but changed for the movie under &quot; Operation Crossbow.&quot; The idea was to select allied officers, trained and educated as engineers, fly them to Germany, have them infiltrate the German War Machine and sabotage the entire V-rocket plant. What they did not harp on was that is was also considered a suicide mission. George Peppard, Tom Courtenay and Jeremy Kemp play the incredibly courageous allied agents who must carry out the task. Anthony Quayle is superb as the traitorous English/German counter agent who&apos;s job it is to stop them. Richard Todd, Paul Henreid, Trevor Howard, John Mills, Richard Johnson and Sophia Loren round out the cast. The movie is incredible with actual WWII footage and surprisingly great dramatic acting. The introduction of Sophia Loren within the actual story is puzzling, but interesting. A very good WWII action movie considered a Classic by many movie fans. ****",

      "reviewBody": "The plot for &quot;Hopscotch&quot; is very simple. One of the top CIA field agents is being sent to a desk job until retirement. Walter Matthau plays Miles Kendig. His boss is of the Ivy League set and doesn&apos;t like the way Miles works. Ned Beatty plays boss Myerson. We don&apos;t like him right away. He&apos;s a jerk, not as intelligent, and he swears and cusses a lot. Miles won&apos;t take it sitting down, and decides to go on the lamb. He destroys the CIA file on himself, and through work contacts arranges for a few new IDs – passports and all. \n\nMiles contacts a former colleague and girlfriend to help him with parts of his plan. He wants to get back together with Isobel (played by Glenda Jackson), who is a well-to-do widow now living in Switzerland. A couple of other main characters are Cutter, a CIA agent who Miles trained, and who is now in charge of trying to find him. Cutter likes Miles, and tells the boss that he will be a step ahead of them all the way. The other character of substance is a Soviet counterpart to Miles, whom Miles like and respects. Miles know how he thinks.. Herbert Lom plays Yaskov, who also likes and respects Miles. \n\nMost of the film is about Miles eluding the CIA who pursue him around the globe. He is writing his memoirs and sending them, a chapter at a time, to the CIA and its counterparts in Moscow, Peking, London and Rome. Myerson wants Miles &quot;eliminated,&quot; and maybe the other intelligence groups do as well. But Miles finds a publisher in London, and his book becomes a best seller. As he sets in play each move, Miles stays a step ahead of his pursuers. Until the very end with its unusual but not very surprising ending. \n\nThe film is based on a book by Brian Garfield. In an interview that came with my DVD of the movie, Garfield said he wanted to write a CIA story as an adventure and a comedy without the gore and killing. His screenplay kept to the book in that regard. He and Ronald Neame, director, talked about how Ned Beatty had to practice using his profanity because he wasn&apos;t that way in real life. That&apos;s the one thing that keeps this from being a movie for all ages. \n\nAnother reviewer noted how the intrigue of the plot keeps one somewhat on edge for what comes next. We all pull for Miles and want him to succeed. The comedy isn&apos;t of the loud laughing type, but is dry and subtle at times with some humorous situations. It&apos;s an enjoyable film, but there&apos;s still something lacking about it. We don&apos;t see or know what Miles plans to do from one point to the next --- and there&apos;s a sense that he doesn&apos;t have a plan. He even says something to that effect at one point. Yet his every move seems so methodically planned out. He moves too smoothly and almost nonchalantly between stops. He visits a forger. He flies to Switzerland. He rents a car. He drives to see Isobel. He flies to London. He visits a man for a job there. He flies to Washington. He drives to South Carolina. He rents a house. He hires an oil truck. He hires a plane and pilot. He flies to Bermuda. He flies to London. He hires buys, rents and flies ad infinitum.\n\nThe movie was shot in several locations – London, Munich, Salzburg, Atlanta and other locales. In the interview that came with my DVD, we learn that Matthau was cool on doing the filming portion in Germany. He is Jewish and lost several relatives who were killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. Ronald Neame explains how he got Matthau to come around. It involved giving parts in the film to some relatives. Mathau&apos;s son, David Matthau, plays CIA agent Ross. Lucy Saroyan, daughter of Matthau&apos;s second wife, plays the airline pilot, Carla. Both tested well for their parts, according to Neame, and he said he made their roles conditional on Matthau&apos;s agreeing to the filming in Munich during the annual Oktoberfest there. \n\nThis movie was made at a time when Cold War spy and espionage films were highly popular. It broke away from the usual suspense and mayhem with killing and gruesome scenes. It offers a light comedic touch to the otherwise dark and often seedy world of espionage. It&apos;s not a great or complex film, but a light comedy that most adults should enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "An excellent documentary that if at first it seems that it is going to be a testimony of their hardships, that is only the beginning; then it is also a critique of the two opposing governments, although not falling into populism. Actually the protagonists of the documentary are those citizens and the fight for their freedom (not only in prison), since the freedom to live where you want, in your city, in your country, etc. Also part of this is the journalist who makes the documentary, who empathizes more and more with the characters. What I liked the least is that despite the fact that many of them imply that they want reunification, it seems to me that there is still a political fanaticism (yes, fanaticism without violence) and ideological, which is much more noticeable in the end , when they arrive in North Korea. Pathetic performances by both South Korean (turning a deaf ear to everything), and North Korea (the video publicist of the children of the sun is shameful). Incredible how in a supposed &quot;democratic&quot; country, it has allowed political prisoners to have spent up to 40 years in jail. Great documentary.",

It&apos;s seven stories which on the first side have nothing to do with each other but they are connected by small small details, and that&apos;s the magic in it. You discover throughout these seven stories how they are connected, and it&apos;s lovely! It is a film about people, how they feel, what they&apos;re like, and it&apos;s about ridiculous little things as well! It&apos;s about the daily life of common people, but they are presented as heroes. You have to pay attention to the small details and to the wording, the way sentences are being said to truly understand the whole film and not just one story. It&apos;s very funny as well! You have to see it!",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Libertine&apos; is a dark period drama that reminds one of Shakespearean tragedies. It can be watched as a wonderful character study as it takes a look at the Second Earl of Rochester during the Restoration period. He&apos;s a poet, a playwright and a tormented soul. He&apos;s a talented man but he&apos;s someone that dislikes life and his actions push &apos;cultural boundaries&apos; that earn him more hatred from surrounding folks. We see in the initial stages of the film that he appears to be alright with being hated by so many but one thing, or person, changes it all...but perhaps it&apos;s too late for him.\n\nDirector Dunmore does a very impressive job of capturing the atmosphere of the time. The foggy melancholy, the brown poverty and the graying rot are some gloomy effects that finely contribute to this tragic piece. The costumes, lighting and set designs add to the gloominess. Though &apos;The Libertine&apos; is a tragedy, it&apos;s filled with dark witty humour. The Earl&apos;s desire to have a painting with a monkey, the first scene at the bar and some of scenes between The Earl and Alcock are examples of such. However, Dunmore neglects many crucial parts of Wilmot&apos;s life which could have made the film and the character more interesting e.g. how much he loved his children and country, his relationship with his wife was very much a loving one etc...there are lots of historical inaccuracies.\n\nDepp is both sublime and enigmatic and he brings the subtle humour and his character&apos;s torment, ambivalence and weakness with élan. One wonders why this performance didn&apos;t get as much recognition for in my humble opinion it&apos;s one of his best among the so many variety of wonderful characters he&apos;s articulately played. Samantha Morton indeed has a strong presence and of course delivers a fabulous performance. John Malkovich is adequate. It was great to see Richard Coyle and Jack Davenport in comedic roles that are upside downs of the characters they play in the famous sitcom &apos;Coupling&apos;. Coyle is particularly effective as the Earl&apos;s loyal servant. Kelly Reilly does well in a small role and Rosamund Pike deserves special mention for giving her best performance and having a remarkable presence within an admirable cast.\n\n&apos;The Libertine&apos; beautifully starts with a haunting monologue and ends with a sad one. It is a phenomenal study of a complex man, a man who rejected what he received but never got what he wanted. A superb film."

      "name": "&quot;Why Tarzan kill Nazis?&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "The seventh Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film and the first from RKO. It&apos;s also the first without Maureen O&apos;Sullivan as Jane. The role would eventually be recast but here we are told that Jane is visiting in England, where she keeps Tarzan and Boy (Johnny Sheffield) abreast of world events through a letter. Since this one features a topical WW2 backdrop, it has one of the more artfully crafted scripts of the later Tarzan sequels. Tarzan here is an isolationist and, like America at the outset of the war, he has no interest in meddling in the affairs of outsiders. The outsiders in this case being the people of the jungle city Palandrya who ask for help when Nazis parachute in and take over, as they were wont to do. But when the Nazis kidnap Boy, Tarzan declares &quot;Now Tarzan make war!&quot; and rallies his animal allies to fight the invaders. And boy, do they fight! This is one of the more violent Tarzan entries. Didn&apos;t bother me in the slightest watching Tarzan kill Nazis but it will likely scar politically sensitive types.\n\nWeismuller and Sheffield both make the transition from MGM to RKO, where they are given more lines than in the MGM films. Also carrying over from the MGM series is the ever-lovable Cheeta, fun as always and more than a match for the evil Nazis. There has to be a pretty female in the movie, even without Jane. So enter lovely Frances Gifford playing Zandra, the princess of Palandrya who comes to Tarzan looking for help. She has good chemistry with Weissmuller and even gets a swimming scene with him. Sig Ruman, Stanley Ridges, and Philip Van Zandt play some of the baddies.\n\nAs for the WW2 elements, how you feel about most American films made during this period will tell you how you&apos;ll feel about this. Unfortunately, if you look around IMDb, you&apos;ll find a lot of people who seem to really hate movies that were supportive of the Allies. They spit the word &apos;propaganda&apos; at these films with such contempt it makes you wonder if these people, most of whom claim to be American, would rather the Axis had won. It&apos;s pretty gross. Anyway, if you&apos;re one of these types you won&apos;t like this movie. But chances are, if you&apos;re that way, you don&apos;t like Tarzan to begin with and believe yourself to be above these movies. I guess you watched them ironically or something, right? Whatever. For the rest of you, this is a fun start to the RKO series. It&apos;s solid escapist fare. Not as good as the MGM films but I&apos;m never bored by them. Love that end scene.",

      "reviewBody": "MGM was never a good studio for slapstick comedians, but this time they got it right. Red Skelton had the misfortune to appear in a group of inept comedies for MGM which missed the mark for the most part. This comedy is terrific and Skelton is terrific in it. The comedy is set at the turn of the 20th Century with Skelton as an ambitious, but accident prone, inventor working on an early automobile. Although he is not given much in the way of witty dialogue, he is given ample opportunity to show his physical comedy skills. Although he plays a misunderstood dreamer, Skelton does not play a total nincompoop. While still a mugging comedian, he is likable and sympathetic. The supporting cast is just right with Macdonald Carey as Skelton&apos;s rival, Herbert Anderson as Skelton&apos;s straight man, Sally Forrest as his love interest and supporting character actors William Demarest and Raymond Walburn adding to the comedy. Monica Lewis is cast as the soubrette and is given two clever specialty numbers by Arthur Schwartz and Dorothy Fields. Forrest is given a good dance specialty. Skelton gets to sing the best song in the score, &quot;Spring Has Sprung&quot;. The screenplay contains some clever satire concerning the industrial age, and, of course, there is the obligatory auto race at the end of the picture. The Technicolor photography is beautiful, but it does not take away from the comedy. This is a really fine, feel good, slapstick opus."

It has a quite good story, and the acting is suprisingly good. The love story is a little far-fetched, but the film itself is quite enjoyable, except, once again for the real animal deaths.\n\nNot as good as either of Deodato&apos;s, but certainly better than Eaten Alive, Cannibal Apocalypse, or Trap Them and Kill Them."

Always rising when she&apos;s down (unsinkable in other words) there&apos;s also a sense of discovery involved for Molly, as she finally comes to understand in a wonderfully dramatic moment in an otherwise hilarious film that even among her wealthy and regal European friends she is accepted because they find her amusing, and not because she&apos;s really accepted as one of them. The title of the movie, of course, comes specifically from the real-life Molly Brown&apos;s experience in surviving the Titanic disaster, as she returns home after making this discovery.\n\nYes, the movie is undoubtedly full of tall tales. But it&apos;s full of wonderful songs (Harve Presnell as Johnny Brown has a marvellous singing voice), pretty good acting and just a general sense of fun. Well worth the watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Here Comes the Navy is a key film in the history of cinema. As it marks the first teaming of James Cagney and Pat O&apos;Brien, that in itself is historic. For these two in my humble opinion are the inventors of the male buddy film. The only other rivals for that distinction are Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen when they did a series of films as Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt. Cagney and O&apos;Brien were teamed for seven years by Warner Brothers in various parts.\n\nThis also is James Cagney&apos;s first film in any of our Armed Services. He&apos;s the usual fresh mouthed Cagney who as a civilian runs afoul of CPO Pat O&apos;Brien over a woman played by Dorothy Tree. Then Cagney joins the Navy and there&apos;s O&apos;Brien waiting for him. And O&apos;Brien has a sister, Gloria Stuart who Cagney falls for.\n\nBut of course when Warner Brothers had the good idea of shooting this movie at the San Diego Naval Station, they had no idea that they would be shooting on what became a national shrine. In fact it&apos;s mentioned several times that both O&apos;Brien and Cagney are assigned to the battleship, U.S.S. Arizona. Shortly after this film was made the Arizona and the rest of the Pacific Fleet moved to Honolulu and on December 7, 1941 the Arizona became a part of history. A whole lot of the crew of the Arizona served as extras in Here Comes the Navy, so a lot of the faces you see are probably at the bottom of Pearl Harbor in the Arizona. \n\nKnowing that I find it incredible that Here Comes the Navy has never made it to VHS or DVD. Hopefully that will be rectified soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Spanish horror director Amando de Ossorio will always be best known for his Blind Dead series and rightly so because they&apos;re good films, and also because most of the rest of the stuff that he directed isn&apos;t up to much. Italian and Spanish filmmakers would often make their own versions of popular American films, and it&apos;s not surprising that Exorcist rip-offs almost became their own sub-genre after 1973. The Possessed is clearly yet another copy of Willian Friedkin&apos;s groundbreaking horror hit, and while it&apos;s not very good and has nothing on the earlier classic; to my greatest surprise, this film is both not bad and definitely one of the better Exorcist rip-offs. The plot focuses on the daughter of a politician who becomes possessed. Sometime earlier, an old woman suspected of being a witch is accused of kidnapping young children and kills herself by jumping out the police station window. The politician&apos;s daughter later has an encounter with a strange woman who gives her a necklace. It&apos;s not long before the girl is speaking foreign languages and turning her head round one hundred and eighty degrees...\n\nDespite being a rip-off, this film actually has a few good ideas of its own. The idea of the girl being possessed by a witch rather than some demonic force actually works quite well and the film has a couple of subplots, such as the one that sees the token young priest being chased by a girl against his wishes. This plot doesn&apos;t have much to do with the film&apos;s central idea, but it&apos;s interesting and amusing. It also seems like director Amando de Ossorio was trying to have a swipe at the church through a lot of the events in this film - including the subplot with the girl and the priest. The film was obviously made on a shoestring budget and as such there isn&apos;t much room for anything spectacular. The special effects are largely inept and unconvincing and the acting is matched by some truly atrocious dubbing. The only real notable cast member is Marián Salgado, and she is only notable for the fact that she was cast in the film because she was the Spanish dubbing actor for Linda Blair in The Exorcist (a nice touch in my opinion). Overall, The Possessed is lacklustre, but it&apos;s not a bad way to spend ninety minutes and it is one of Amando de Ossorio&apos;s best films outside of the Blind Dead series.",

I don&apos;t remember having seen the girl in the jungle in the 50s but I remember that one was sort of a scandal. Now in this Monte Carlo comedy I was reminded of her and strangely enough I recognized her after 45 years immediately. She is the one and only beautiful and entertaining decoration in this long forgotten German production. It is really a pity that Marion didn&apos;t enter the ladder of at least European success. She was a natural born comedian and definitely capable to follow the steps of for instance Lilo Pulver. She was obviously an amateur but once in a while I love to watch amateur stuff especially when they show early a maximum of future talent. Eddie is as usual in his early films, Gunther Philipp is quiet and has not so many lines but sings a song with the American in Paris Eddie. The mentioned director I don&apos;t want to mention. But Vive Marion ! But sorry: She died 40 years ago. (Instead of Constantin Hans Albers was in the first version, but I don&apos;t remember the girl.)\n\nMichael Zabel",

I do have a general dislike for The Asylum&apos;s films, but this is a serious contender for their worst movie, and it is for me the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The production values are atrocious, in recent memory this is only one of about three or so movies that look as though absolutely no effort has gone into making it, complete with shoddy photography, cheap effects and dull lighting. The story is highly derivative, the script is cheesy and clichéd, the direction is abysmal and the characters could have been made of stone and I still wouldn&apos;t have cared in all honesty. The acting is some of the worst I&apos;ve seen as well, none of the actors look comfortable and none connect to their cardboard characters, while the fight sequences are poorly choreographed and confusingly edited. Overall, appalling and one of the worst films I&apos;ve seen. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "In a country where any halfway decent local movies can be counted on the fingers of one hand, this comedy is definitely one to watch; in my opinion, one of the funniest, most clever movies ever. Ephraim Kishon, one of Israel&apos;s (and Europe&apos;s) most popular writers, wrote this movie (originally as a sketch) when the noise from construction work in the street below got on his nerves. Ever the self-centered type, he asked himself whether the construction workers were really there for a reason, or just a bunch of freaks whose only perpose in life is to disturb his sleep.\n\nThis simple idea eventually led to a hilarious satire of administration gone berserk. Bomba Tzur plays Blaumilch, a madman who&apos;s obsessed with digging. He escapes from an asylum early one morning, steals a pneumatic drill and starts digging up one of Tel-Aviv&apos;s busiest streets! Within hours, downtown Tel Aviv is reduced to a gigantic traffic jam, the local residents go insane, and Mr. Blaumilch is having the time of his life. But when the officials of the Tel Aviv municipality get wind of this, no one (including the runty mayor) knows who to give credit for this unexpected project; nearsighted bureaucrats secretly blame each other for it. In the confusion, nobody thinks to check what started the whole thing, except our hero Ziegler, which obviously nobody believes, even when he eventually discovers the truth. Eventually, city hall sends in reinforcements (bulldozers and heavy machinery) and the dig becomes a monstrous excavation, which can only lead to disaster. Or perhaps not... This movie is terrific. Very well directed, shot, scored, cast and acted, by a who&apos;s who of Israel&apos;s best comic actors of the time. Director Kishon throws in some very clever set-pieces. Excellent 60&apos;s atmosphere, too. A winner. Not to be missed.",

I have to say a lot more in order to reach the specified length necessary for publishing it online on the IMDb. So one of the nurses in this movie makes the following comment--&quot;A lot of what we see is actually a product of our mental process. If brain circuitry is altered...memories can begin to move again.&quot; That&apos;s more profound after a first viewing. The subtitles are fast but accessible enough. And the fact is that I&apos;m renting this DVD from Netflix, and I opted to watch the disc a second time, the very same night. It&apos;s intricately-plotted, and a bit confusing the first time through. But it will stand up to repeat viewings quite well. (The other movie I plan to see again soon is Star Wars 3.)"

Watch him challenge Jessep in the closing.\n\n#7 It simply had the unfortunate timing of coming out the same year as &apos;Unforgiven&apos; and &apos;Scent of a Woman&apos; and lost best pic. Both of those were excellent movies and it would be tough for any voter.\n\n#6 All actors given time to show depth, creativity and originality. I absolutely loved Moore, Bacon, Sutherland, Pollak and Cruise.\n\n#5 In addition, even though everyone&apos;s performance was spectacular and Nicholson&apos;s was a brief one, he still stole his scenes and strongly deserved an Oscar. (I mean, c&apos;mon&apos;You can&apos;t handle the truth!&apos; scene was worth an award.)\n\n#4 The Dialogue. Please, the main characters were good enough at bantering back and forth, but just witness the conversation between Cruise and the newspaper man.\n\n#3 Chess = Courtroom. If Cruise&apos;s Kaffee performance wasn&apos;t evidence the direct correlation between chess and courtroom, I don&apos;t know what will. (i.e. Where&apos;s the mess-hall?)\n\n#2 How many movies since 1950 have you seen end with &quot;The End&quot;? They seemed to know this would be a classic, without excessive violence, language, no sex or nudity.\n\n#1 Everything, and I mean EVERY THING in this movie workedbut simply judge it on one of the BEST SCENES of any movie ever: &quot;You can&apos;t handle the truth!&quot;",

This does have a few problems however--I felt it was about ten minutes too long. And the shades of black and white do become a little tedious after awhile (though there is alleviation in the strategic use of colors throughout).\n\nOne of the attributes of the movie, the one that could either draw viewers in or send them running, is its tendency to drift in a kind of dream-logic (I feel that animation works well with that sort of surrealistic play) with no regard towards traditional structure. The character design is simple, yet oddly emotive, and the music is dreamy enough to get lost in.\n\nThis movie makes me wonder what the next step in these kinds of animation projects is going to be.",

      "reviewBody": "In the opening scenes of this movie, I couldn&apos;t tell what century it was. The peasant family living in their hovel with no electricity or running water and their subservient attitude toward the master made me wonder if this movie was taking place in the 19th century. But no, a car appeared, a model from the 1960s, so I knew that it took place in relatively recent times.\n\nFilmed in muted, grayish tones reminiscent of a Goya painting, this film gives one an idea of what life must have been like, not only for Spanish peasants in the Franco era but also for medieval serfs and slaves in the pre-Civil War South. The master and mistress treat their own whims as more important than the peasants&apos; needs, require them to act and speak in a subservient manner, act as if small favors are huge concessions (The family gets to move into a house with electricity!), and literally treat the men of the family as if they were hunting dogs, forcing them to fetch the game that the master spends an inordinate amount of time shooting. In one case, a man is forced to fetch while trying to recover from a broken leg. When foreign visitors criticize the master and mistress for their treatment of the peasants, they make a big show of demonstrating that the peasants are happy and can write their own names (but only because they have just been taught).\n\nBut the world is changing, and even the meekest peasant may reach his limit...\n\nUnfortunately, this film has never been released on DVD for Region 1, and the Region 2 version is out of print, so few people will be able to see this brutal but fascinating glimpse of the twilight of an era when Spanish society was composed of countless little dictatorships.",

      "reviewBody": "From writer/director Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.\n\nDirector Dominik has great control of the picture but when the film went into the editing room the film underwent some problems. The film never keeps the momentum to be an amazing picture. The viewer is connected for the first 15 minutes, then bored for 10, then enchanted for 45, bored for 15, then comes the anticipated climax and you think its over, then it goes on for another half hour. Dominik gives the audience the best understanding of Jesse James possible so we can become better acquainted with him but brings in an slew of different characters that, to be perfectly honest, I don&apos;t care that much about. I believe this might be a example of over character development where we get all the aspects of his life but all we want is Jesse.\n\nLast year, many critics were stating Brad Pitt gave his best performance ever in Babel however, his Jesse James is the best performance of his career by a mile. Pitt wears Jesse like an overgrown coat that you don&apos;t want to get rid of. Pitt gives the most tortured, endearing, and frightening performance of the year thus far. He makes the audience so uncomfortable and awkward yet gives off sensitivity and compassion for a very unlikable and ferocious man. If buzz builds, expect Pitt to be a huge contender at the Oscars.\n\nCasey Affleck, arguably the better actor of the Affleck clan gives the most pathetic, annoying and cowardly performance in the last ten years; and its brilliant. With his deep &quot;admiration&quot; for Jesse, his Robert Ford is engulfed in Jesse&apos;s presence and wants enjoy the moments with him, even if he is in fear of him. The finale is truly his show as he stretches out his acting legs and dissolves into a character you can&apos;t wait to see off-screen.\n\nThe cast ensemble is a true revelation as each character as over-developed as they might be, all bring a sense of humanity, charisma, and heartbreak to their roles. Sam Rockwell who is on the verge of being a household name and coming his way to a nomination one day plays Charley Ford, brother of Robert, as magnetic as the character demands. Mary Louise Parker, who is one of the better actress&apos; working today, goes nowhere as Jesse&apos;s wife. This is a role that is very Academy friendly, and throws it away in a her limited screen time Sam Shepard who plays the older brother of Jesse, shows fear and anguish built up in a man who yearns for emotional freedom from crime. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Expect a possible Screen Actors Cast Ensemble nod for these men.\n\nExpect a possible and much deserved cinematography nomination for the overdue Roger Deakins, which is the strongest technical aspect of the picture. Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice Blackey-Goodine. The appeal is there for the film as a whole but it leaves us floating a little too often in a long river of bravery, artistry and commendation. Dominik will likely be cited for some breakthrough director awards with the picture popping up during precursors&apos; season.\n\nGet ready for the assassination everyone knows is coming but no one can prepare for. Never has been a film that tells you the entire story in the title and can still surprise the viewer with beautiful cinematic moments.\n\nGrade: ***/****",

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;d probably know by now how adamant I am that the best and only way to enjoy a Hong Kong comedy, is to watch it in Cantonese, otherwise chances are a lot of jokes, especially the verbal ones, will likely be lost in translation. I had the chance to watch this during my recent trip to Hong Kong, but decided somehow to pass it up for other films. Needless to say one of the major interest why I decided to watch this film back in Singapore and compromise on having to sit through this in Mandarin (besides having a friend watch this as well), is no doubt fueled by Ronald Cheng and Charlene Choi coming out of the closet proclaiming an end to their secret union.\n\nGossipy news aside, I&apos;m never convinced about singer Ronald Cheng&apos;s ability as an actor, though I had wondered how well he had fared being in a comedic leading role. I&apos;m still not convinced actually that he&apos;s leading man material, despite having tickled my funny bone in the film, which I attribute more to writer-director Jeffrey Lau, who had gone to elicit laughs right from the get go, and had enough fuel from opening credits to plenty of sight gags, toilet humour, a string of cameo appearances, and enough of movie references here to keep you engaged throughout.\n\nIn essence, I liken Lau to Asia&apos;s version of Hollywood comedies as churned out by the Zucker siblings, where a film can stand on its own with enough craft in comedy, rather than the recent slew of relatively terrible Hollywood comedies that know nothing except to string together films of the same genre, and then poking fun at them en masse. Here though the idea is simple, and Red Cliff / Three Kingdoms form the basis and backdrop at which comedy finds its place. It&apos;s essentially a crazy little love story between an unnamed bandit (played by Ronald Cheng) who becomes Zhao Yun when the time travelling, titular Pandora&apos;s Box gets activated, and an immortal called Rose (Betty Sun) who is out to find The One true love, whom she believes to be Cheng&apos;s character.\n\nSo time travel drops them smack into the Battle of Red Cliff, and part of the fun here is to identify the whole slew of cameo appearances by China and Hong Kong actors, who seem not to mind the very bit roles (one scene or two) to lend a helping hand at boosting the film&apos;s star attraction. And these appearances come quite fast and furious, together with almost a laugh-a-minute comedy that Lau weaves into the narrative, most of which are genuinely funny, until it started to run out of steam and paid not too subtle comedic homage to Hollywood films like Titanic, The Matrix and King Kong even.\n\nNeedless to say the narrative itself is simplistic and delivered in a choppy manner, stringing together gag after gag, and the finale was quite off the mark with a sudden tribute paid to one of Lau&apos;s earlier and more famous works with Stephen Chow. Still, it did what it had set out to do, to help you relax and enjoy a rip-roaring time at the movies, so the objective&apos;s met and I&apos;ve got little qualms about it since I honestly am admitting this was much better than expected, and had found myself laughing at some points with tears uncontrollable.",

      "reviewBody": "Hercules directed and written by Luigi Cozzi stars the great Lou Ferrigno as the title character and takes great liberties with his story. It&apos;s aimed squarely at kids, with its colorful characters and even more colorful special effects. What i liked about it was the steady pacing, the absolutely weird musical cues and Lou&apos;s solid, if perhaps too straight performance.\n\nForget all you know about Herc, this film stands on its own. Some of the old tale is here, baby Herc does crush snakes sent by his stepmother Hera and he does grow up peacefully not knowing why he&apos;s so strong. An early battle with a giant bear is well-shot. Lou certainly looks the part, unlike some other actors who tried and he isn&apos;t that bad with the dialog, which is very ripe. \n\nIn this version Herc&apos;s great love is Casseopeia, played by the very easy to look at Ingrid Andersson. I so wanted to get that veil off her face! Herc must win her hand by competing in a series of bizarre rites of Strong. Including the classic cleaning of the stables. Which is a great sequence using miniatures and super-imposition. Even the rocks look heavy and real for a change! Still Zeus, and at least one actor, Claudio Casselinni, was understated, wants the sides of good and evil to be balanced, so Herc and Cass are separated.\n\nNot to fear, Herc soon hooks up with sorceress Circe, played by another beauty in a barely there outfit. She aid him in his celestial quest to conquer the evil of Thera and save Cass from being a virgin(!) sacrifice! \n\nThe set for Thera, the green isle of Atlantis actually, is one of the best I&apos;ve seen outside of Star Wars: Episode IV, its truly a great work of lighting and miniature sets, complete with a flame-wielding colossus. Herc&apos;s great strength is no match for the witch Adriana (called Ariana in my version,) played by the buxom Sybil Danning, but his great heart is, he&apos;s loyal to Cass. This all leads to a duel with the evil King Minos, who wants science to rule the world at the expense of all emotion. Their duel with Herc wielding the sword of Zeus and Minos the fire sword of Atlantis is great. The finale is spectacular and I love Herc&apos;s ending line to the rescued Cass. and check her final outfit, wow! &quot;How do I know you&apos;re really Casseopeia? Or are you Adriana is another form or Circe reborn?&quot; She responds &quot;I am all and none of them. I am the one who loves you!&quot;\n\nCool movie, what I didn&apos;t like was the cheesy robots, they simply looked bad! Also why was Daedelus, the God who helps Minos, played by a woman? Some elements of the plot were confusing. Still this a great family adventure, the hero is great the girls are lovely and there is nothing objectionable save some light violence. If you&apos;re looking for a fun movie that doesn&apos;t require too much brain power, this is it!",

      "reviewBody": "Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio&apos;s death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir&apos;s idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman&apos;s heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.\n\nBut then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.\n\nMeanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption &apos;a typical Jew&apos; so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. &apos;Entree des artistes&apos;, a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio&apos;s scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.\n\nAfter a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in &apos;Hold Back the Dawn&apos;, a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.\n\nIn early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, &apos;Everybody Comes to Rick&apos;s&apos; but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.\n\nShooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.\n\nThey produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to &apos;Casablanca&apos;.\n\nIt is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. &apos;We&apos;ll always have Paris&apos;, &apos;I was misinformed&apos;, &apos;Here&apos;s looking at you, kid&apos;, &apos; I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there&apos;s gambling going on in here!&apos;, &apos;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&apos;, &apos;Oh he&apos;s just like any other man, only more so&apos;, &apos;I don&apos;t mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one&apos;, &apos;Round up the usual suspects&apos;, and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, &apos;Play it again, Sam&apos;.\n\nMadeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.\n\nAnd when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, &apos;I&apos;m shocked! Shocked! To find that there&apos;s gambling going on in here!&apos; the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, &apos;Your winnings, sir.&apos; It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.\n\nI have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.\n\nAlas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.\n\nLate in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply &apos;old man in whore house&apos;, in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what &apos;grand themes&apos; may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival."

The rebel opposition consists of a group of pseudo-military types led by Rutger Hauer. I&apos;m not sure if the clownish attempt at acting like soldiers was due to the writers thinking it unnecessary to pay for technical consulting, or perhaps that really is how Italian soldiers work. Hauer appears in a state of constant obliviousness (which is reasonable, given the script). Thin plots don&apos;t really bother me as long as there is a little bit of good acting, a character to root for, or at least entertaining action scenes. This movie, having none of those things, is utterly unappealing and thoroughly boring. The script was completely incomprehensible. The actors never had a chance with this big steamy turd.",

Sure, it is not a fast moving story, but it very much reflects the pace of the era: people were not in the great hurry our society apparently cannot do without. Laurien van den Broeck played her role of Mariken admirably and with gusto - she was a delight to watch and listen to. The unashamed frankness of her questions to and opinions of the adults around her were a real joy and reminded me of my own childhood. Unfortunately, these days such an attitude is often accompanied by lack of respect - there was no trace of that in this movie&apos;s script. I&apos;m afraid though that some of the crispness of the dialog was `lost in translation&apos; to English."

      "reviewBody": "finally, a movie in theaters WORTH seeing!!!! i just saw &quot;Shooter&quot; and i was thoroughly entertained. the plot kept me intrigued from beginning to end. mark wahlberg is fantastic... he&apos;s like a modern day McGuyver, but better looking and more sarcastic. his character is cunning and smart. wahlberg excels in playing characters who are determined to make an impact. i&apos;m not a huge fan of action movies, but this movie was so packed with plot that i just kept moving along with it. i bet most of the naysayers of the film are going to be people who believe every word their government tells them. yes, this film depicts government officials in a bad light, but what or who doesn&apos;t? i&apos;m sure in reality it&apos;s much worse. don&apos;t let political beliefs interfer with seeing this film... it&apos;s a good time no matter what side you are on. the screenplay was well-written, excluding ONE, minute one-liner about anna nicole smith marrying for love which was obviously written before her death. (plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it&apos;s intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you&apos;ll be impressed with wahlberg&apos;s character... go see for yourself!!",

It would&apos;ve been interesting to see how it would&apos;ve turned out the other way around.  As it turns out, Cape Fear is a film that follows Scorsese&apos;s usual themes, mainly guilt.  Nick Nolte suffers from it, and Robert DeNiro helps to amplify the guilt.  He attacks Nolte indirectly, letting Nolte inflict the most damaging on himself.  In order to fight this loon, Nolte has to sink to his level, which is what DeNiro&apos;s Max Cady wanted. Scorsese&apos;s use of the camera is fluid and always moving.  Those slow zooms on Cady, the whip cuts from one scene to another and the whole end sequence is a doozy.  Bernard Herrman&apos;s great score is pumped through your speakers in Dolby sound and gives the film, a proper level of menace.  Watch this instead of &quot;The Fan.&quot;  You won&apos;t be disappointed."

A young boy Storm takes on the church after his father is caught red handed printing a writing by Martin luther an advocate against the church. His letters were so influential the church did everything they could to stop them and punish those involved. Will Storm save his father from being burned at the stake?

What a pity that i couldn&apos;t experience the movie&apos;s aura earlier! \n\nChariots of Fire is an outstanding piece of work which may be easily, and deservedly so, termed as LEGENDARY! Watch this movie and you&apos;ll know what is inspiration and dedication...\n\nThe characterization is such exemplary that each and every character tell their own little story... The two main characters - Lindell and Abrahams - are such that you&apos;ll only want to know them better as you go on watching the movie... especially that of Lindell. The guy is so so dedicated and truthful that i for one would just feel honored to know him closely.\n\nGuys, WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Beauty Shop captures the true qualities of women striving, surviving, and winning against all odds. There wasn&apos;t a strong storyline, just a message of how women of all cultures deal with cheating husbands, cosmetic surgery, gender and racial profiling, insecurity, and male chauvinism. Still these women roll with the punches to enjoy each other and celebrate the beauty within.\n\nThe underlining theme of the movie is Maya Angeleo&apos;s poem Phenomenal Woman, which can be seen in Gina Norris (Queen Latifa), the struggling entrepreneur trying to secure a future for her daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) a young talented pianist. Particularly colorful characters are &quot;Catfish Rita&quot; (Cheryl Underwood), Ms. Josephine (Alfre Woodard), Lynn (Alicia Silverstone), Darnell (Keshia Knight Pulliam) and Jorge (Kevin Bacon). It is has lots of humor, guaranteed to make you smile.",

      "reviewBody": "After making his acting debut in RING OF STEEL – one of the best films about weapons-fighting I have ever seen – swordsman Robert Chapin followed it up with this little independent disaster. DRAGON FURY is an ambitious outing that partially recycles the premise of THE TERMINATOR with swords in place of robots, without a hint of a substantial budget. Though it bears the Troma label, this is likely a third-party acquisition because despite its hokeyness, it lacks the inspired cult spirit of the likes of THE TOXIC AVENGER. Not to spoil the rest of the review, but this movie isn&apos;t very good.\n\nThe story: A warrior from a dystopian future (Chapin) and his cohort (Chona Jason) travel back in time to 1999 and attempt to recover the cure for a devastating disease while being hunted by the minions of an evil overlord (Richard Lynch).\n\nFrom the opening shots of a mass slaughter taking place on a flimsy outdoor set, the viewer knows s/he&apos;s in for the amateur experience. Things improve a little when the characters travel through time and have the public property of Los Angeles to elevate the production standard, but the single-camera cinematography and restrictive indoor locations never let you forget what kind of a movie you&apos;re watching. The tone of this college-level production is inconsistent and inharmonious: for the most part, the performers are trying to tell a semi-serious action yarn, but aside from moments of massive overacting, there are instances where it seems like a rogue goofball took over the production with intentionally bad comedic scenes and silly inserts (e.g. goofy voiceovers when characters are stabbed). I don&apos;t know what to make of this, other than be unimpressed.\n\nThough Richard Lynch gets top billing, the real villain of the piece is T.J. Storm, given his presence and the fact that his genuine athletic ability is one of the few highlights of the film. Though the fight scenes that he contributes to are plagued by occasionally silly choreography and vague repetitiveness, Storm and Chapin and a handful of martial costars are fun to watch and their smooth sword-fighting is a welcome change from kickboxing. The fights are virtually the only reason one would want to watch this movie, other than for laughs, but even I can&apos;t get maximum enjoyment out of the ten or so duels due to the underutilization of Chona Jason and the absolutely embarrassing finale between Chapin and Lynch.\n\nDRAGON FURY has enough spirit and enthusiasm to save it from a lower rating, but it&apos;s still a cheap movie that can hardly afford its own special effects and features some blatant goofs (get a load of T.J. Storm&apos;s white stunt double). I don&apos;t think it&apos;s funny enough to achieve cult status, rendering it as little more than a cheap action movie that made questionable choices of how to maximize its resources. Let it be.",
