The color is a little more pale than I was expecting, not my favorite but it’s ok. The think I don’t like is the collar. Other reviews said the same thing and I should have listened. So I’m going to try my hand at changing the style of the collar somehow so I like it better. It’s too stiff and bulky to drape well so it just looks a bit odd. Maybe it’s just this color? But I got in on a great sale and it’s not returnable because of that, so no big deal. It’s so cozy that at worst, I’ll just wear at home or camping or for chores if I can’t make it look how I want. I may have even sized up to make it more oversized, but this does fit well as-is.",

Tightening the BOA more just tightens the top and does nothing for the toe end. \n\nAfter trying these out I found a like-new used pair of Terra X5 on eBay thankfully and am back on the shoes I love. \n\nSince I can&apos;t return these due to taking a muddy mtb ride, I will keep them as backups for muddy race weekends.",

The material and construction is top notch, the pockets gave me the chance to carry more than I think could carry. Pockets for your phone, tools, keys, a pocket air pump etc. Even though it is not too big, I have other hydration backpacks and comparing with those the size is very similar. The capacity is superb, I was looking for that feature, the chance to carry close to 2L of liquid on longer rides. Easy to clean. Very happy.",

I recommend sizing down; I&apos;m usually a 28 but I could have gone with a 27 or even 26. Women may also want to try the men&apos;s version for a different cut; these sit slightly higher and have a *lot* of room in the butt. Unfortunately the white color is a bit see through and doesn&apos;t work for me at all; recommend the loden. The size 28 worked for my partner who would typically be a size 29, and the inseam for her 33&quot; inseam was only an inch short and workable. Would be better without the logo and also the pesky zipper pulls bouncing on the large pockets. If Icebreaker made a work version (no logo, straight leg, pleated front, no hiking pockets, no knee articulation, yes gusset, yes double snap closure or side closure) from the same fabric, that would be fantastic.",

I have an adult pair and love them, and the cool thing about Lowa is that they do not &quot;de-tune&quot; kids products;  they are build as solidly as the adults boots are.  Pretty incredible!  My son loves these and gets him excited about being outside.\nThe sizing was translated from the Lowa European sizing, and is close, but runs a little large.  Maybe go 1/2 size down and you will be set!",

These run large and I was concerned that I would catch a rock with the extended length in my toe area. Asolo boots are amazing sports equipment. They change the possibilities of a hike, making hiking, more smooth, safe and fast. My feet are completely protected, allowing a longer stride, and more confidence with the grip of each foot fall.",

First time the pump was still usable, but had to be held by two people to operate. Second break was the clear plastic in the bottle fill lid fitting. The resulted in the pump being nonfunctional. It appears that the plastic parts are not strong enough to withstand use over time. The fatigue and then break. \n\nI received a repair part for the first break. Based on the repeated issue I think that I will be looking at other models. Additionally, the on line repair site states that it will be 12 weeks before I get a response.

Also, the ability to attach my tripod to the pack really simplifies preparations and hiking. The water resistant materials and well sealed closures are important features to me and have proved their value in just a short time while out in the winter weather.

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Wandrd PRVKE series has established itself as a favorite among photographers, travelers, and creatives for its combination of rugged durability, thoughtful design, and stylish aesthetics. The **31-liter PRVKE Backpack** paired with the **Pro Camera Cube** elevates this bag into an excellent choice for those seeking a versatile, camera-focused bag with ample storage and organizational options.---#### **Build Quality and Design**The PRVKE 31L is crafted from **weather-resistant tarpaulin and ballistic nylon**, ensuring durability and protection against the elements. The bag exudes a modern, minimalist aesthetic that appeals to urban explorers and outdoor adventurers alike. Key design elements include:- **Magnetic Tote Handles:** For quick grab-and-go functionality.- **Weatherproof Zippers:** Offer additional protection for gear in inclement weather.- **Expandable Roll Top:** Adds up to 5 liters of extra storage, taking the capacity to 36 liters.The **build quality is outstanding**, with reinforced stitching and robust materials that can handle heavy loads without showing signs of wear.---#### **Comfort and Fit**The PRVKE 31L offers a comfortable carrying experience thanks to its **padded shoulder straps and back panel**. The bag includes an adjustable chest strap, which helps distribute weight evenly. However, users carrying heavy loads for extended periods may notice the absence of a hip belt, which could alleviate pressure on the shoulders.---#### **Storage and Organization**This backpack is incredibly well-organized, catering specifically to photographers and content creators:1. **Pro Camera Cube**: - The Pro Camera Cube is tailored to fit snugly within the main compartment of the PRVKE, providing padded and customizable dividers for gear. - It easily accommodates a **full-frame DSLR or mirrorless camera, along with 3–4 lenses** and additional accessories. - The cube is removable, allowing the bag to transition seamlessly between a photography bag and a regular travel bag.2. **Dedicated Laptop Sleeve**: - Fits laptops up to 16 inches, with padding for protection. - Also includes a tablet sleeve for added utility.3. **Quick-Access Side Pocket**: - Enables fast retrieval of the camera without fully opening the bag.4. **Expandable Roll Top**: - Great for carrying extra clothing or gear for longer trips.5. **Multiple External Pockets**: - Zippered front pockets for small items. - A hidden passport pocket for secure storage of valuables.---#### **Functionality for Photographers**Photographers will appreciate the **side camera access**, allowing quick and discreet access to their camera. The inclusion of the **Pro Camera Cube** ensures gear stays protected and organized. There are attachment points for tripods, and the roll-top design makes it easy to expand storage when carrying additional items like jackets or food.---#### **Versatility**The PRVKE 31L shines as a **multifunctional bag**, transitioning effortlessly from a camera bag to a general-use travel bag. By removing the camera cube, the main compartment transforms into a spacious cavity suitable for clothes, books, or groceries.---#### **Cons**While the PRVKE 31L with the Pro Camera Cube is an excellent option, there are some minor drawbacks:- **Lack of Hip Belt:** Carrying heavy gear over long periods could be more comfortable with a dedicated hip belt.- **Weight:** At 3.4 lbs (1.5 kg) without gear, the bag is on the heavier side due to its durable materials.- **Limited External Accessory Straps:** While there are attachment points, more robust strap options for larger items would be helpful.---#### **Price and Value**At a premium price point, the PRVKE 31L with the Pro Camera Cube offers excellent value for photographers who prioritize durability, organization, and style. While there are cheaper options, few can match the quality and versatility of this bag.---#### **Conclusion**The Wandrd PRVKE 31L with the Pro Camera Cube is a **top-tier backpack** for photographers and travelers seeking a stylish, durable, and functional solution. Its ability to adapt between camera and travel modes, combined with its weatherproof construction and thoughtful design, makes it a standout option. Despite minor drawbacks, it remains a worthwhile investment for those serious about protecting and organizing their gear.**Rating: 9/10** **Best For:** Photographers, urban explorers, and travelers needing a versatile and durable backpack.",

They fit my feet right out of the box but when laced the hooks at the ankle of both boots exert pressure that leads to pain. I wore them around the house to test before hiking in them but never felt the hooks. On the first hike the pressure turned to pain in about 3 miles. I&apos;ve tried numerous combinations of loose lace, tight lace, skip a hook lace but nothing helped. I tried sock combinations with heavy socks, light socks, hiking socks combined with liner socks, nothing worked. I wanted to like these boots because I love the Altra Lone Peak running shoes but I can&apos;t recommend them.",

They are a joy, except for one thing. They aren&apos;t waterproof. Today, I had to walk through very wet grass. Within 10 seconds, my toes were wet. Within one minute, my feet were making squelching noises. I walked 11 more miles in totally wet boots. This was the 2nd time they got wet through the fabric of the boot (not deep water up by the laces). The first time it took two days to dry and I ended up walking in my running shoes. They got wet too, but they aren&apos;t supposed to be waterproof. I love the lone peak running shoes, and I would love these hikers in a dry place, but I am not loving them in Scotland. I really needed waterproof boots and these aren&apos;t it.",

Light, nimble, wish I had these my whole life. the tongue kept out debris well. Mine have held up well for a year now, mostly very light hikes and day hikes. I&apos;d love to see a cleaner look- like some of your new shoes with the logo set back toward the heel- but they feel great. Sometimes, like all mid boots, i have to mess with t he tongue gusset to get it to sit right and not press on top of my foot. I didn&apos;t buy the previous version because the fabric made a popping sound as it creased and uncreased with every step- I couldn&apos;t handle it- but these didn&apos;t do that so I gave it a go and I think it&apos;s a great product, thanks.",

The boot is light weight, supportive and very comfortable. The terrain was varied but only rugged like back country Rocky Mountains in a few spots. The shoe adequately handled cobblestone streets too but there were times when I wished the sole had been a little stiffer. I normally wear a size 13 but bought 14 and they were just right.

So your legs extend out in front so you need to put your heels up against the chair and rock and pull forward simultaneously.  That’s this chair:  My one big question is why would they use steel rivets when the entire point of a “beach chair” is to resist salt water rusting.  Who are the genius product engineers that missed the one singular, crucial design use case: “How to make an indestructible beach chair”.  And replaced it with: “How to make the most awkward chair to get out of”.  Well done PE’s!  Well done”",

After several day trips and backcountry trips with this one, I really like it. It rides a bit higher in my pack than the longer ones and can fit right on top of my fully loaded-pack. I had no problems with leaking of any kind. The bite valve is great and the Basecamp Tap is pretty nice for filling up my pot to boil water. The handle makes filling from a larger water jug or a spigot easy.  If you&apos;re in the market for a new bladder I highly recommend this Hydro Trek from Gregory.

I thought I could just adjust how it fit in the pack to avoid whatever pressure was causing it, but a fellow hiker notified me that my pack was dripping. Have gone back to the regular 3L bladder.",

I have the pocket towel and XL towel and they were both lifesavers when a lot of my hostels either had no hand towel or a communal towel. It was so nice to have a towel for showering/beach and then a smaller one for drying hands and face after the bathroom or to wipe sweat. I could not recommend this product enough!

And as we were preparing for this big road trip, I paid attention to the label on my favorite 8 years old towel and ordered from Sea to Summit. I ordered Pocket and Drylite because I coudln&apos;t tell which one it was - we love the silky and lighter texture of Pocket Towel more than the suede and thicker texture of DryLite. Now we also use them to dry dishes and dry our hair and I am debating to throw out all my other dish clothes. Just getting the most out of these towels!",

My legs were so fatigued and sore after a few miles in these boots. I tried using inserts with them and that only helped a little. I ended up returning them. If you have a high arches, these may not be the walking boots for you. I&apos;m sure they&apos;re fine for errands and short distances. They&apos;re also very cute. But they didn&apos;t cut it for me unfortunately.",

Good soles make me feel secure on ice or in puddles, large boxy toe makes it so I can wear thick socks if I want. I like the look of boot. Easy-on, easy to lace at perfect tightness for whatever socks you have on, or for rough terrain. Good insulation- thick at the top, then moderate through the boot so it&apos;s not too hot and can be padded more with socks if desired. Light weight, water proof. They are good winter outdoor work boots.",

The fit is snug and comfy but still on the wider side, with socks the side gaps are filled and the extra cushioning make it comfier for cracks. But that huge toe patch that I though was gonna help with durability but is on the wrong side of the shoe and thus it starts to peel off, if the rubber patch were on the outer side of the shoe, it wouldn&apos;t start to peel that early, that&apos;s just a design decision I don&apos;t understand. Regarding edging, it does the job well, it&apos;s not great, but not bad either, just good enough.",

        "reviewBody": "The Greenland Jeans (48EU/US32”, long/34” inseam) are my 1st pair of Fjallraven clothing.  I bought the Greenland Jeans, in Buckwheat Brown, because of their versatility. Quite literally they are the most versatile jeans/pants that I own. You can wear them on casual Fridays at the office, going out on the weekends, for hiking, chopping wood, camping, or even rock climbing. They are the most comfortable pair of jeans that I own, period. I can tell Fjallraven spent a good amount of time designing the proper fit for these jeans. To help customers, my dimensions are as follows 6’1.5” tall, 33 inch waist, and 33.5” inseam. Just like a pair of jeans they are comfortably fitted in the upper leg (10” inch width). The knee (9” inch width). The lower leg has a slight taper, but nothing dramatic or overdone, just a slight taper (I measure 8” inch width at the leg opening). The seat of the jeans (crotch) is gusseted which makes the jeans unrestrictive when taking longer strides hiking. The Greenland Jeans have an articulated knee which allows one to bend down and NOT have the jeans clinch or restrict when squatting. I further attest that these are the ONLY pair of jeans that I have ever owned that have a waist that does not bulge when bending down or leaning over. Meaning a tucked in shirt will stay tucked in these jeans – the rise of the jeans is spot on! The construction and materials are unbelievably robust. The stitching is tight and reinforced. Meaning these jeans, with proper care, will last a lifetime. I am not kidding about that either – that’s how well made these jeans are. The Greenland Jeans are made of the original G-1000 material (65% polyester, 35% Cotton). For customers, who might be shy of wearing “polyester looking” jeans you need not worry about that. To the touch and to the eye these jeans look like they are made of 100% cotton. The original G-1000 material these jeans are made of is light. This allows ample breathing on warmer days outside. They do not feel stuffy like 100% cotton jeans do. On cooler days these jeans hold up to wind and I feel no draft. One other wonderful quality about these jeans is that they are SUPER QUICK DRYING!!! No joke, I took these jeans out of the washer and hung dried them outside. 10 minutes later the legs were dry and the seat and pocket areas were about 85% dry – dry enough that if I were in a time crunch I would wear them and not feel wet. There was a light wind that day. On the topic of washing these jeans I would recommend hang drying these jeans just as Fjallraven recommends. Why? Because all clothing will last longer and maintain their original durability by hang drying. With these jeans, as I mentioned above, take only 10 minutes outside to dry or 15-20 minutes inside based on my experience. Plus, it is better on the environment to dry these via hang drying. If any customer viewing these jeans and reading this review it is my hope that this review will help aid your decision. You won’t regret the purchase and any justification can be explained by the fact that these jeans are timeless looking and will last a lifetime with proper care!",

After wearing them sporadically over the course of a few weeks, the waistband stretched out so much - seemingly permanently - that I can basically fit my entire arm into the waistband along with my own waist. It&apos;s like the waist stretched out by 2 - 2.5 inches.\n\nI&apos;ve only washed according to instructions, and the rest of the garment fits the same as when I received it. I&apos;m now considering putting them in the dryer briefly to try to force shrink them back to the initial waist size.\n\nReally disappointing because they were so expensive and fit so well at first.

        "reviewBody": "Long review but I hope somebody can appreciate the details. Firstly, I’ve known of this brand for many years and always wanted to own something from them because all of the marketing made them look like they were truly built for the outdoors. Regretfully this was my first purchase and not only do I not see myself buying these specific pants again, but now I’m worried about their other offerings as well. I believe these pants are better suited for drinking IPAs at your local brewery in a flannel (mustache optional but encouraged) and putting off the impression that you are super into the outdoors versus actually being great outdoor pants. First, as for fit, i found them to be true to size unlike other review. I’m 5’9ish 170ish lbs (semi athletic) and wear a 32 inseam/medium in virtually everything. I actually ordered a 34 based on other review and ended up exchanging them for 32 because they were too big in the waist. Length is a bit long (its in the name though) but for hiking I actually dont mind (IPA pants though and these need a good roll or hem). I do like the fit of these pants. I appreciate a more tailored fit, however, there is absolutely zero stretch to these pants. And although they do have a gusset any amount of high stepping does create quite a bit of tension on certain seams through the thigh and crotch region of these pants. It’s not so bad that it’s uncomfortable but it’s certainly the type of tension that overtime I would be worried about tearing seams. Speaking of seams, it is not that there’s anything wrong with the stitching but more that it is completely ordinary. I expected more spending $140 and I guess I also just thought that this company wouldn’t be manufactured in the same country that most house sporting good store brands are, or costco for that matter (sorry Costco, you know I still love you). And that is not to knock overseas manufacturing but to highlight the lack of value these pants offer. I could better justify buying these pants if they were $80 (I bought them using a $50 gift card) but paying $140 only to have to replace them in two or three years like I do most other branded (and cheaper) pants doesn’t make sense. The material of these pants is a stand out feature as I do imagine it would hold up well and feels great. As for the thigh pocket? Well it looks great. Like seriously great. Its the main reason i bought them (almost didnt want to admit that). But its functional value on the trail (vs your casual intown hang out) is much less so. I don’t hike with a map very often these days, and if i do its not the kind of thing I need immediate convenient access to. If you do hike with a map a lot I suppose this would be a good pocket for you. But anything thicker or less plyable than a map, say like your phone, snacks, or anything of real use, will quickly become a bother on the trail. Again due to the lack of stretch and tailored fit it just starts to bother my quad (that IPA punch card however would fit nicely) The problem is I do not buy $140 hiking pants to go out on the town with (more of a jeans kind of guy) and I think that is the niche these pants fill vs a true rough and functional outdoor pant. I really wanted to like these pants. And this brand. But now I’m hesitant. Would buying the $200 or $300 pants they offer give me the true outdoor pants my heart yearned for and that 10 years from now i am still wearing on my week long backpacking trips into the wilderness and on the many weekend missions? I am doubtful. But seriously, the look of this thigh pocket almost makes it worth it. Almost. See you downtown I guess.",

Not sure which one comes with 4.5mm and 6.5mm adapters but I needed that. Now I have to purchase $16+shipping adapters kit in order to get 6.5mm one. 7-10 days waiting time is also very convenient in the middle of new bike build. \n You have 7 adapters in drop menu. All with same details and tech specification. Why? To make everybody life miserable? \nWhen you sell headsets, bearings and BB&apos;s item description and tech spec&apos;s should be full and clear. Otherwise you&apos;ll deal with very unsatisfied customers like me at the moment.",

        "reviewBody": "I just got this bag because I thought it would be a great size to keep all of the dog food and gear organized for road trips. It’s a good size because it fit quite a bit in the open position and it doesn’t take up much room in the closed (zipped up) position. I’m a contractor and the design is very similar to a wide mouth tool bag which I like. It’s a great grab and go kind of bag, so Im going to use it for work (laptop, paper work, water bottle etc. It has a bigger pocket on the outside which is just right for a phone and external battery. There’s three small pockets on the inside which is also great. The framed zipper feels very durable and the huge zipper pulls are comfortable. I would like to see webbing on the outside similar to the alpaca duffle if I could change anything. There are four little key or carabiner loops on the outside of the bag but for travel I always appreciate Molle webbing. Also for the price of the bag I wish it included a shoulder strap, you could easily attach one yourself but the only points to clip to might be flimsy with a fully loaded bag.",

The bottom straps are thin and the mounting design is poor (there&apos;s a flap of fabric running the length of the bottom, and they strap through that flap, leaving a lot of literal wiggle room) so it&apos;s not super stable. It&apos;s not going to fall off your bike, but you will be adjusting it all the time. Super narrow, so it fits remarkably little stuff for the size.\n\nStick to a design with sewn-in velcro straps, e.g. from Revelate or Dark Speed Works.",

Once I built it up, I wanted to ride the Exie immediately and kept the stock saddle on for that ride. I&apos;m glad I did. It&apos;s great! It is the only padded saddle I can even stand to ride long in. I have swapped all my MTBs over to this saddle and am seriously considering swapping all my bikes over. I&apos;m a saddle snob and honestly shocked that a &apos;cheap&apos; saddle would become my favorite.",

        "reviewBody": "The Volt is my second attempt at finding a suitable saddle for my gravel bike. I like it because it is affordable with just the right amount of cushioning. The chromoly rails seemed like the perfect choice for my chromoly bike. I went with a size medium and I would say it is a perfect fit for my 6’1” 175lbs frame. The saddle feels equally good when riding in the drops and on the hoods. At first, I wasn’t too impressed. However, I started to micro adjust each time I took the bike out and finally found the sweet spot. So, if an open saddle isn’t your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend giving the Volt a try.",

As I was out shoveling, I discovered the designer winter coat I bought from a big department store was NOT waterproof. Unfortunately, I weigh 274, so finding a coat isn&apos;t easy. After researching, I decided to try this one even though it is over $300. It fits great (it isn&apos;t loose, but it is comfortable and I can sit with it zipped)! It also is not puffy, so there is no added bulk. The sleeves are nice in that they are not too short and I can tighten them at the wrist with the Velcro. I also love the chest pocket--I put my phone in there and can listen to a podcast as I walk my dog. Well worth the money!",

It&apos;s much more &apos;professional&apos; than anything else. It&apos;s very slim/trim fit, so it doesn&apos;t have that feel of wanting to wear it hiking or camping. It&apos;s more of a shirt to wear if you&apos;re going to a pumpkin patch or orchard to take family photos. Or dress it up a bit and wear it to work. \n\nIt&apos;s a fantastic shirt and super comfortable, I just don&apos;t suggest it for any strenuous activities.

I have a 5L so am familiar with the features and felt comfortable ordering this one. Everything worked great as far as pocket accessibility, water bottles, and pack comfort. The major  disappointment was that it had no loops the attach poles or a sleeve. Not sure if this is standard on this model or if Backcountry just sold me an older model wo the options. Fortunately I was able to rig a system with my loops from the other vest that attached them on my back. I just had to take the vest on and off to get to them. Otherwise, great storage for what I needed",

Although I&apos;m usually a size medium (5&apos;5&quot; ~155lbs) I sized up to a large and it fits really well, roomy enough to add layers, but not bulky at all. The only thing I wish it featured is a detachable hood, I almost purchased the Aston jacket because of the removable hood, the hood isn&apos;t bothersome on the lift or in the turns. Thank you Halfdays!!!",

It would be nice if the front zipper pull was a bit bigger or had a cord on it to make zipping up with gloves on easier like the pocket zippers have.

I ordered an XXL of this jacket and didn’t want to zip it up all the way of fear the zipper would pop off and take out someone’s eye. It is a very slim fit. Going back to Competitive for refund.

Was well rewarded when paired with light long sleeve base and temp warmed from 52 to 59F.  Stops wind dead and and never overheats or feels swampy.  Have rolled with it and a heavier base down to mid-40s very happily. Polartec carries the day beautifully.  As usual for Castelli, size up if in doubt.",

After the first pair I bought busted holes in the top, I thought it was a one-off thing. But after buying two more pairs and having the same thing occur, I am really disappointed. \r\n\r\nThere are huge holes that form after just a few months of wearing them. This is from a couple backpacking trips and local hiking, not a thru trail or anything. You can tell that Salomon went really cheap and dirty with the manufacturing and it sucks.",

I&apos;m on my 4th pair of Paradigms and my 3rd pair of Lone Peaks....and I loved this shoe when I first saw it...but it was squeezy, and hardly felt like a large toe box. I returned the 9.5 which is already on the large side for me and got a size 10. They are so comfortable now I never want to take them off! I think the Goretex addition reduces the actual size of the shoe somehow, so I would recommend sizing up a 1/2 size.",

But I am EXTREMELY disappointed that the toe box is smaller, even though all Olympus shoes are listed as having the &quot;original&quot; toe box. It is subtle, but enough for my duck-shaped feet to feel it. It might be that the materials on the waterproof Olympus are just thicker and not that the toe box is actually smaller. If that&apos;s the case, I hope they can be broken in to be more comfortable there.",

The biggest issue is that the heel is so shallow that my foot almost slides out of the shoe with every step. No amount of different lacing helps. So disappointing, I really needed these shoes to work.",

If you were hoping that it would be a good pump for seating tubless tires you better turn back now, it takes decades to pump even the smallest 23mm tires. The pump head is poorly designed and bends presta valves. This thing is a glorified paper weight and does not belong in anybodys shop or garage.",

        "reviewBody": "I have been riding my Burton step on bindings with a burton type boot that has a true stiffness flex rating of 8 for 3+ years now on 2 different boards with their own bindings. The problem is they (Burton) did not continue to make the boots for women! So I got a chance to try these on in store after reading they had similar specs to the Burton boot… and what a huge let down! I have never worn Nitro and it looks like I never will! First off is the shrink it and pink it syndrome where manufacturers simply change the color of product and for some strange reason shrink it down to unrealistic sizes and slap a “women’s” label on it. \n\nSo the inner boot liner was so small that I couldn’t get the Velcro to secure around my leg! I tried on my normal size of 8 and the toe box was so horribly tight and rubbing that I thought I had tried on the wrong size, so anticipate these to run tight and narrow. Lastly the worst of all is the misleading flex rating of 7/8, which is a giant joke. These boots are soft with a mid flex of a 5 stiffness with minimal stiffness and maximum flex, despite the two tongue stiffeners which hardly did anything. \n\nThe snowboarding industry is a huge let down for me as a woman! Making things too small and inferior to my level and style of riding! My husband tried on the men’s version of these and he was instantly disappointed with the false flex rating listed on these boots too and I ordered him our favorite Burtons!",

        "reviewBody": "Been riding this bike all year with tons of bike park days here in Utah, Washington, and BC. This bike makes me feel like a hero even though my skills are far from it. The mixed wheels are perfect for riding steep terrain and feel at home in tight twisty corners. The kit on this build is the perfect mix of drivetrain and suspension components. If I had the extra cash I would splurge and go with the Reserve wheels though. \nTypical of Santa Cruz, the frame quality, fit and finish is industry-leading. I&apos;ve put many hard days on this bike and put it through the ringer and it still feels just as good as the day I got it. Add a lifetime warranty on the frame, free bearings for life, and the stiff nature of the frame and I have no doubt this bike is ready for many more miles of abuse.\nIf you&apos;re looking for a big bike that can handle big days, look no further.",

They are really well made but fairly light. the lenses work well for a super wide range of lighting from extremely bright in the middle of day to dimmer sunset. I found them quite comfy and basically wore them for my whole trip. The included features (nose shield, side shields) are all nice and easy to install/remove.",

        "reviewBody": "Having used these glasses for a lot of backcountry skiing this season, including a traverse of the Haute Route, I feel like I can provide some meaningful feedback. For their intended purpose, they are excellent. Fit, coverage, and optics are all fantastic. The lens works well in bright alpine/glacier sun at 3000+ meters. I didn’t experience any eye fatigue during whatsoever. Very very happy.\n\nHowever, one big issue is that the ends of the arms will scratch the inside of the lenses when the glasses are folded and stored inside their provided case. This scratching is enough to be noticeable while wearing the glasses. This is frustrating. I feel that I will have to 1. replace the lens and 2. add protective silicone tips to the ends of the arms. I don’t feel that this is something I should have to do for glasses this expensive.\n\nOne other minor complaints include the side shields as others have mentioned. They do not seem to want to be removed; I fear that if I try they will break. So mounted they will remain and that will limit the versatility of these glasses.\n\nAside from those two issues, these remain excellent glasses that I am happy to own and would recommend to anyone.",

        "reviewBody": "Great all around glasses. So far have used for MTB (moderate fall temps), 1 early season light ski tour and lot&apos;s of Resort skiing. Great coverage and they fit my expansive head well :) . Little fogging , so far only when stopping after high exertion skiing in cold temps. Very little wind bleed at high speeds. Not the perfection solution for flat light but what is ? My Oakley Sutros i with the snow prism lense are marginally better in flat light but more wind bleed and too light of a tint when the sun comes out. Love that the photochromatic lense covers my need for darker lenses as it gets brighter ( bright light fatigues my sensitive eyes). There are a couple of design flaws- super hard to remove side shields, I just leave them on, and plastic temple ends scratch the inside of the lens when folded in the case ( they need soft rubber pad on the ends, put a chums or other retainer on immediately).",

Zipper pocket it nice, a little different, but a nice detail. Fit is good, not overly tight nor large. Not what I&apos;d go to for a run or serious bike ride, but perfect for a campfire night or a movie on the couch.",

The lens does an amazing job on bright sunny days and believe it or not cloudier low light conditions as well. Comes with a clear lens but even on some stormy days haven’t had to use it. Really like now the frame protrudes around the lens so if you drop them lens down, they hit the frame and not your lenses! Great design all the way around.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought the black model and I&apos;ve been happy with it.  Excellent yoke, great size to the water bottle pockets, ABC set-up is great.  Very comfortable pack to wear around town.  I have not taken it to the trails yet, but the waist strap is not spectacular, so I expect that I&apos;ll need to consider the weight of the pack a bit more carefully than I normally would.\r\n\r\nI like the size of the pack but I feel it could benefit from an extra inch of width for the sake of getting a 15&quot; laptop in there more comfortably.  Mine fits but you definitely notice the difference in width with the pack full. 32 litres would be about perfect for this pack in my opinion.\r\nI am just over 6 feet and about 220lbs with fairly wide shoulders.  I bought the S/M size, which I am at the upper end of, but the large is too big for me.\r\n\r\nFull U-shape opening is excellent, makes organization and access easy.  I mostly use it as a top hatch opening in day to day use, but when I travel further from home I enjoy the full opening.  The zippers are a touch on the stiff side and the grab handle is literally just a piece of webbing, so smoother zippers and a bit of a beefier handle would go a long way for me, but I am knit-picking.\r\n\r\nFavourite things: Full clam opening, sturdy construction, ABC access, and side opening for laptop (has top access from inside as well).  Very comfortable shoulder straps.\r\n\r\nPossible improvements:  Smoother zippers, beefier grab handle, removable padded waist straps, slightly wider profile.  My personal preference would be to have the laptop side access completely separate from the main panel opening of the pack as well.  A place to tuck away the straps when they are not in use would also be a valuable addition.\r\n\r\nThis bag is exceptional in terms of its ability to cover a wide variety of activities.  I like it mostly for EDC around town, but with the right waist straps I see no reason why it couldn&apos;t rock the trail as well.  And for short hikes the regular webbing probably can manage just fine.\r\n\r\nBest pack I&apos;ve owned by a long way, so I am looking forward to putting it through the wringer.  As a final note, a lot of reviews dislike the tactical look to the bag, but in the black I don&apos;t find it sticks out so badly.  I am unlikely to use the molle attachments on the exterior as I think it gets a but chunky-looking once pouches are added, but to each their own I suppose.",

Mostly I use the pack as a junk hauler,  everything from shower towels and phone gadgets to small tools and “EDC” stuff.  The easy access laptop slot works wonders for an iPad.  I love the exterior pockets for pens pencils and notebooks, etc.  Whatever doesn’t fit can be strapped up with the Molle straps or any of the miscellaneous straps on the outside.  Extremely versatile.  Comfortable and adjustable with the same yoke system in many of their packs.  Downside, like most MR stuff, this pack is pricey.",

The biggest issue is the size of the main compartment. I wish you had a 35L, but without the &quot;pouch&quot; or &quot;cinched roll-up&quot; currently on the 35L Blitz. The design of the zippers on the 30L Blitz is awesome. Have you considered making a replica of the 30L in a larger size? \r\n\r\nI would recommend a Mystery Ranch bag for its construction and materials, and the fact that you will repair the bags. I would just be honest with them about the size of this particular bag.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had many other good packs over the years working as a network engineer that has to bring a plethora of tools with me through TSA, going site to site, and I spend quite a bit of time with a pack on my back as a result. Every other pack either fails at the stitching, or hurts my back or upper back/neck. The Blitz 30 just works for me, and conforms to my back enough to where I don&apos;t have any pain in my upper/lower back. I am 5&apos;10&quot;, and ordered the small/medium. I was able to custom size the back panel very easily to fit me perfectly. What an awesome system!\r\n\r\nOn it&apos;s own without accessories, the Blitz 30 holds everything better than similarly sized packs around the 30L size, which is the limit I&apos;m willing to stuff underneath a plane seat. I purchased a few of the small mystery ranch simple gear pouches in different colors so that I know what is what, and I stuff those into the internal vertical side pouches, and I have a soft-sided specialty tool bag for my network tools as well as the small mystery ranch padded power/cord pouch (mission control) that both fit perfectly into the bottom middle portion of the bag, which leaves a ton of room in the middle of my pack to hold things like a tablet and steamdeck.\r\n\r\nThis pack holds 4x of the small void bags, and 1-2 small mission control bags with relative ease in the main compartment, with a ton of room left over if needed. I also put my firearm in that middle space in it&apos;s holster when not travelling via plane when transporting off-person. I also purchased a pack of web keepers to tidy up the additional hanging webbing, so don&apos;t forget those.\r\n\r\nThe laptop pouch holds my Dell Latitude 5430 Rugged laptop, but the side zipper on the back portion does not work so well for my laptop due to it&apos;s thickness. However, that is not so much a concern for me, because I can just open the zipper below the admin pouch anyway to grab it which is another great feature. If your laptop is less thick than say my laptop or something like a Panasonic Toughbook, you will not have that problem. Basically any laptop thicker than 3/4&quot; might give you issues when trying to pull it out of that side access zipper. Speaking of which - The admin pouch is huge, and very usable!\r\n\r\nThe fit, finish, stitching, zippers and overall construction of the pack is second to none. I was highly impressed with the materials they used to construct this pack, and even the small pouches I purchased. This brand is expensive, but I believe it is very much worth the money so long as you use it daily, which I do. I consider this pack to be one of the best purchases I&apos;ve ever made. Thank you, Mystery Ranch!",

I found myself the other day running through a field with tourniquets in one hand, and a trauma kit in the other, trying to locate a plane crash.  I could only carry so much.  This bag lets me carry everything I need, and organize it in a way that makes sense.  The quick access to the main compartment is also why I bought it; I love the fact I can zip open the entire bag quickly to get at anything I need.  The molle also allows me to tie the trauma kit and tourniquets directly to the bag.  \r\n\r\nI also noticed that the Emergency Response Team medics use the 2-day Assault bag for their medical supplies; I expect the Blitz 30 bag wasn’t available yet at that time.",

The generous footwell is a game changer -- my feet stick straight up with zero pressure from any side. My entire body fits in the bag, completely zipped, with inches to spare. All that, and the bag still stuffs into a ball smaller than my head (and I mean stuffs! No folding or gentleness required, you can just mash it into the stuff sack).

I have a UVEX and Gyro in same style but the Dropframe is much better looking, so I had high hopes.\r\n\r\nThe BOA system is good but the implementation is bad, its difficult to crank down as the strings bind and then there is a very tight pressure in a small footprint placed on your forehead from the string system.    \r\n\r\nIll still run this but not for long days on the bike...",

These bibs have an annoying silicone gripper around the leg, unlike the nice powerbands from years past.  The material is so thin its virtually see through and not supportive at all. You couldn&apos;t pay me to wear these! What happened to Louis Garneau?",

        "reviewBody": "I loved the Fit Sensor 2 Bib Shorts and after 6 years of wear, looked forward to replacing my old ones with the new Fit Sensor 3 Bib Shorts. Rather than an improvement on a great product, however, this new version is a step backwards. The material is much thinner, the waist is much looser, the straps are thinner, and the overall fit and quality are inferior to the previous version of these bib shorts. While I am generally a fan of LG cycling gear, I would not recommend this product.",

And surprisingly, the shin protection style isn&apos;t too long for a shorty (5&apos;3&quot;).\r\n\r\nInitially the pad inserts felt too wide for the sleeves --- they curved inward and dug into the sides of my knees. BUT after massaging the pads into place and wearing them for a few rides, things fell into place and they&apos;re now pretty comfortable (well... as comfortable as knee pads can be). The pad opening placement at the knee was also bothersome at first, but that issue also went away after a few rides.",

(For Elbows I&apos;ve been using the Transitions but just bought some lighter Sam Hills)\n\nI&apos;ve used these Sam Hill Knee pads for 3 plus hr XC Rides, Hot mid Summer Rides,  Shuttle laps, Enduro rides as well as chilly Fall days with no issues. \nYeah they can get warm on 90+ days but they aren&apos;t that bad with that light mesh backing that doesn&apos;t bunch up behind your knees while pedaling and I&apos;d rather have protection for certain rides so I can push it. \n\nSuper Durable &amp; Long lasting, They are easy to wash!!

I wore them around the house when they arrived but I couldn?t tolerate wearing them longer than 15 minutes, let alone going on a multi-hour bike ride in them. Almost felt like I was wearing a tourniquet! Luckily, they fit my wife pretty well and I ordered them again in large. This time they were bang-on as far as sizing. \n\nI wore them on a two hour ride yesterday and they were so comfortable. Temps were in the 50?s here in NorCal so the added warmth wasn?t too noticeable. No crashes yet, but they seem to provide good protection (better than no knee pads anyways). These are my first set of knee pads and I definitely felt more confident wearing them.",

        "reviewBody": "So far, I love these pads, for two reasons. 1. They are longer overall, so the protection portion covers more of my shin. The sleeve portion above the knee does sit high, but I believe it wouldn&apos;t be as effective at staying on without that kind of length.\n2. They are sooo comfortable. I find myself wearing them all day without even noticing they&apos;re on. While pedaling, I don&apos;t notice them and they don&apos;t move around or slide up or fall down.\nI&apos;m seeing some comments about them being less malleable in colder temperatures. It would make sense, given that the SAS Tech is a malleable material itself, but I&apos;ve ridden mine all day in temperatures peaking at 50° F or for shorter evening rides between 30° and 45° often and had no comfort issues.\nFor sizing, I feel like they fit true to size. \nNote: I do have to wear these underneath my riding leggings directly on my skin, otherwise the silicone tape on the sleeve ends don&apos;t work and the top slides down.\nI will say that I haven&apos;t crash-tested these other than getting hit hard in the shin by my pedal once and didnt feel it, but I feel they are a good medium-weight, medium-intensity knee pad. For those wanting hard, heavy-duty protection, you should look at heavier-duty pads.",

        "reviewBody": "I know these pads get glowing reviews, which is why I bought them. But I returned them right after trying them on, I could tell they wouldn&apos;t work for me for a few reasons:\n\n- The SAS Tech pad is removeable, but the break in the material to remove them is right on the knee cap. So when I flex my knee I can feel the material parting and my knee touching the bare pad. The material has a seam and this seam rubs back and forth on my kneecap every time I flex my knee. I don&apos;t see how this wouldn&apos;t wear a hole in my skin. I have other knees guards where the material parts near the bottom in order to remove the pad, this seems like a far better solution. \n\n- The SAS Tech pad is MUCH stiffer vs D30. If it&apos;s cold it feels like hard plastic and I&apos;d guess it could be brittle, if this pad cracks you may be left with diminished protection. \n\n- The padding around the SAS Tech pad is too soft, and there is a gap in between the SAS Tech and the padding sewn in. I can&apos;t see the value in this extra padding besides adding bulk and making the pad less comfortable. The thought this extra padding will do anything is wishful thinking imo. \n\nThese pads seem to work well for many folks, but I also think some newer designs/materials might be superior at this point. \n\nSizing was good, I ordered XL according to my measurements and they fit well.",

That&apos;s probably ok, but the description says that the, The pad sits higher on the thigh than most pads of similar design.&quot; The pad doesn&apos;t sit higher, I would actually say that the pad actually extends lower down the shin than most But the retention sleeve does actually sit quite a bit higher on the thigh. I&apos;m just a little bummed because the pad seems to protect very well for a kneeling impact, but if you were to hit just above the knee in a superman style fall, you are def going to feel it. There is some foam in the correct position for this type of impact, but it&apos;s very low density and there&apos;s a seam that would allow a hit directly through as well.",

We&apos;ve since purchased a green grill pan to use on our one burner Eureka.  Why?  Cleaning this little grill is a chore in camp and I&apos;m a person that cleans it every time since we camp in bear areas.  Food sticks to the grill top even if you give it a quick coat of olive oil before cooking.  The food juices drip down into the grill and coat all the surfaces. Since there is no lid splatters go everywhere.  So now it takes washing every surface of the stove meaning you are wasting water and chill time after each use.  A green grill pan can be cleaned up with a reusable bamboo cloth and you are quickly on to post meal conversations.",
