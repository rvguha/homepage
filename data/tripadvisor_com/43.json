We lucked out with a gorgeous day and the mountain top was visible, something Michael informed us doesn't happen too often. The gourmet lunch was amazing and the tour was chock full of activity and time to rest and enjoy the breathtaking views. The views were indescribable - such beauty, it was like we were in a different country. Michael had every detail handled and was such a gracious host. Thank you for the incredible experience Michael. This was the last tour of our visit to Seattle and we definitely saved the best for last."

The views though would not not been possible if our tour guide Michael did not do his weather homework before hand. With the ever changing weather patterns of Mt Rainier, especially late in the season, it was very important to do that. We started at the top and worked our way down the mountain. By time we started our journey back down the mountain and back to the city, the top of the mountain was covered in clouds. If we would have done the opposite, we would have been in clouds and would never have seen the views or gotten the pictures we did . Thank you Michael for taking the time to make our experience the best it could be, and for being such an awesome and descriptive tour guide you are. Make sure you include this trip the next time you are in Seattle!"

We went on a beautiful (slightly strenuous – uphill) hike to (5) the most incredible views! (6) We had multiple diverse stops/treks to different mountain views, Reflection Lake and an old growth forest. (7) We never had to worry about anything – it is a total turn-key experience – never a worry about any of your needs.  Also, the best actual gourmet lunch. When you have a choice/chance to use Nature Nuts – you should! Thank you, thank you, thank you Michael!!!"

Michael was very responsive and patient to address our concerns.  About a week prior to the adventure, he provided updates and preparation details which gave us peace of mind.\n\nMichael is very professional and shares with us his in-depth knowledge about the National Park.  Despite the not-so-cooperative weather (very wet and foggy), it was a nice hike.  Michael took us to different areas of the parks with his very well-maintained van.  We covered mountain peak, forest, waterfalls and glacier river.  It was a very unique experience.   We also had plenty of time to take photos and appreciate the scenery.  But, we must admit that we were exhausted after a full day event.\n\nThe lunch was included in the tour and it was delicious with various options of protein.  Michael also prepared snacks and hot drinks for us.  The chocolate cookies made by his wife were the best.  \nWe highly recommend this tour to anyone who love hiking and want to explore Mt. Rainier National Park."

Michael knew all the best spots to stop at on our tour, the hidden gems and roads less travelled. He kept the van stocked with goodies and really took great care of his guests. Another huge plus was Micheals driving skills. As someone who is prone to motion sickness I can assure you Michael drives incredibly well, no sudden jerks or slamming on brakes or \"speeding up just to slow down\". Lunch was awesome, too. I just cant say enough about this tour experience, you do NOT want to miss an opportunity to tour with Nature Nuts."

        "reviewBody": "Overall- Average tour.  Good way to get an overview of Seattle.  I booked the tour directly through the company.  Good thing because I got a AAA discount which I would not have gotten had I booked through Viatour (Trip Advisor.) \nWe met at Wells Fargo bank and there were only four of us total.  (Nice) My mom and I and two ladies from Germany.  Our tour guide was a 22 year Navy veteran and former Uber driver. I think his name was Dave. \n\nThe Pros: He was pretty knowledgable about the area and gave us a lot of history about Chief Seattle and Captain Vancouver.  \nTold us about rough ocean conditions in the Pacific Northwest and the dangers of being a fisherman. \nTalked throughout the tour giving us good historical info. \nWe went to most of the areas stated on the trip.\nThey provided bottled water.\n\nCons:\nHe was kind of a know it all.  When his microphone was picking up annoying interference from his cell phone he refused to believe me.  He kind of argued with me and after telling him about having a degree in TV Broadcasting and working for a TV station for 20 years and THAT IS the cause of the exact sound his mic was making he countered with the fact that he had 20 years in electronics.  SO?  What does that have to do with anything. He finally turned his cell phone off and that ended the interference.  (Told ya!) \nWhen streets were closed he was very annoyed.  Ok, well stuff happens. Deal with it.  \nThe van was very hot after stops.  He could have kept it on instead of us waiting several minutes for it to cool down.  \nBallard Locks- Rushed through.  My mom and the two German ladies were all over the age of 65.  Why make them practically run up and down the hill?  Come on. \n(oh, and when I told him about going to China and going through the locks on the Yangtze River (3rd longest in the world) and that it took several hours- he was like, ALL locks work the same and they only take a few minutes!  I was like, well ours took hours.  He just dismissed me.  (Looked it up online- it takes approximately FOUR hours!)  He made me feel like I was some kind of dumb*ss and didn't know what I was talking about. (When it was actually HE that didn't.)\nSometimes when I asked a question he seemed annoyed. \nFremont Neighborhood- We didn't even go.  The Famous Freemont troll?  We didn't even see it.\nHe drove up to Kerry park so we could take a picture of Seattle. After that he asked if we wanted to be dropped off anywhere.  I said, Well, aren't you supposed to take us to the Space Needle?  He said, yes- and I said, ok, well drop us off there.  Not sure if he would have gone past it had I not said anything.  \nOverall the trip was fine.  Maybe he needs a new job and doesn't like that he was once a decorated Officer and now had to deal with measly civilians.  Who knows?  I was in the military too.  (USAF)\n\nBook directly through the company to save some money.  \nExpect to rush through locks.  Be prepared for attitude. Good tour that is comparable to the other tour companies.  I think this one is a little cheaper that Northwest.  That is why I chose it."

    "description": "This two-day course introduces students to traditional (trad) climbing on routes that follow cracks. Students will learn how to select equipment, place and remove protection, build simple trad anchors, and climb cracks and other natural features. These skills prepare students to climb at rock climbing destinations and in the mountains throughout the United States. Our course utilizes phenomenal learning environments such as the Index Town Walls of Washington where students find an abundance of traditional climbs of all difficulties. If students are interested in learning how to lead trad routes this course can be combined with our Trad Lead Climbing Course. Previous climbing experience is required for this course with outdoor climbing experience preferred. This can be gained on our Intro to Outdoor Rock Climbing trip.\n",

They hooked us up with Chloé, who was super knowledgeable, able to communicate ideas clearly, and was always encouraging us. She took the time to walk us through fundamentals as well as introduce more advanced topics as we progressed. Chloé is a 5 star guide and I hope to work with her in the future.\n\nWorking with Miyar to schedule the weekend was easy. I left a voicemail and Sandeep called me to set up the time that would work best. They were responsive and provided all the necessary information to make our weekend a success. I felt like we were in very good hands the whole time."

The instructor Glen is super knowledgable and insightful about everything from gear, protection to how to transition on multipitch belays, and everything in between. Glen was super flexible and accommodating to our hours and lodging preferences. His explanations were very clear and he made to go at a pace that you can follow, and allows for a lot of hands on practice. He was super patient and answered all of our questions with great insight. Our outing did involve a bit of scrambling on 4th class terrain, rappeling and even following him on easy trad multipitch that he led. In all occassions, he was super conscious of safety and made it feel safe by explaining clearly what he was doing and how he was keeping us protected. \nHe also provided us with great conversation, and he was super insightful about everything outdoors. We also had tons of laughs and just a good time in general. All in all, had a great experience! Highly recommended for those that want to learn about trad climbing and get a solid understanding of the fundamentals."

She customized our trip to include the most scenic areas so my photographer husband could really take in the majestic beauty of Mt Ranier.  NIce for couples and small groups. We were at the end of the seasons, so options for lunch were rather limited. Might be could to pack cooler with something from the market before heading out."

We were picked up at our hotel by Cheryl and driven safely to experience breathtaking water views, historical places like Ft Casey , beaches , friendly tavern for lunch and local shopping , explore a rhododendron garden then ferry ride back followed by busy ride back to Seattle . Along the way lots of history and facts about the area was given along with some laughs. Cheryl is a lovely experienced guide. Worth every dollar!"

At one point we spotted a bald eagle directly about the vehicle. I jokingly asked her where the button was that she pushed to release the Eagle. I truly had a wonderful tour. "

I enjoyed that trip so much that I decided to go on the Deception Pass Bridge Island tour and I was not disappointed. This tour company really makes you feel important. They only use SUV size vehicles that limit the number of people who can take the tour at the same time. It makes for such a personal and specialized outing and it's great to be able to talk to the tour guide one-on-one without a bus full of people to contend with. Thanks for another great day and all of the beautiful scenery that we enjoyed together. I can't say enough good things about this tour company and the great people who work there. I will be back!"

I contacted her, explained what we wanted to do (which included a drive down the street in Mount Vernon where my parents lived in 1943), plus stops in Oak Harbor at the PBY Museum and near the Naval Air Station where my dad was based during WWII as a PBY pilot, and she said no problem.\n\nCheryl was very accomodating of all of our  requests.  She also was very knowledgable of the Puget Sound area and its history and geography.  We walked the bridge at Deception Pass and toured the park.  She took us to a great waterfront spot for lunch in Coupeville.  Our day concluded with a ride back to the mainland on the Whidbey Island ferry.\n\nOur vehicle was clean and comfortable, and Cheryl was very personable.  She picked us off and dropped us off at our downtown Seattle hotel.  If you want a personalized tour of the Northwest,    contact her!  I am glad we did!!"
