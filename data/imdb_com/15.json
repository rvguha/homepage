He warned us that is was &apos;a pretty weird movie (chuckles)&apos;, and how right he was!\n\nHe did fail to mention that his movie was not only &apos;pretty weird&apos;, but also hilarious, absurd, violent and sexist.\n\nThe whole setting seemed to be some aggrevated, distorted version of reality in which politicians, corporations and the media played a bizarre role.\n\nI think everyone in the audience loved it, including myself. I can only say to you: Go see it!"

      "reviewBody": "As Stefan Djeordjevic, Tom Cruise wants to move out of Ampipe, Pennsylvania as badly as George Bailey does from Bedford Falls. He plays football, but harbors no illusions about a career in that direction. The pros won&apos;t take anyone his size so he just wants to get to college to study engineering. His working class father and brother can&apos;t get him there and as a B student no academic scholarships are in the offing. Football really is his life.\n\nThe difference between Bedford Falls and Ampipe is the difference between a rising and falling economy. If you remember in It&apos;s A Wonderful Life, George Bailey gets Sam Wainwright to re-open the old glass works for a plastics factory instead of locating in Rochester. There&apos;s a future in Bedford Falls, like there is none in the Eighties Ampipe where industry is relocating to the south and even out of the country. The future is definitely not in rust-belt Pennsylvania. \n\nEverybody wants out of that place except those with no future. Cruise&apos;s girlfriend Lea Thompson is jealous because as a band-member there ain&apos;t no scholarships for him. The coach Craig T. Nelson wants a winning season so he can get a prize college coaching job. All his other players have ambitions like Cruise.\n\nAll the Right Moves was Tom Cruise&apos;s sixth film and first dramatic lead, it&apos;s the film that made him a star. He was first billed in Losin&apos; It and Risky Business, but this one showed what a good actor he was. If it wasn&apos;t for All the Right Moves, Tom Cruise&apos;s career would have faded with the eighties. \n\nLea Thompson gives good support to Tom and Craig T. Nelson is far from the coach that we see in Coach. He&apos;s a bitter driven man and not happy when some in the town toilet paper his house after a loss and he sees Cruise on the scene.\n\nPaul Carafotes and Christopher Penn are a couple of other football players whose lives take an abrupt change in direction by other reasons than football. Best supporting player in the film though is James Battico who&apos;s stayed all his life in Ampipe. He turns out to be a malevolent creep, very similar to Robert DeNiro in This Boy&apos;s Life.\n\nAmpipe stands for American Pipe&amp;Steel. The town, the high school is named it. But the very name I&apos;m sure gives rise to other less flattering nicknames that I&apos;m sure anyone reading this will come up with.\n\nAll the Right Moves is one of the best coming of age films ever made and should never be missed when broadcast.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a thoughtful and well made documentary that looks at the subject of copyright from both sides of the law, and with an international scope, to boot. I get jazzed when I hear or see anyone putting the spotlight on the creative aspects of sampling and cut-and-paste technology, and not just towing the usual line about piracy and copyright violation. This insightful work explores the topics of hip-hop sampling, remix culture, file-sharing, movie piracy, and the current state of the music business. It also touches upon Russia&apos;s rampant DVD black market, Brazil&apos;s vibrant Tecno Brega remix scene, and the booming independent film industry in Lagos, Nigeria (Nollywood).\n\nA number of notable names in the copyright debate are interviewed, including mash-up maestro Gregg Gillis (a.k.a. Girl Talk), Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig, Grey Album culprit Brian Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse), MPAA chief lobbyist Dan Glickman, and Fredrik Neij (a.k.a. TiAMO) and Gottfrid Svartholm (a.k.a. Anakata), operators of the Swedish Bit Torrent site The Pirate Bay. The documentary initially aired on Danish television in 2007, but is now available to view for free on the official website. If you&apos;d like to burn your own copy to disc and share it with others, the directors also provide a torrent link for a XviD version. The film is well worth it, and if you have the means, I encourage you to reward their efforts through the optional PayPal donation. Even if you just throw two or three bucks their way (equivalent to the average DVD rental or on-demand title), it would be a nice show of support.",

      "reviewBody": "Hans-Jürgen Syberberg is a representative of the Neuer Deutscher Film, and it took decades until his works are starting now to reach worldwide distribution. &quot;Karl May&quot; (1974) is one part of Syberberg&apos;s Trptychon, besides &quot;Hitler&quot; and &quot;Ludwig II&quot;.\n\nWhile both Hitler and Ludwig II are sufficiently known to the US public, Karl May is probably not, although generations of German children owe their knowledge of American history, especially American-Indian wars. to his over hundred novels and novellas. However, that May has never gained fame in the New World which he loved so much, has its good reasons: Karl May has his whole live, on hundred thousands of pages, described landscapes between the Apalachian Mountains and the Californian Coast without ever having set one foot into the New World. He used encyclopedic dictionaries, reference works, every printed story and each picture he good get to let his fantasy wander through the Plano Estacado or to the shore of the &quot;Silver Sea&quot;, to drink for blood brotherhood with Winnetou or to meet Old Shurehand or the Shut. During the decades, May&apos;s own inventions became so real that he toured through Saxonia (which he never left), clothed as Old Shatterhand and believing that he is Old Shatterhand. Besides using a fake doctor title (which was &quot;appointed&quot; to him by a Chicagoan shoe-maker) and a series of criminal acts in his youth and early years for which he had spent some years behind the bars, it is a fact that nobody was more successful, in the 19th century, than him in editing worthless but very entertaining dime novellas. I remember the 60ies and 7oies when there had been, in Germany, the last big Karl May-Wave, when pupils spent their last cent for getting used Karl-May-volumes in thrift-shops or antique book-stores. It was the time when Pierre Price and Lex Barker in the main role filmed May&apos;s most famous works, the &quot;Winnetou&quot;-novels.\n\nSyberberg&apos;s film is a well crafted piece of high art, I respectfully admit that, not being a Syberberg-fan. But besides that, he has a crew in this two-parted movie that you will never find so easily on 1 or 2 discs. I just mention Helmut Käutner, Kristina Söderbaum, Attila Hörbiger, Käthe Gold, Mady Rahl and Lil Dagover. To see them again - many of them were at the end of their lives when the film was made - is alone worth watching this strange and uniquely made movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes, it&apos;s funny. It&apos;s silly, it&apos;s crass, it&apos;s irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.\n\n&quot;Superbad&quot; is, as you may expect from any film produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc), on the raunchy side. So don&apos;t be surprised if you see a penis drawing or 2. But what makes this an amazing film is that despite all the raunchiness and partying and horseplay it actually delivers some powerful human and sentimental themes.\n\nIn the hands of an inferior cast, it would have flopped and come across as cheesy. But with these actors, each delivering a larger than life performance despite playing high school seniors, it&apos;s magnificent. I&apos;ll give you just 1 example of what I&apos;m talking about...\n\nThere&apos;s a scene where 2 characters are gearing up for a sexual encounter (their first). But one of them (and arguably both) are not ready for it. Unlike all the teen romps that I grew up with, where the goal is for the guy to bed the girl, this scene makes us put the brakes on and consider: Wait... Why is the goal always for the guy to bed the girl?? And at the same time it&apos;s really funny and does not sacrifice the film&apos;s momentum. I won&apos;t ruin the ending of the scene, but let&apos;s just say it&apos;s satisfying on every level and punctuated with a great gag to make us laugh.\n\n&quot;Superbad&quot; is truly an evolution of the genre. It&apos;s every bit as crass and wacky and full of horseplay as all the others since Porky&apos;s, but this is the first time one of these mindless comedies dares to make us think and feel on a deeper level. Like I said, it&apos;s largely due to the great casting. Michael Cena, if you&apos;re not familiar, plays his signature role of an awkward deer-in-the-headlights kid but with a strong sense of who he is, even though nobody else seems to understand. Jonah Hill plays his best friend, sort of the antithesis: a loser who thinks he knows what he wants but he&apos;s really quite confused. Emma Stone knocks it out of the park with a great role that&apos;s quirky, cool, rebellious and responsible all at the same time. Rounding out the troupe are Bill Hader and Seth Rogan who play a pair of despicable yet loveable cops whose combined IQ is around the same as their blood alcohol level.\n\nThis flick has it all. It&apos;s definitely for mature audiences in terms of language (at least the unrated cut I watched), but ironically it has some great messages for teens and younger viewers, if you can see through the tomfoolery. There aren&apos;t many films I can compare this to, but if you&apos;ve seen &quot;Easy A&quot; with Emma Stone (somewhat tamer than this), I&apos;d say &quot;Superbad&quot; has the same vibe. A seemingly silly teen comedy that packs a serious punch under the surface.",

A charming family movie, all at once, an unsentimental love story sporadically. Raimu delivers monologues here that define the character and the nature of the others. Also, I must the add, the son of Fanny and Maurius is very well played. Pagnol must be applauded for bringing his hit play to the screen. A musical movie was made in the sixties starring Leslie Caron which put all three plays into one movie titled Fanny. I remember as being sporadically entertaining with its deep sets and lush technicolor. But this is the one to watch. Pagnol use of outdoor sets is invigorating for early sound cinema and his camera is an unobtrusive detailer and watcher. A fine movie forgotten but worth remembering.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d give the movie a 7/10 for entertainment value. Since the hero is new and not well known, I was reluctant to watch the DVD. After a few months I did and I&apos;m glad.\n\nNo one mentioned Gulshan Grover! He provides great comedy and charm in the movie and sets the stage for how all the main actors interact with each other. This is one of my favorite performances by Gulshan Grover and a must see for his fans! This role may be more low key and not as flamboyant as his big movies where he&apos;s the villain but he gives the best performance in the entire film.\n\nThere is a particular scene with a Mohd. Rafi song - great song and tribute. That itself made the scene very romantic - my favorite scene of the movie.\n\nIn comparison to many Hindi movies - the plot in this one isn&apos;t so bad. Actually, I praise it for having a realistic component unlike many movies where the heroine gives up everything for love. In this film, does she or does she not? It isn&apos;t so predictable.\n\nI don&apos;t think there was copying of SRK by Shahid Kapur. Actors do some things in common. In a sad scene, all actors are frowning (not smiling). That is the kind of similarity I would say the two have - a fundamental one. Although I do agree that he tried to pick up a few thins from Tom Cruise but no matter.\n\nIt was good entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "This is that OTHER movie made about Buddhist monastic life in Korea in 1989. I&apos;m Kwon-taek&apos;s film is far more conventional and has neither the depth or the strange, quiet poetry of One Shot Wonder Bae Yong-kyun&apos;s &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left For the East?&quot; The main character of &quot;Come, Come, Come Upward&quot; (Kang Soo-yeong, who won best actress at the Venice Film Festival for I&apos;m&apos;s &quot;The Surrogate Woman&quot;) is expelled from high school after wrongly being accused of having an affair with her teacher and decides to join a nunnery. The head nun has doubts about Kang&apos;s sincerity and devotion to the Way and casts her back into the real world after a crazed man becomes obsessed with her and starts to cause ripples in the serenity of temple life. The film eventually breaks off into two trajectories, one following another young, surer nun of serene countenance as she, too, is forced by the head nun as a test of devotion to face the evils and temptations of the outside world. One woman is destined to return to the monastery, and the other to forever live outside. Elegantly shot, as all I&apos;m&apos;s films are, but underdeveloped on the narrative level, as many of I&apos;m&apos;s films are, &quot;Come Upward&quot; never achieves the sublime heights of its similarly-themed counterpart in the same year. &quot;Bodhi-Dharma&quot; tried to convey the experience of Buddhist temple life through images, parable, and mystery; &quot;Come Upward&quot; is more literal, and plainer."

      "reviewBody": "Lets give a disclaimer here: I am a comic book nerd-geek and Spider-Man is one of my favorite fictional characters ever, so maybe I am inclined to be fully absorbed by this movie very easily, yet this doesn&apos;t take away from my film nerd-fan side that genuinely thought very highly of this film from a simple filmaking point of view. As storytelling goes I was very-pleasantly surprised to find a really strong grip: it never commits the Spider-Man 3 mistake of being over-crowded and maintains a brilliant balance on all the characters flowing naturally with a story that feels perfectly fine despite the pressure it had from Sony. It never tries to be over intricate but manages to pull of multiple inter-twining story lines in a magnificent way. Never does it leave loose ends and that is something I hadn&apos;t seen in a comic-book movie for a couple of years. Furthermore it isn&apos;t a banal plot, there of course are some clichéd moments but as much as they don&apos;t get me in 90% of movies they got me here (credit to director/actors for making those few feel very spontaneous), it has valid originality and keeps a core fidelity to the source material that deserves high praise. Just as good is the way in which this sequel builds on its predecessor tying up loose ends, proceeding with minor story lines of the first movie and adding great parts in it. As a director Webb proves to be amazing. The action scenes are complexly put together, with visual brilliance and continuity in them. Great improvement from the first movie. They really were breathtaking, nail-biting sequences that found me on the edge of my seat continuously. Another visual aspect that is stunning is the swinging sequences of Spider-Man: this is what I always wanted to see but never fully experienced with the other Spider-Man movies; the shots there were fantastic. Yet what I most admire Webb for is the talent he has for character development and coherence, we have seen this in his previous two movies and here it is firing once again in all cylinders. There just isn&apos;t one character in whom I did not believe, I never spotted the stereotypical comic-book person in here. Everybody had there chance to shine. Sure a couple of characters have minor short-comings and I understand if somebody doesn&apos;t believe in Electro&apos;s personality, but I found that it walked the line between movie acceptability and comic-book campyness in the perfect dose. To this I also have to give credit to the soundtrack which blew me totally away when Electro is introduced to the public: that was some serious use of music and sounds for storytelling, brilliant, intelligent! Adding to this is a really powerful score from Hans Zimmer, one of the better ones I have heard from him and generally in recent years. Our introduction to Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was positive on the character part (indeed there was no need for him to be green goblin in this one but I honestly did not mind him), yet from an acting point of view I think Dane Dehaan overacted in some scenes, nevertheless he was good enough. There have been many criticisms of this movie in regards to messy tone, unoriginality and rushed villains and as much as I see where people are coming from and I would indeed have appreciated a more untraditional villain(s) introduction and story I just never thought of that during the movie: there are many movies in which I simply cannot be taken in because of originality issues, but for some reason this one felt to me so fluent I never had any problems with this and actually felt it kept a consistent tone throughout. Yet I must address the fact that watching it twice I could feel the studio putting too much of its hand in the movie: they were way to manipulative of this and I think that by leaving Marc Webb just some more creative power this movie could have been enormously better. The CGI wasn&apos;t always seamless but great in many moments and anyways it never bothered me because the story was always the driving force behind it and what I was most interested in: this also speaks to the fact that the action was used to propel the plot so it never felt out of place, that is something really hard to pull off. There is lots of humor in the film and I can safely say that it actually is very funny and very faithful to who Spider-Man is and how he acts and to expand on this the humor fits both the tone of the movie and the storytelling, speaking again to the fact that, just like the action, it is used appropriately for the character development or the story, it is never gratuitous. I was excepting more fan service, but I can&apos;t really fault the movie for not satisfying my unsatisfiable thirst for it, that was nevertheless kept at bay. &quot;The Amazing Spiderman 2&quot; truly was a comic book movie. It took the best aspects of the two world and combined them in what I always figured in my head when I read Spider-Man comics. Yet, I have been holding back this for all my review and here it is: what truly is the best part of the movie, the most riveting element, the thing that Webb does best in a really majestical way, the driving force behind this film, the main reason and thing that kept me most absorbed in the drama and what gives it honest emotional depth is the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. honestly do not know how Webb is so amazingly good with romance and character interaction but what we have here (and in the previous movie) is something really special.",

Guy dies wrongfully. Comes back to avenge a group of people (the first one I forget who it was, the second it was drug dealers, and this one it&apos;s dirty cops). There&apos;s is the sad female character (Lucy from Seventh Heaven in the first one, the one girl in the second, and Kirsten Dunst in Salvation). And then there&apos;s the tough female evil character (Japanese woman in the second one, the one blond woman in this one).\n\nRegardless of this, I found The Crow: Salvation very enjoyable. I brought it over to a party tonight and myself and a group of friends watched it together. The scenes of violence were exceptionally well done, especially for a direct-to-video shot.\n\nCrow: Salvation comes out Tuesday, I really reconmend you rent it."

Ursus, Maciste , Goliath , Samson , Hércules , Atlas , Rocha ..., those Italian Muscle man producers must have had a hard time figuring out what to call the musclebound actors who played all these legendary muscleman heroes . Being other second-class Muscle men players the followings : Dan Vadis , Rock Stevens , Gordon Mitchell , Brad Harris , Samson Burke , Reg Park , Ed Fury , Richard Harrison , Kirk Morris , Alan Steel or Sergio Ciani and subsequently Lou Ferrigno .

      "reviewBody": "This sequel to &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; essentially begins with a gangster from Milan known simply as &quot;Il Milanese&quot; (Ricardo Garrone) approaching a small-time crook in Rome named &quot;Peppe&quot; (Vittorio Gassman) with a plan to steal the proceeds of an important soccer game being transferred by car after the match. To assist him in this theft, Peppe is asked to select several other men from Rome to help him out. Naturally, Peppe immediately turns to the same group of friends he trusted in the previous film--who each bring their own talents and assorted problems with them. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an amusing Italian comedy which, although being somewhat dated, still manages to entertain fairly well. Admittedly, I would have preferred a larger role for Claudia Cardinale (as &quot;Carmela Nicosia&quot;) but, even so, it was still an enjoyable film for the most part, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

      "reviewBody": "The idea is intriguing. For twelve hours a year all crime is legal, including murder; do what you want and face no consequence. All emergency services are suspended and with the exception of an unexplained restriction on weaponry, and certain members of the public being out of bounds as targets, there is nothing to stop you doing what you wish. The result is a venting of frustration and anger, a purging of demons, as well as the eradication of the poor and those unable to defend themselves. The end result of this annual purge is extremely low unemployment and crime, and a fantastic economy; &quot;a nation reborn&quot;, where the weak are prey and the strong survive. One of the strong is James Sandin, who sells security systems to fellow high-flyers; these obviously come in most useful on the night of the purge. Of course on the night in question, things go rather wrong and the Sandin family find their home under siege, following their son Max&apos;s generous act of letting a victimised stranger in.\n\nFor a second, put aside the rather obvious holes in the idea when considered as a practise encouraged at a national level, even put aside the cynical nature of the movie, and we can see the idea may have started out as a distressing vision of a near future, a terrifying &quot;other reality&quot;. Indeed, &apos;The Purge&apos; takes its cue from a lot of previous work that has done similarly; you don&apos;t have to look too hard to see various elements of &apos;A Clockwork Orange&apos;, &apos;1984&apos;, &apos;Lord of the Flies&apos; and &apos;Battle Royale&apos;. The problem is that unlike those works, and unlike &apos;Straw Dogs&apos;, with which it shares more than a little DNA, this story has been watered down to a locked room domestic thriller; a potentially incendiary political fable is devoid of most of that which would have made it so. This is actually typical of writer/director James DeMonaco, who is responsible for the screenplay for the remake of &apos;Assault on Precinct 13&apos;, a film which again extracted a lot of the original&apos;s rough edges and tough moments to leave a flat, action driven thriller. Similarly, the scope of the film is rather narrow; with early implication that there will be a study of repressed violence and how the night is used as an excuse, it is then disappointing to see the story steers frustratingly wide of all matters other than murder. The film lacks the gumption to tackle the disturbing elements of our unchecked nature in a way that Cronenberg would have done.\n\nSo what we&apos;re looking at here is a film which, in different hands may have proved to be a controversial and stirring piece of work, but with DeMonaco scared to grasp the nettle, we end up with a flat, rather tame film, which is given some lift by its better elements, such as the performances and some of the fight sequences. Lacking bite, with a frustrating amount of exposition and not enough dissection of issues, &apos;The Purge&apos; falls short of what it should have been.\n\nThis is not to take away from Ethan Hawke&apos;s solid performance, or some of the more effective scenes, but what we would give to have seen this in the hands of Michael Haneke.",

Other interested parties include Françoise Dorléac as Cassel&apos;s girl friend, Geneviève Grad as the exiled Princess of Poldova and club dancer, whom Brialy woos, and Michel Vitold, who wants the crown jewels for the cash. The police are present for comic relief.\n\nIt&apos;s a light-hearted romp as the two half-brothers one-up each other and try to figure out what is going on. It&apos;s reminiscent of Maurice Leblanc&apos;s tales of the master, although it lacks the elaborately detailed mysteries that provided the skeletons of the novels. Capably directed by Édouard Molinaro (best remembered for LA CAGE AU FOLLE), it maintains its old-time ambience via references to the war in the Rif and costuming.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m always leery of any film in which a couple marry when they are drunk and then can&apos;t remember what happened later when they are sober. That is partially the premise in this film; it is Robert Taylor who is the drunkard and he recalls what happened with great difficulty. Janet Gaynor had been drinking, but she knew what she was doing and took the opportunity to get out of her small-town humdrum life. To me, the situation is virtually impossible, and what J.P. would marry a man who is that pie-eyed?  Still, once the event happens, I found myself rather enjoying most of the rest of the movie despite its predictability. Only the yacht trip dragged a little.\n\nI confess I was never a Taylor or Gaynor fan when I say that the best one in the film is 8th-billed James Stewart, playing Gaynor&apos;s home-town boyfriend. It wasn&apos;t too much longer when his star shone much brighter than either of the two stars in this film.",

Interesting to note that de Havilland and Wyman would be up for Best Actress Oscars three years later (To Each His Own, The Yearling). Wyman was so impressive as Jack Carson&apos;s wise-cracking wife that Billy Wilder decided to use her for &apos;The Lost Weekend&apos; in a more dramatic role. De Havilland&apos;s sleeping pill scene early on gets the film off to a breezy start--she even lapses into a little French (long before she became a Parisian in real life). All in all, she does a wonderful job as the Princess in love with commoner (Robert Cummings)and facing a few twists and turns of plot before the ending. John Huston, her boyfriend at the time, was said to have coached her in the role. Jack Carson and Jane Wyman have good supporting roles--and Charles Coburn has some amusing scenes as de Havilland&apos;s overprotective uncle. Ten years later, &apos;Roman Holiday&apos; gave us another variation on this theme. One of de Havilland&apos;s better comedy roles."

Isa Haller may be the only actor who is looking kind of sexy and despicable - the others just fail miserably, man or woman. One may wonder: how could this even be filmed, or even be shown in theatres? Nobody knows nowadays.... So if you are into really worst case german trash films: take this!

One is a large sum of gold and the other is a half-man, half-ape creature. One day the doctor is killed by the creature and her home is left to a newlywed couple. It doesn&apos;t take long for the couple to run into the creature.\n\nSON OF INGAGI is best remembered today for featuring an all black cast, which certainly wasn&apos;t the norm for 1940 and especially in the horror genre. I&apos;ve seen a lot of the race pictures from this era and all of them suffer from having very small budgets and often time not having that much talent in front or behind the camera. This film here is actually pretty entertaining for what it is even with the limitations.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about this picture was the monster itself. If you&apos;re familiar with the horror films from this period then you know gorillas and killer apes were quite popular and they&apos;d continue to be throughout the decade. If you&apos;ve seen Bela Lugosi&apos;s THE APE MAN then you&apos;ll see a few similarities to this picture but I&apos;d argue that the ape creature here is even better since the actor&apos;s entire face is covered here (unlike Lugosi who the studio obviously still wanted you to see).\n\nOf course, there are several flaws in the movie, which is to be expected including some pretty fair to bad performances. I would argue that none of the performances are all that good but they had to work with what was available at the time. It should also go without saying that there wasn&apos;t too much suspense in the film and as a horror movie it&apos;s really not all that horrifying. Still, SON OF INGAGI makes for a decent way to kill a hour."

      "reviewBody": "When humans face the loveliness and miracles of nature, something truly awesome appears in our perceptions. In such moments of delight only heart can speak. And something so vivid, touching and surprising evokes whilst viewing the most captivating documentaries about natural world. And yet, documentary is, in many cases, still a &apos;docu&apos; filled with scientific facts. In contrast, imagine a film about animals when they are &apos;protagonists&apos; themselves and seem to &apos;behave&apos; before cameras. THE MEERKATS, directed by James Honeyborne, has hardly appeared to me as a sheer documentary but a feature film. With its viewing experience and the haunting voice of Paul Newman, I felt like highlighting my emotions and sharing the captivating feast for the heart with my friend whom I am grateful to for owning that little treasure in my film gallery.\n\nThe Kalahari in South Africa, the land of dry seasons, the land of thirst and wild animals that sometimes break the balance of nature. The Kalahari is the land where &apos;every sunset is a victory for those who have a chance to glimpse it.&apos; In between the harsh wilderness of this &apos;land of the giants&apos; live lovely tiny creatures, the Meerkats, who seem to &apos;understand&apos; that &apos;staying close&apos; to one another is an intuitive maxim of their lives. There are moments when hard conditions force them to do what they would not do normally. The absorbing mutual &apos;war dance&apos; against invaders supply the viewers with unforgettable emotions. Besides, is there a lesson for those tiny creatures of how to manage in heat when droughts kill any hope for survival and enemies that attack constantly? And what are the gravely dangerous enemies?\n\nThe patient cobra that knows no time and no mercy....\n\nThe enormous eagle whose wings and strength give him possibilities that may be merely a dream to many other creatures...\n\nThe lion, king among all who may also lack intelligence and tiny Meerkats may trick him when they are good students of their ancestors...\n\nWhat else can help them avoid the drama if not keeping together in family? \n\nBeing one of the Meerkats is a pride of little photogenic Kolo, the protagonist of the absorbing 80 minute-story that keeps even the skeptical viewer stunned in the chair.. Kolo&apos;s growth to become an adult and the adventure of being taught necessary skills by his brother is the major highlight of his existence within the helpful community. Although his brother is a supreme teacher for him, there will come a day when there is no more &apos;brother&apos; no more &apos;teacher&apos; but Kolo will be forced to experience the very essence of the Kalahari. Will he grow up to become the teacher himself, the teacher for a new generation of Meerkats? Indeed, there is much he needs to learn, much loneliness and obstacles he needs to overcome...Yet, the promised day comes for the brave, honest and the determined at last.\n\nThanks to the great contribution and tremendous efforts from the crew, including James Honeyborne&apos;s direction, Barrie Briton&apos;s cinematography, and Sarah Class&apos;s use of local music that resembles the rhythms of the land, the visual, aesthetic and artistic impressions are highly worth attention. The producers do a marvelous job in winning the &apos;trust&apos; of the animals. Kolo touches our hearts and makes us empathize with him to an extent as one of the most genuine protagonist could do. But not only him but a number of Meerkats that trust humans, are so playful and natural before cameras, who share with us (in such a genuine manner) the circle of their lives, including the joyful moments, the hard working moments, the dramatic moments.\n\nTHE MEERKATS is one of the most interesting documentaries I have seen about sweet animals that easily win our hearts. A gorgeous experience to be so close to nature, so close to the tiny creatures whose lives are filled with interesting interactions and constant mutual existence. So close to the miracle that Lord God has given to humanity through nature governed by its own rights but constantly creative, opening to all of us new horizons of seeing and learning from the little creatures. Also a lovely stimulus to understand the importance to protect the tiny ones. Stunning experience",

In the process, he gives a lesson on movie-stealing; hissing, prancing, yowling, sniffing, swooping, shrieking, he effectively makes the film His and everyone else is just annoying background noise. Plummer is in his own Universe and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. \n\nEven the anti- Vietnam War scene doesn&apos;t stop the laughter. It&apos;s so badly executed that characters fall before being hit, in two cases without being hit.\n\nAs long as Plummer&apos;s on screen, this is amusing or, at the very least interesting: without him, it is pretty dull.",

He is placed by a policeman for a job with a Covent Garden grocer Nightingale (Jack Warner) who listens to his stories of a fur smuggling ring with a filthy laugh.\n\nFelix Wilkinson (Alastair Sim) is the scatty comic strip writer who stories are being manipulated by an insider in the publishers. As the police does not believe Joe&apos;s fantastical tale, it is up to him and his gang to take on the crooks.\n\nI must have first watched this film as a teenager. It rather reminded me of those Enid Blyton adventures I used to read as a kid. The post war setting of a bombed out London make the city look like an adventure playground for kids.\n\nIt is an enjoyable Ealing comic adventure as the kids take on adult crooks and put themselves in jeopardy.

The script, credited posthumously to Orson Welles, takes a number of twists and turns, but they are neither clever or clear. William Hurt portrays Missouri gubernatorial candidate Blake Pellarin, an independent running against another independent, which is unlikely enough. The fact that both candidates sport Southern accents even though it is set in Missouri is another peculiarity that is never explained. Miss it and you&apos;ll be better off."

      "reviewBody": "I purchased this DVD because of its German star, the beautiful and soft-spoken Gudrun Landgrebe, who portrayed a tender and warm-hearted young woman so convincingly in the German TV series &quot;Heimat&quot;. In the German version of this movie, she dubs her own part with near perfection and makes all the right faces all the time, but is condemned to play the silliest society woman one may ever encounter on the proverbial celluloid: falling &quot;lesbianly&quot; (so to speak) for a sour-faced, lying and manipulative Japanese woman, even though she is happily married to a successful diplomat in the German government. After the viewer becomes convinced to have seen the peak of cinematic stupidity, he is in for yet further astonishment when said happily married diplomat too falls for the Japanese and, in this state, becomes even jealous of his wife. Now, this male reviewer may not be able to judge correctly the authenticity of a lesbian infatuation, but he can assert that, as a man&apos;s sex object, the Japanese is so low on the totem pole to be below ground. Those fake sexual encounters, during which the participants never shed any of their clothing, do not exactly contribute to the credibility of the story either. Only Gudrun&apos;s 1930&apos;s Mercedes looks genuine.",

Well played, Opie and Corman! \n\nThe film as a whole is fun if you like seeing kids outrun cops, but the Chow Fongs car chase scene is the best.

      "reviewBody": "I saw a while ago in the list of J.J. Abrams future projects was a movie called God Particle and a as then unnamed Cloverfield project. I was notified the other day that a new Cloverfield movie was already out so I checked it out as I wasn&apos;t expecting one yet. It turns out that while making the God Particle movie at some point they decided that it was going to be the next Cloverfield movie. Whether they felt the story wasn&apos;t going as planned or it was too good to be this low-ish budget movie called God Particle or it wasn&apos;t good enough and wanted to add the Cloverfield name to it to boost it or they just couldn&apos;t get together a decent plot for the next Cloverfield movie and decided to use this one or some other idea but whatever they thought and maybe we wont find out the truth behind it they decided God Particle is now The Cloverfield Paradox the 3rd so called Cloverfield movie.\n\nThe original God Particle movie sounded quite good with Russia and America at war which a group of American astronauts are in space find themselves being contacted by some Russians as they discover Earth has in fact disappeared. This was all done with around a $10,000,000 budget until they decided to use part of this story with extra scenes added to make it into the 3rd Cloverfield movie. When completed I read the budget was now around $45,000,000 and they felt it would be hard to get that money back through box office takings so they decided to sell it to Netflix. After reading the bad reviews which were mainly about the script and then watching it and reading the background of the movie I can see why people thought it was a bit of a mess\n\nI wasn&apos;t expecting much from this movie after reading those reviews but was hoping it was going to be better than what most people said. I was happy to say it was OK, in fact better than OK as in the end I rated it 7 out of 10 which is the same as I rated the original Cloverfield and more than the 6 I gave 10 Cloverfield Lane which I felt was over long and so slow paced that I was struggling to give it more than a 5 rating until the last 10 minutes which boosted it to a 6 in the end. I thought The Cloverfield Paradox a decent sci-fi, with a good cast, good acting, likable characters, plenty of action, some nice humour in it especially from Chris O&apos;Dowd, good effects for the budget and not a bad story considering its background and how it came about. Plus it seems to kind of explain a bit more of how the original Cloverfield movie came about.\n\nApparently the next Cloverfield installment is entitled Overlord or at least it is listed as that at the moment and at the time of me writing this it is already completed. Lets hope it is more of the original Cloverfield, without the found footage theme and with a lot more Monster/Alien action. :)",

      "reviewBody": "First of all Highlander III: The sorcerer is the french title used for this film, I just thought I&apos;d clear that up real quick.\n\nThose of us that live in America know Highlander III as Highlander: The Final Dimension. \n\nHighlander is heavly criticized due to the fact that Highlander II: The Quickening came before it. I look at it this way, Highlander II is like Halloween III it has nothing to do with the rest of the series the only exception is that it does involve Conner Macleod, unlike Halloween III which doesn&apos;t involve Michael Myers at all. \n\nI did not see the theatrical version of Highlander: The Final Dimension, I just recently came across a copy of the R rated Directors Cut of this film. This cut of this film is excellent and it is a nice sequal to the original Highlander if you forget about Highlander II.\n\nI think I can understand why this film was criticized, the theatrical version was probably released half assed with the scenes all cut up. The Directors Cut is pure and complete.\n\nI&apos;d like to comment on the love scene in this film between Conner and the female lead, it is almost on a pornographic level and it is no wonder that they wouldn&apos;t allow that to get into theatre&apos;s. It is greatly welcomed in this release though.\n\nMako does an excellent Job as Macleod&apos;s new trainer at the beginning of the film, he knows he is going to die and on at least three occasions gives Conner the opportunity to take his head, he idiotically refuses and his trainers powers fall into the hands of evil an evil that would hunt MaCloud many centuries later. \n\nThose that say that this is a remake of the original are greatly mistaken and should rent the directors cut of this film and watch this one again.\n\nMaCloud did win the prize in the original film, it just so happens that when the sorcerer is resurrected the game begins again,Macloud is actually defending the prize he already won, he gets an even greater prize when he kills the Sorcerer, he recieves the powers and knowledge of his trainer and his power of illusion, besides the overall prize.\n\nMany have asked about Highlander: Endgame, this film only works if you think of it as many years later, this film also is based on the television series too, we have both Conner and Duncan in this one. IF you see the pilot of that show Conner is there, we learned that he trained Duncan after finding him almost dead after a battle. This film pretty much wraps up that series and it tries to finish off the film series as well, it is confusing but you can make sense out of it if you try. The Villian in that film tops them all as he doesn&apos;t care about the rules, in fact he breaks every one including the Holy Ground rule.\n\nIf anyone else can figure out the link between Highlander I, III, the series and Endgame, feel free to write another commentary with updated information and your own thoughts of what if.\n\nHighlander: The Final Dimension is under-rated and the Directors Cut of this film should be viewed for best performance.\n\nThere can be only one, yes in the end there can be only one, we do not know when the end will be, it could be the end of time for all we know, immortals are always being born throughout the centuries and years, we don&apos;t know who they are or where they are, at the time end of time one man shall stand alone, at that point there can be only one, but it will be almost an eternity before every immortal is killed in fact the game has the potential to last an eternity.\n\nThose were just some words to think about next time you watch any of the Highlander films(except II) and when you watch the show."

They go to his manor and witness him dying frightened to death by a cat. Miss Marple snoops around the house and finds a piece of mud that she keeps with her. \n\nShe calls the police and later she reports to Inspector Craddock (Charles Tingwell) that Old Enderly was murdered. However he tells that the Death Certificate states the cause of his death as heart failure and Old Enderby had had a severe heart condition for many years. Miss Marple decides to investigate one of the heirs but she finds her dead in her house with her housemaid Miss Milchrest (Flora Robson). Then she lodges in The Gallop Hotel to investigate who might be the murderer. When her prime suspect is killed, she finds the reason why the assassin is killing the relatives of Old Enderby. Now Miss Marple plots a scheme to catch the killer.\n\n&quot;Murder at the Gallop&quot; is another highly entertaining comedy and mystery with Miss Marple. There are delightful scenes, like Miss Marple telling the Inspector Craddock that he should read Agatha Christe, or Miss Marple dancing Twist with Mr. Stringer. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Sherlock de Saias&quot; (&quot;Sherlock in Skirts&quot;)",

Even though you would think the chief demographic of forty year old virgins and basement-ridden, antisocial, hardcore, old-school gamers would flip the bill, Kong immediately offers so much more on so many different levels of psychological and sociological intrigue that anyone not self-conscious enough to feel embarrassed for investing an emotional stake into a Donkey Kong showdown, (highlighting a bittersweet anti-climax) will find themselves deep inside a world they never thought imaginable.\n\nThe mock-epic tone, which so many supporting characters delightfully contribute to, feels seized by director Seth Gordon and infused into his charming take on good-vs-evil, letting this potentially inspiring metaphor stretch it&apos;s wings into a blossomed, well-rounded quirk-fest far more fun then it&apos;s rigorous gaming pedigree would suggest.",

It kinda remind me my childhood. Kid&apos;s acting was not annoying, and directing - not boring. Storyline - simple, but not crazy unbelievable. Jokes makes me smile, but not laugh of course, i am probably too old for this humor :) But kids may like it very much. And most important, movie is not stupid and has some moral thoughts.\n\nIt is definitely NOT 2nd worst movie in history! I see A LOT of movies every day and to half of them i am not paying attention too much or just turn off after few boring minutes. Daddy day camp i watched till the end (and with some pleasure). 5/10\n\np.s. but if this movie had 3/10 i am probably never would watch it :) &quot;Worst in the history&quot; take my attention.",

      "reviewBody": "Luke (Strait) and Brier (James) are two beautiful young people who have a chance encounter on a New York subway. Shortly later, they both go to L.A. to find fame, he as a rock star and her as an actress, but when they run into each other again, they have to decide whether their relationship is strong enough to withstand &quot;the business.&quot; Undiscovered was named by many as the worst film of 2005. I can&apos;t say I really agree with that. The movie is kind of weak but it&apos;s still tolerable and it&apos;s also pretty harmless. The premise is fairly interesting even if it&apos;s not very original. The execution is only average but still much better than expected. The romance is pretty weak though and just not very interesting. The two leads don&apos;t have enough chemistry to make the movie work. There are a few moments of intrigue and some nice performances but the end result is still unsatisfying. The reason the film is kind of lackluster is because of the writer and the director. John Galt wrote the screenplay and he fails to really add anything new to this movie. Also, Meiert Avis just keeps everything by the numbers without adding any surprises.\n\nThe acting is only okay with Carrie Fisher giving the best performance. She isn&apos;t given a lot of screen time but she still manages to give a few funny lines. Pell James is pretty good as Brier Tucket. She has that &quot;model&quot; look and she has an engaging quality that kept focusing my attention to her. Steven Strait is only okay as Luke. He&apos;s a little dull but he has that &quot;rock star&quot; look that suited the character. Ashlee Simpson plays Clea and she is actually only a supporting character in the movie. Her performance is surprisingly average (like the film) but she should stick to singing. Shannyn Sossamon was just annoying and not funny while Kip Pardue was only okay.\n\nI think the supporting characters really kept this movie moving. The scenes between Clea and Brier were pretty nice and engaging. Most of the characters were also pretty likable so the viewer at least cares for a happy ending. The ending was surprisingly good but very obvious. The music wasn&apos;t as painful as I was expecting it to be. I don&apos;t really like the type of music that was performed in the film but some of the songs were decent. Of course, there were a few cheesy songs but they can&apos;t all be winners. I think the movie was unfairly bashed because of Ashlee Simpson&apos;s appearance. However, she didn&apos;t bring down the movie and the film itself wasn&apos;t horrible. In the end, Undiscovered isn&apos;t worth checking out but it&apos;s not a travesty either. Rating 5/10",

Behind the camera was William Daniels who was to be her favoured cinematographer.\n\nGreta Garbo had hoped that she would be directed by her &apos;Svengali&apos; and fellow Swede Mauritz Stiller but the film was already earmarked for Monta Bell who had, to his credit, insisted on casting Garbo after chancing to see her film test. Her leading man had very wisely changed his name from Jacob Krantz to Ricardo Cortez and although he acknowledged her &apos;strange quality&apos; he made it quite clear from the outset that he was a Somebody and she a Nobody. Time of course would prove otherwise.\n\nHe is adequate in the role, the character is a drip and there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between them. As for Garbo, she is far from being the finished article but it&apos;s all there and she is adored by the camera.\n\nShe attended the premiere(the first and last time she was to do so) and remarked: &quot;If I can&apos;t learn to act, they&apos;ll soon tire of me&quot;. The rest as they say, is history!\n\nStiller had coached his protégé privately but considered the film itself poor and although assigned to direct her next picture he was eventually replaced by the talented Fred Niblo. As Garbo&apos;s star rose, Stiller&apos;s fell. She was again lumbered with Cortez but next stop was &apos;Flesh and the Devil&apos; opposite John Gilbert. Now there&apos;s CHEMISTRY!",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie today and I have to say, it was much much better than I expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it. Personally I had some prejudice due to the language of it, but it did totally change my idea. The movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. This really touched me and as a film, which is based on a true story, it convinced me. A new school, psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher, a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn&apos;t seem to work out. It showed how little things can make huge changes in many things, and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. Also I think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly. It really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened. Before I spoil this movie with praises, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn&apos;t look and feel realistic..like the one where the headmaster of the school beat Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He really got beaten badly, but the only thing that it caused to him, was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning, when Frits got some stitches..well I guess every movie has it own faults..have to say, that if I someday somewhere find this DVD from the store, it&apos;s sure thing, that I take it with me.",

He&apos;s at is best when he&apos;s at the dinner table playing everyone but the kid. That is one of the funniest scenes I remember from any 1990s comedy. \n\nHis humor is very crude in here (another PG-13 rating that is ludicrous) but very funny in spots, too. With that kind of humor, it&apos;s easy to go over the line of &quot;good taste&quot; which he does on occasion. Overall, however, Murphy is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest &apos;showcase&apos; ever on film, demonstrating his comedic talents.\n\nEven though this has a childlike-romance-type feel to it, and a nice message about bias against fat people, there are so many raunchy and downright nasty lines - mainly at the comedy club or the dinner table - that it&apos;s certainly not recommended for kids. This is a LONG way away from the original Jerry Lewis movie. Still....for adults, this movie provides a lot of laughs.",

      "name": "A very good Noir film due to its realism and lack of clichés",
      "reviewBody": "This film is rather reminiscent of the excellent Alan Ladd Noir film, APPOINTMENT WITH DANGER (about a postal inspector infiltrating a murderous gang). In this case, the undercover work is done by two Treasury agents--Dennis O&apos;Keefe and Alfred Ryder. I really liked these two as leads because despite being far from household names, the acting was excellent and believable. Also, true to Noir, they weren&apos;t exactly handsome guys--more like a tough average man instead of the usual non-Noir heroes.\n\nO&apos;Keefe and Ryder play undercover agents who are trying to infiltrate a gang of counterfeiters. It&apos;s dangerous work and they can&apos;t just arrest people because they have no idea who is in charge. Throughout the film, tough bad guys (such as Charles McGraw) and unflinching but realistic violence is present--as well as an excellent level of suspense. Unlike some Noir films, this one pulls no punches nor does it give way to sentimentality. This is a seldom-seen but exceptional film for lovers of the genre.\n\nBy the way, I had one minor complain and that was the terrible narration. My score for the film, because of this, is knocked from an 8 to 7. When the film began, a Treasury official gave an introduction that was VERY stilted and he simply couldn&apos;t read his lines well. Then, throughout the film, a different narrator spoke on occasion and just wasn&apos;t necessary to the film--it was a minor distraction.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Paroles et Musique&quot; is an incredibly weak film and my score of 3 is perhaps a bit higher than it deserves--even with Catheerine Deneuve in the lead. There are many reasons not to bother with this film--I&apos;ll explain them below. But first, a brief outline of the plot. The film begins with Deneuve&apos;s husband leaving her and their two kids. What led up to this is uncertain, but he apparently left the country to &apos;find himself&apos;--whatever that means. After a few months of being very lonely, she begins a VERY brief affair with an amazingly poor musician (Christopher Lambert). As for Lambert, he and his musical partner seem to be bisexuals (though this is not 100% clear--but very, very, very strongly implied) and both decide in this film to explore relationships with women instead of each other and their musical partnership is tested. In the end, the music is what is important and despite some disappointments in love, they&apos;ll always have their music together.\n\nThis film is one of the least romantic romances I&apos;ve ever seen. There&apos;s practically no chemistry between the two leads and it defies logic that Lambert&apos;s character becomes so whiny and stricken with love for her considering they barely know each other. He can&apos;t sing, he can&apos;t write his music--all he can do is whine and mope about--now THAT&apos;S a great character! And, considering that she IS married and her kids would like nothing more than to see their parents reunited, you can&apos;t exactly root for Lambert--especially since their &apos;love&apos; seems to be mostly glandular. As for Lambert&apos;s partner, he, too, has an affair with a married woman--nice guys, eh?! I don&apos;t know about you, but guys sleeping with married ladies is NOT what I call romance! The second major problem is that Lambert and his partner are supposed to be wonderful musicians. While both can sing, their voices are incredibly weak and wimpy (like their characters) and their becoming a success seems silly--even in the dismal world of 1980s pop music! It just isn&apos;t believable.\n\nThe final problem is the ending. Despite the relationship between Deneuve and Lambert being so incredibly brief and obviously doomed, Lambert behaves like an idiot. You feel like yelling &apos;be a man, you wet noodle&apos; as he stops working and is about to give up his career. And he would have if Deneuve&apos;s character had wanted him! Not exactly a tower of strength and manliness! Overall, this is a musical romance with terrible music and poor romance. Despite my loving French films, this is one that is practically impossible to love and I can easily see why, so far, no one else has bothered reviewing it! Soggy and unappealing.",

      "reviewBody": "Antoine Fuqua&apos;s Tears Of The Sun is a brutal, tough war machine of a flick in the tradition of the old 70&apos;s war films, kind of like a brooding Dirty Dozen. Bruce Willis stoically heads up a team of special ops soldiers who are sent into a war torn region of Africa to rescue a doctor (Monica Belucci) from a missionary camp. Genocidal maniacs are encroaching into the area and it&apos;s no longer safe for locals or relief workers. His orders are simple: locate and extract the doctor, and no one else. However, when he comes face to face with the refugees, and their situation, he simply can&apos;t find it in himself to turn his back on them when he can do something to help. He then disobeys his orders, collects both his team, Bellucci and the Africans and makes a run through the jungle for diplomatic protected soil. His team are a grizzled band of warriors, each with their own unique qualities and opinion on his decision. Kelly (a badass, mohawk adorned Johnny Messner) believes it&apos;s too much of a risk, and not their concern). Michael &apos;Slo&apos; Slowenski (Nick Chinlund, excellent and understated) takes a compasionate standpoint. Second in command Red Atkins (Cole Hauser) trusts Willis is making the right call. Soon they are pursued by the extremists, led by a hulking Peter Mensah, before King Leonidas kicked him into the Sarlak pit. The combat scenes are hard hitting, seemingly very well rehearsed and researched. The only problem for me was the overbearing and extended sequences of genocide, which are harrowing and quite tough to watch. When it&apos;s combat based it&apos;s a damn fine piece, with a rugged, thoughtful band of heroes who are an absolute joy to see in action. Rounding out the team are Eamonn Walker, Charles Ingram, Paul Francis, Chad Smith and a briefly seen Tom Skerritt as Willis&apos;s commanding officer. Tough, muscular and no nonsense, with burgeoning compassion that gives that soldiers purpouse beyond the cold lethality of the mission. Fuqua has a terrific collection of lean and mean action flicks under his belt, and this is one of the best.",

      "reviewBody": "I like the surface simplicity of this movie, beneath which lie important questions: Can we be free of our ancestors&apos; demons?   Can love between two emotionally crippled people be healthy?\n\nMadge and Hal are  -- probably tragically - made for each other.  Each is a product of a broken home.  Each wants to create a life worth living, despite family history, circumstances, and friends who expect little of them.  My heart goes out to both of them.  (The sad truth is that Madge&apos;s mother&apos;s warning will probably come true.)\n\nI love the ambiguity of the movie&apos;s ending.  I read that William Inge (or was it the screenwriter?) had originally had Madge return to her five and dime deadend job.  I much prefer the ending that Mr. Logan chose.\n\nAlcohol ought to be listed in the cast credits.  It plays a big role at the picnic, and the effects of parental alcoholism pervade Hal&apos;s and Madge&apos;s lives.\n\nRoz Russell the town schoolmarm and Howard the shopkeeper provide delightfully lighthearted counterpoints.\n\nNo car crashes, no karate.  Just a simple story, simple setting, and timeless questions."

However, Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin and John Goodman are all so entertaining to watch that I&apos;ve always enjoyed this film no matter how many times I&apos;ve seen it.\n\nThe suspense is what this film is all about, but I am fascinated with these actors, including supporting performances by Michael Rooker and William Hickey. Although her looks are a little hard and her mouth way too profane for my tastes, Barkin never looked better and sexier. That Pacino&apos;s character, &quot;Detective Frank Keller&quot; would fall for her is understandable, especially know what part of his anatomy is doing the &quot;talking.&quot; However, adultery, once again is excused in this film along with other not-so-moral acts so this isn&apos;t a film you want to show to your church group. All three of the leads are very weak, ethically-speaking.\n\nThe fact that this film can go on for almost two hours with very little action and still keep you riveted to your seat speaks highly of its entertainment value. Why critics knocked it so much, I don&apos;t know. Hey, it&apos;s good entertainment. What more do you want?",

The other actors play competently. The soundtrack is nice. However, the script is at times generic if not approximative. The story in itself is very dark and presents a tormented leading woman split between ambition and guilt. My vote is 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Today, &quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot; is considered a classic. The film itself has become a cliche for the &quot;man-in-a-rubber-suit&quot; monster movie, and the &quot;gillman&quot; is now included in the pantheon of classic movie monsters -along with Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman.\n\nI was a teenager when I first saw this Sci-Fi/Horror gem on television in 1965--the film was already ten years old by then--and I loved it. Surprisingly--even after a decade of watching technically sophisticated, state-of-the-art, unbelievably realistic prosthetic, animatronic, and computer-generated movie monsters--today&apos;s teenagers still love the old &quot;rubber&quot; prototype of all swamp monsters -&quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot;. This is especially true of teenage boys. Why? Perhaps every adolescent male can relate to the film&apos;s star: the Creature is horny, inarticulate, moody, misunderstood, not pleasant to look at, and is unbelievably awkward with girls -the ultimate teenage &quot;geek&quot;. We all remember this classic scene in the movie: the film&apos;s beautiful heroine (Julie Adams) decides to take a dip, unaware that the Creature is swimming below her. The image is archetypal : the powerful &quot;masculine&quot;, and the overtly seductive &quot;feminine&quot;, beautifully juxtaposed in a stylized sexual union. Then, from the murky bottom of his lagoon, the Creature leeringly watches Adams as she performs an erotic underwater ballet, and he knows that, for the moment, he can only look, not touch. (Is the &quot;scaly one&quot; shy and insecure? Or does he simply have a Catholic upbringing?) Indeed, much of the film&apos;s imagery lends itself to Freudian interpretation.\n\n OK, so it&apos;s not exactly &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; -the Creature&apos;s passion is purely primal and elemental. But still, the fact that he restrains himself, satisfying his carnal curiosity with a simple caressing of Julie&apos;s ankles, and then retreats back to the gloomy bottom of his underwater sanctum to secretly watch her react in bewilderment, suggests he may be more human than he appears. But, alas, as any good Freudian will tell you, repression often leads to disfunction. And later in the film, in a brief, but beautifully filmed underwater scene, the Creature savagely drags the tantalizing &quot;Playboy centerfold&quot; down into the Freudian depths to his subterranean grotto -perhaps to hide her under his bed...where his mom can&apos;t find her. (I apologize for the metaphor. It&apos;s getting stale, I know.)\n\n&quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot; was directed by Jack Arnold (&quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;), who (from 1952 to 1960) directed a series of fantasy/horror films for Universal Studios, including &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot; -this film&apos;s sequel. Arnold would certainly object to us reading too much symbolism in his gillman, but the Creature may not have achieved such enduring status in monster-mythology if not for the fears and anxieties of the movie-going audience of the &apos;50s. Arnold&apos;s dramatic use of the Creature succeeds, of course, by exploiting the human fear of the unseen threat lurking below -a very primal, deeply embedded in the human subconscious, and one that&apos;s been ruthlessly exploited by filmmakers in countless horror films. But Arnold&apos;s beast may also represent a more intellectualized fear. In the 1950s (and beyond), the threat of nuclear annihilation was very real, and like the creature in Shelly&apos;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Arnold&apos;s lagoon creature represents an elemental force of nature that, once discovered and awakened by science (even well-intentioned science), cannot be controlled -perhaps like the newly tapped, but untamed, power of the atom. Or (and this may sound like apostasy in one of John&apos;s pretentious, sophistical, over-intellectualized movie reviews, in which I&apos;ve constantly and digressively wandered into the Freudian morass) perhaps the Creature is not a mataphor for teenage angst, forbidden knowledge, or cold-war anxiety. Perhaps the Creature is nothing more than a guy in a scary rubber suit chasing a pretty girl around a movie soundstage. But where&apos;s the fun in that?\n\n&quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot; is still fun to watch. Actors Richard Carlson (the sophmoric, but noble-minded paleozoologist) and Richard Denning (the ambitious financier) play off each other well. And Julie Adams is simply gorgeous in her custom-made swimsuit. Also, the beautiful (albeit black &amp; white) underwater photography by James C. Haven is appropriately surreal: as the men begin their search and descend into the black depths of the lagoon, they intermittently twirl and hover amidst penetrating shafts of sunlight from above; and as the camera pans the peaceful bottom-landscape of the lagoon, the gillman suddenly springs from clouds of disturbed sediment, thrashing through curtains of shimmering air bubbles and drifting weeds, determined and unstoppable in his persuit of the human intruders. But one of the best things about the movie is the music. Some of the themes--written by Henry Mancini and Herman Stein--are quite beautiful; for example, as the expedition slowly makes its way up the dark Amazon, an ensemble of gentle woodwinds can be heard -a soft, subliminal prelude that lets us know we are entering another world, a primeval world. And who can forget the Creature&apos;s signature theme--the brassy, bombastic, three-note progression of DA DA DAAAAA!--whenever &quot;Creech&quot; appeared on the screen?\n\n Of course, the best thing in the film is...the Creature. Jack Arnold suggested that the design of the gillman suit be based on the graceful form of the Motion Picture Academy&apos;s &quot;Oscar&quot; statuette. (Really!) The suit was designed and brilliantly crafted by make-up artist Bud Westmore, and there were two versions -one suit for filming on land, and another for filming underwater. On land, the gillman was played by Ben Chapman. Olympic swimmer Ricou Browning wore the gillman suit in the underwater scenes. The &quot;dry suit&quot; that Chapman wore was beautifully colored with iridescent greens and blues, and mottled with many other marine hues. The &quot;wet suit&quot; worn by Browning was a bright yellow -the marine hues chosen for the &quot;dry suit&quot; photographed too dark when filming underwater.\n\n Yeah, I really love this movie. I&apos;m not sure why. Perhaps it&apos;s just one geek relating to another. You see, in the final reel, neither of us got the girl."

      "reviewBody": "The storyline is inspired from When Harry Met Sally, but the indianised version with a few foreign cities thrown in is a good entertainer. Karan, a cartoonist, meets Rhea on a flight to New York. They get well acquainted during a 6 hour stop over in Amsterdam. They have a fall out and they end up going their separate ways once they get to New York. Their chance meetings over then next few years and how their friendship develops gradually over time and how they end up falling in love without even realizing it forms the gist of the story. Saif Ali Khan fits Karan&apos;s role perfectly and Rani makes a wonderful Rhea. Even the supporting cat has done a great job. The use of the cartoon characters Hum and Tum in the story narrative adds some color to the movie. It is a welcome change from the cop flicks that have dominated the Indian screen in 2004. All in all, a wonderful movie, worth watching at least once on the big screen."

      "name": "Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre",
      "reviewBody": "While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.\n\nWritten and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter&apos;s Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.\n\nBecause a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very cliché and unrealistic fashion. What&apos;s original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn&apos;t follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn&apos;t predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn&apos;t been in a film without the words &apos;Rush Hour&apos; in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.\n\nThe most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he&apos;s ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn&apos;t be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper&apos;s best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence&apos;s role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence&apos;s work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichés. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can&apos;t help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-",

I gave it a verrrrry generous 7 out of 10. It is clearly a virtual ripof of Tod Browning&apos;s &quot;Dracula,&quot; and it does even measure up to Werner Herzog&apos;s remake of F.W. Murnau&apos;s German classic &quot;Nosferatu.&quot; But,as a Turkish-American, I have to thank showtvnet.com for providing this interesting guilty pleasure (sorry no subtitles) which does drag at times, but considering this film was made almost 50 years ago when Turkish film standards were even lower than they were in the &apos;ala Turka cinema renaissance &apos; of the &apos;70s (when enormous numbers of bad films were made left and right) this has to be viewed as a noble effort. Along with &quot;SCream Blacula Scream,&apos; and perhaps (I&apos;ve never seen it) &quot;Billy the Kid Meets Dracula,&quot; it has to be one of the more unusual takes on this much-filmed saga.",

This was old news as far back as the &apos;40s.\n\nBut in the &apos;70s...well....  Let&apos;s just say that it looks new.  For the &apos;70s.\n\nGil is game as Buck, shooting laser guns and cracking wise and making a good space-age hero.  And Gray&apos;s Wilma Deering is both stern and soft as the Earth&apos;s military leader.  Felix Silla makes a good impression as Twiki (with a more-than-equal assist from Mel Blanc&apos;s voice wizardry) and as Princess Ardala, Hensley gives what must be the most sensual performance from an alien up to that point in time.\n\nBut the special effects are clearly from the &apos;70s, as is the music (disco music in the 25th century?  Someone must have unearthed Studio 54.) and the set design: its glittery, shiny look may have been futuristic then, but now it just looks more &apos;70s than anything else.\n\nYes, it&apos;s a dated future.\n\nBut is it entertaining?\n\nPretty much.  No one went into this thinking they were making &quot;2001&quot;, but are spots here and there where it looks like everyone was having a good time with the material.  Especially Gil, who just plain has fun with his role as the 25th century&apos;s loosest guy.\n\nToo bad they cut out Wiseman&apos;s work as King Draco.  Some of his best stuff since &quot;Dr. No&quot;.\n\nSix stars.  Here&apos;s to futures past."

What happens to Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis is every traveler&apos;s nightmare in between all the laughs.\n\nStarting with the circling around the airport, I remember once circling an hour and a half at Newark Airport because flights were backed up and that&apos;s after an hour delay from Rochester. That was 20 years ago and I haven&apos;t had anything like that happen to me recently. It can be incredibly nerve wracking and I well sympathize with what was happening.\n\nThat would normally be enough. But Mr.&amp;Mrs. Kellerman go exponential Murphy on this trip. Everything that can go wrong does, every single solitary thing from lost luggage to canceled hotel reservations to spending a night on the ground at Central Park and plenty more besides. All this on a nice dreamed of vacation in New York for this middle America Ohio couple who are combining business and pleasure as Lemmon is also in town for a job interview.\n\nJack Lemmon is a perfect fit for his American everyman character and Sandy Dennis provides an interesting brand of quirkiness as the wife. Although there are some talented players in the cast including a rising Billy Dee Williams in the role of a ticket agent, they&apos;re fairly one dimensional as the film for about 90% of the time focuses on Lemmon and Dennis and their travails in the Big Apple.\n\nDo they get out of all their woes. Well I can say is, think about that musical number that Bing Crosby and Olga San Juan did in Blue Skies.",

Atmosphere is not that great, it really gives you some promise, but the characters ruin it. Maybe too much light also. \n\nMovie is not bad BAD movie but to me it was not enjoyable at all.

      "reviewBody": "White Noise comes across as a horror movie that tries to do something original before they are forced into doing a remake of an Asian film. It will still draw comparison with Hideo Nakata&apos;s Ring trilogy because of the static TV&apos;s but that is unfair due to the subject. The subject being Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP), which is a paranormal occurrence where the dead contact the living through static, recorded on the TV or a sound recording device. Original enough to make a movie about plus scary things jumping out of a static TV is relevant to the subject. Yay Hollywood. The apparent decent plot and the not-too-shabby cast headed by Michael Keaton actually had me very eager to see this, such a shame then that the movie actually doesn&apos;t do what it says on the tin.\n\nThe first half of the movie is a decent drama about the loss of a mans wife and his obsession with contacting her from beyond the grave whilst his work and the relationship with his son suffers. The second half however seems to just draw from the basic scary movie template and disappointingly swerves away from the dead contacting the living and into Keaton running around like a psychic detective in a race against time trying to save people from dark forces.\n\nThe movie opens in generic perfect home situation. Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers the successful architect who is married to his wife Anna the successful author, even his sons mother (the divorcée) has a good relationship with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rivers. Apart from the radio skipping to static a few times (an unused plot device?) things seem pretty rosy. Until &quot;I love you&quot; gets mouthed from the wife leaving the driveway taking the kid to school. Automatic dead meat. When will they learn? The police assume she slipped from the motorway, bashed her head on a rock then got taken away by the tide but Jonathan doesn&apos;t accept her death and doesn&apos;t give up hope. However, on his first day back from work since his wife went missing he is followed by a stranger whom he confronts. The stranger turns out to be some sort of expert in a phenomenon known as EVP and he says not only is Anna dead but she has been contacting him from the other side. Jonathan dismisses it until she leaves a message on his answering machine. Yeah, it is that simple. Cue Jonathan getting obsessed about finding out what her message is, mishaps happening and Jonathan getting even more obsessed over something completely different. Drawing in another believer in EVP they investigate into messages the recording equipment seems to be getting from the future.\n\nThe ending leaves the movie ridden with plot holes, which has frankly become expected of movies like this from the past few years. It could have been so much more. Perhaps the director was wary of making this film &apos;The Sixth Sense from the other point of view&apos; but then again the CGI scary ghosts wouldn&apos;t work in a more subtle setting like that. The plot turns into some non-sensical slush whilst the score let&apos;s the film down. The acting wasn&apos;t the strongest either but if you want to be scared every 20 minutes by the volume being cheaply cranked up and CGI ghouls flying out of static then go spend your hard earned cash on this.\n\n6/10 Robb Idle",

      "reviewBody": "In a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema, in terms of capturing those strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies self-indulgently fooling around with a camera. Ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability (thankfully much more so the former than the latter). Part of me wants to reward it solely for it&apos;s absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I can&apos;t completely ignore the occasionally downright awful &quot;acting&quot; and overtly bad production values. At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting (or maybe just wrongheadedly &quot;innovative&quot;), but after a while I got used to it, which is, in the end, the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it&apos;s own terms or not. I guess that answer basically sums up my all-around feelings for the film. That is, despite it&apos;s in-ignorable flaws, on a whole it does work very well. And, if nothing else, a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux-documentary, shaky-cam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect (such as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger). Here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation, and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look &quot;cool&quot;.",

Her acting did not seem like acting as it did in Xanadu when she tells Sunny that she is a muse. Instead everyone in the Toomorrow group seem to be enjoying themselves as they go through the film.\n\nGranted the movie is not Oscar material but considering how bad so much is today, I would love to see Toomorrow on the big screen or at least come out on DVD.\n\nDefinitely worth a look.",

Secondly Val Kilmer&apos;s performance. He&apos;s not acting, he&apos;s just there fighting the obstacles. Thirdly Mike Douglas&apos;s influential way of telling things. He&apos;s more convincing than in &apos;Basic Instinct&apos; and sorry Oliver, &apos;The Wall Street&apos;. His macho appearance doesn&apos;t interfere with the main plot but comes to be part of it. Last not least it&apos;s Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s music. I don&apos;t know how he did it but he made it perfect. You just have to sense it to feel it. One of my favourites."

But then, Joe finds that children dying at the hospital  have seen his wife when they are near death, like a young boy named  Jeffrey who is at the hospital for cancer. Now, Joe must find what his  wife wants him to find.   This movie was interesting and good. I give Dragonfly a 9 out of 10. :)"

If you want to see a film based on &quot;Shadow Over Innsmouth,&quot; Stuart Gordon&apos;s &quot;Dagon&quot; is mediocre, but it&apos;s certainly better than this botched attempt. If you want to see &quot;Call of Cthulhu,&quot; the silent film adaptation is great. But this? This film is a waste of time. I suspect the people who are writing 10 out of 10 scores are either friends of the director or shills who worked on the film. There is no earthly way this film is a 10. It stinks like a rotten pile of fish.",

If that&apos;s not your thing then don&apos;t complain if you didn&apos;t like it.\n\nIf you can&apos;t stand Hayden Christensen, then don&apos;t see a Hayden Christensen movie. It&apos;s as simple as that, folks. He&apos;s not Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio, don&apos;t expect an Oscar worthy performance. However he&apos;s not bad on the eyes and as shy as he is, he&apos;s not unbearable on screen.\n\nPersonally I thought it was entertaining from beginning to end, not memorable. Acting was bearable, Sam Jackson played a badass as usual. There was a bit of humour, I liked Jamie Bell&apos;s character. It&apos;s a fun concept and with and imagination like mine the possibilities of such a power are unlimited.\n\nI did feel that you never really connected with the characters on an emotional level and the plot was very straight forward and basic. No twists and the ending was fairly dull.\n\nIt did bring up some interesting points, like real world superpowers. Yet as an Alan Moore fan this isn&apos;t anything particularly new."

      "reviewBody": "Long live the new flesh! The new flesh here being David Cronenberg&apos;s son Brandon, who seems to have inherited his father&apos;s body-horror fixation and has used it to direct his feature-length debut Antiviral, an unnerving yet very entertaining piece of science fiction.\n\nAntiviral offers a disturbing new meaning to our culture of celebrity obsession. Televisions everywhere show round-the-clock footage of their lives and newspapers are full of the tiniest stories and scandals. But that&apos;s just the beginning. Syd Marsh (Caleb Landry Jones) works for a company that specialises in injecting members of the public with diseases that have been taken from specific celebrities; you could be walking around with Madonna&apos;s chest cold if you wanted to. Part of Syd&apos;s job is to &apos;copyright&apos; these infections: to remove all possibilities of contagion so that once they&apos;re injected they cannot be passed on. His desire to make a bit of extra money on the side however, coupled with his own addictions, leads him to be injected with a disease so incurable, it becomes a matter of life and death.\n\nMore a criticism of celebrity culture than an accurate vision of the future, there are moments in this film that are frankly alarming, even when compared to our present day society of Big Brother, X-Factor and Heat magazine, a world in which attaining celebrity status is the only worthwhile ambition. In Antiviral, for instance, there are companies that have developed &apos;cell stakes&apos;, slabs of grey meat grown from the muscle cells of the rich and famous that people actually queue up to buy and subsequently eat for lunch, their excuse being that it makes them feel closer to those they admire. It&apos;s moments like these that make it a hard concept to imagine, yet it&apos;s a credit to Cronenberg&apos;s direction, his cold, very clinical approach to every scene, that makes it somehow believable. \n\nWhat makes Antiviral worth watching though, is Caleb Landry Jones, whose on-screen presence is beyond sinister. You might recognise him from X Men: First Class, The Last Exorcism and a couple of Breaking Bad episodes, but Antiviral is very much his breakthrough role; he won&apos;t be forgotten in a hurry. Very pale, very freckled and with a ponytail of ginger hair, he has this contemptuous expression on his face as if trying to keep from shouting at every client who comes into his office, yet each line of dialogue is considered and slow, sometimes menacing and other times devoid of any emotion at all, and he has such a mesmerising way of walking through doors that it becomes hard to take your eyes off him. Yet Jones&apos; talent really comes into effect as the virus starts to take control of his body, developing a contorted, demonic stagger as he attempts to go about his life as though nothing is wrong. \n\nNow it wouldn&apos;t be right to compare the films of father and son. There are certainly elements that share similarities: the hospital settings of Dead Ringers, the exploration of media and addiction in Videodrome, but Antiviral needs to be viewed as a completely separate piece of cinema, one that is refreshingly unique in its approach to a topic dealt with many times before, portraying a not-so-distant future with a strange, yet very absorbing bleakness. It&apos;s a well-directed film with an extraordinary performance at its centre that serves as a perfect showcase for the brilliance of both Brandon Cronenberg and Caleb Landry Jones; let&apos;s hope their collaborations continue.\n\nhttp://monsters-and-ink.blogspot.co.uk/",

Marins plays an evil wealthy man who bites off a girl&apos;s nipple, just for the hell of it! In court he&apos;s declared innocent and throws a big party showing off the bloody nipple in glass jar!! But in the end the poor girl&apos;s sister get back at him in a pretty nasty way.\n\nThere are some issues of the übermensch/Nietzchian ideas from the Coffin Joe-films, but still it&apos;s too &quot;normal&quot;.

I am not sure if I am upset at myself for paying so much for a camcorder shot looooooooooooooooooooow budget flick, or if the movie actually had an effect on me.........I am still pondering that one.\n\nFor those who love extreme gore, action, and excitement.....this movie will probably not suit your fancy. I would not even call this movie a horror movie. There was nothing scary about it, nothing shocking (except for the gun up the muff scene)...I have seen it all before. I would consider this movie a dark comedy, even though I am sure Scooter did not intend for it to be funny. I mean the really bad acting and dialogue just has to be laughed at, especially Stark Raven and the Preacher Man. Some of the dialougue is just hilarious, like &quot;don&apos;t be scared, I am scared.&quot; You just have to laugh.\n\n Stark Raven is about as talented and sexy as a slab of cardboard (she&apos;s as flat as one too). Her gratuitous sex scenes sort of nauseated me because she is not in the least bit attractive....for once a movie would have been better without the female lead getting naked. The only thing that &quot;shattered&quot; in this movie is the mirror everytime Stark Raven looked in it (God, those teeth..........).\n\nThe clever storyline and idea behind this movie are strongly overshadowed by the lousy acting, camera work, and dialogue, and get left behind and forgotten quickly.\n\nI mean, any movie with a guy dressed up like Howard Stern as Fartman with a gun cannot be taken seriously.\n\nWorth a rent but not a buy. Nuff said."

It&apos;s about inventing a way to make the object of your affection secretly fall in love with you. The agency has an impeccable track record by employing plots that work extremely well in a wide range of romantic dramas, from sudden rain when the girl doesn&apos;t have an umbrella to beautifully written speeches about love. , trying to maintain payroll to reinvest crumbling revenues into theaters they are desperate to rebuild. The Cyrano Agency takes that inspiration to heart and is proud that many reinterpretations of Rostand&apos;s Cyrano de Bergerac have been adapted into films. But importantly, this is not just a modern take on a classic love story, but one that is certainly more imaginative than a typical romantic comedy would allow. &apos;&apos;Cyrano Agency&apos;&apos; has the potential to be a new generation of post-modern romantic comedies, a work that deftly distills all the heart-wrenching moments that Korean love stories are known for. It never strays into the realm of parody, but consciously winks at the audience while drawing on the entire best canons of the genre.",

Instead of clashing, Lubitsch&apos;s stylish, mischievous approach and Wilde&apos;s perceptive cynicism complement each other. The characters and the story are Wilde&apos;s, the acting and the style are Lubitsch&apos;s.\n\nAlthough the material is heavily re-worked from the original play, Lubitsch&apos;s decisions all seem to work pretty well. Wilde&apos;s witty and resourceful dialogue is gone, but his insightful portrayals of human nature remain. Lubitsch also makes good use of the camera to bring off some shots that could not have worked on the stage. In particular, at times he makes the fateful fan seem almost a full-fledged part of the cast.\n\nThis movie version features solid performances by May McAvoy and Bert Lytell as the Windermeres, with a youngish-looking Ronald Colman suitably ingratiating as Lord Darlington. But Irene Rich has the most interesting character, and as Mrs. Erlynne she also gives a fine performance that particularly stands out in her scenes with the other characters. She and Lubitsch both capture the nature of her unpopular but admirable character, while carefully setting up the contrasts and conflicts between her and the other characters, who are in general more socially acceptable but far less worthy.\n\nThis also works well simply as an entertaining, often very amusing, and sometimes dramatically compelling story. For most silent film fans, it would definitely be worth tracking down and watching."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s just over an hour long and even so we have the trademark Kubrick opening, where he takes his own sweet time in letting us know what the film is about but somehow draws us in all the same.  Look: it&apos;s an hour long, and it&apos;s a slight, hour-long kind of story.  Don&apos;t expect anything more.  I think there&apos;s also rather clearly a moment when Kubrick realised that he didn&apos;t know how he was going to end it all - to be honest, I have a sneaking suspicion that a similar thing happened on &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; and even &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.  In each of these cases it was the prompt for a daring and unconventional conclusion.  I wish I could say that was the case here.\n\nThis doesn&apos;t prevent it from being involving while it lasts.  Kubrick once again demonstrates the he could point a camera at anything at all and make it interesting - the images are amazing, yet entirely functional.  If you have ever loved any black-and-white camera work you&apos;ll love this.  It&apos;s also a masterpiece of violence-without-violence, if you know what I mean.  It deserves to be more well-known than it is."

Lots of details and great backgrounds are making the kids watch it again and again... The Happy Cricket brings principles, messages and life examples for freedom, friends and environment protection in an easy way for the kids without compromising the fun. After a couple of years living in South America, we experimented more fun with the Spanish and Portuguese languages/sub-titles (made for hear impaired children - what a care!). We also found the movie web site interesting and the kids are having good fun with the games and downloads.",

      "reviewBody": "What did Rosina Lawrence&apos;s dying father expect when he entrusted Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy to deliver the deed to a gold mine to her in Way Out West? I mean even in death was his judgment that seriously impaired?\n\nThe boys are up to the necks in it in the town of Brushwood Gulch when they try to do their good deed. In fact Ollie&apos;s up to it even before as Stan innocently dumps the freeloading Ollie who is snoozing in a travois drawn by their donkey while Stan is guiding the poor animal. Dumps Ollie in a creek mind you. Serves him right actually.\n\nThe boys arrive in town and wouldn&apos;t you know it, they tell bartender James Finlayson what their mission is. So the quick thinking Finlayson gets his wife Sharon Lynne to pose as Lawrence and the boys sign the deed over to her. \n\nLater on they discover their mistake and the rest of the film is spent trying to make up for their mistake and get the deed to the rightful owner. Of course it&apos;s one mishap after another, including Stan lighting Ollie&apos;s thumb on fire. Don&apos;t ask how.\n\nEverybody looks like they&apos;re having a great old time in Way Out West. Finlayson is a terrific Snidely Whiplash, Lynne does a great imitation of the kind of brassy dame that Gladys George or Binnie Barnes had a specialty in, and Lawrence is a fabulous little Nell heroine. \n\nWay Out West is one of Stan and Ollie&apos;s best feature film comedies. It even got an Oscar nomination for Best Musical Scoring. But I still wonder, wasn&apos;t their anyone else Lawrence&apos;s father could get for such a mission?",

      "reviewBody": "The previous reviewer dwelled on the penis thing and the erotic aspect of this film, but I think he, along with many others, missed the point. It&apos;s partly the fault of the advertising campaign, which I understand emphasized Jo YeoJung&apos;s (as well as other actors&apos;) nude scenes -- but I don&apos;t know how anyone can still retain the impression that this movie is an erotic bodice-ripper after actually watching it. This is a dark, perilous journey through the obsessions and grudges of people who cannot stop running lest they fall behind, and the sweat is all of the cold kind.\n\nThe said scenes involving nudity and sexuality are not in the least erotic, nor did I find Kim DongWook&apos;s reaction to the coitus-by-the-book(literally) as the hapless young king at all comedic, intentionally or otherwise; rather he did a fine job of assaying a pathetic and desperate character trapped in an intolerable situation, and his mental near-collapse was almost palpable. And the supporting characters&apos; stories did not interfere with the unfolding of the main plot for me -- they were not subplots so much as back stories for the characters&apos; motivations, and served to flesh out, not complicate, the plot.\n\nAside from the mostly fine direction and the acting -- which latter ranged from decent (in a few cases) to very good (mostly) -- for me the art direction and cinematography were particular standouts. While most historical epics tend to emphasize sumptuous costumes and the splendor of the architecture and ornamentation, this movie did the opposite; while it is visually rich in its own, gloom-laden way, everything in it is in dark, muted colors as if it were dyed with tea, the ladies wear little jewelry and the sets are kept very lean, to sometimes very striking, almost expressionistic, effect, as when HwaYeon&apos;s maid is assigned new, better quarters of her own after catching the King&apos;s eye, but the room is entirely empty, and the woman is shown laughing in semi-hysterical self-congratulation on a tiny mat on an otherwise bare floor.\n\nThere are many, many scenes shot at very close range, often lit by simulated candlelight at night, creating an overall claustrophobic feel that visually replicates the suffocating atmosphere of the intrigue-riddled court these people endured. Fittingly, the scenes of violence are presented suddenly and starkly, with minimal cues in the soundtrack, which makes them all the more shocking yet realistic.\n\nWhile not exactly a masterpiece, this movie is a well-thought out and well-executed production, much superior to the kind of titillating fluff it is made out to be by some. It definitely deserves a thoughtful watch."

I thought the story had holes in it because it did not show enough detail of how he developed as a rapper. He just went from drug dealer to rapper. There needed to be some progress between the two lifestyles because it is usually a struggle to become a good rapper. It would have been a better story if it showed how 50 really went from drug dealer to rapper. He met Jam master Jay of Run DMC who taught him how to rap. Anyway it is a good story because of the fact that it shows how it is in the inner city is educational to people who are blind to this kind of struggle and it shows him being able to get out the hood to pursue his dream. This will inspire young people in that position to do the same, maybe not with rap, but with their God-given talents.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Alien&apos; is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, &quot;lived-in&quot; look of space-freighter Nostromo&apos;s interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) &quot;retro&quot; technology inside the ship doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it&apos;s the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). \n\nI feel it&apos;s especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and &apos;Alien&apos; simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It&apos;s a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn&apos;t just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it&apos;s a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10. \n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie again recently, and I have to say that upon reconsideration I think this film is a bit underrated. There are a few deeper sociological issues being explored here that I perceive but are quite subtle in their appearance in the film.\n\nIt is a study about the law to some degree, and it has some critical things to say about the ability for one who knows the law and its loopholes and thus exploits others with tools that were originally intended to preserve civil society. Keaton plays a psycho, but one who is highly educated and quite adept at his craft of fraud and deceit.\n\nFurther, Modine&apos;s character is irrational, befuddled, and ultimately marginalized. I wonder if the director took some liberties with him (as this is a true story, I don&apos;t know everything about the real person he portrays) to bring out a few of his close-minded tendencies that may have contributed to the awful situation in which he finds himself. Obviously, there is the closet racism which keeps him from renting to a black man (this is thrown in the viewer&apos;s face later and is quite obvious), but there is also the way he perceives a man&apos;s role as the solver of problems and his wife as nothing more than a spectator.\n\nThat she ends up being the one to calmly and coolly affect a search for and investigate Keaton&apos;s character, assaults the traditional notions of a man&apos;s role as a protector. Her temperament is ultimately more appropriate for the solution to the problem, and I think it is no accident that the director portrays it in this way."

But this doesn&apos;t have to be a bad thing. I found the plot to be interesting. Only the execution was poorly done. Why?\n\nFirst of all - the characters are boring and annoying. I understand that comedies kind of live from stereotypical over exaggerated persona. But this was too much. \n\nDo you knows this feeling when you&apos;re watching a bad horror movie and you think to yourself:&quot;No, don&apos;t go there. You&apos;ll be killed. No, dude - don&apos;t go there.Oh, he&apos;s dead...&quot;\n\n&quot;Lazer Team&quot; is similar to that. Very predictable, flat jokes, boring character development.

It deserves more because this is simply a great movie, with songs that will leave you laughing for days and some great pop-culture references. Oh yeah, and Japanese Indians. And Confederate solider Cyclopses.\n\n\tI actually read about the real Alfred Packer on the internet and believe it or not, the movie stays true to what happened. Scary, huh?\n\n\tHistorical background aside, the one-liners and musical numbers (`Let&apos;s Build a Snowman&apos; is unbelievably funny) are a good reason to get this movie. If you have a DVD player, get the DVD and listen to the cast/crew&apos;s drunk commentary. It&apos;s not very informative but it sure is fun. Grade: A.\n\nRated R for graphic comic violence/gore and strong language. Suggested for ages 14 and up.",

The plotted and scripted comedy framework for this film may not be anything special, but the Martin and Lewis set pieces remain great. With hindsight, you can see the grounds for the pair&apos;s breakup this early in their career. Martin is charming when he&apos;s allowed to sing or do a solo bit, but his character is an unsympathetic bully to Lewis&apos; hapless fumbler -- Bud Abbott at his most brutal to poor Costello. \n\nThe glimpses of bits of their stage and radio act, however, are funny -- their byplay before a band; their imitation of Bing Crosby (Martin, of course) and Barry Fitzgerald (Lewis)in &quot;Going My Way&quot;; Lewis in blonde drag (with a hairy chest showing over the v-neck of his dress) singing a husky-voiced torch song to Mike Kellin, and Martin&apos;s underplayed double-take and mumbled, &quot;No, couldn&apos;t be,&quot; as he passes by them. \n\nOne special highlight is Polly Bergen in an early brief part as Martin&apos;s girlfriend. (The movie&apos;s credits read &quot;introducing Polly Bergen,&quot; but IMDb lists two previous roles for her, one just a voice part.) This is Bergen before she had an absolutely perfect face with an absolutely perfect nose, but still, as Martin sings &quot;You and Your Beautiful Eyes&quot; to her, she is given a lengthy, star-making closeup in which she smiles and becomes luminous, and her future career is assured."

O is the number 1 killer, he does his job and gets away clean. Tok is a showman, taking risks but always making them pay. To be number 1 he knows he has to defeat O, and begins to stalk his prey. Along the way, both hitmen fall for Chin (Kelly Lin), a young Taiwanese woman, and attract the attention of Lee (Simon Yam), a cop determined to bring them both down.\n\nSo far, so familiar, but Johnny To delivers a film that ascends over its premise to become a classic of the genre. The action sets are expertly done, and everyone looks totally cool - especially Lau. Slo-mo and visual effects are used but not overused, and there was clearly a decent budget getting thrown around (the list of sponsors in the credits attests to that). There&apos;s more depth here than in an average film of its ilk, but there&apos;s also a delightful sense of glee in the action pieces that make you think that those involved thankfully weren&apos;t taking it completely seriously.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of heroic bloodshed&apos; action and for whatever reason haven&apos;t seen this yet, do yourself a favour.",

      "reviewBody": "A police jeep speeding through palayam flyover at dawn - the chilling wind is blowing to jeevan&apos;s face as he looks out. He observes the street light lit roads of vellayambalam- kowdiar road and musuem-vellayambalam road. There is a loud thinking, rather a narration - which forms the entire backbone of the story later.\n\nSeason - The timeless padmarajan saga of revenge kicks open with mohanlal&apos;s rustic bearded face through the roads of capital city. When i first watched this movie in local cable at my uncle&apos;s place at EKM sometime in the nineties, this opening sequence itself was captivating enough to keep me watching till the end. Looking back today from a period of city of god, traffic, saroja , amorres perros, ayutha ezhuthu and the likes, season is clearly a movie way ahead of its times - a cult classic by all means, it remains quite a surprise to me that this was box office dud in 1989. But then again many of padmarajan masterpieces were not commercial wonders of their respective times.\n\nUnlike his earlier associations with Johnson, padmarajan uses maestro ilayaraja for the songs and most importantly for the the vibrant BGM. &quot;Swapnangal than theeram&quot; by chithra and &quot;poyi varoo&quot; by yesudas are not exactly some of the memorable works of ilayaraja , but he makes up for that with the Background score - which itself evolves through the screenplay. What starts as a melancholic violin score when jeevan is marched through the poojappura central jail courtyard, gradually progresses to the dark guitar tweaks portraying kovalam and emerges in full swing with a thrilling jazz beats mix bearing a typical ilayaraja signature. The jail break scene with gaavan and the fight scene at the end remain memorable to this day with the amazing BGM&apos;s.\n\nThe film opens with jeevan&apos;s entry into the central prison and progresses with mohanlal&apos;s classic voiceover which constitutes a good part of the screenplay. The viewer is left to ponder about jeevan&apos;s past as he befriends the foreigner Fabiyen Remenez at the prison and plots to escape. It&apos;s at this point the film whizzes back to jeevans earlier sentence time and from there to the prime flashback at the beaches of kovalam. Maybe this is one of the reasons season remains a favourite - the natural trivandrum slang used throughout (not the horrible, most artificial verbal diarrhoea of made up trivandrum slang spoken by mammootty in rajamanikyam or the bafoonish mockery made popular by suraj venjarammoodu). Poojappura Radhakrishnan, Maniyanpilla Raju and Jagathi Sreekumar etch out some of the most memorable supporting roles as the beach locals - be it the lusty half blinded broker jagathi or the small time drug pusher kanthi (raju).\n\nApart from the screenplay and direction, the highlight of movie is obviously the super-cool jeevan who is an enigma to the other characters of the movie as much as he is to the viewers. Mohanlal gives one of his best performances after memorable outings with padmarajan in namukku parkkan munthirithoppukal and kariyilakkaattupole in the past years. A loner- Calm and composed, in a typical beach dress or the 80&apos;s denims and with a beard that he sports so rarely in his movies, lal never ever reminds you of any other of his characters that he has done before and is doubtful to repeat the act again as jeevan stands out very differently from all the sethumadhavans , neelakantans, sagar alias jackys or other characters that he&apos;s blown life into. The prisoner in poojappura flashes back as the hotel owner at kovalam and takes you through the rest of the story with interesting incidents. As is quite expected with an urban tale like this, padmarajans spins the entire events around greed, treachery, drugs and violence. Adding to the uniqueness of his work, padmarajan maintains a foreign character as the main villain of the movie, perhaps largely unheard of in that time. Jeevan does not have a heroine to himself throughout the movie, maintaining his loner, Clint Eastwood-like image quite convincingly. Opening promisingly and carrying on quite interestingly, the movie tends to lag a bit at those portions where jeevans friends are murdered and he&apos;s ultimately accused of the crime. But from there the film jumps into its most interesting part, the jail break and the subsequent showdown between jeevan and Fabien. The climax is largely unconventional, but at the same time heroic, with jeevan returning the murdered Fabien&apos;s body back to the prison after using the money he got from him to pay for the family of his murdered friends.\n\nA small group of supporting characters makes the film more interesting to the viewer- azeez as the jailor, prempraksh and valsala menon as the couple who came to buy smuggled goods, oduvil unnikrishnan as the thirumeni prisoner, and krishnaprasad as the young housekeeper lad all play their brief parts well as characters who don&apos;t play a major part to the thread but entertaines the viewer well.\n\nA highly recommended watch for all those who missed it, Season easily tops my all-time favourite list of movies.",

      "name": "Beautiful Rachel Ward in a fairly good slasher",
      "reviewBody": "It took me quite some time to find this pre-cert copy of TERROR EYES mainly due to the fact that it never got re-released after being thought a little too gruesome to be suitable viewing material and therefore it was banned in the United Kingdom way back in the early eighties. Surprisingly enough Kenneth Hughes directed it, which came as a real shock because his greatest cinematic conquest prior to this was the children&apos;s classic CHITTY, CHITTY, BANG, BANG! Here in his last movie before his demise in 2001, he attempts to join the ranks of Hitchcock and Carpenter and create a harrowing portrayal of a city in fear from a psychopathic headhunting assassin. But does he succeed in jumping from one end of the movie chain to the other without getting a little confused in-between?\n\nIt&apos;s all set in Boston, around Wendell College&apos;, a suspicious night school where it seems a sadistic and ruthless butcher is targeting a number of the students for headless (!) assassination. Lieutenant Judd Austin (Leonard Mann) is put on the case and finds a prime suspect in professor Millet (Drew Snyder), a flirtatious anthropology lecturer who seems to have quite an interest in the young attractive female co-ed&apos;s extra curricular activities! However the police are left with no clues and no witnesses to each bizarre murder and find themselves struggling to come to terms with the fact that they are dealing with an extremely intelligent serial killer. Before long decapitated bodies begin to turn up all over town and Judd realises he must do everything in his power to stop this deranged butcher from striking again\n\nI&apos;m having trouble finding out when this was actually released. The Roman numerals on the cover of my print state a production date of 1979, the IMDB say it was 1981 and the All Movie Guide&apos; reckon 1980? At a guess I&apos;d say &apos;81 but I may well be wrong. I&apos;ll do my best to try and find out more\n\nUnlike many of the genre films from this period, this manages not to imitate HALLOWEEN too much, but instead owes more to Italian Giallo movies and Hitchcock&apos;s PSYCHO. Hughes makes us well aware of his love for the later by including a remake of the notorious shower scene from that movie. Here Rachel Ward is washing, when all of a sudden in the background the door opens and through the curtain we see a silhouetted figure creeping up on her. It&apos;s effective in showing us that the director was well aware that he was making a slasher movie and he enjoyed using the obvious clichés that were apparent even that early in the cycle. You immediately notice that the guy behind the lense is a man with an experienced past, it&apos;s competently shot and surprisingly well budgeted. He also manages to pile on some suspense in a number of scenes, my favourite being the aftermath of the brutal murder of a female café waitress. The next day the owner turns up to find his restaurant in a mess. We already know by viewing the first two murders that the killer submerges the decapitated heads of his victims in the nearest pool of water, so we&apos;re already expecting him to find a shocking sight somewhere or other! As he begins clearing up the tables and chairs, two builders arrive and ask him to heat up some food for them. He places a large saucepan on the hob, which is filled with stew and warms them up a snack. They tuck in, and one of them finds a hair in his bowl! By now you&apos;re cringing thinking surely it wasn&apos;t in therewas it? The chef continues chatting and pours the remainders of the pan down the sink. You&apos;re on the edge of your seat expecting to see a blood-splashed head roll out at any minute! I wont tell you what happens, but the tension it creates is excellent.\n\nThe bogeyman has got to be one of the most violent slayers that I have ever seen. He repeatedly slashes his victims with a large machete before beheading them. In one bit, he cuts one unlucky girl to shreds, splashing pints of her blood all over the clear white walls as he goes! This must&apos;ve been the scene that helped get the film added to the video nasties list and I can see why, it&apos;s one of the most disturbing things I&apos;ve ever witnessed in a horror film. (The CHITTY, CHITTY, BANG, BANG similarities were wearing pretty thin by now!)  He looks pretty creepy too, in shiny black motorcycle leathers and tinted helmet to conceal his identity. There are some genuinely macabre moments on show, including him dragging his machete along a wire fence creating an eerie clanking sound and one unlucky teen finding a gory head in her toilet! It&apos;s also worth noting that Dario Argento lifted a number of parts from this for arguably his greatest ever feature TENEBRAE from 1982. This is most evident at the beginning, when the demented worker guy follows Rachel Ward&apos;s character home from the café. It&apos;s almost identical to an early scene in Argento&apos;s flick, right up to the dog jumping up and barking at a wire fence! That in it&apos;s self is a huge compliment for any director.\n\nSadly though, what really came close to being an unsurpassed classic is let down by poor cinematic balancing. Though the murder scenes are brutal, effective and brinking on the verge of ingenious sleaziness, the rest of the runtime feels sloppy and meritless with some comically inept scripting and dialogue.  There&apos;s no real plot twist at the end and the butcher&apos;s identity is far too easy to solve, offering no challenge for all the junior Agatha Christies among us! The general acting is also mediocre especially from Ward who doesn&apos;t manage to excel herself in her first silver screen role. She certainly had the looks, but all the charisma of a dead fish! I&apos;m afraid that these minor problems prevent TERROR EYES from shinning as much as it could have done and it&apos;s a real shame.\n\nThe net result is an above average thriller with some interesting ideas and some chillingly effective set pieces. Unfortunately it falls slightly short of true greatness and fails to live up to its at times all too sleazy surroundings. However, it still comes highly recommended to any slasher follower as a neat example of the genre&apos;s peak period and many a horror fan will find fulfilment in the brutality of the demented bogeyman. It&apos;s not bad, but just at times a bit of a disappointment"

      "reviewBody": "There are a few Olympics documentaries that are the gold standard for the genre (notably Olympiad and Tokyo Olympiad.) And there are some that are just adequate, being nothing more than just filmed recordings of the events. White Vertigo, the documentary about the 1956 Winter Olympics held in Cortina d&apos;Ampezzo Italy, falls solidly between those two camps. The color cinematography is flat out gorgeous and the movie takes some interesting looks behind the scenes. But the coverage itself is fairly rote with little suspense generated--with the exception of the downhill ski racing event near the end of the movie, which is expertly handled. In short, there is little reason to seek this movie out, but if it presented to you, there is no reason not to watch it either.",

      "reviewBody": "I had never heard of this movie and found it laying around in one of my friends large DVD collections. After reading the back I thought I would hate it. I don&apos;t know why I torture myself watching movies that I think are going to make me cry to the gods to stop people from making these horrible artsy films, but I do. It seemed like a low budget stylized sort of art film that managed to pull in some mid level stars and in aging one in Bruce Willis. Not my kind of film. I was wrong!(apparently ignoring my gut turns out to be a good idea, but usually it&apos;s still torture)\n\nThis was really a fun quirky, little movie that I actually enjoyed. The story is fairly sophomoric. A high school cheating scandal that the student newspaper, and the grizzled old war veteran Principal (Bruce Willis) are trying to get to the bottom of.\n\nThe acting in this one is admittedly over the top, but that is the strength of this movie. It is suppose to be over the top which provides the humor throughout. Mischa Barton plays the pretty girl, so that was no stretch, Bruce Willis&apos;s tough guy image works wonderfully for his character as well.\n\nI won&apos;t get into the whole plot/ storyline as anyone can read it above, but it was a pleasantly surprising, humorous story that I would definitely recommend. I am usually not even into this kind of movie but I really enjoyed it. It was much better than sitting through another stupid Harry Potter movie that&apos;s for sure.\n\nSo if you find yourself bored with nothing to watch, pop this fun little gem in the DVD player. Its a fun one that I think is definitely underrated and worth a view.\n\nLike my reviews? Hate em? Questions? Comments? Have a DVD that you want reviewed?

I could sort of tell it&apos;s the type of movie that I would be into, where the surrounding is generic but the direction makes it enthralling. The movie revolves around a typical Japanese family but there is elements that make it intriguing, one of them is how the family has a certain rule. That &quot;Never conceal the truth, no subject is taboo&quot; so the whole family share everything. Which makes it interesting since most Asian families are conservative in most aspects. Instead of a comedy direction though it goes in a sort of real live direction in Japanese society. The most effective aspect of this movie is the depth of it all and how the truth about the family unfolds bit by bit. Overall this movie did a pretty good job of what it tries to accomplish while showing how something that may seem normal maybe much more underneath it all.\n\n7.8/10",

The plot points come in rapid succession, it isn&apos;t exactly boring - but not original either. A non-thrilling &quot;thriller&quot;. It&apos;s OK to waste some time before going to bed, but nothing to set your clock for.\n\nIronside gives a good display of his most annoyed, sleepdeprived and angry faces. If you&apos;re into collecting these, this film is for you...\n\nI&apos;m not surprised mine is the first comment, because you have to write at least ten lines, and there is not really much more to say about this movie. The cop buddies have to take a leave in order to continue their investigations, one is grouchy and the other loquacious, and so on. Some parts are surprisingly good, Ironside and Graham know their job, but some of the other cast are, um, not at their best.",

Its done in a mondo style with recreations for most of the first hour before settling on the insanity on Central and South America.\n\nI&apos;m not what to think of this film. Certainly its graphic in its violence and tough to take as a catalog of violence. But this film aspires to be more than just being an exploitation film. It wants to be an anti American tract on the evils of the CIA. The problem is that the CIA&apos;s dirty laundry has been aired so many times in the last 30 years that the film&apos;s revelations are far from shocking. With the shock of the &quot;laundry&quot; gone we&apos;re left with just the plot of the freedom fighters in Central America, and the film falls rather flat. Its not bad, its just unremarkable and we&apos;re it not for the violence and torture there really wouldn&apos;t be any reason to see this. In an exploitive mood this film isn&apos;t bad, but I wish I could have seen this 30 years ago when its revelations and graphic violence would have rocked my world. Now its just sort of there.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for an exploitation film with a little meat give it a try. Otherwise this is a film that can probably give this a pass.",

Juhi was so funny throughout the entire movie, especially in the beginning like when she accidentally sticks a fork into Shahrukh&apos;s hand, it left me laughing like crazy! Juhi did an excellent job playing her role. It amazed me how she &quot;transformed&quot; from an over talkative Punjabi girl, to club dancer to an undercover cop! Even Shahrukh shined throughout the film!\n\nAs for the songs, I&apos;d have to say One 2 Ka 4 has a very interesting soundtrack. This film offers a wide variety of music ranging from a romantic number like &quot;Sona Nahi Na Sahi&quot; to a catchy dance number like &quot;Osaka Muraiya.&quot; One 2 Ka 4&apos;s soundtrack is beyond amazing!\n\nI really wonder why critics considered One 2 Ka 4 a &quot;flop&quot; and put it down so much? I think One 2 Ka 4 is a totally cool movie and far from being boring!\n\nOverall, One 2 Ka 4 deserves a 10/10!!!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;They are good for only one thing now - slugging!&quot;, Joe Bonaparte says with self-disgust, looking down at his broken hands after a middleweight prize fight at Madison Sqare Garden.\n\nJoe had the option to be a great classical violinist, but the girl he was in love with wet his appetite for the quick buck and the American dream. &quot;It&apos;s a big city, little people don&apos;t stand a chance&quot;, says Lorna, egging him up, playing up to his male ego. &quot;Money&apos;s the answer&quot;. And the poor Italian immigrant kid grabs the bait, hangs up the violin and sells out.\n\n&apos;Golden Boy&apos; is a piece of vintage Americana that is a bit hard to take today. Clifford Odets&apos; controversial play was openly socialist and crammed with sudden, badly integrated political insights about &quot;competetive civilization&quot; and &quot;a man hits his wife, and it&apos;s the first step towards fascism&quot;. It is all about the flip side of the American dream and gets a bit heavy-handed at times.\n\nLee J. Cobb is almost unbearably schmaltzy as the all-embracing, tearful Italian Papa, whereas Adolphe Menjou balances his performance carefully as the basically benign boxing promoter whose mistress is Lorna, Joe&apos;s chosen one, &quot;just a dame from Newark&quot; as she presents herself.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck is more or less going through the motions as the hard-as-nails Lorna, and the real star of the picture is 21 year old newcomer William Holden, impossibly handsome and hunky, starting out with perfectly tousled curly hair. His performance is as yet immature and unfinished, but he has his moments and makes up for a shaky ride with loads of charisma, and he more than holds his own in the climactic title fight at the Garden, playing against the Chocolate Drop, &quot;the pride of Harlem&quot; in this race-segregated boxing haven.\n\n&apos;Golden Boy&apos; is not, though, one of director Mamoulian&apos;s happier efforts. It is far too maudlin to look like anything Mamoulian ever did, it is not like him to lay it on this thick. It has none of the quirks or edge from &apos;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&apos; among others, but it is lushly, richly orchestrated in the vein of 19th century European music.",

Like so many Indian films, it could go on and on ...\n\nDo Kaliyaan was the first Indian film I had ever seen, back in 1968. No, I&apos;ve not seen it again since then, but it left such a huge impression. I was freshly relocated to Kenya, which had a substantial Indian community and therefore a good supply of Indian films. My friends wanted to try something &quot;new&quot;, so we went to the cinema.\n\nWow! What an assault on the senses, in all ways. For one thing, the colours -- apparently all primary. The running time -- endless. The music, the songs, the dancing, at seemingly random intervals. The plot line -- all possible emotions one after another. Kids. More music. Being real about it, from my distant memory of this film, I thought it would *never* end.\n\nBut I came to knew and appreciate a certain formula for Indian cinema, and up to this day, somehow I compare every film from there in my head with Do Kaliyaan, and if it were possible, yes, I would definitely watch it again.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I have seen it in Moscow and Braunschweig on Film Festivals and I only can recommend it for Independent Movie Fans. A great Sophie Rois (I know her from Salzburg and Berlin) in connection with some unknown Cast members. A really well done black Comedy. I hope I can see a few more Comedies of this Type from Austria. Austrian Film is a must for Filmmaniacs, this pure style of Film and Music is a great Alternative to the American Big Budget movies. Also the style of the costumes and the set dressing is it worth to be seen. I don&apos;t know more films by Clemence Schoenborn, was this his first full length feature, if so it is a great thing and we can hope that he will make more films like that."

Kyra, to me, was an over-feminest, big cleaveged woman, wearing pants. Now, I&apos;m not a historian nor do I actually know enough, but I thought women didn&apos;t wear pants in the 6th century. If I am wrong, I stand corrected, but that doesn&apos;t sound right to me.  Beowulf&apos;s leather outfit reminded me of a Keanu Reeves wannabe. Grendel&apos;s mother is a Pamela Anderson look~a~like who would make a better porn star than a real actor.\n\nAlright, so it may sound like I hate this movie, but I did like it. I never read Beowulf, but plan on doing it, eventually, so my opinion on this movie is based on seeing it alone. \n\nOverall: 6 1/2 out of 10."

The cliches of black and white are wonderfully maintained in this movie as the good guys are clever and witty and the bad ones are bad and pretty dumb. I considered the &quot;Shakespearian&quot; dream of the &quot;good&quot; Mafioso a bit stupid but then a film like that seems in need of a few blunders. The costumes are great. All in all enjoyable."

In the case of &apos;I&apos;ve Loved You So Long&apos;, I felt no such distance. Indeed, this is the first time I&apos;ve cried in a movie since... I don&apos;t know when. Sure, I am a callous bastard, but I often find myself moved by a film, only, rarely do I find myself as moved as I was by this one.\n\n&apos;I&apos;ve Loved You So Long&apos; focuses on the story of Juliette Fontaine coming from prison to live with her sister, who was a young adolescent when she was incarcerated. The tensions of living with an extended family are exacerbated by Juliette&apos;s personality, which it is accepted is altered by her time in gaol. Philippe Claudel&apos;s story is beautifully structured to release just as much information as is necessary to keep you interested, while retaining just enough mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nI have never seen a French film that I haven&apos;t liked, but I have also never seen a French film of this calibre. It is an outstanding piece of storytelling, full of pathos and charm.",

      "name": "A worthy new version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; with marvelous visuals and excellent performances",
      "reviewBody": "Charlotte Brontë&apos;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. The tale of a feisty orphan-girl-turned-governess who finds true love in a spooky mansion and ultimately redeems a tormented hero has made it to the top of every &quot;Best Love Stories&quot; list since it was first published in 1847, and with good reason. It&apos;s the perfect Gothic novel, melding mystery, horror, and the classic medieval castle setting with heart-stopping romance. \n\nThere have been at least 18 film versions of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and 9 made-for-television movies--27 in all! I have seen most of them, some multiple times–-both out of my deep love for the tale, and as part of the research for my novel &quot;The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë,&quot; the true story of Charlotte&apos;s remarkable life, her inspiration behind &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and her turbulent, real-life romance.\n\nEvery screen version of JANE EYRE has its merits. I especially loved Timothy Dalton&apos;s portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the 1983 mini-series, and the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre mini-series starring Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. I was very curious to see how the new JANE EYRE adaptation from Focus Films would measure up. I am happy to report that the film, which I saw last night at an advance screening, is very good indeed, with marvelous visuals, terrific performances, and enough unique elements to make it a worthy new addition.\n\nThe most notable distinction that sets this film apart from the rest is its structure. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback–-which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a two-hour time span.\n\nThe movie opens as Jane is fleeing Thornfield after having discovered Mr. Rochester&apos;s dark and heartbreaking secret. We fear for her as she becomes lost on the stormy moor. The mystery continues as St. John Rivers (well-played by a sympathetic yet appropriately stern Jamie Bell) and his sisters take her in. As Jane ruminates about the past events that led to her escape, we are treated to the story in flashback.\n\nThe casting of Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre also sets this production apart, since she is closer in age than most actresses who&apos;ve played the role to the character in the novel, who was about 18 years old in the Thornfield section. Although I wish Mia&apos;s Jane was a bit more &quot;swoony&quot; over Mr. Rochester earlier on (yes, she is supposed to be stoic, but I missed that phase where we get to see her blossom as she falls in love with him, and then is utterly crushed when she believes him to be in love with Miss Ingram), Mia truly inhabits the role, beautifully portraying Jane&apos;s sense of self-respect, integrity, and restraint, as well as her passion and vulnerability.\n\nMichael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding, while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul. Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Reed effectively portrays the icy ogre who menaces the young Jane (a spirited and appealing Amelia Clarkson.) And Judi Dench, as always, gives a superb performance as housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nThe film&apos;s locations do justice to the novel&apos;s often gloomy, atmospheric tone. Director Cary Fukunaga makes excellent use of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, one of the oldest houses in England, as Thornfield Hall, emphasizing its dark, Gothic, masculine feel. The exterior locations--gardens, cliffs, craggy rocks, stone walls, and seemingly endless fields--make an arresting, dramatic backdrop for the story. You truly feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere.\n\nMy only minor gripes are that when Mr. Rochester&apos;s secret is revealed, it feels a little too prettified, and the ending was too abrupt for me. But that aside, the filmmakers have done a masterful job translating the novel to the screen. I highly recommend it! --Syrie James",

      "reviewBody": "Jeff Mills (Tim Daly) is a likable, good looking nice guy lawyer in L.A. who&apos;s tired of the dating scene. He chances to meet a gal named Miranda Reed (gorgeous Kelly Preston) in a parking lot one night, and brings her home to his pad, soon striking up a relationship with her. Unfortunately, his impulsiveness turns out to be a bad mistake, as Miranda&apos;s past then catches up with them. It turns out that she was part of a witches&apos; coven, and that they &quot;want her back&quot; because they need a human sacrifice for the winter solstice, which is coming up. Blinded by his love for her, he goes out of his way to try to keep her safe, and to deal with her scummy associates, including Aldys (big haired Anthony Crivello) and the deceptively cheery Mrs. White (Audra &quot;Mrs. Roper&quot; Lindley).\n\nThe solid supporting cast of nicely chosen actors also features Diana Bellamy as Jeffs&apos; loyal (and intuitive) secretary Grace, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as somber faced police detective Lt. Lee (an expert in occult related crimes), Julian Christopher, Kyle T. Heffner, and the amiable Rick Rossovich as Jeffs&apos; circle of friends, and the very amusing M.C. Gainey as lively survivalist Brock. Overall, the movie is nothing special in terms of presentation, with competent but undistinguished direction by Janet Greek, but it does have its moments (the best occurs when a bunch of mysterious people gather at a window), and isn&apos;t totally without atmosphere. The story, written by Tracy Torme (son of Mel), who went on to script one more feature (&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;) and work for television series ranging from &apos;Star Trek: The Next Generation&apos; to &apos;Sliders&apos; to &apos;Carnivale&apos;, is pretty absorbing, and does have some effective twists near the end.\n\nIt&apos;s a good movie in general, and is worth a look for 80s horror fans who want to check out everything that the decade has to offer.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

I thought it was funny. I would love to have a copy of it to keep because I haven&apos;t seen it in a few years. I think its important to remember that it was filmed years and years ago in another country. The actors obviously spoke in a European language so the American version has other voices speaking English. Its a cute movie and I think we can all relate to that time in our lives when we were exploring sex and love. I think some people would have liked more nudity. As I recall there are a lot of above the waist views, but not much else. Enjoy!"

Tension builds up slowly, gradually reaching the climax. Actors are doing a great job and director is a true master of the genre attempting to produce a small masterpiece in a minimalistic premise, only a few actors and almost no special effects. Watch this movie at night, alone, with lights off and I promise you that you are going to be scared.",

This film has Hal Hartley&apos;s trademark sparse, artsy atmosphere, with the slightly surreal characters, the staged dialogue and set pieces. All the characters are quirky and memorable, I loved Isabelle Huppert&apos;s character - the nymphomanical nun - in particular and the story dissects amnesia in a really interesting way. \n\nAbove all the central love story will draw you in more than you realise; the ending was both crushing and fitting. This is due to the acting, as every movement and expression helps to build characters and relationships. Isabelle Huppert and Martin Donovan both do this perfectly, and the impact of the ending owes a lot to them. The odd &apos;staging&apos; of the film may put off those expecting a more conventional thriller but open minded viewers will be rewarded.",

      "reviewBody": "Ingmar Bergman&apos;s seventh film, To Joy, is actually a fairly bitter film, more often than not, in looking at the destructiveness of a marriage between two people who somehow got stuck with each other to fall in love. And yet there are some moments that are quite joyful, or at least in the terms that Bergman will allow from time to time, and they help ring this as less a total work of despair than an examination of &apos;average&apos; people who can&apos;t stand not having more. Stig (Stig Olin) and Marta (Maj-Britt Nilsson) meet as they&apos;re both musicians in an orchestra conducted by Sönderby (Victor Sjostrom). \n\nShe&apos;s the only woman in the orchestra, but it&apos;s not exactly that they have love at first sight in the slightest. Their connection grows following a party where Stig gets drunk and makes a depressing grandstanding fool of himself in front of friends, and somehow his downbeat manner is charming to Marta. Soon they grow closer, even fall in love perhaps, though their future marriage is complicated by Marta becoming pregnant. This scene, when she reveals it three months on to Stig, is the first real crack in the relationship. It only cracks more, with the occasional patch-up, and the question stands more or less- as Stig is looking back on the relationship following his wife and one of his child&apos;s deaths- is what could have come from all of this? \n\nBergman deals with his characters, at this stage in his career, in trying to just find the simple and really not very simple truths of what Stig and Marta are together and separate. For the first half it almost looks like Stig is a bit too two-dimensional, particularly for a Bergman film (and Olin doesn&apos;t play him extremely well, even if he does deliver the beats fairly well, perhaps in line with his own character&apos;s inadequacies). He can&apos;t seem to enjoy anything that he does because he always wants more, to be a supreme soloist, than to have what he already has gotten. Marta, on the other hand, after having several potential men before going with Stig, tries her best to cope with having two kids that she probably wasn&apos;t totally thrilled to have in the first place. \n\nThere&apos;s a great little scene where Sanderby recounts walking in on Stig and Marta after having some kind of odd tender moment (as well as later on after having a quarrel), without them noticing Sanderby walk in, and the expression still underneath their faces when he formally walks in. In typical Bergman fashion we see the disintegration of a relationship (quite a brutal argument in bed really, more of emotional violence than physical), even if the sort of &apos;patching-up&apos; period towards the end is a little weaker than what&apos;s come before.\n\nSo on the one hand there is this aspect, the drama of two people having a constant push-and-pull tie that binds them through Stig&apos;s delusions of grandeur and self-pity and fear manifesting in other forms (notably into the arms of another woman) and Marta&apos;s own semi-helplessness, which is very good, if imperfect, as classic Bergman storytelling. On the other hand it&apos;s also one of the best examples of classical music being used as incidental music: there&apos;s not exact musical score like if we hear music accompanying the characters giving the emotional cues during an argument scene or when Sanderby offers advice or gets irritated at Stig, but rather the music of Sanderby&apos;s orchestra (and Sjostrom, I might add, is pitch-perfect in the role of the weathered and brilliant second-banana conductor) fills in the spaces at times of the emotional context. \n\nProbably the most successful, and joyful, scene is when Stig finds out Marta has the baby, by running out quick during a rehearsal, the music going along as he&apos;s on the phone, then continuing as he sits back down, and as Sanderby asks quietly of one musician who asks another to another to Stig what happened, as the music plays on. This, plus the second greatest cinematic interpretation of Beethoven&apos;s 9th symphony 4th movement in a climax (the first being Clockwork Orange), make To Joy worth seeing all by itself, if only for Beethoven fans.\n\nAs one of the several films included on the recently released Eclipse DVD series, To Joy will appeal to fans of Bergman&apos;s knack at telling of characters in shattered, honest romance, and to those looking for some classical music bliss and have seen The Magic Flute or Autumn Sonata too many times.",

After &quot;The Silencers,&quot; there was no where to go but with more fun in the sun with Matt Helm - poking fun, that is, at the James Bond spy genre. Dino Martin is as lackadaisical as ever as Helm, the part-time super agent, barely awake in some scenes and ready with the cute quips in, well, every line of dialog. To illustrate the difference between Helm &amp; Bond: Bond, as an example, is allowed one minor joke during his usual mission briefing with M. Now, Helm jokes with his boss, MacDonald (James Gregory, reprising his role) during the entire session, even as MacDonald tells him that Helm may have to commit suicide during the mission. &apos;I ain&apos;t going&apos; Helm quips. The villains are again the evil organization Big-O(oh), who target all the major secret agents as the film starts, including Helm. But, this is one of those false deaths for the hero, just as was done in a couple of the Bonders (and they don&apos;t explain how Helm survives). The action takes Helm to Monte Carlo, where a primarily young crowd do a lot of dancing and swinging. Helm searches for a scientist who is providing Big-O (led by Karl Malden) with the final formulas for a super heat ray.\n\nThe action slows down at the mid-point, especially with the seemingly endless scenes of young folks shaking their bodies to sixties tunes. The filmmakers manage to work Sinatra in again in a sort-of cameo. The absurdity and sight gags are at the usual level: all of Helm&apos;s girlfriends attend his funeral dressed exactly the same. The main henchman walks around in public with this big metal plate covering the top of his head and no one notices. Helm drinks while driving and on the job, joking with the liquor bottles. Ann-Margret plays the daughter of the missing scientist and she&apos;s always great, no matter what she&apos;s doing, but she even gets quite involved in some strenuous action towards the end. Sparv is fine as the femme fatale, with her slightly exotic good looks, though she inexplicably seems to change sides near the end (Helm never even had a chance to seduce her). Malden as the head villain does not do as well, speaking with a dopey accent which fades in and out. He is the subject of an effective on-going gag with a gun that delays firing for a few seconds. The climactic action in the villains&apos; lair is not bad, with some actual suspense and humor mixed in, though the very conclusion on the hovercrafts, on the water, seems like an afterthought. The epilogue is just too silly. Helm would return in &quot;The Ambushers.&quot; Hero:6 Villain:5 Femme Fatales:7 Henchmen:6 Fights:6 Stunts/Chases:6 Gadgets:5 Auto:4 Locations:7 Pace:6 overall:6-",

      "reviewBody": "AI is inspired by British science fiction writer, Brian Aldiss short story &apos;Supertoys Last All Summer Long.&apos; It was a project initiated by Stanley Kubrick and then taken over by Steven Spielberg who directs as well as write the screenplay. It is a mixture of Spielberg&apos;s wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick&apos;s cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.\n\nThe film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like.\n\nMonica and Henry Swinton (Frances O&apos;Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love.\n\nWhen their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated.\n\nMonica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him.\n\nDavid is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights.\n\nSpielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby.\n\nThe final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings.\n\nI have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function.\n\nI understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.",

They added a lot of Black stereotypes as well, as the Hammer joined with the Kwanzaa League to defeat the evil Santa that was trying to wipe out Hanukkah.\n\nAdam Goldberg was good as the Hammer, and Mario Van Peebles as his Black partner.

Even the women in the cages and the sailors who buy them just pretend .Nothing is real.\n\nTierney&apos;s downfall is depicted in lavish detail:from the elegant woman of the beginning to the wreck Gin Sling invites to her Chinese New Year feast .Directing is absolutely breathtaking,when the camera circles around the dive where a cast of thousands -Sternberg even pays a tribute to the extras in the cast and credits,which is rare ,to my knowledge ,the first and last time it had been made-surrounds the heroine ,or in the final scenes ,when the shots merge with the firecrackers of the New Year.\n\n&quot;The Shanghai gesture&quot; may be a guilty pleasure.But this kind of pleasure ,I ask for more!",

Well for the characters in the movie. I&apos;d reckon that almost everyone watching this knows what is what and who is who.\n\nBut it is not so much about the mystery of the masked man (literally!), it is about the fun one can have watching the movie. There are many other influences you can detect here too ... all from vigilantes, fighting off evil to protect the poor and the ones who can&apos;t defend themselves. The story is quite simple and not worthy rehashing ... but the fun factor is so high, you probably shouldn&apos;t mind ... I was just surprised I have never seen this before. All the gun and brawl sound effects of the era ... if you don&apos;t mind them - or rather cherish them like I do.",

      "reviewBody": "In order to escape from the abusive boy-friend Gary Winston (Damian Lewis), Jean Gilkyson (Jennifer Lopez) moves with her young daughter Griff Gilkyson (Becca Gardner) without previous notice to the ranch of her father-in-law Einar Gilkyson (Robert Redford) in Wyoming. Jean and Einar are disaffected, since he blames her for the death of his beloved son in a car accident. Einar is taking care of his friend Mitch Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who was attacked and seriously wounded by a bear, and he does not know that he has a grand-daughter. While Mitch heals his wounds and forgives the bear, Einar also changes his feelings regarding Jean, finally understanding that accidents happen and accepting her and loving his grand-daughter.\n\n&quot;An Unfinished Life&quot; is a beautiful tale of forgiveness, with the lead characters healing their wounds  Mitch, the ones provoked by a savage bear, and Einar his innermost feelings of loss. The cast has amazing performances, showing the importance of a director of the weight of Lasse Halltröm: Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman are unanimity, but I myself like a lot the versatile Jennifer Lopez and strongly believe that even the viewer that dislike her as actress must admit her excellent performance in this touching film. Josh Lucas is a great support actor and the favorable surprise is the performance of the young and unknown Becca Gardner. Although being a predictable story without any twist, this sensitive movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Um Lugar para Recomeçar&quot; (&quot;A Place to Restart&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this last night on TCM, which, BTW, is a rare treasure in this medium called the &quot;idiot box&quot;. Isn&apos;t it remarkable that this movie is 53 years old, and it still sparkles? What an accomplishment! It had the ingredients of a truly great film - complex characters that are developed fully and efficiently, great story-telling with attention to details, and good acting - a little stylized, but keep in mind that that impression might be due partially to Westerners unfamiliarity with Japanese culture, and partially to how the definition of &quot;good acting&quot; has evolved.\n\nI love the film&apos;s nobility and moral rectitude. Those were the days when (and we were in a culture where) &quot;doing the right thing&quot; was the expected norm. It was seen in Moritoh&apos;s loyalty at the price of - at least it seems at the time - expediency, which was preceded by Kesa&apos;s unflinching sense of duty and willingness to lay down her own life. This is the beauty of Kesa&apos;s &quot;soul&quot; that Moritoh found out all-too-late he failed to see, which manifested itself as bookends in the plot, but is in fact the moral center of the movie. Such ideals are no longer frequently or fully embraced these days. Look at how we glorify criminals in shows like The Sopranos and Thief. I also liked how the plot falls together: Kesa&apos;s readiness to sacrifice herself at the outset of the story made her self-immolation at the end of the film ring true. The little details: remember the talk of chestnuts when Moritoh first saw Kesa with her aunt? We saw later on those very chestnuts hanging on the swaying trees during Moritoh&apos;s unfortunate night time visit. When Wataru and Kesa took what turned out to be their last walk in the garden under a full moon, it was all peace and serenity. The very same setting is transformed sinister and ominous just moments later, with the moon now hidden by clouds, as Moritoh slowly emerges out of the darkness in the background - a truly masterful and memorable scene in the history of cinema.\n\nThe theme of &quot;folly&quot; pervades the movie: we see a lot of it just from one character, Lord Kiyamori - and he&apos;s a top dog and a leader! His son had to advise him to act quickly to quash the uprising when we first see him. He then failed to reward Kesa, who is every bit as deserving as Moritoh of recognition. Even if you chalk that failure up to be culturally driven, we have his Jephthah-like stupidity and arrogance in giving Moritoh pretty much carte-blanche in his wish for a reward. What&apos;s more, we have his incessant and insensitive teasing - instrumental in precipitating the tragedy, in that it made the proud Moritoh all the more determined to have Kesa. Was Wataru cowardly, foolish, or both, when he &quot;threw&quot; the race? Lest you missed it, there&apos;s the cruel irony of Moritoh&apos;s comment after his brother&apos;s treachery resulted in his execution, &quot;My brother was a foolish man&quot;. Well you proved to be no Solomon, Moritoh.\n\nI thought it was a little frustrating to watch Kesa&apos;s helplessness when Moritoh blackmailed her. Surely there&apos;s another way out, woman! But I suppose that&apos;s part of the tragic theme: all the characters had strengths as well as tragic flaws. At the risk of second-guessing the director of a great movie, I felt that he could have kept the identity of the person in bed a secret until the moment of truth, but I&apos;m sure I need to remind myself that this is not meant to be a thriller. I&apos;d like to watch this movie again, maybe along with a movie it reminds me of: Kurosawa&apos;s Ran.",

Co-written by Fellini himself like probably all of his other movies, this one enjoys a pretty good, witty script, that was even Oscar nominated. The film went on to win an Academy Award in a Best Costume Design category in 1976.   I found it a real pleasure watching from beginning to the end, although it is not on the same level of perfection as &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; or 8 1/2, Il Casanova still has a strong touch of Fellini&apos;s genius.\n\n Highly recommendable. 9/10"

      "reviewBody": "Simply breathtaking. For a band as atmospheric and deep as Sigur Rós, one could not think of any natural visions worthy to accompany the music. It ends up, though, that you don&apos;t have to look too far after all. Just take some time to see the beauty and infinite space right in their own home of Iceland. This documentary, Heima, shows the world one of the last untouched visages in existence. The island country is exotic and devoid of pollution of nature and man. Sigur Rós decided to come back home to do a sixteen-city tour, for free, in order to give back to the community that gave them life. Without the hectic bustle of traveling the entire earth from venue to venue, the band is able to bask in the glory that is home, calm themselves down for a short respite, play the music to their own people, and get nothing out of it except the joy from bringing together an entire country through the sounds they have created. It is a touching story of art and life that simply needs to be seen to be understood.\n\nSigur Rós&apos; music has always been such a visceral and aural experience for me. It is the kind of work that cleanses my mind from all thought to fully envelope my body and soul as one. If you are ever feeling stressed or unable to cope with something in your life, just put on any of their albums, all are masterpieces. The layers meld together for a wall of sound that takes you over, washing away all your fears, filling you with hope and joy for a future coming towards you; a future that can be battled with the knowledge that you can overcome anything.\n\nI am just overjoyed to finally see a little insight into the artists behind the music. The members of this quartetalong with the foursome of women as their string sectionare all soft-spoken, down to earth people. They tell of their inhibitions and inability to do many interviews or press junkets to support them. Not because they are standoffish or uncaring for those who enjoy their sound, the band just wants to lead normal lives out of the spotlight that would overtake them if they bought into the machine. With abrupt cuts to the group having fun with each other, we see the good-natured humor they all have. As one member says, he was 21 when they first started and became a sensation. These men didn&apos;t quite know what was in store, and rather than become destructive to themselves and the music, they decided to go in the other direction. More a family than a business, Sigur Rós takes great pride in their work and say that they may even take too much time honing everything to the point of perfection. I myself don&apos;t care, because the time spent seems to have worked each and every time.\n\nThe visuals that director Dean DeBlois has added to enhance the music are magical. For one, the cities chosen for each concert are amazing and diverse. From concert halls, to giant festival stages, to an abandoned fishing complex, to setting up between a couple country houses, to even in front of a newly created dam in the highlands for a protest show, Heima shows Iceland with an eye of wonderment and unfiltered beauty. To see how the band uses layers of projections and cloth curtains, hearkening to the elaborate cd artwork they hold each album in, helps to explain the detail and perfection really at work. Seeing them play an acoustic show outside a dam they feel ruins the natural landscape of the city, in order to create the electricity they refuse to use, is fantastic. Also, the cut scenes to static shots of the world surrounding them show the country in all its glory. The kites in the air, the juxtaposition of the rundown fishing wharf with black and white footage of the time it once bustled, the mountains shrouded in fog, the ice melting, and the water flowing (forwards and backwards) leave you without words as it all encompasses you into the world of their sound.\n\nAll the band members share anecdotes and insight into their motivations and creative process, as well as why they still come home and stay in Iceland despite the notoriety and money they have earned since their first album. Through it all, though, it is the music that shines. True artists, their renditions of songs like Starálfur and Hoppípolla can bring a tear to your eye for their sheer emotion. I loved how they sprinkled in motifs of the band throughout, from the Takk man to the Ágætis byrjun alien, to the birds flying, silhouetted from the sky. Heima gets to the core of what Sigur Rós and their music is while also showcasing a country that many people may never think twice about. I for one now see that I must visit Iceland at least once before I die to experience its beauty for myself.",

      "reviewBody": "German director/writer,Veit Helmer&apos;s films are an acquired taste (much like Canada&apos;s Guy Maddin). His style of directing seems to lean toward the mainly visual (there is little to no dialog in his films),and in metaphorical terms,has a tendency to (at times)resemble some of the films of Czech film makers,Jiri Menzil,etc. In this gentle fable,&apos;Absurdistan&apos;,the story takes place in the fictional village of Absurdistan,somewhere in a part of Russia that seems to have been forgotten by time (it&apos;s not supposed to be listed on any map),but still exists,none the less. Aya &amp; Temelko are two young people who have been in love with one another since childhood. Aya&apos;s fortune telling grandmother predicts that the two should get together when two star signs merge. Sound simple enough? There is a problem in the village with the water supply (and the lazy,good for nothing men,who are content with just hanging out in the local teahouse all day while their women do all the work,including the work projects that the men start,but never seem to finish). When things get downright dire,what with the nearly total lack of water,the women stage a sex strike ultimatum on the men. It&apos;s up to Temelko to try &amp; fix the water problem, so he can be with his beloved Aya forever. Veit Helmer directs &amp; co-writes the screenplay (with the assistance of Zaza Buadze,Gordan Mihic &amp; Ahmet Golbol). The cinematography by George Beridze makes nice use of what appears to be a arid,near desert environment. The cast is made up of mainly Russian actors who do their job well. If you enjoyed Helmer&apos;s film, &apos;Tuvalu&apos; from a few years back, this will be another feather in your conical cap. Spoken (what little on screen dialog,outside of the narrative structure)in Russian with English subtitles. No MPAA rating,but contains flashes of nudity &amp; sexual content.",

      "reviewBody": "In the first of several explosions in this(except for one that is real, they are all poorly CGI&apos;ed, so don&apos;t get your hopes up), an alien craft crashes onto Earth. I think, we barely see it. Anyway, this really worries the senior citizens working at Luke Airforce base, so they send out some bubble-gum-chewing soldiers, only for them to die at the hand of confusing quick cuts, some of which may contain a trace of the creatures. Well, this flick mainly concerns itself with the prisoners escaping their transport bus who bring along the guards as hostages(complete with an attractive female working at the pen, just to complete the rip-off of Con Air... and *yes*, there is even someone who needs medical attention among them) who find themselves in a seemingly abandoned town that is obviously where the extra-terrestrials are hiding. One of the criminals thinks he&apos;s Michael Madsen(don&apos;t feel bad, at first glance, I kinda thought you were, too, dude), and he&apos;s kind of in charge. There&apos;s some tension and a few physical fights, and if the characters weren&apos;t so boring, stereotypical and clichéd, we&apos;d probably care. We do eventually see the outer space beings for more than a single frame, and the designs are decent(if one is unmistakably a man in a suit), if there&apos;s little violence or gore. Even the sex scene is merely hinted at! Come on, this isn&apos;t an artistic piece, it&apos;s a B movie, don&apos;t you know your audience? This nearly always shuns away from what we want to see! There are two hot chicks in this, though. The acting is pretty bad. This is only 83 minutes sans credits, and it simply doesn&apos;t deliver what we expect of it. It isn&apos;t entertaining(not even in the &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; way), and it tries to be smarter than it is, and fails(and if it didn&apos;t, it would still be aiming wrong). Also, at times, it&apos;s like they just learned how to use the equipment; at one point they clearly move too close to the lighting setup, and with some footage, it&apos;s very easy to tell that it was sped-up. I recommend this only to those who won&apos;t listen to the warning. Oh, and conspiracy theorists might get a kick out of the very opening and the &quot;bonus scene&quot; at the end. 1/10",

      "reviewBody": "Absolute Warhola is a wry but affectionate look at the village in Slovakia where Andy Warhol&apos;s parents were born and which proudly claims the artist as its native son. This is not a purist&apos;s documentary. The seasons shift inexplicably. The pace feels a bit aimless. It contains no useful information about Warhol nor his work. Instead of cinematic orthodoxy, however, Absolut Warhola offers the quirky poignancy of a documentary on the Cargo Cult, combined with a bizarre juxtaposition that perhaps would be found in a Lawrence Welk special on Abstract Expressionism. The filmmakers visit Warhol&apos;s cousin who recalls, at one point, how Andy sent them a pack of drawings and paintings which they didn&apos;t much care for, so they rolled some up to use as paper cones and pitched the others into the water after the house was flooded. The curator of the Warhola Museum explains how he chose the works to be included in the collection primarily on the basis of their relevance to the local community: cows, butterflies, Lenin, and Ingrid Bergman as a nun. The touching absurdity of his discourse is rivaled only by David St. Hubbins&apos; explanation in Spinal Tap as to why the amplifier whose dial goes up to eleven is better than the ones that only go to ten. Absolut Warhola may not be a textbook work of documentary filmmaking, but it presents a consistent vision of people whose lives under the shadow of Chernobyl are somehow brightened by the memory of a man they never knew nor remotely understood.",

Working on an extremely small budget, Milligan unwisely attempts to recreate the look and feel of Victorian England and, rather unsurprisingly, fails on almost every level, with particularly unconvincing production design, the film boasting patently fake shop facades and completely unauthentic costumery (did Milligan actually research the era or did he just go with what he imagined it was like?).\n\nThe film stars Annabella Wood as Johanna Jeffrey, assistant in the bakery run by Maggie Lovett (Jane Hilary), who gets the delicious filling for her meat pies from barber Sweeney Todd, who kills customers with his cut-throat razor. Johanna is planning to quit her job to marry her fiancé Jarvis (Michael Cox), but is unaware of the murder and mayhem that surrounds her, at least until Jarvis falls victim to the evil Mr. Todd.\n\nWeighed down by interminable scenes of dreadful dialogue, and suffering from hopelessly amateurish direction, the film is yet another test of one&apos;s resolve from the always awful Milligan, making it through to the end being a challenge for even the most hardened of horror fans. Along the way, we are treated to just a smattering of nudity (from Susan Cassidy, as songstress Anna, who is having an affair with Sweeney), some terrible gore (rubber appendages are hacked off and there&apos;s an unconvincing meat cleaver in the head effect), and the unforgettable sight of a severed breast in a pie, all of which just about saves the film from earning the absolute minimum rating possible.",

      "reviewBody": "Bicentennial Man is an overlooked family film that isn&apos;t perfect, but nonetheless doesn&apos;t deserve all the negativity it has received. Chris Columbus directs this with flair and he makes something really good here, and quite entertaining. Due to some scenes, this may upset younger viewers, but this is sure to appeal to anyone looking for something unique to watch. I can see why some people may dislike this one, but I on the other hand found it very entertaining and very well done. The special effects are truly wonderful and they add so much to the film. I thought that Robin Williams was truly great in the lead role. This is a fine drama that manages to overcome its shortcomings due to its heart. The cast are wonderful and they elevate the material significantly. Bicentennial Man is not perfect, but it definitely entertaining and is worth watching. Chris Columbus has directed something truly incredible that is very much underrated and like I said does not deserve the flack it has received. Of course Columbus has made better films in his career, but this is an overlooked gem that definitely is worth your time. Robin Williams is a good actor and he deserves credit in giving the film its charm as well as some humor here and there to lighten the tone of the drama. There are things that could have been done better, but overall the film really soars above the negative aspects that all the negative reviews have pointed out. Give this film a shot if you&apos;re in the right state of mind, you may be surprised at how good it really is.",

      "reviewBody": "Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. Actually, it&apos;s almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. This is a marvelous story about sex and gender, and it&apos;s almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. Feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. We look at it, and something starts growing inside our minds, even our hearts: it a pure poem. I&apos;ve watched some &quot;gay&quot; movies, and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I don&apos;t like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that I&apos;m forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? But in the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, in the end of the movie: Why? And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. The scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. And maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. I&apos;m sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it Some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. Others are so used to common &quot;American gay&quot; movies that can&apos;t appreciate the real value of this master-piece. Watch it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give a nine. And I just don&apos;t give ten, because ten of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.",

Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus &apos;Thunderbolt&apos; Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create &apos;super soldiers&apos;. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it&apos;s smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy.",

I agree with every positive word written in this place.\n\n&apos;A Year of the Quiet Sun&apos; is indeed something special: It is a humanist treasure - beauty brought forth from the universal and horrific darkness of the 20th century, truly a sun painted to put back up into a ruined sky, to shore up the ruins of our benighted world, patching the gaping darkness of our fallen and threadbare souls. To call this a masterpiece would seem somehow as shocking as applause during a church service: It is a profound meditation on the fate of humanity, and as such it is beyond praise. It is that rare thing, an artifice that brings reality into sharp focus, and gives us back a little of our lost immortality. A breathtaking achievement. A film for the ages.\n\nEspecial thanks are due to Netflix, by the way, for the commendable and valuable &apos;season&apos; of neglected Polish films they are presently curating (November 2019), of which &apos;A Year of the Quiet Sun&apos; is the most remarkable amongst several wonderful productions. Netflix, in this willingness to feature what are usually dismissed by popular streaming services as &apos;art house&apos; movies, and which are as carefully avoided by traditional broadcasters in this commercial milieu, is performing a very valuable cultural service.",

      "reviewBody": "Ghost Sweepers (aka Fortune Tellers) is a 2012 Korean film that&apos;s somewhat comparably themed in nature to the 1980&apos;s movie Ghostbusters.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nYour story involves a wealthy land owner rounding up 50 or so of Korea&apos;s top paranormal specialists to rid the supernatural problems plaguing her plans to develop a small seaside town. As one would expect from people working in this profession, many of the &quot;experts&quot; gathered together are little more than charlatans, phonies, etc, who are out to make a quick buck and/or further their reputation. \n\nEveryone convenes at the site of the problem, where they quickly find they are overmatched by actual otherworldly powers that far exceed their b.s. abilities. As such, most of them high tail it out of town asap, leaving only a handful of people to deal with the problem. The 5 people that decide to remain do have some varying degree of special skills however, and include: a money hungry scheister looking to make a name for himself, a shaman that can see spirits with his mystic eye, an engineer that designs all types of ghost hunting equipment, a pretty fortune teller who can see the past, and, a young boy who can see the future.\n\nThe 5 remaining &quot;ghost sweepers&quot; are joined in their endeavor by a spunky reporter who&apos;s down on her luck. Together, they all set off to solve the mystery of what&apos;s going on in town. From there, it&apos;s a mish mash of varying back stories, unnecessary side plots, and so on, until the main ghostly story line finds its way to a conclusion. There&apos;s also a considerable amount of unnecessary filler that unfolds along the way regarding various familial/friendship/love relationships among the characters.\n\nEach of the primary cast members are given a brief, albeit promising, intro that provides some insight into the characters they portray. Unfortunately, there&apos;s too little time spent on them (in favor of emphasizing an overly lengthy ghost story) to allow the viewer to better invest and care about any of these people over the long haul. Two of what could have been some of the more interesting characters (the pretty fortune teller and the young boy) are so underutilized that they were almost pointless in the overall scheme of things. \n\nThere is simply just too much going on here to make all of this effectively work in the context of a theatrical movie format. None of what is going on is complicated or confusing, but when you add up the father/son story, reporter/dad story, love interest stories, friendship/kinship stories, etc., well, it&apos;s a lot to digest &amp; process all at once; and, I haven&apos;t even mentioned the primary story about the sunken Japanese treasure ship/ghost story angle, the village idiots who work at the behest of the ghostly presence, the unnecessary side plot involving some company that wants the reporter dead, etc. This film would have been far better served if it were turned into a KTV series, where the characters could be better fleshed out, and various story lines and relationships could be more fully developed over time, and where new ghostly occurrences could be solved every few weeks, etc. But, this is a 2 hour movie, so it is what it is!\n\nThis is an average movie at best. I suppose you can kill two hours watching it if you have nothing better to do on a rainy afternoon. Otherwise, this is a forgettable and underwhelming flick that can easily be skipped over.\n\nBottom Line: A very generous 6 out of 10 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "FIST OF THE WARRIOR is a cheapo martial arts vehicle for Pak Ho-Sung, a Korean-American fighter whose best known role is still as the top henchman in Jackie Chan&apos;s excellent DRUNKEN MASTER II (he&apos;s the guy who goes lording it around in a black suit). Sadly, to mention FIST OF THE WARRIOR in the same paragraph as the Jackie movie is to do the latter a disservice, as this independent production is completely forgettable and nowhere near in the same league.\n\nIt&apos;s a film with a simple revenge storyline that feels dragged out no end with long dialogue scenes between extraneous characters who aren&apos;t even important to the story. The whole thing is dark and cheap-looking and the various fight scenes suffer from lacklustre choreography that doesn&apos;t allow the viewer to enjoy any of the strikes or special moves, not that there are many.\n\nHo-Sung makes for a wooden hero although I did enjoy the presence of the familiar faces in the supporting cast. Sherilyn Fenn was once the star of BOXING HELENA while Peter Greene has long been propping up B-movies as a slimy villain; I still remember him as the guy who gets his neck snapped by Seagal in UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION actors Marina Sirtis and Michael Dorn enjoy a mini reunion of sorts, Antonio Fargas cameos as a priest, and hulking body builder Brian Thompson is completely wasted in a nondescript henchman role. Yeah, FIST OF THE WARRIOR isn&apos;t much cop, even for action lovers.",

      "reviewBody": "Filmmaking legend John Huston&apos;s visually sumptuous, rousingly full-blooded, hugely undervalued &apos;A Walk With Love and Death (1968) is, for me, one of the more unfairly neglected works of 60s agitprop cinema. This rather cruel, emotionally visceral, oppressively dark tale of burgeoning love set against the squalling, brutalist backdrop of 14th century France, with its increasingly malign, irreligious mania and ceaseless warmongering has retained much of its power to draw you into this especially grim and turbulent epoch.\n\nUnlike so many bloodless, pretty-plastic cinema couples I had a great sympathy for the desperate travails of naive, haughty, yet wholly innocent Claudia of St. Jean (Angelica Huston) and her earnest young paramour Heron of Foix (Assi Dayan), and I can readily imagine Terry Gilliam, Michael Winterbottom, Andrea Arnold, and Gaspar Noe might also appreciate Huston&apos;s doomily atmospheric, frequently distressing period masterpiece. A bold, triumphant expression of refined cinematic art made ever more divine by maestro Georges Delerue&apos;s sublime score! While &apos;A Walk With Love and Death&apos; is certainly not without its missteps, it is quite obvious that Huston&apos;s majestic, witheringly unsentimental film has not only endured, the galvanizing themes of an impoverished, ruthlessly exploited minority angrily rising up against their mercenary oppressors is disturbingly relevant!",

I read the book many years ago, when I was 10 years old and the first time I watched, the movie brought out nice memories and emotions in me . I couldn&apos;t help but smile throughout the movie. Definitely one of the best adaptations of children&apos;s books. It made me want to go through the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn again. Movie doesn&apos;t follow all the chapters, some details are left out but it leaves up to the book&apos;s spirit. Elijah Wood&apos;s performance is noteworthy. He expresses Huck Finn&apos;s personality and characteristics perfectly. It is considered a children&apos;s book and a children&apos;s movie, but in fact, it&apos;s pleasant to watch for all the audiences, regardless the age. Like the book, you&apos;ll enjoy the movie at any age!",

      "reviewBody": "It is a widespread superstition that when a book is filmed, the movie is usually inferior to the book. The most probable explanation of this groundless idea is that many people have read this or that book, say, Tolstoy&apos;s &apos;War and Peace&apos;. When they learn that the book has been filmed, they are induced to go and see the movie. And often they become disappointed. By contrast, only a negligible minority will first see a movie, discover that it is a filmed novel, and therefore read the book. I happen to belong to this minority. And I am capable of presenting a long list of books which turned out to be inferior. Gabor von Vaszery&apos;s novel &apos;Monpti&apos; is merely one example among many others. However, von Vaszery also wrote the script for the movie. I have carefully studied every difference between the movie and the novel. It is my view that in each and every case the film version is superior if assessed in itself, while the book version fits more properly into the work as a whole. But I also claim that the film version is invariably so much improved, that only a formalist could prefer the book version. Besides, the movie is also superior whenever there is no obvious difference between both. - - - In my youth I thought that Romy Schneider is beautiful, but not more beautiful than many other actresses or even extras in her own movies. I also meant that she is a skilled actress but not more skilled than many others. Later, my fascination was caused by two movies, &apos;Monpti&apos; and &apos;Claire de femmes&apos;. I was 53 when I saw &apos;Monpti&apos; for the first time. Whether or not it is a subjective idea, I still think that &apos;Monpti&apos; is the best German movie ever made.",

      "name": "A great Van Damme movie...",
      "reviewBody": "This is without a doubt one of the better Van Damme movies in the entire course of his career. Why? Well because it is not the average generic movie that he usually makes, where he is sort of a lone underdog hero who is fighting an uphill battle against overwhelming odds, and with some miraculous force he manages to singlehandedly emerge victorious at the end, even after having received a beating that would normally drop dead a prize-winning bull.\n\n&quot;6 Bullets&quot; is a great story-driven movie, in which Van Damme plays Samson Gaul, a mercenary who is working in Eastern Europe to infiltrate human trafficking rings and rescue underage boys and girls, and bring them home to be reunited with their families after these horrible ordeals. However, during one such a mission, something goes horribly awry and two innocent young girls end up dead. Haunted by the apparitions of these dead girls, Gaul ends up seeking solitude and salvation at the mercy of alcohol while trying to make a living as a butcher. A young American girl is kidnapped from her hotel and the parents seek out Gaul for help. But can Gaul redeem himself of the past and step up to the task at hand? The storyline in &quot;6 Bullets&quot; was really interesting and captivating, as human trafficking is, sadly, every day events in parts of the world. So with that in mind, then this story really takes on a personal approach and becomes more than just mindless martial arts entertainment.\n\nPlus, the storyline is really helped along by some powerful performances, not only by Van Damme, who really stepped into character and showed a great acting side, but also by Joe Flanigan (playing Andrew Fayden).\n\nThe movie was nicely shot, the dialogue was good and it moved at a great pace. There was a fair amount of drama in the movie, spiced up with martial arts, of course, and also gun fights. This is really one of the better Van Damme movies that I have seen in a long, long time, and it is good to see that he is back in the game.\n\nThere were just a couple of things in the movie that I didn&apos;t really understand. In the opening sequence, how did Gaul manage to plant all that explosive in the cars parked outside the building when there was all that much security personnel around? And also when he wanted a phone number traced, it started with 555, which is a number associated with Hollywood movies, so we must assume that it is an alleged American fake-movie phone number, so why was it showing up on an Eastern Europe phone? And finally, why would most people in Eastern Europe opt to speak English first whenever addressing strangers? Wouldn&apos;t it make more sense to speak in their native language? Anyway, these touches are just small flaws that don&apos;t really have much impact on the movie. I just happened to notice this and wonder about it.\n\n&quot;6 Bullets&quot; is a great addition to movie collection for fans of Van Damme. And it is also good entertainment, even if you are not particular a fan of him.",

The crew must navigate to the scientist&apos;s brain (within exactly 60 minutes) where Dr Duval will attempt to dissolve the coagulum with a laser beam After that everything starts growing back to its original size\n\n&quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; is a film of authentic wonder: An ocean of life, the corpuscles, the heart, the lungs of the human body through which the crew move are exquisitely designed in great detail with artistic quality...\n\nThe plot creates unceasing moments of suspense as the ship and its crew are continually threatened by the scientist&apos;s natural defenses: white corpuscles, reticular fibers, antibodies and other factors Leonard Rosenman&apos;s futuristic score nicely complements the adventure on screen with the strange sound of the human blood rushing through arteries, veins, rhythmical muscular movements, and of course, the sabotage occurred on board \n\nWith two Oscar Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction, &apos;Fatastic Voyage&apos; is certainly the most unusual journey into the human body, where the &apos;medieval philosophers were right. Man is the center of the universe. We stand in the middle of infinity, between outer and inner space. And there&apos;s no limit to either.&apos;",

The story is set at the time of religious wars and turmoils following the protestant reformation and the hero fights for the freedom of his country from Spanish occupation and from the holy inquisition. The fist parts of the film are devoted to showing the atmosphere of oppression in the Netherlands at the time, with people being reported to the inquisition by envious neighbors and burned at the stake on flimsy excuses, when the real goal is for the king to get hold of their riches. Obviously this must have been a &quot;hot theme&quot; for soviet citizens even in the seventies, and it might be the reason why the film is so effective, though I wonder how it passed censorship. The whole film is spectacularly shot, in the tradition of the best Russian film-making, but probably the most monumental scene is at the end, when Til drives a ship into a flooded town. This film is probably very hard to come by, unless you live in one of the ex-socialist countries, but if you do manage to see it you won&apos;t regret it."

      "reviewBody": "This was an interesting idea. Basically, a couple of Dutch guys decided to arrange a soccer match between Bhutan, a tiny, isolated Himalayan nation between India and China, and Montserrat, an even tinier island in the Caribbean. And they pulled it off: the Montserrat team went all the way to Bhutan and played a game there.\n\nThat&apos;s a pretty odd idea, needless to say, but it was great fun and it made for a very enjoyable movie. I&apos;m not a soccer fan, so I can&apos;t say whether or not the soccer playing is very good (my guess is no), but I can say that both teams seemed to take the game seriously but still had a great international exchange.\n\nThis is a &quot;feel good&quot; movie. The only reason I didn&apos;t give it higher marks is that the filmmakers used way too many specialty shots, particularly during the game. The story is interesting enough to stand up on its own without needing that kind of distraction.",

A little comedy from the 80&apos;s, with no pretension whatsoever other then to entertain you and make you laugh Unfortunately, the end is not that great. Those were the times when the good guy had to defeat all of its enemies within the last 10 minutes of the film. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and deserves to be seen.",

      "reviewBody": "A large asteroid falls on earth and from that emerges a group of aliens who try to take over the ancient world by bringing an evil witch back to life. The story is, like some many of these films, incidental to the action but I really enjoyed the mix of fantasy and sci-fi. The alien is cool looking. The rock monsters are slightly underwhelming (it&apos;s the way the walk) but they&apos;re fun nonetheless, in a B-movie kinda way. Alan Steel (née Sergio Ciani) is agile even if he&apos;s more beefy (and older looking) than Steve Reeves or Mark Forest. The film transfer I saw was bad but even so I had fun watching it. I could see that it was very colorful film in its original state and I&apos;m certain that if this film had a decent transfer, people would be pleasantly surprised by how much fun HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN actually is.\n\nThere are several good moments in it, including the &quot;nicer dicer&quot; scene, when Hercules (or Maciste) is trapped within a giant contraption which looks like the jaws of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Cool scene. I thought the film moved at a good pace and was never dull. The actress who played the Queen was a pretty good villainess. She looked like she came straight out of an anime. The actress who played the sister had a massive rack which would make Dolly Parton jealous. The only weakness in the film would be the soundtrack. It&apos;s not really impressive.\n\nPeplums like this one are often derided and dismissed for showcasing too much muscle. First of all, so what? Secondly, films like this were made, first and foremost, for kids. Kids back then (and today) are impressed by big burly guys. Just look at the success of the über trashy WWE today, which shows more skin than any of these sometimes overlooked action flicks. Third of all, Sword and Sandal films are probably the most underrated genre ever. Without these films there wouldn&apos;t have been a Ridley Scott&apos;s Oscar winning GLADIATOR or the current box office smash, 300.\n\nJust watch HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN for what it is: just a fun, colorful action movie, which happens to have some beefcake and cheesecake thrown in for good measure.",

He takes her to hairdresserÂ’s, goes for walks, shopping, and tidies up the apartment.\r\n\r\nBut one day while Daniel is cleaning the windows, Edeltraut locks him out on the balcony and takes off. The two men go out looking for her. But what they find is not just Edeltraut, but also a tender fondness for one another, one which turns both of their lives upside down.\r\n\r\nProduction note:\r\nÂ“HEAVY GIRLSÂ” was completed in just three months, \r\nfrom the original idea to the finished film. The film was shot based on a treatment, which defined the order and content of the scenes, the dialogues were improvised. In order to attain the greatest amount of creative freedom and authenticity, we intentionally shot the film without a crew and film team and with a simple Mini DV camera.\r\n",

Forget Ivan Reitman&apos;s great direction and the highly suitable music of James Newton Howard. Even the notable guest appearances from senators, journalists etc.\n\nThat makes it for me one of my all time favorite movies, is the heart of its characters, especially Dave.\n\nIt&apos;s all about doing the right thing.\n\nUnfortunately almost never good people reach the highest offices. You need to be a politician. To sell yourself bit by bit, to compromise, to lie or even worst.\n\nBut what if? What if purely by chance or because the universe wanted it, a good, honest, caring man becomes the most powerful man in the world? This is the main theme of this great movie and you surely wont give it justice if you see it as a farce or a comedy.\n\nFor me this movie is a 10. I really think writers and directors should make more movies like this, instead of writing about lunatics and serial killers."

      "reviewBody": "We sat for the first few minutes wondering whether we&apos;d come to the right film (expecting a formulaic period romp). And for a little while I was prepared to spend the rest of the evening apologising to my partner for the slowness and oddness of the film. But once our disbelief had been suspended and we&apos;d got used to the cramped feeling of the film (more like a staged version than cinematic at times), we both loved it.\n\nI agree that Claire Danes acted well (though the hyperventilation happened once too often) and Billy Crudup brought a complexity to the role that I rarely see in films. The reference to Shakespeare in Love is an affectionate comparison: I enjoyed the light snack of Gwinny, luvvies and Fiennes and have sat through the DVD time and again. But that film had a predictability that Stage Beauty lacked. We didn&apos;t know that Stage Beauty&apos;s &apos;love element&apos; would ever work out.\n\nI do not see the development of the relationship between Danes and Crudup as a conversion from gay to straight. Instead I see a problematic progress from an imposed gender identity (perpetuated through sexual fantasy by Buckingham) to an un&quot;knowing&quot; but more satisfying state, where it&apos;s being yourself (whatever that is) not performing a role that counts. I think that this is relevant to all of us as we perform the roles that we and those who&apos;ve influenced our upbringing have created for ourselves. We can&apos;t easily escape them (and some are more hammy than others in their performance) but the knowledge that life is performative and complex is, for me, liberating.\n\nAnd all that from a costume drama!"

      "reviewBody": "For years I thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the leads. It certainly has the same rough house humor that Ford laces his films with. \n\nTo my surprise I learned it was George Stevens who actually directed it. Still I refuse to believe that this film wasn&apos;t offered to John Ford, but he was probably off in Monument Valley making Stagecoach.\n\nVictor McLaglen along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three sergeants in the Indian Army who have a nice buddy/buddy/buddy camaraderie going. But the old gang is breaking up because Fairbanks is engaged to marry Joan Fontaine. Not if his two pals can help it, aided and abetted by regimental beastie Gunga Din as played by Sam Jaffe.\n\nThe Rudyard Kipling poem served as the inspiration for this RKO film about barracks life in the British Raj. The comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film. Not that the makers were racist, but this was the assumption of the British there at the time, including our leads and Gunga Din shows this most effectively.\n\nThe British took India by increments, making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak Mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the 19th century. They ruled very little of India outright, that would have been impossible. Their rule depended on the native troops you see here. Note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and Gunga Din is considerably lower in status than that.\n\nNote here that the rebels in fact are Hindu, not Moslem. There are as many strains of that religion as there are Christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. Of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the Congress Party came into being, these people were the voice of a free India.\n\nBut however you slice it, strangling people isn&apos;t a nice thing to do and the British had their point here also. When I watch Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the prime directive came into being.\n\nCary Grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane Cary we&apos;re used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities.\n\nBest acting role in the film however is Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, the head of the strangler cult. Note the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when he&apos;s on.\n\nFavorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. Note how Stevens progressively darkens the background around Ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish Halloween mask. Haunting, frightening and very effective.\n\nIt was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the British public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the Raj. But that&apos;s the subject of Gandhi.\n\nGunga Din is still a great film, entertaining and funny. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can chart how the Indian independence movement evolved.",

      "reviewBody": "It seems at the present time, I can not help but watch movies that are based on a true story&apos;. Perhaps it is all a coincidence, but I have been richly rewarded for viewing such movies. Race to space is a family friendly&apos; motion picture, that has a great resemblance to the movie October sky&apos;. If you have ever looked for a film about animals, and why they are and can be an important part of someone&apos;s life, then this film is it.\n\n Wilhelm is a NASA scientist, who has recently located to Florida with his son Billy, who aspires to be a hero like the young astronaut, Alan Shepherd and it&apos;s not long before Billy gets his chance. Hired by Dr. McGuinness to help train the chimpanzees for the NASA space mission, he begins to develop a close bond with one chimp in particular, Mac. With Billy&apos;s help, Mac is chosen to become the first chimp into space. It all seems a wonderful game until Billy realizes the risk associated with Mac going on this historic mission. Can Mac and his Dad pull together to make this mission fly?\n\nThis a really enjoyable film. Considering that is based on a true story, I like how it compels you to see what will happen between the main stars, that being Billy and Mac. The director, Sean McNamara, does a great job in bringing out the wonderful relationship that a young boy has with the Chimpanzees. I also found the story interesting in how the bad men of launch wanted it to fail, but never got their way. The credit for the story belongs to both Eric Gardner and Steven H. Wilson. They wrote both the script and the characters perfectly. \n\nThen what about the cast for this film. The main man of the show was Billy, who was played by Alex D. Linz. I like how he showed such compassion for his animal friend Mac, as that sentiment seemed real. This young fellow also appeared in films such as the Cable Guy and the starring role in the not so popular, Home Alone 3. I liked the grown cast members of `Race to Space&apos;. Billy&apos;s Father, the eccentric Dr. Wilhelm Von Huber, was acted very well by James Wood. I especially enjoyed how his character turns from being a strict parent, to a caring and understanding father. Then the role of Dr Donni McGuinness is also important. Her character was performed by Annabeth Gish. She was good in the role of the doctor who chooses the one Chimp to go into space. I also enjoyed her role in the film, Double Jeopardy.\n\n There is also some different sort of stars that need to be recognised here. I am of course talking about the wonderful work by the Chimpanzees. They were very funny and well taught by their trainers. It was an amazing achievement to actually have an animal do what was being shown. To have it reenacted is priceless.  It is great to have animals being not only able to achieve great heights, but to be used in a way that is not cruel, but instead to the advantage of all to see.\n\nIn conclusion, I watched this film with a group of people, who all thought it was pretty good. I would have to agree, considering that it was funny, touching, sad and triumphant, showing the heartfelt adventure of the first chimpanzee in space. This film also makes me a little envy of missing out such great achievements by man, such as putting animals in space (safely) and a man on the moon. What an historic time the 60&apos;s must have been, and how lucky we are that movies can are being made showing such events. Race to space is an inspirational story that should not be missed.\n\n CMRS gives Race to Space&apos;: 4.5 (very good - brilliant film)"

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to see how well made this movie is if you didn&apos;t grow up in Korea. The movies doesn&apos;t provoke much thought but the director obviously put so much thought into the details of the movie.\n\nTo understand the movie, here are a few basic facts: 1. This movie isn&apos;t set in 21st century. It takes place in 1983, when Korean students were free to where ordinary clothes to school as opposed to uniforms. Therefore, the characters will be more &quot;old-minded&quot; and more conservative than present day Koreans. 2. Korea is an extremely hierarchical society. This was much worse during the 80s than it is now. 3. Back then, students weren&apos;t respected much as individuals(they still aren&apos;t, but it&apos;s getting a bit better). There were two extremes, the &quot;model students&quot; and the &quot;faulty students,&quot;(direct translations) and everyone else was just somewhere in between.\n\nThe hierarchy of high school students goes Kids with rich parents(because the parents can give money under the table to teachers or can pay for gangsters to protect their children)&gt;the good fighters&gt;everyone else, including the model students\n\nThe main fight in the movie is about the place of the &quot;King&quot; of the high school. The King is basically the school prom king+the bully of the school. The power of the King stronger was stronger back then because most of the schools were divided in boys and girls schools and the hierarchies were more intense.\n\nA few comic factors in the movie have to do with the fact that Koreans like to ignore the truth and make themselves(and the stories they tell) seem bigger than the truth. That&apos;s why the stories the boys tell each other about the fights are so comically exaggerated. In real life, the exaggerations wouldn&apos;t be near as great, so it&apos;s pretty sarcastic for the director to express it that way.\n\nThe movie&apos;s also funny in the fact that the Kings are usually very (overly) serious about the power they hold. Basically, actual kings in real life/Joongpil equals beer-bellied middle-aged men who still think they&apos;re hot and hold a lot of authority over other people/Homer Simpson of The Simpsons.\n\nI don&apos;t know how the Eng subs are because I watched it without any, but I can assure you that the subs can&apos;t capture what the Korean in this movie feels like. It&apos;s hard to translate this movie because most of the language that gives this movie it&apos;s spunk is slang used by high schoolers."

Fitzgerald delivers in her role as the tortured Alma and stalwarts, John MCintyre and Rita Moreno supply the sparks.\n\nLost in all of this is a fine performance by the large version of Thomas Gomez..who proves again his versatility. I love the irony of the ending with the appearance of Earl Holliman as &apos; Archie&quot; Good Drama is never dated and Peter Glenville (dir) makes it all happen..also ..one wouldn&apos;t be surprised to note that Hal Wallis is the producer..one of the all time best that Hollywood has ever had.\n\nC Pope"

Bravely he dishes out very pretentious scenes. On the other hand, in order to conduct the screenplay instead of using a responsive script; he chooses to benefit by populist ingredients. Clemens-Maria Haas&apos;s strong music score holds the tension of the film at the top from opening to the ending, even though there are unnecessarily long scenes.\n\nThe storyline is very basic and simple. There are only three location sets: Construction building, a street from Berlin&apos;s Turkish quarter and the apartment. This might be boring, but at the same time it builds strong focus. Berlin in Berlin is an unassuming production. Don&apos;t expect any splendor, or even an average cinematography. All the actors perform very well. Absolutely worth watching.",

I came away from this film with the thinking that in 1957 when the picture came out in a strange way it must have terrified viewers. The film was clearly ahead of its time. By todays standards the egotistical, cynical and power hungry Lonesome Rhodes actually is quite tame but in 57 he must have been viewed as a cross between Hitler and Arthur Godfrey. Andy Griffith is nothing less than brilliant as Rhodes. Superb support from Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau, Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick in her first motion picture. The movie never lags as it grips the viewer from the opening right to the final scene."

Nils Aster portrays a Javanese Prince who clearly has self control issues. He not only beats his servants but even attempts to seduce Greta Garbo when he realizes she is being neglected by her husband. His repugnant behavior towards her border on attempted rape. \n\nThe Synchronized Score is pleasing. I especially like the theme song &quot;You Are Like Wild Orchids&quot; which is played and sung several times. The native Javanese song and dance sections however are quite strange and features unpleasant discordant melodies. The removal of that sequence from the film would have improved the picture tremendously.",

This documentary takes the question of what is work, and why should we do it into an extended work of interviews and clips from the french bosses union MEDEF convergence. What it really is is the clash in between the neoliberal ideology being forced upon us, and uphelf as hum*n emancipation through consummerism by the liberals, against the philosophy of the free time. I have to say that I&apos;ve never worked in a fastfood chain restaurant, and was really impressed at the brainwashing and normative process applied to the body that goes along with the uniform : having the proper haircut matching your gender expectations (2cm above your eyebrows at least, and no hair on the neck) which was way beyond by expectations. I feel like finding a not-too-patched-up flannel shirt is already hard enough to comply with, but such conformity, to watch and not even live, was already making me angry. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m already convinced at what the interviewees advocating for free time were saying, and I would certainly advocate for this too. In all of the cliché, I&apos;m always happy to hear folks speaking with southern french accents.",

Now I&apos;m no expert reviewer, or even amateur scientist, but I&apos;ll do my best to explain this one.\n\nIsaac Bruno is a scientist obsessed with finding a new planet, with the potential to harbour life, around distant stars. But he&apos;s a troubled man, having to deal with a very recent loss in his life, which greatly affects his work and career. Enter Clara, who agrees to be his unpaid research assistant, but has a very unscientific way of explaining her view of the universe. Together, when new data is released following the launch of a new space telescope, they attempt to find the elusive planet, whilst helping each other to deal with more earthly problems.\n\nThe relationship side of the story between Bruno and Clara, never becomes boring. The characters are so well played by the two lead actors, that you actually end up caring for their lives and situations, something that is rarely achieved in many movies nowadays. And their story is so well intertwined with the main plot.\n\nThe science behind the planet searching is explained in a way that doesn&apos;t treat you like an idiot (even one like me!!), so even those not used to this kind of movie should at least grasp the basics, and it certainly doesn&apos;t distract ones attention from the story.\n\nWe seem to be bombarded nowadays with so many sci-fi movies about alien invasions and superhero daring do, that movies like this seem to get lost in the ether. Indeed I don&apos;t remember this movie getting a cinematic release in the UK (but I could be wrong there). And that&apos;s a real shame because this is probably (in my opinion), one of the best &quot;thinking mans&quot; sci-fi movies out there.\n\nIf movies like Aliens, Independence Day or Predator, are your thing, then you will want to avoid this one. If, however you prefer the likes of Contact, 2001 etc, then this movie is an absolute must.",

      "name": "Yet another early-&apos;70s Spaghettit Western slapstick comedy",
      "reviewBody": "Two brothers set out in search of a treasure, buried in secret by their late father many years prior.\n\nHere&apos;s another dumb comedy slapstick Eurowestern of which there is seemingly an inexhaustible supply. Fans of Spaghettis (like me) will amazed (like I was) at discvering this film available to stream in widescreen HD at Amazon: it&apos;s a film I&apos;d never heard of, the only feature from a director I&apos;d never heard of, starring two lesser Euro stars among a cast of unfamiliar faces.\n\nSo what is it? Another mismatched pair of guys, this time two brothers: one is a dummy (Martell) who&apos;s handsome, the other is, uh, also a dummy (Borgese), who thinks he&apos;s a gunfighter but is really just a clueless klutz. Mama gives them a map to find Papa&apos;s gold stash (torn in half so the fellas will have to cooperate) and from there, we&apos;re off.\n\nThe action is sparse, with some random brawls, standoffs, and chases, but none of it is particularly engaging. There&apos;s a rich town-boss-type and his sniveling henchman on the boys&apos; trail, as well as a Union Lieutenant who also craves the hidden loot. Music, by the team of Bixio, Frizzi &amp; Tempera, is bubbly and lively but peppered with era-inappropriate synth blasts throughout. Additionally, the choice is made to insert loud, non-diegetic sound FX to each punch or conk on the head. Kettle drums, pinball machine sounds, that type of thing. It&apos;s goofy but more annoying than funny to be honest.\n\nAdd a godawful post-dub dialog track, one of the worst I&apos;ve heard in recent memory (just loud and annoying and lacking of any nuance or craft), and a ridiculously unmemorable non-sequitur title (translated directly from the original Italian, I&apos;d assume*), it&apos;s no wonder this thing has a low profile.\n\nAbout the only thing I&apos;d say is a plus for the flick is the performance of wiry and rubber-faced Sal Borgese, who is rather brilliant at his particular brand of physical-comedy acting. Borgese was, by the &apos;70s, elevated from supporting player to leading man status in Eurotrash pics, seeing top billing in flick like this one, and several of the THREE SUPERMEN entries.\n\nIf you&apos;re reading this blurb, you&apos;re probably curious enough about this kind of movie to warrant a peek at the film, but honestly you shouldn&apos;t feel bad about leaving this box unticked on your big Eurowestern checklist. HD stream available as I write at Amazon and also Tubi.\n\n*Not sure if the film&apos;s actual original title is the Italian La pazienza ha un limite... noi no! Or the Spanish ¡Caray, qué palizas! (&quot;Damn, What a Beating!) as the pic was an Italo-Spanish co-production.",

Spike Lee has a knack for finding these incredibly draining performances and bringing them to you in a way that makes you run the gamet of emotion as well.  This as well as FREAK! by John Leguizamo, both present two VERY different performances with VERY different meanings, both pull you through a full gauntlet of emotion. Incredible works.\n\nDo the tighten-up Make it mellow",

The Animal is a strong and true story about one man&apos;s choice and to have the guts to take it. \n\nI liked this movie. I am a Ving Rhames fan and he did it again. If you like Ving Rhames and like prison movies and gangster movies I think you will like this one.\n\n8/10 Stars in my book",

Each one of them contributes to this story, simple, but rich, dense, where family, friends, lovers contribute to produce a beautiful drama. Patrick Dewaere returns from prison in the USA; he finds his father, Yves Robert, who could give the title of &quot;a bad father&quot; to the film, even if we understand him. The police help Patrick Dewaere to reintegrate. He then crosses the path of Brigitte Fossey (very good performance), also in rehabilitation following his drug addiction. He also meets Jacques Dufilho, who will help him to reintegrate.\n\nThe film could be called a beautiful story, with beautiful characters, poignant at times, but gripping, which accepts that everyone has good sides, or weaknesses, and are able to overcome them, or not. The script also mixes, without condescension or judgment, the universe of the father, a public works worker, and the employer for the reintegration, Jacques Dufilho, who is a bookseller and music lover. These worlds are articulated through the character of Patrick Dewaere.\n\nIn its kind, a perfect film, which does not leave indifferent, which knots the stomach of the spectator.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s very sad to look at the Ward Boys, a trio of brothers whose simple world is brought out into the national spotlight in 1991 when one of their brothers is found dead in the morning, and one of the brothers, Delbert (who shared the bed with Bill, the dead brother), is accused of murdering/ euthanizing him.  To watch them is to see a segment of the country that gets little attention, but is made king of quaintly riveting in this context. We basically see all the different characters of the town go about their daily lives (including the brothers) while the backdrop of the murder trial casts a pall over their lives.  It&apos;s funny to see people who would have never normally talked to these outcast bumpkins now embrace them as if they were relatives.  And the old Ward Boys, all in their 50s and 60s, don&apos;t seem too affected by it all until the trial.\n\nThis is a really enthralling watch and it gives an insider&apos;s view into a community and a world that many of us never get to see.  Some of the townspeople are really fun to just listen to, and the police make themselves look pompous and suspect, which is one of the great achievements of this film... it makes us relate to people who are unlike most of us and rally around them against those most like ourselves.",

Two guys, one being Leslie Neilson, are at odds since one wants out of this Project Control. Basically people are shooting up to become superstrong? Well Leslie Neilson gets mixed up with some Filipino gangs who don&apos;t like either one of the Americans. There is a side romance too. Makes little sense really.\n\nI&apos;m sure Leslie would love for you to forget that he was in this one, but sadly like the movie says: &quot;The only way out is DEATH.&quot;\n\nWatchability: 2 out of 10 MST3K quality: 7 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "(8/10) Refreshing, delightful, sexy. moving and thought-provoking movie from Spain. Not really porn (as the title might suggest) although there is some very artistic explicitness. It is movies like this one that remind us that European cinema can scale the emotional dilemmas and mountains of a story where other films look at a storyline in terms of physical developments. Lucia, a young waitress in Madrid, falls completely in love with a writer. After a period of blissful togetherness, something from his past pulls him in two directions. We are caught up in his moral dilemma, of not wanting to lose the wonderful gift he has found and yet not wanting to be untrue to himself. The semi-autobiographical novel he is writing pulls together the story and the emotions and hopes of the characters and introduces ideas that enable them to heal some of their hurt.  A central idea is that of finding a hole (symbolically on the sandy beach) where, after reaching the end of the story, you can jump back into the middle. That way you can try an make things turn out better (&quot;If you give me time&quot;, says Lorenzo, Lucia&apos;s boyfriend.) \tA more mature and rounded work than the Director&apos;s earlier &quot;Lovers of the Arctic Circle&quot;, Sex and Lucia combines wonderful acting, a great story, innovative cinema and spine-tingly beautiful photography. One of my favourite films of the year.",

      "reviewBody": "Hard to believe this script was written in the early 1950s -- it sounds like it might be a pitch for some mismatch comedy of today. Neal is an environmental activist sent to Washington to help stop a bill that would allow drilling for natural gas in the habitat set aside by the government for the endangered California Condor. An evil oil company is sponsoring a bill in Washington that would allow them, and only them, to drill -- thus disrupting the Condor&apos;s delicate breeding patterns. She crashes a swank DC party to try to gain access to the Department of the Interior bureaucrat who&apos;s been ducking her, where she runs into a kindly retired Admiral (Gwenn, better known as Kris Kringle in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;), who is taken by her and agrees to introduce her to one of his many Washington pals, the sleazy but suave lobbyist lawyer played by Mature. What neither of them knows is that the Admiral is in fact an engraver at the Bureau of Printing and Engraving who&apos;s been forging party invitations for himself for years and has adopted the persona of a retired admiral. And Mature, infatuated with Neal, has to hide the fact that he&apos;s in fact the lobbyist hired by the gas company to get the special interest bill through Congress! Screwball complications ensue, of course, while Neal tries to get protection for the condors, Mature tries to seduce her without actually helping her against the interest of his client, and Gwenn finds his cover story unraveling the more he tries to help Neal, all under the comic theme of the whiff of corruption in government business.\n\nThe acting is fine here, hardly true screwball, but with believable performances by all three principles. Neal isn&apos;t quite enough of a sex bomb to explain Mature&apos;s infatuation, and her natural intelligence and self-possession bely the fact she&apos;s supposed to be something of a naif around DC. Nevertheless her portrayal is earnest and just enough tongue in cheek. Mature himself is just creepy enough to be credible as a sleazoid lobbyist, although his B-list looks also don&apos;t suggest much chemistry with Neal. Gwenn is his usual sophisticated self, playing the double role of Washington insider and humble engraver.\n\nModern sensibilities may be a bit perturbed by the comic use of the Condor&apos;s plight, but on the other hand it&apos;s a sober reminder of how little has changed that the plot would be just as plausible if remade today.\n\nWait for this hilariously obscene line in the middle of the movie, which somehow slipped by the censors: &quot;Unpack that 16&quot; gun!&quot;",

All of the surviving Hungarian team members were interviewed as well as some of the Soviet members and they told about their experiences before, during, and after the match.\n\nIt was well made and well edited, the film-making did a great job with all of the material they had to go through to put it together.\n\nProduced by Lucy Liu and Quentin Tarantino and narrated by world famous swimmer Mark Spitz, I hope this film gets a wider release so that many people can learn about this amazing story.",

You may not like the fighting and stunt work it presents. I do think it has hits and misses (yes more puns - or is it puns-es? As in punches - get it?).\n\nThere seem to be quite a few moments where people wait to be beaten up - but suspend your disbelief and go with the flow and you may actually have some fun with this. And not just at the end/during the end credits and some outtakes (in the vain of Jackie Chans movies), but throughout the movie. This is not the best martial arts movie - it does not claim to be. But if you have a heart for them - give it a go.",

I I would like to say it I actually saw the film, but for 40% of it my eyes are closed just keep from puking on the guy in front of me.\n\nThe about beside the movie is extremely weak with no character development and it&apos;s highly unlikely that an advanced civilization of aliens as those depicted in the movie The Practice martial arts as too close to just vaporising the human beings. I am an absolute sci-fi geek, and willing to forgive a lot of things. But this movie fails on so many levels I wonder why I even spent the time watching it that I will never get back.\n\nI gave it 5 Stars only for the reason that it has some good special effects. But even they were amateurish and I can only think that the camera movement was designed to disguise the poor quality of the CGI.",

It&apos;s biggest quality is its completeness in almost every respect. Completeness in its themes, in its means, and a glorious cast.\n\nIt&apos;s a film most of all about friendship (I most often think of the scene where monkey, usually the most &apos;rude&apos; of the protagonists,  eagerly grasps the last letter of their dead friend, and then, realizing he can&apos;t read at all, is forced to pass the letter to Holy Joe, but in fact the friendship theme is present in the whole movie), about the antagonism of freedom and civilization, about the need and the struggle to find and defend your own position towards everything surrounding you (the &apos;star&apos; to follow), about how dreams and reality can influence each other (remember the scene of Candida experiencing the man of her dreams riding towards her in a gracious slow motion, while Terence Hill in fact cusses his half-dead horse), about technological progress, it&apos;s consequences, and about almost every other theme that has ever been dealt with in 80 years of western history.\n\nThe movie&apos;s means are comedy, satire, drama, buddy movie, a really great musical score by Guido &amp; Maurizio de Angelis, and all style elements of the classical western.\n\nThe cast is superb, creating at least half a dozen unique characters you can root on; unfortunately with one exception: Yanti Somer&apos;s lousy performance as Candida.\n\nAnother wonderful thing about this movie, is that it doesn&apos;t condemn any of its characters; everyone has his place in the film&apos;s world and gets his respect by script, direction and cast: the protagonists as well as the whores, the &apos;villains&apos;, the bounty hunters and the jailers. By the way: This quality also characterizes most films by Sam Peckinpah.",

      "reviewBody": "Leave it to Flicker Alley to come up with a silent movie that I wasn&apos;t aware of. I may have come across Marcel L&apos;Herbier&apos;s 1924 L&apos;INHUMAINE (The Inhuman Woman) in some silent film reference book but I don&apos;t recall it. I knew of the director&apos;s later movie L&apos;ARGENT (1928) but not this one. Having just watched the film, this is rather surprising as it is quite remarkable on a number of levels. Some of the futuristic design especially in the laboratory scenes recall a Soviet sci-fi film called AELITA, QUEEN OF MARS which was released 6 months earlier while Fritz Lang&apos;s METROPOLIS (1927) may have borrowed a thing or two from them later on. L&apos;Herbier envisioned the film as being a &quot;miscellany of modern art&quot; and there is indeed something for everyone in an artistic sense. From an entertainment sense, it&apos;s a different matter as its appeal outside of artistic circles would be very limited (just like art films today).\n\nThe melodramatic plot tells the story of a callous opera singer (real life opera singer Georgette Leblanc who co-produced) who throws lavish parties and toys with men&apos;s affections. When one of them suddenly commits suicide, her fans and detractors clash at one of her concerts recalling THE RITE OF SPRING premiere in 1913. A jealous suitor poisons her with a deadly snake and then it&apos;s up to a former lover to bring her back to life in his state-of-the-art laboratory. That&apos;s just the basic outline. L&apos;Herbier uses every cinematic trick he can think of from rapid montage editing to a saturation of color tints to enhance his story. The real star here is the decor, a riot of art nouveau as conceived by several leading artists of the day. The sets (especially the laboratory) and the fashions must be seen to be believed. As the plot would indicate, this is not meant to be realistic in any sense of the word which makes it ideal for the medium of silent movies.\n\nThe restoration by Flicker Alley and Lobster Films may be the finest that they have ever done regarding the overall look of a film. An original nitrate print in good condition (courtesy of the director&apos;s daughter) was the source material and the original color tints as specified by L&apos;Herbier were utilized in the transfer to a digital medium. The two set pieces, the tumultuous concert and the lab resurrection, remain astonishing even to this day. If you carefully look at the 57 minute mark, you&apos;ll see composers Erik Satie (ill with less than a year to live) and Les Six member Darius Milhaud (who wrote the original score which is now lost) in the audience at the concert. This Blu-Ray offering comes with two brand new scores, one by percussionist Aidje Tafial, the other by the Alloy Orchestra. Both are effective but I prefer the former. If ever a silent movie was made for Blu-Ray release, it&apos;s this one and Flicker Alley &amp; Co have done it up proud. Thank You!... For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic."

      "reviewBody": "Mathew McConaughey is Brandon Lane, a former football star recruited by Walter Abraham (Al Pacino), the head of a sports consulting firm to help them set the line for their sports betting business. Lane&apos;s ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy, but it soon becomes apparent that he&apos;s bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.\n\nTwo for the Money is a forgettable, generic thriller that doesn&apos;t really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But, the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily, Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good, over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally, sports betting isn&apos;t that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let&apos;s be honest, the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It&apos;s so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.\n\nAl Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn&apos;t very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can&apos;t keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino&apos;s wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It&apos;s hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn&apos;t really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end, if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot, if you don&apos;t then just skip it. Rating 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "What a totally crazy (yet highly admirable) ambition to remake a Herschell Gordon Lewis film and actually add story depth, detailed character drawings, mystery and an atmosphere of morbidity! But it works. At least,  partially it works. Horror fanatics familiar with Lewis&apos; oeuvre know that his films are entertaining and sensationally gross, but they always severely lacked in the plotting department. Of all Lewis&apos; splatter films, &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot;, released in 1970, was definitely the one with the greatest potential and it&apos;s actually most unfortunate that the basic concept ideas weren&apos;t properly elaborated. Director Jeremy Kasten and writer Zach Chassler obviously must have felt the same way, as their remake cuts down on the gore (but luckily not to much) and attempts to give meaning and background to the whole idea of a maniacal magician. &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; is actually quite a unique oddity in the area of horror cinema nowadays! People always complain about the overload of needless remakes and modern directors&apos; lack of own creativity (and they&apos;re right, too) but here&apos;s finally one remake that doesn&apos;t aspire to just bluntly copy the original, but to complete and perhaps even &quot;improve&quot; it. The result may not be entirely successful, but it&apos;s definitely a courageous approach and an overall enjoyable and recommended experience.\n\nThis new version largely maintains the same plot as Lewis&apos; original film. Montag the Magnificent is a thoroughly uncanny magician/illusionist who, along with his hermit assistant, tours around with a quite unique and nightmarish act. He butchers seemingly random girls from the audience live on stage, yet when the audience panics and tries to flee, the light go on and the victims are standing there back in one piece again. A young reporter quickly discovers that the girls turn up dead the next day after all and their corpses are damaged exactly like they appeared to be on stage. Severely against the will of his girlfriend, he becomes obsessed with Montag&apos;s show and becomes entangled into a web of surreal nightmares, primitive drugs, physical agony and mental deterioration. &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; is still a pretty incoherent mess in which a lot of twists make absolutely no sense and a lot of vital questions remain unanswered, but at least you get the impression that Kasten and Chassler put thought and effort into providing an explanation for the events, and that is already an accomplishment to itself. Especially given the entirely illogical mishmash of half-decent ideas Herschell Gordon Lewis left behind. Moreover, this 2007 version benefices from a supremely macabre atmosphere and all the decors and set pieces look very grim. The gore and splatter effects clearly can&apos;t hold a candle to those of the original (at least, when it comes of outrageousness), but still there&apos;s some excellent carnage on display. Gore, nudity, atmosphere and immensely creepy carnival music  These are all great elements that allow you to overlook the occasionally senseless subject matter. Another thing which makes &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; a must-see for horror fanatics is the presence of no less than three phenomenal genre veterans, namely Crispin Glover, Brad Dourif and Jeffrey Combs.",

I was stuck in a sort of trance while watching this, as beautifully photographed scenes seemed to follow one after the other for the film&apos;s entirety.\n\nThere wasn&apos;t a moment that I had lost interest, and the questions posed throughout are some that I found myself thinking about on many different occasions as a child. Do we, perhaps even simultaneously, share the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things, or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions, but of course never answered them. It turns out, I believe, that there are no answers to begin with.\n\nThis is the fourth Kieslowski film I&apos;ve seen, and most certainly the best. Visually, it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy, and Irène Jacob (Veronique and Veronika) was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films, and the mood she creates in this one is understated, but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well, which in addition to being beautifully presented, plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made, presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon."

      "reviewBody": "If you have been waiting some time for a horror-musical-teen-comedy-Christmas-movie, then it has to be said the wait is over. Anna and the Apocalypse boldly goes there. It centres on a group of teens who find themselves in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Why is there a zombie apocalypse? Not important. But it is a good excuse for some serious genre mash-up action. I am not necessarily a natural audience for this kind of thing but I would say you would need to be being a bit overly harsh not coming away from this one with some positive feelings. It is a very likable film with some ambition to do something new.\n\nThe star of the show here for me was certainly the very beautiful Ella Hunt, who plays the title character. Clearly a performer with some definite star quality and versatility and one for the future hopefully. The rest of the cast are good too it has to be said, and it was nice seeing old Dennis Pennis himself, Paul Kaye, appear as an unhinged headmaster. It has to be said that the comedy is a bit uneven to say the least, although there are some good jokes sprinkled throughout about evacuation selfies, Justin Bieber and all the rest of it but I found it only sporadically funny if I am honest. The horror side of the fence is covered with the usual zombie violence which is visceral and creative enough to keep us interested. The songs were actually quite a welcome injection, as it was with those that the film was at its most distinctive. And also, quite pleasingly, things are not rounded off with a Hollywood ending either, which I thought was the right way to go for this kind of thing.\n\nOn the whole, while this is definitely a bit hit and miss, I commend it for its ambition and fun-factor. When a film has the good grace to at least try something new, it deserves a chance and I wish it the very best.",

Apparently action is located in an undetermined South American country but actually Jess filmed all the action in the south of in Spain and even with a restricted budget ambiance are well crafted and manages to give us the atmosphere Jess intended . Plot itself it&apos;s not a wonder, classical search for a killer mixed up with some revenge touches but is enough to keep you interested throughout the film . Main assets here is that Jess is not trying to do here his usual mix of sexplotation ,vampires ,lesbanism . He steps in a different ground and provided the level of the Spanish cinema in the late 50&apos;s I would say that he accomplished a fine impersonation of the Dassin and Melville works and ambiance&apos;s.",

This fragmented ,tiresome story was just plain silly --Imagine a crew member who can&apos;t count to twenty and the feeble overused gimmick of contrasting the couples&apos; plight with all the bustle and liveliness of natives in an outdoor shopping mall. Cut to the luckless couple , heads just bobbing along for over an hour in a monotonous sea. Exciting,no! Throw in the mandatory shark attack and your fright knows no bounds. I have this uneasy feeling that because of all the overworked hype, people feel compelled to rave about it, lest they admit (like me) to having been taken in. Simply, just an insipid travesty.

      "reviewBody": "It has been a great pleasure re-starting my &quot;watching Soviet/Russian films&quot; quest (especially fantasy and animation) and becoming acquainted with ones not yet seen, the same going for the original stories that some are adapted from. Did it a lot in 2013 and 2014, a great way of coping with stress, and wanted to relive those fond memories. A lot of the Soviet films seen recently have been fantasy and often the surreal kind with touches of comedy. This has been especially true in the films of Aleksandr Rou.\n\nHave seen almost all of them and have really liked to loved them all, though there will be those who will find them too weird. Not me, find them very imaginatively done, they are charming, the surrealism is a healthy dose but not excessive and the comedy touches in his films genuinely amuse. His most atypical and accessible, and also one of his best, is his adaptation of Prokoviev&apos;s ballet with the involvement of Bolshoi &apos;Cinderella&apos;. It is a shame that non-Russian viewers know him best from the riffing of &apos;Morozko&apos; (&apos;Frosty&apos;), to me that was not a bad film at all but to say that the dubbing doesn&apos;t do it justice is an understatement, very similar to the films of Aleksandr Ptushko.\n\n&apos;The Night Before Christmas&apos; is another Rou adaptation based on the stories of Nikolai Gogol, having seen 1952&apos;s &apos;May Nights&apos; recently and loving it. The film is based on Gogol&apos;s first story in the second volume of his &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot;, known as both &apos;Christmas Eve&apos; and &apos;The Night Before Christmas&apos;. Although it is higher rated than &apos;May Nights&apos;, there is actually a preference for that film, which to me was a little better paced and more focused in story. Not that &apos;The Night Before Christmas&apos; does either badly, just that &apos;May Nights&apos; does it a little better for my tastes.\n\nGetting the short-comings out of the way, the story is a slight one anyway in the first place and there are times in the film where one can tell where at times the pace feels a little draggy and padded.\n\nSome of the sound effects are on the overwrought side and the latter parts of the film is not always as easy to follow as what came before.\n\nConversely, &apos;The Night Before Christmas&apos; holds up well visually. Even if the sky is obviously painted, the sets are handsome enough and still evoke a sense of wonder, whether dreamy or macabre. Really made me want to be there, and this is complemented by the quite lavish photography, that is never too flashy or overblown nor simplistic or static and beautiful use of colour. The practical effects similarly are imaginatively done, have a charm and don&apos;t look cheap, the film doesn&apos;t overuse them and uses them when necessary. The music score is a mix of eccentric, whimsical, romantic and haunting, while not being at odds with what is going on.\n\nThe comedy is generally very funny and at its best hilarious, without being overdone to the point of being cartoony, while the quieter moments are charming even if they slow the film down slightly. It never feels over-complicated, yet never feels simplistic at the same time. Rou&apos;s direction is controlled and doesn&apos;t feel too heavy while also keeping things engaging. &apos;The Night Before Christmas&apos; is not always easy to follow in the latter stages, but the surrealism didn&apos;t feel over the top and the more macabre elements are darkly unsettling while not being too scary. Didn&apos;t feel that the film was too stagy.\n\nFound myself enjoying the characters, with the Devil being the most enjoyable and entertaining, a very memorable creation. The acting suits them well, on the theatrical side at times (not uncommon in a Rou film, or Russian fantasy), but didn&apos;t find them irritating or bland in any way.\n\nIn summary, very nice fantasy if not quite a classic, also feel that Rou has done better films. 8/10",

Sure the SFX are kinda low-budget and some of the actors sort of ham it up, but imagine if this film was made today with CG and bland actors whom take everything seriously, it just would not be the same movie.\n\nThe movie follows, well, two scientists whom drill beneath the Earth&apos;s core, run into bizarre monsters (whom looked like they were kicked out of Daiei&apos;s Gamera films BTW), become slaves, and explore the strange world and so on. I don&apos;t remember the novel very well, but I sure know that this movie is one of those &quot;so cheesy and wild, it&apos;s hard to forget&quot; type of movies.\n\nBTW, check out the part with Jubal the Ugly one! PRICELESS!"

      "reviewBody": "Call Her Savage (1932)\n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\n&quot;It&quot; girl Clara Bow made her comeback with this at times raunchy Pre-Code that features the actress turning up the sex level. In the film she plays a wild child who goes through various up and downs throughout her life. This starts with stealing a husband (Monroe Owsley) from his wife (Thelma Todd), which turns into a disaster but these two will pop up again later in her life. As with Bow&apos;s characters life, this film is up and down from start to finish. At times the film comes off very sexy, at times it&apos;s funny, at times it&apos;s heartbreaking but there are other moments where the film comes off as pure camp. Since this is a Pre-Code we get all sorts of scenes where Bow is showing off her sexuality, which includes scenes showing off her legs and one memorable scene with her nipples showing through her clothes. Before we get to all the sexual stuff we have a prologue that tells us Bow&apos;s character is cursed by God due to her grandfather&apos;s bad doings behind the back of his wife. These religious elements come off very campy and really put the movie at a slow start. The reason to see this film is due to Bow&apos;s terrific performance. She was always great at being the wild child and her funny side has always been good and that continues to be the case here. What really works is her dramatic turns, which includes one heartbreaking scene that I won&apos;t ruin here. Bow&apos;s comeback would only last one more film, which is a shame because it&apos;s clear she hand more punch than a lot of the actresses of this era, which went onto have long careers."

      "reviewBody": "Takeshi Kitano is worldwide known because of his violent movies such as Brother, Hana-bi, Violent Cop, etc. However in Japan is the other way around, he is mostly known by his comedy tv shows or duo-comedy shows (the two beats), where he got the name &quot;Beat&quot;.\n\nMinna Yatteruka! could be Kitano&apos;s masterpiece in comedy, but still very difficult to import. At least, Image has released in Hong Kong and USA the DVD of Minna Yatteruka (getting any?) with English subtitles, and we&apos;ve been able to see the unknown Kitano in a hilarious movie.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that I&apos;ve seen all Kitano movies, even Dolls, and this movie has nothing to do with them, it&apos;s a completely different story, has more to do with tv shows he directed like Takeshi&apos;s Castle.\n\nSo, the movie is just astonishing, it comes from the most stupid situation and developes through gag to gag. One hour and a half of cinema parody fullfiled with Japanese Manga stupidity. The rhythm of the movie is slow, very slow at some points for a comedy, but it&apos;s still a good movie. I found parodies from his other yakuza movies, Ultraman, even the gohstbusters! and I&apos;m sure I missed a lot.\n\nOverall Review: A very funny movie, a fresh product, but might be too weird for the general audience. So, if you are interested in the Japanese culture, in Kitano, or if you are openminded for new experiences in comedy, check for it, unless , discard it and look for American Pie.",

This surely would be no. 1 in the Top 100 Most Cynical Movies Ever, even after all these years (the simultaneous French version is not so earthy, a more flowery artiness coming out instead). For me, it&apos;s the best movie I&apos;ve seen of Pabst&apos;s, most of his post-WW2 stuff has eluded me so far.\n\nThe Guild Of Thieves&apos; leader gets married to the Guild of Beggars&apos; leader&apos;s daughter, causing friction between the two highly organised and respected professions, but inertia in the police who are in the Thieves&apos; power. Prostitution, aberration, bigamy, thievery, extortion, bribery, corruption (and complete cynically cheerful indifference to it all), you name it it&apos;s here - after all it is all that Man can do! Laconic-looking Ernst Busch&apos;s searing inter-ditties leave you with the distinct impression that someone was rather tired with the world! The savage sounding German words spew out, whilst reading the English subtitles is sometimes heavy going in digesting all of the conceptual opinions in time to digest the next. Would that Bobby Darin had got his tonsils round a few more of the extraordinary gossamer Brecht/Weill songs from this! Lotte Lenya sparkled doing her Pirate Jenny number, being just a part of my favourite bit in the idling whorehouse.\n\nAll of the people involved in 3G are &quot;lost to sight&quot;, except to the handful of Artheads who occasionally hold cultural revivals of Weill, Brecht or Pabst. There was a memorable series of events in London in 2000 to mark the 50th anniversary of Weill&apos;s death, but 99.99% of the general public passed it by.\n\nSoon we will all be lost to sight too, along with all of our fractious opinions and silly vices.",

They discover that a scientist, who has since fled with the element, has invented a new highly dangerous radioactive element that is able to &quot;grow&quot;.  If the element is not found and destroyed or contained, it could continue to grow until it sends the Earth off its orbit. The OSI men must locate the element and then find a way to destroy before its to late.\n\nTHE MAGNETIC MONSTER is one of the best low budget films from the 1950&apos;s. The story is intelligent and the science at least seems authentic. Ivan Tors deserves praise for trying to make a serious, realistic science fiction film. This is probably his best. His other science fiction films and T.V. series &quot;Science Fiction Theater&quot; also aimed for this kind of realism, but they were often to talky and slow moving. This film moves at the right pace and builds up to an excellent climax.\n\nA few stray facts: Most of the special effects at the end were taken from the 1935 German science fiction film GOLD. This explains the outdated overcoat and fedora that Carlson wears at the the climax, to match the one worn by the German actor in the older film. Also Ivan Tors is said to have aped this films structure from the &quot;Dragnet&quot; TV series. The fictitious government agency The Office of Scientific Investigation turned up in Tors GOG (1954) and some episodes of &quot;Science Fiction Theater.&quot;"

But I know what Akira Kurosawa did in film, and I have more than a general sense of his style and his concerns - what makes a Kurosawa film identifiably Kurosawa.\n\nJohnnie To&apos;s tribute to Akira Kurosawa comes as a very splendid surprise. Not really a martial - arts film, this is the story of champion judo wrestler who, going blind, wallows in drink, gambling, petty theft and jazz (do these all go together?) Anyway, although the final 20 minutes of the film gets a little heavy, for the most part this is a humorous look at some Hong Kong low-lives, and how their redemption comes through the personal discipline necessary to learn judo. Even if you don&apos;t like judo, you will enjoy this film - very professionally crafted and acted.",

It is a far better film than Goetz&apos; own film adaptation (&quot;Frauenartz Dr. Prätorius&quot;, 1950, q.v.); enjoyable and well-made with good direction by Kurt Hoffmann, though - sadly perhaps - it is no improvement on the version Joeph L. Mankiewizc made in 1952: &quot;People Will Talk&quot;. Heinz Rühmann makes a good Prätorius that is different from Goetz&apos; own interpretation: more quite. Liselotte Pulver and Rühmann make a fine couple.\n\nWithin the career of Kurt Hoffmann the film is also proof that his once very personal style for light comedy is disappearing: it is very good routine but nothing more than that. But still, German cinema could be glad to still have a director who would be up to this kind of comedy.",

This did look like a crappy movie, therefore I did not want to see this flick. It looked like your typical teen movie and cheesy predictable plot.\n\nYeah, it had that, but I think in some strange way it offered more. I&apos;m just at least seeing something a little more in this flick. Yeah, it had your typical stereotypical teens, and you could predict everything that would happen in the next scene. But still I think in it&apos;s own special way, this will win teens over. I don&apos;t think this is a bad movie.

A refreshing change for a tamil movie along the lines of Kaakha Kaakha, but no where near.\n\nKalabhavan Mani has done a great job as usual. Srikanth has come across very well as an action hero. The army training camp scenes were realistic and well shot. Sneha has been wasted in this movie. She has shown her potential, but the story is made for Srikanth and he has benefited from it for sure. Others like Talaivaasal Vijay, Nagesh, etc are all surplus in this movie.\n\nAll in all...if you love action sequences, watch Bose. Otherwise.. just listen to the songs on Raaga."

      "reviewBody": "A true story of almost documentary character telling the terrible story of some of those Berliners who refused to leave the city in the war in spite of all the odds against their survival if they stayed. It&apos;s the story of a countess studying to become a vet who gets involved with the son of the first Jew who became a judge in Germany, a veteran of the first world war, so the son was brought up to be a German, not a Jew, but of course that meant nothing to the Nazi government and the Gestapo, and things really started to look grim when the war broke out on the precise day when the countess enrolled in the university. She is played by Jacqueline Bisset who is always a success when it comes to roles of great integrity, and this performance is a virtuoso piece in all its simple and straightforward honesty. The man is played by Jürgen Prochnow, who is a good match for her, although she has to keep him out of her underground involvements, which he of course finds difficult. His mother (Irene Worth), with whom he stays at first, also refuses to leave Berlin and is later brought to Theresienstadt. The title of the book on which the film is based is &quot;The Last Jews of Berlin&quot; which tells exactly what it is all about. There are many authentic documentary cuts illustrating the ordeal and destruction of Berlin and the Berliners, so the film coudln&apos;t be more convincing. It is a gripping tale and the more gripping and important for being all true.",

      "reviewBody": "Well i grew up in the communist Czechoslovakia and here are some fact to explain the movie. I hope it will help you to understand the movie.\n\nBony = special currency used only in special stores called Tuzex, which featured consumer products from wester countries. Thats why all the crooks (aka. Vekslaci) stand in front of the Tuzex store. \n\nKlid = peace of mind ... \n\nVekslaci (plural) Vekslak (singular) = from German word Wechsel meaning to exchange currency (i think) ... &quot;hustlers&quot; dealing with foreign currency ... which was illegal in communist Czechoslovakia. Sometimes they went really big and became a real mafia with corrupt officials working for them, see character Karel how he&apos;s chatting with his friend, a judge.\n\nFew facts about the planned communist economy:\n\n1. Czechoslovak citizen were forbidden to own large amounts of foreign currency while in the country. If foreign currency was brought to a bank it was exchanged for Crowns or Bony. It was necessary to exchange foreign currency to obtain Bony. Since Tuzex store were accepting only Bony, they were extremely desirable thing to own and a whole criminal circle of gangs developed around it.\n\n2. At the time of the filming, Radek John&apos;s salary was 1800Kcs (or Crowns), about 22000 a year. A hard working Vekslak could make even 1-2 million Crowns. Quite a difference. \n\n3. Phase one of the deal: Vekslak went on a bus full of foreign tourists and exchanged Czechoslovak Crowns for some foreign currency. Phase Two: Vekslak changed the currency in a bank for some Bony. Phase Three: Vekslak was selling Bony in front of Tuzex at a high rate. Or they were also offering foreign currency if someone wanted, and therefore skipping phase two.\n\n4. Tuzex store functioned this way: Communists did goods exchange with western countries, for example, Semtex explosives for Lego toys or Swiss watches ... etc. Comunists kept the foreign currency and top officials had luxurious villas and cars that they kept in Switzerland and other countries.\n\n5. The top Czechoslovak exports were: Weapons and Semtex explosives. Most common goods in Tuzex were: Brand name Jeans (especially Levi&apos;s and Wrangler), Watches, Lego, and fine cognacs and sweets ... as far as i remember. That&apos;s why Vekslaci all wore Levi&apos;s, swiss watches. \n\n6. Vekslaci sometimes started to bring foreign goods such as Porno videos and some electronics that was impossible to get even at Tuzex stores.\n\n7. Film Bony and Klid was banned by communist party, however someone somehow got hold of a film played it ones in a movie theater and made a Video screener out of it before the film was locked for good. The movie became a hit on the black market and was selling for even 500 Crowns. A year later the communist party officially released the movie in the movie theaters, since they knew that it is already out on the street."

It speaks volumes that Mr. Radford achieves a triumph with a film that for all practical purposes should have been directed by an Italian. This is a timeless story of friendship, poetry and love set in a desolated island that was to be Pablo Neruda&apos;s home in exile.\n\nThe story is a simple one. Mario Ruoppolo, a poor man without a job, suddenly applies for a vacant position that will pay almost nothing, but by becoming a letter carrier he gets the chance of meeting a man that will make a deep impression on him and who will change his life completely.\n\nMario, the postman, is almost illiterate. He can read and write, with only the basic knowledge he probably picked up in the island school. He is allergic to fishing, and can&apos;t make a living like his father, and probably most of his ancestors before him. It&apos;s the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat.\n\nPablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island, Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo.\n\nThe film&apos;s mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice.\n\nThis is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi, who as Mario, completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret, is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice, the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti, play minor roles with success.\n\n&quot;Il Postino&quot; is helped by the magnificent cinematography of Franco di Giacomo who captures the island in all its splendor. The music score is another asset. Luis Bacalov&apos;s tuneful background music adds another layer in this film rich texture. \n\nThis film is an excellent way to be introduced to Pablo Neruda&apos;s poetry, even if it&apos;s only for the curiosity the film will give even a casual viewer. Thanks to Michael Radford for a poetic view of this lonely place where two people meet and are changed forever.",

      "reviewBody": "VeggieTales is my favorite cartoon, even though I am 24 years old. The Star of Christmas is the 2nd Christmas special they did, after The Toy That Saved Christmas. My favorite of the holiday bunch is the next one, Saint Nicholas, but for the ones that center on the meaning of Christmas, this is the best one.\n\nSet in 1880s London, 2 playwrights named Cavis and Millward (played by Bob and Larry) have 3 days to prepare for their play that supposedly teaches the true meaning of love.\n\nThey expect the Prince to come to see the show, since he is also London&apos;s biggest theater critic, however, the local church plans to do a Nativity pageant the same night, which will display The Star of Christmas, a rare artifact that hasn&apos;t been displayed in about 80 years.\n\nSince the Prince only wants to go to the pageant for The Star, Cavis schemes to steal The Star of Christmas.\n\nThe Star of Christmas is one of the few &quot;serious&quot; episodes of VeggieTales, which makes for some effective drama. For example, there is a scene where Cavis and Millward meet a prisoner named Charles Pincher, who doesn&apos;t think you can teach a man to love- &quot;it&apos;s not in his nature.&quot; The Pastor and his son prove otherwise right after.\n\nDespite it being more serious, it&apos;s still very funny. In fact, this is also one of the funniest VeggieTales videos. Some of the comedy comes from quick lines. For example, when Cavis tells Millward that he has something that their audience has never seen before. Millward immediately asks excitedly: &quot;You&apos;ve got a monkey that can yodel?&quot; (No, it&apos;s electric lights.)\n\nAlso, one of my closest friends watched this with me one time, and he pointed out that Cavis and Millward&apos;s play is the story of Mario saving Princess Peach. When he mentioned that, I told him: &quot;You just made this episode 100 times better!&quot;\n\nApart from that, there are 2 funny action scenes, one in the middle when Cavis and Millward are chased by a church member when he catches them stealing the star. Another comes later when Cavis, Millward, The Pastor, and his son use a rocket car to get to the church on time.\n\nIn fact, that line gives me a childhood memory. Before Millward drives off in the rocket car, he says:&quot;We&apos;ve got to make it to the church on time!&quot; As a little kid, if we were running late for church, I&apos;d say that before we drove off.\n\nThere&apos;s also some good music in the movie. My favorite is a song from the musical called Plugged Up Love. You can look that up on YouTube. Also, Lisa Vischer, who voices the Pastor&apos;s son, sings O Come, O Come Emmanuel in the credits- it&apos;s a lovely rendition.\n\nAll VeggieTales videos have a moral, and this one is the true meaning of love. Cavis makes his play to show what romantic love is. The Pastor&apos;s play shows Cavis what true love is. God sent Jesus for us to die for our sins- that&apos;s sacrificial love, something way stronger than infatuation.\n\nJesus once said: &quot;There is no greater love than this- than to lay one&apos;s life for his friends.&quot; (John 15:13). That is what Cavis realizes when he sees the church kids perform the story of Jesus&apos;s birth.\n\nWith its great humor, drama, songs, and message, it is without doubt that I call The Star of Christmas one of the best VeggieTales videos. While it&apos;s great for any time of the year, it&apos;s one of the very best specials you can watch in December. I&apos;ll take this over Frosty or Rudolph any day of the week, any day of the year.",

While sitting through this film, I had a distinct feeling that it was intended for the typical &quot;international film festival&quot; audience.\n\nThis film is designed to be minimalistic, so minimalistic, that it can be adopted to any demographic group with minimal effort. The result are dialogs without nuance, characters without identity, and a film without depth. For this reason, everything became very repetitive and stagnant; sitting through this film became a chore.\n\nAfter the film, the filmmaker was invited to answer some questions from the audience. He made some interesting points, such as the incidental music, that was play on-the-spot by a pianist, and the process of making this film. But I did not think the film was groundbreaking, entertaining, or thought-provoking as some of the audience would believe.\n\nBut, most interestingly, I would never thought that there is a niche for such kind of films, let alone a market.",

      "name": "One of the most authentic depictions of contemporary Bavaria (despite being almost 50 years old)",
      "reviewBody": "Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern&quot; is wonderfully shot and acted, and needs not to shy from comparisons to other contemporary works, just to mention Werner Herzogs or Herbert Achternbuschs films, which often take place in a similar environment. But rather than discussing the film and its qualities, I would like to discuss the social and cultural implications. Much has been said about Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern&quot; being a metaphor for the fascism under the Third Reich, the butchering of the &quot;unwanted&quot; in the concentration camps, etc. All this is true and intended by the director, but if you take those metaphors and allegories away, you&apos;d still have a very precise portrayal of rural live in the Bavarian countryside.\n\nIf you want to compare Bavaria to Germany, you could think of Italy and the difference between Milano and a Sicilian hamlet. Or think about the States and the &quot;cultural&quot; differences between Boston and an Appalachian mountain-village, you should get the point.\n\nIf you should ever visit Germany, going south and crossing the &quot;Weißwurstäquator&quot; (or &quot;White-Sausage-equator&quot;, an imaginary border that divides Bavaria from the rest of Germany), you&apos;ll notice that you&apos;re indeed in another country. Cuisine, language, fashion, indeed, physically things are very different in the free-state. People in those areas are proud to be the most traditional (if not tribal) of all German states or &quot;down to earth&quot;, as they frequently put it. Bavarians from the small villages and hamlets will often joke, that the Autobahn is the only reason that saved those villages from degenerative inbreeding and refer to any outsiders / non-Bavarians as &quot;Prussians&quot;. Bavarians will often declare that they are a monarchy (despite the last king having been declared insane and committed suicide more than a hundred years ago). They&apos;ll likely point out that Bavaria is a free-state, which is correct, albeit purely symbolic and without political consequences. This is meant as a tongue-in-cheek joke, usually told with a wink of the eye. But once you&apos;ve spent more time in those parts, you&apos;ll notice that the joke only paper-thin and that, yes, these people actually mean it.\n\nThe film (and the play upon which it is based) also refers to the Bavarian tradition of &quot;Haberfeldtreiben&quot;, which is a symbolic lynching: during those occasions, the mob (generally the whole village) will gather in front of the house of an undesired person, usually people who have broken a taboo or against the moral standards of the village (unmarried mothers, liberals, often intellectuals or the rich; in more recent times, homosexuals and people afflicted with AIDS). The villagers would recite the &quot;crimes&quot; of the target, sometimes in the forms of rhymes and accompany the recitals by making as much noise as possible. Unlike in a real trial, the &quot;delinquents&quot; are not given the chance to justify or defend themselves. Bavarians are quick to point out that, other than to the dignity of the &quot;offender&quot;, no physical damage is done during the &quot;Haberfeldtreiben&quot; – which is only partly true, since there have been many such events recorded which ended in violence, lynching and death. The last officially reported &quot;Haberfeldtreiben&quot; took place in 2009.\n\nIn essence, &quot;Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern&quot; is a look at an archaic culture, deeply rooted in the 18th and 19th century, which in many ways is backward, stuck in outdated ways of thinking and very proud of it. Needless to say that there was much outrage in the south when this film was released. People were quick to point out, that director Fleischmann depicted most of the villagers as stereotypical – which is perhaps true but not to much the fault of the director as the fault of the stereotypes themselves. In other words: it wasn&apos;t the dignified outrage of people who felt that they were being lampooned unjustified, but rather the outrage of people who were shown a mirror and weren&apos;t comfortable with the reflection.\n\nAs for the film: it is a piece of art and highly recommendable to anybody who wishes to look a little deeper into the Bavarian psyche, beyond tourist-attractions like the castles of King Ludwig II and the bucket-sized beer-mugs at the Oktoberfest.\n\n7/10",

His comment &quot;Alles hat sein tiefen Sinn&quot; is &quot;goldich&quot; 2. When a sniper shoots his pipe from his mouth, and Schwejk shouts to the effect &quot;You might have killed someone!&quot; 3. When he arranges with his friend to meet at &quot;half-past six after the war&quot;. The whole film has me curled up laughing, although the anti-war moral is quite serious."

The reds really are redder than anywhere else. They are often surrounded by muddy browns and greys and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it was an inspiration for Michelangelo Antonioni&apos;s Il deserto rosso. The set designs are simply stunning, and the street fighting scenes (in Son) are probably the best of all times.\n\nIt is really curious how dismally the film fails in its message  at least for a present day viewer, but I doubt that the people in the mid fifties felt much different. Communist leader Ernst Thälmann, called Teddy, does not come through as a charismatic leader but rather as a stiff, uninspired bureaucrat. No attempt was made to give him a human touch (and his looks didn&apos;t help either...) As to his leadership qualities  even in this heavily doctored retelling of the events leading up to the takeover of the ruthlessly totalitarian Nazis, Thälmann appears as a political powerbroker who clearly misjudged the situation and shares the responsibility for the Nazi electoral success in 1933.\n\nThälmann is presented as a strangely bloodless martyr to the Communist cause. As he sits in prison awaiting his execution (Stalin reportedly was not eager to help even when he was quite friendly with the Nazis), he literally becomes a flag that is first handed to the Thälmann brigade in the Spanish civil war (they lose) and then to a detachment of Soviet tanks named after him. In the final sequence Thälmann fuses with the red flag on his way to the gallows, the viewers are spared the final humiliating scene.\n\nDespite all the shortcomings I can recommend the two Tälmann movies  especially to film buffs who are interested in the deliberate use of color. The aesthetic is not unlike the one used in those beautiful Powell/Pressburger movies like Col Blimp. And there is a beautiful love story between Fietke Jansen (who calls himself a pupil of Thälmann&apos;, whatever that may mean) and his wife Ännchen. The great performances of Hans-Peter Minetti and Karla Runkehl are really touching  it hasn&apos;t anything to do with Communism and shows clearly that love transcends ideology. You somehow get the impression, that here was one of the few emotional emergency outlets for the many talented artists who worked for that oppressive system."

Rani as usual sizzles and Abhi gives a fairly OK performance. Amitabh is not in his element except for the dance sequence &quot;kajrare&quot;. Somewhat his performance can be termed as overacting. This man ( Amitabh ) is overworked and his age shows. He is burning at both ends. It is high time he slows down a bit. \n\nAnd now the piece de resistance of the movie : That is the music. The music is very good and all the songs are quite hummable. The music is quite experimental and unique.\n\nThe story is plagiarized from a number of Hollywood movies, chief of which is &quot;Catch me if you can&quot;. The plot is not detailed enough . For example the way the duo ( Rani and Abhi )dupe their victims , seems childish and there are many gaps in their schemes. But anyway the viewer can take all this in his stride, for after all this is a Bollywood movie and they are notoriously not meant to be perfect in their plots.\n\nAll in all a passable fare..",

      "reviewBody": "I had read about and seen stills from this movie for years. I had heard how freaky and bloody and scary this movie&apos;s vision of hell was, but I never got a chance to actually see it. Finally I was able to secure a copy and I sat down to watch the horror.\n\nFor the first hour of this film we watch as our hero lives a life that is more or less a living hell. More horrible, terrible things befall him and those around him than anyone outside of a soap opera has a right to expect. Very act is bound to damn someone to hell and it isn&apos;t long before our guilt ridden hero crosses over and experiences what true torment is. Its enough to make you want to laugh were it not played so painfully straight.\n\nWhat we see once we get to  Hell itself looks great. Even some 40 years after it first marched across theater some of the shots of flayed flesh and disemboweled intestines are still shocking. The cramped and dark vistas are something out of a nightmare. Many tormented images you&apos;d almost be proud to have on your walls.\n\nIs it scary a bit but its not the be all and end all that some had made it out to be.  Then again the films images have been raided by others so it less shocking. I also find that some of the pacing is off and what may have once worked now borders on tedious.\n\nThe film seems to be saying that all life, here or in the next world is miserable hellish  and that no matter what we do we&apos;re doomed simply to suffer. A happy little film if there ever was one.\n\nI like the film but far from love it. The first part is very soapy and over blown, while the second is almost a catalog of horrors. I give it points for trying but I don&apos;t think it completely works.\n\nShould you see it?\n\nA coin toss. It really depends on what you&apos;re looking for. If you&apos;re looking, for gore and guts, its here but not enough to make you walk away happy. Are you looking for a meditation on sin, guilt and existence, you may like it, especially if you can get past the soap. If you want to see a technically well made film that doesn&apos;t quite work but influenced later films and which will provide some discussion over dinner, then try it.\n\nI give it 7 out of 10 for the parts more than the whole.",

      "reviewBody": "Admittedly, DEMONLOVER makes a sharp left narrative turn at the halfway point that&apos;s going to confound viewers who are intrigued by the straightforward (and extremely absorbing) high-stakes opening.  But that&apos;s no reason to dismiss the many, many things that writer/director Olivier Assayas gets absolutely right.  In the end, DEMONLOVER is a fascinating mirror-world reflection (as William Gibson would call it) of where our global society might be just five minutes from now:  the fittest who survive will be multilingual, career-consumed and ridiculously chic, but also soulless, as if missing the gene that supplies a sense of loyalty and ethics.  The movie is a cautionary, though entirely plausible, tale of humans debased by their own lust for ungoverned capitalism.  Every line of dialogue is about the business merger at hand; in the rare instances where feelings are discussed, they&apos;re usually about how *work* affects those emotions.  The big wink here is that the characters don&apos;t even discuss business honestly, because each has duplicitous motives.\n\nTechnically, DEMONLOVER is a feast.  Denis Lenoir&apos;s widescreen photography constantly dazzles -- many of the tracking shots are sustained in close-up (creating paranoia), and the color spectrum appears as if filtered through corporate fluorescence.  (The neon-drenched Tokyo sequence is particularly hypnotic.)  Jump cuts keep the narrative one step ahead of the audience. Sonic Youth&apos;s atonal guitar score creates the same mutant environment that Howard Shore pulled off in CRASH.  Most significantly, Connie Nielsen&apos;s face (and hair and wardrobe) mesmerizes more than any CGI I&apos;ve ever seen. Considering the labyrinthine motives of her character, Nielsen&apos;s exquisite subtlety may be lost on first-time viewers; on second look, her emotionless gaze speaks volumes.\n\nAudiences (and critics) have unanimously attacked the `problematic&apos; second half as an example of directorial self-indulgence.  While I agree that it&apos;s not as satisfying as the first half, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a total crash-and-burn (pardon the pun).  Clearly, the ending is open to thematic interpretation, but I think Assayas is just saying that if our species isn&apos;t more careful, we&apos;ll end up like one-dimensional characters in a video game of our own devising - sure, winner takes all, but the rest of us suffer enormously.\n\nNarrative ambiguity aside, DEMONLOVER is the great Hitchcockian/Cronenbergian espionage fantasia I&apos;ve been waiting for.  It makes sense that it would come from Europe, since Hollywood forgot long ago how to make their assembly-line genre exercises intellectually stimulating.  (Like the animé porn within the story, Hollywood movies today represent no more than a calculated corporate commodity.)  More than any other film from the last 2½ years, DEMONLOVER seems a product of the post-9/11 world - a not-so-distant future where overwhelming paranoia goads us to preemptively eliminate any form of potential competition before it can do the same to us.  And how in doing so, we devour our own tail.\n\nI expect this movie&apos;s reputation will grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Operation Undercover",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Wo Hu&quot; literally translates to &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; (yeah yeah, one half of that famous Chinese proverb/movie of the same title), which refers to hidden talents, agendas and the likes. In yet another Hong Kong triad movie produced by the infamous Wong Jing, Operation Undercover (the less stylish English title) tells the story of how Hong Kong&apos;s police sent a rumoured thousand undercover cops to infiltrate the triads at all levels, leading to numerous high profiled arrests of triad members.\n\nBut no, this story doesn&apos;t begin and end just like that. It&apos;s actually a misnomer of a plot device, and you&apos;re not going to see thousands of similar Tony Leung/Andy Lau characters invading the screen. In fact, this movie is anything but pitting mole against mole. While the story may seem to be familiar, with the theme of the discovery and realization of bad hats in any organization, and those whose hearts and intentions are pure, the delivery, although stylistically looking similar to Infernal Affairs with its strained blue hues, actually excelled, very much dependent on the ensemble cast.\n\nIt&apos;s great to see Miu Kiu Wai back on the big screen after a long hiatus. In fact, this film had a number of actors whom we haven&apos;t seen for a while. With Wai playing a police superintendent, the rest make up the triads. I haven&apos;t seen Julian Cheung take on a bad guy role before, even though his scheming character here is nothing to shout about. Regular insane character actor Francis Ng returns to his mould, although his performance here surpassed the recent Exiled and On the Edge. A welcome return is Jordan Chan, famed for his dynamic pairing with Ekin Cheng in the Young and Dangerous franchise, playing a hen- pecked and muddled gangster chief, and rounding up the triad organization at the top, is Eric Tsang, probably in a role we&apos;re so familiar with given his Infernal Affairs connection. Shawn Yue cameos too as an assassin with few words.\n\nGiven the slew of movies in the same genre, you might balk at this one, given the low level publicity muscle, and probable thoughts of it emulating Election or Infernal Affairs. But the filmmakers perhaps realized the inevitable comparisons, and have early in the movie, given subtle jibes at those other movies, as a reminder that hey, we&apos;re from the same genre, but we&apos;re not emulating anyone, although the themes and plots might be threading the same ground. It doesn&apos;t take the typical microscopic look at the life of undercovers, but adopts a macroscopic view instead. Suggestions were provided as to how undercover cops lead their lives, and how much license they are given to walk on the wrong side of the law. Sadly this potentially interesting aspect wasn&apos;t looked into much, and came more of an afterthought following a surprising revelation.\n\nThe usual scheming and double crossings surface rather fast and furious in the second half of the movie, and it&apos;s quite puzzling to wonder why a bit part mushy romance was thrown in to upset the pace. While the subplot might be used to gain some sympathy for the characters involved, it could have been a darker film should this aspect not be explored, and it&apos;s quite unnecessary at times. My guess would be actually for the actress to make some kind of debut performance and sharing the credits with a rather stellar cast. Or perhaps to highlight the point again that some gangsters do have hearts (of gold) as well.\n\nThe finale, if wrapped up earlier, could have made the movie feel more compact and satisfying. However, it chose to end abruptly, and leaving things so open, there is room for a possible sequel. I won&apos;t hold my breath for that to happen though.",

      "reviewBody": "Argo interested me not only because it was rather breathlessly discussed by critics when it came to &quot;best film of 2012&quot; time, but also because it was a true story that I knew nothing about – from detail to the ending it was all news to me. Watching it I still took it with a pinch of salt simply because I think it is wrong to approach any fictionalized version of a true story and assume that it is entirely gospel. The film walks a fine line between the dramatic and the absurd, almost to the point where if you left the cinema during one scene and then returned during another, you would be forgiven for thinking you&apos;d come back into the wrong screen. It does this but yet it mostly pulls it off.\n\nThe film opens with an American embassy in Iran being stormed and the majority of people taken hostage, except a small group who flee to the home of the Canadian Ambassador and are hidden. The story is then about the extradition of this small group, before the Iranians work out that they are missing and hunt them down; with options limited, the plan is to send an agent into Iran posing as someone scouting for locations for a movie – and then leave the country with the small group acting as his colleagues and peers. This involves doing more than saying it out loud as it has to pass muster with the Iranians – so the CIA works with a Hollywood writer and a producer to greenlight a film, sell it to the press and take their small production into Iran. In telling the story the film pretty much plays it straight and allows the scenario to be whatever it is – so when it is a press junket then it is amusingly absurd but while it is in an Iranian airport it is really tense and the stakes are apparent. This approach works pretty well because it lets the film have these extremes alongside one another without one undercutting the other. The downside is that it does occasionally mean that the telling feels quite &quot;ordinary&quot; as it lacks an individual voice to the delivery – not boring by any means, but just surprisingly straight in the telling.\n\nThis can be seen in the cast because mostly there are not really characters here, since the film focuses on events and doesn&apos;t leave a lot of time for the people (understandably). Affleck doesn&apos;t really work in the lead and I&apos;m not sure why he cast him; he is OK but his presence is not all it needed to be in such a straight film. The various hostages in Iran don&apos;t really make an impression beyond them being just that, but there is color provided by solid turns from Goodman, Cranston, Arkin and a few others. As director Affleck does a good job to make the mix of content work so well, but the real credit to the production is how of the period it feels – there is nothing that really seems out of place, from office to street it feels like it was filmed back in the late 70s.\n\nArgo is an effective and engaging story that works partly because the telling is straight enough to let the events be however they are (absurd, tense, whatever). However this straight bat does also limit the film by making it feel a little ordinary in the delivery, without much flair or individual style to the telling, even if the attention to period is really well done."

      "reviewBody": "Most of us, at the end of the 20th century, know Robert DeNiro as an actor who has portrayed countless tough guys onscreen, in movies such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, and even up to Ronin. But before Bobby was cast (and cast and cast and cast)as Hollywood&apos;s chief badfella, he co-starred in this adaptation of a novel by Mark Harris as a simpleton baseball catcher who may be dying.\n\nMany people feel that playing a sick or handicapped character is relatively easy for an actor, but in truth there&apos;s more to acting than simply limping or slurring one&apos;s speech. DeNiro&apos;s character, we learn early on, is dying - just when his chances of sticking with the big club are tenuous at best. His best friend is played by Michael Moriarty, whose character is a seasoned, talented pitcher. Moriarty learns of DeNiro&apos;s fate during an off season, and decides to do all he can to help his friend, to make what life he has left a pleasant one.\n\nBoth actors turn in magnificent performances, but you can&apos;t beat this film for an excellent foretelling of a major talent. By 1973, DeNiro had acted in a few movies (including a couple from his once and future director, Brian DePalma), but it was his astounding work in this film that really put him on the map. His Bruce Pearson isn&apos;t just a simpleton for whom the audience is supposed to feel a truckload of sympathy - there are many television movies that do just that - he&apos;s a multilayered person. DeNiro squeezes more emotion out of a single sideways smile than many actors can do in their entire careers. What&apos;s more, even though you the viewer know what Pearson&apos;s fate is, you&apos;re no less pulling for him. \n\nCall this a tearjerker, and you&apos;d be correct. But ultimately, DeNiro&apos;s conviction and a solid script put this far above most other films of this genre.",

Kevin Kline, a fine actor, does what he can as Artemus Gordon, but seems to be recapitulating his &quot;In and Out&quot; persona (Ross Martin was never that prissy.) Kenneth Branagh, as the villain, plays it so far over the top you can&apos;t even see the top from where he his. Salma Hayek is undeniably lovely, but is wasted (she&apos;s basically an afterthought). Special effects are good, plot is stupid, script is awful. As a fan of the old series, I was very disappointed.",

I laughed from the beginning to the end. Of course I&apos;m very tempted to compare it to &quot;Les 3 frères&quot; done by the same people (Les Inconnus) and there, I&apos;ve got to say that it&apos;s not as good, because the first one really surprised everybody in the way they used their humor through a movie. This one is still the same humor, still as funny, a little more special effects and fantasy that add some more enjoyment without bringing sth really essential. The fact that it&apos;s based on a biblical story makes people see references here and there and interpretations that are really amusing. Well if u liked &quot;Les 3 Frères&quot; go see this movie, if u haven&apos;t well u might enjoy it even more since u won&apos;t know their humor and types of joke already. Oh, yeah, and the acting was pretty good too, especially from Virginie De Clausade (as Macha) which was the most attaching character. Lots of good feelings and laughter, a perfect pick for a family Christmas movie or for anybody who wants to laugh and have a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "Having just seen the brilliant SWORD OF DOOM by the same director, I was surprised to find that he directed this film also. This was shown, subtitled, at a Japanese sci-fi film festival at the Japan Society in New York City in the early 80&apos;s. It was on a double bill with a classic TOHO film.\n\nSet in present day Japan, the film postulates about how people would react if suddenly half the population was changed in a subtle way by mysterious UFOs. The UFOs appear and whom ever sees them has their blood permanently turned blue. This causes a mass panic where everyone is classified by their blood color and all the blues are cruelly discriminated against and eventually rounded up in concentration camps. In the midst of this, a romance blooms between a red and a blue played by the leads.\n\nThe UFOs only appear very briefly, most of the film is taken up by melodrama and illustrations of mass prejudice. It&apos;s an interesting concept and the director clearly does not have much faith in humanity. Unfortunately, by the time the very melodramatic conclusion arrives (and it takes a while) I didn&apos;t care anymore and most of the audience had left in boredom."

      "reviewBody": "There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston&apos;s light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure &quot;Friends&quot; persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie&apos;s wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she&apos;s unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother&apos;s pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah&apos;s paternity.\n\nAll the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy&apos;s blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah&apos;s family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb&apos;s 1963 novel, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols&apos; classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah&apos;s dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars&apos; ages.\n\nBeyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau&apos;s relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah&apos;s passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra.",

      "reviewBody": "Wes Cravens&apos; &quot;Shocker&quot; is often one of the more derided in the directors&apos; career, but in this own reviewers&apos; humble opinion, it still manages to be pretty entertaining, even as it gets awfully silly and keeps wavering between a serious, sombre tone and an insane, over the top one. It doesn&apos;t help that it&apos;s too obvious that Craven was trying to create another Freddy Krueger in the form of raving maniac Horace Pinker, a savage psychopath played to foaming-at-the-mouth perfection by Mitch Pileggi, eventually to become better known for playing Skinner on &apos;The X-Files&apos;.\n\nPinker&apos;s on the loose, slaughtering whole families, but opposing him is college football star Jonathan Parker (a remarkably sincere Peter Berg), a nice guy who was raised by a police lieutenant (Michael Murphy). Jonathan and Horace, who are connected in a way that the younger man doesn&apos;t anticipate, are also psychically linked, and Jonathan is able to give the cops his name and place of business and before too long the killer is caught and executed.\n\nBut the story doesn&apos;t end there, as Pinker, in league with Satan, &quot;survives&quot; the electric chair and lives on to overtake various unlucky people and control their bodies, including, in the movies&apos; most memorable sequence, a little girl. How can one hold in their laughter watching this blonde haired moppet curse like a sailor, and try to operate a bulldozer?\n\nUltimately, the movie is a little too absurd for its own good, but damn if it doesn&apos;t have some good atmosphere, show off some amusing ideas, and go overboard on the bloodshed. One particular murder scene is just drenched in the red stuff. One of the methods used to combat Horace is pure corn, involving Jonathans&apos; love for girlfriend Alison (Camille Cooper) and an all-important locket. The best stuff is the wonderfully ridiculous climax in which a rampaging Horace and Jonathan run amok through TV programming (they end up in an episode of &apos;Leave it to Beaver&apos; where Jonathan pleads for the Beavers&apos; help). This does show some invention, and the special effects are effectively cheesy. (One has to love the &quot;You got it, baby!&quot; moment.)\n\nThe cast is extremely game throughout this thing; also popping up are Ted Raimi as an assistant coach, Vincent Guastaferro (&quot;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&quot;) as a victimized cop, Heather Langenkamp in a tiny, non-speaking cameo as a murder victim, Richard Brooks (&apos;Law and Order&apos;) as football player Rhino, Ernie Lively as the warden, rock guitarist Kane Roberts also doing the cameo thing as a road worker, and Cravens&apos; kids Jessica and Jonathan in bits. The heavy metal soundtrack adds to the fun.\n\nOverall, this may not be something this reviewer would necessarily consider &quot;good&quot;, but it&apos;s still something of a hoot, and may keep some people watching out of sheer disbelief.\n\nSix out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Albert Pyun had a long career in dtv b-movies. Reading his bio you see words like &quot;award winning&quot; and a bunch of flowery praise being heaped upon the man. All the &quot;big names&quot; he worked with. The reality is most of the movies he did are cheap &amp; quite bad, but for years the consensus was you had to watch &apos;Mean Guns&apos; or &apos;Postmortem&apos; to see the best from him. So here I am.\n\nI guess when the bar is set so low ... when your previous efforts have been so poor there&apos;s nowhere to go but up. This is a fairly average hunt for a serial killer flick. The only thing it does to distinguish itself from its genre peers is being set in Scotland. Oh and a throwback to Charlie Sheen before his problems blew up in a very public manner playing a guy who&apos;s a wreck. Hindsight being 20/20 and such.\n\nMcGregor (Sheen) is a divorced American ex-cop, profiler and author laying low in Scotland after seeing too much death. He soaks his days away in booze, advil, cigarettes and takeout food. He&apos;s been living there six months and he&apos;s estranged from his son. When a dead body turns up outside his house he goes from suspect to helping the local police as the bodies continue to pile up.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing wrong with &apos;Postmortem&apos; on a deep level, but it&apos;s also lacking in real suspense or thrills. Going through the usual story motions in low budget fashion. Ivana Milicevic (Casino Royale) and Pyun regular Michael Halsey play police Inspectors.",

A beautiful film by Ann Hui about a Cantonese girl Hueyin (Maggie Cheung) trying to be friends with her Japanese mother. Hueyin goes to Japan with her mother and there they get to know their differences and eventually understand each other. I think they understood each other the most when her mother talked of the Sino-Japanese war to Hueyin and how she and her father met. To me that was the one of the most well-acted scenes in the film. The music went well with each sad and reminiscent scene in the film, which I guess was mostly what added the drama to it. I hope Ann Hui makes more good films like this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Herbie: Fully Loaded is just what I expected from this next installment of the famous Love Bug series. I am not sure how many there were (and I am too lazy to look), but I have seen them all. The same things I liked about the originals, I liked about this one. Same with the dislikes. I am able to suspend my disbelief only so far. However, I do realize this movie is mainly for KIDS and I am able to let go of it&apos;s obvious flaws. I did like how Herbie was animated just a bit to show his personality just a little more.\n\nRay Peyton Sr. (Michael Keaton) was a legendary racer and wants nothing more than his son Ray Peyton Jr. (Breckin Meyer) to be the &quot;Next Great Peyton&quot;. The only problem is that Jr. has a unique problem which causes him to crash for apparently no reason, even when no one else is around. The other thing is, Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) is the more gifted of Sr.&apos;s children.\n\nAfter Maggie ends up with Herbie, although she does not really want him at first, he takes it upon himself to take on the current racing legend, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), in a street race and beats him. This strikes a nerve with Trip who wants to ruin Herbie and his mysterious driver &quot;Max&quot;. Bet you can&apos;t figure out who Max is. Anyways, the racing scenes are very similar to the racing scenes of the past movies. I am not sure, but I believe the opening scenes were clips from past movies.\n\nMatt Dillon is excellent as the antagonist, as he usually is. He plays the egotistical Trip in quite the humorous way. Also, Lindsay Lohan was beautiful and perfect for the role. To be honest, I may not have seen Herbie if she was not starring in it. Also, Michael Keaton has visibly aged here and not in a very good way. Justin Long also puts in a fine performance as Kevin. Also, I did not even realize I was watching a &quot;G&quot; Rated movie. I am not sure when the last time I saw one of those was but it was refreshing to be able to look back at the movie I just saw and not be able to come up with anything questionable about it.\n\nIf you have seen any of the Herbie movies then you know whether or not you will like this one. Please don&apos;t be shocked if you have seen them and still choose to go see this movie. If you did not like it, then it is entirely your fault. Maybe movies are too complicated for someone like that to enjoy. 7/10"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Devils Ground&quot; is a fairly average slasher movie, though it has some resemblance to &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, without being a copy of either of those movies.\n\nWhat puzzled me was seeing Daryl Hannah appear as the first name in the movie, despite her role wasn&apos;t the lead role. But guess having a relatively known name like hers in the movie and flaunting it that way is the way to lure people in.\n\nAs for the story told in &quot;Devils Ground&quot;, then I thought it was actually good, and the plot managed to keep me hanging and wanting to see what would happen next. And there was a nice twist of storyline towards the end, and I for one, hadn&apos;t anticipated the story to take a turn like that. But it was a nice surprise nonetheless.\n\nThe cast in the movie was actually decent. I like Leah Gibsons portrayal of the role of Amy Singer, she was doing a good job with her character. And as usual, to me at least, it is always nice to see Daryl Hannah in a movie, I find her charismatic in a way. And Daniel Probert, in the role of Billy, was also really well cast, and he brought a lot of color to that role, and he played it quite well. I think it was somewhat of a shame that Twan Holliday&apos;s character Jimmy wasn&apos;t given more screen time than he had, because his character could have added a lot to the story. And Twan Holliday has a really distinct voice.\n\nFor a slasher movie, &quot;Devils Ground&quot; doesn&apos;t offer lots of blood and gore, but it has just enough killing to make it interesting. There was just the right amount of blood and mayhem to keep you lured in, so that worked well enough. However, being a slasher movie, I don&apos;t think that &quot;Devils Ground&quot; has enough impact to make a lasting impression, unless you are a fan of someone in the movie. It just lacks something to make it stand out, unfortunately. Then again, it has a really nice surprise twist to it, which many other slasher movies lacks.\n\nI like horror movies, and I personally think that &quot;Devils Ground&quot; was actually a good enough entry to the horror genre, just a shame that it failed to leave a lasting impression.",

The mainstream movies here benefit heavily from financial government support. Mainstream movies here have average scenarios at best, and most of the time the acting is theatrical when it&apos;s not sub par. Even with some of the best paid actors here in the french province. Probably it&apos;s all under the influence of a group of people who don&apos;t really care about passion and quality.\n\nNot so with this particular picture. Compared with the rest of the local productions, this film is pure bliss. Actually, without being partisan, this picture reminds of one of the best Quebec&apos;s directors, Robert Lepage. He also has a role in the film. Actually, Lepage is a genius born at the wrong place where he doesn&apos;t receive the deserved recognition. Will Martin Villeneuve be luckier?",

The feature film, based on the graphic novels of the same name published by Sid Lee and la Pasteque, is written, produced and directed by Martin Villeneuve. Almost entirely shot on green screen, Villeneuve&apos;s striking feature film debut has a significant amount of visual effects. Belgian comic book artist Francois Schuiten (&quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;) is the production designer, former ILM Senior Compositor Carlos Monzon (&quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;) worked as VFX supervisor, and Oscar-nominated Benoit Charest (&quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot;) composed the original score. The film was financed by Telefilm Canada, SODEC, Les Productions du 8e Art and the Harold Greenberg Fund, and is distributed in Canada by Alliance Vivafilm. &quot;Mars et Avril&quot; is produced by Martin Villeneuve, Benoit Beaulieu and Anne-Marie Gelinas for Mars et Avril Inc. Executive producers are Robert Lepage and Lynda Beaulieu for Les Productions du 8e Art, as well as Pierre Even and Marie-Claude Poulin for Item 7.\n\n&quot;A trippy science fiction fable about the musicality of the universe that&apos;s set in Montreal and on the Red Planet, the sumptuously designed &apos;Mars et Avril&apos; is certainly one of a kind.&quot; - Boyd van Hoeij, Variety",

Nora Ephron&apos;s writing is sharp and VERY funny, and the perfect cast delivers the dialogue with flawless timing. I own it on DVD, and will almost invariably turn to it for at least a couple of minutes when I see it in the TV schedule. There are so many priceless moments that I can&apos;t pick out one to highlight; most of them are subtler and funnier than the famous Simulated Orgasm scene. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are perfect in their supporting roles, and Rob Reiner&apos;s direction couldn&apos;t be better. I&apos;m afraid that I&apos;m doing nothing but gushing in this review, but great is great, and it&apos;s hard to say anything else.",

Trude Herr has a cameo-like, delightful part and brings one of her own very good songs.\n\nOf course, as this is a typical Conny &amp; Peter vehicle and thus for fans only, personal taste is of interest here. And I have always loved Conny Froboess (I hate Peter Kraus, but in this film he is not as offensive as in others).",

I can&apos;t even remember how I came across hearing of the film, I think I was just browsing the net one day and saw the name &apos;Bob Gale&apos; attached.\n\nI&apos;m a huge fan of the BTTF series, and pretty much appreciate all works done by cast and crew of the series in other titles. Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Christopher Lloyd, and the great MJF to name a few! So how come I&apos;d never heard of this film &apos;Interstate 60&apos;, as it contains 3 of the 4 aforementioned magical ingredients (albeit the 2 actors in secondary roles).\n\nIntrigued, I set about attempting to obtain the movie, which proved more painstaking than trying to remove barbed wire from your rear end.\n\nNowhere in the UK has it or had even heard of it, there was no cinema release, no straight-to-video, nothing. Not even big Brit name Gary Oldman (who appears for his fair share in the film), or legend Kurt Russell seemed to have secured its distribution.\n\nAnyway, to the film, I think it has to be seen to be appreciated, I rate the plot quite well, with its quirky and surreal sense of humour. The direction and camera work are fantastic (albeit a little rough around the edges) for a low-end budget film, and is something Bob Gale should be proud of for his first outing as a director. The narrative element from BTTF, using the main character as eyes and ears for the audience is again used to good effect, and is once again an engrossing way to tell the story in &apos;Interstate 60&apos;.\n\nPerhaps big distributors felt that the film was too odd, or strange to merit a push for release, which is a shame, as it&apos;s a hidden gem and well worth shipping over international waters anywhere. Strangely enough, it seems as though its one of the only films amazon will ship over to another country (so maybe they know its true value).\n\nIf your at all interesting or intrigued as I first was, then you should definitely attempt to get hold of the film while its still about.",

I was taken aback at how well it has held up to the test of cinematic time. Melodrama, to be sure! Offbeat, yes a little. But when all is said and done the performances of Ellen Burstyn and the great Eva La Gallienne stun! Many films have visited this subject matter, but none with the emotional impact that we recieve from the climax of RESURRECTION. The last scene is worth the view."

      "reviewBody": "Marc Barenberg (Benno Furmann, with intense steely blue eyes reminiscent of Daniel Craig) is a 30-something father of young (10-ish) Tyll (Henry Strange), from whom he&apos;s been estranged since his marriage broke up. A photographer, Marc takes Tyll out on assignment with him, to find and photograph quaint Bavarian folkways; together, the bored Tyll and exasperated Marc find the village of Kaifeck, which holds an annual festival between Christmas and Epiphany, during which villagers dress up as monsters and chase the devil away for another year. An ideal setting for Marc&apos;s assignment, and Tyll finds the tales of the monsters very interesting too; soon, they are set up in a converted barn that intrepid villager Juliana (Alexandra Maria Lara) has renovated as a guest house, although her mother Alma (Erni Mangold) disapproves and ancient grandmother Martha (Monika Hansen) seems unsure about the whole scheme - but not about Marc, when she sees him; &quot;I knew you&apos;d come,&quot; she croons, stroking his face. Once settled in, Marc starts having discomforting nightmares about a farmhouse in the woods that surround the village - a farmhouse now deserted and crumbling, but once the scene of a vile mass murder of an entire family 80 years previously, the perpetrator having never been found and the skulls of the victims having mysteriously vanished. Rumour has it that among the dead is a small baby, the product of incest between the father and eldest daughter of the clan, but that has never been proved....\n\nWhy is Marc having these dreams about this ancient evil? More, why is he waking up to find himself at the abandoned farmhouse? What do the villagers know that they&apos;re not telling him? Why does Martha seem so familiar to him, and why is he so worried that young Tyll might be in danger in this place? The answers to all of those questions lie squarely in the past, a past that refuses to stay buried....\n\nI had a few problems with this film, but first the good stuff: the acting is very strong (especially Furmann in the lead role, I quite believed his growing paranoia and determination) and the film is wonderfully atmospheric - it being winter in Bavaria, there&apos;s no snow on the ground, but plenty of fog rolling in, and loads of bare woods that seem trackless and threatening without doing anything more than existing. But the Big Reveal - which I won&apos;t give away here - was just a tad unbelievable to me, and without believing in that particular piece of information, the film loses its cohesion. It&apos;s a very spare film, barely 86 minutes long, which means there&apos;s no filler, but the last 20 minutes or so just strained my credulity to the point where I can&apos;t quite give this a whole-hearted recommendation. Definitely a work of art in terms of atmosphere and setting, but for me the story needed one more rewrite to make the ending work.",

This means action and suspense are replaced by &quot;auteur&quot; posturing and pretentious dialogue, mixed here with the same corny special effects and settings you can see in all the Italian Mad Max 2 - wannabes. Expatriate American director Robert Kramer, normally an appreciated moviemaker, here totally loses control of his film. Putrid dialogue, lackluster performances from a usually talented cast and a completely preposterous and incoherent plot make up for an ultra-camp movie experience. Whenever the french tried to do &quot;science-fiction&quot; or &quot;fantasy&quot;, the result turned out to be a disaster, and this movie is no exception.",

The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film?

      "reviewBody": "It would be pretty surprising if Quiz Show, Robert Redford&apos;s film about the 1950&apos;s quiz show scandals was anything short of excellent.  The principal actors give phenomenal performances:  Fiennes&apos; Van Doren is usually unflappable and cold, but manages to allow vulnerability to surface at times, and Turturro&apos;s Stempel is a study in almost sociopathic and manic behavior.  What allows both actors to transcend mere greatness is their ability to make the viewer both admire and detest their characters with something as subtle as a glance or body language.  Morrow&apos;s character of the `whistle-blower&apos; is there as the moral fiber; the outsider who looks upon the situation both with objectivity and as the devil&apos;s advocate. \n\n Redford&apos;s direction is rich and well-paced.  There were not any slow moments in the film, and he did not have to adhere to rapid-fire editing to achieve the momentum of the film.  Perhaps the subject matter is a factor, but I have found that with the exception of `Ordinary People&apos;, the films I have seen under Redford&apos;s direction have been good in a technical respect but lean toward the maudlin.  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions. \n\nQuiz Show is an excellent film that I highly recommend, especially to see the razor-sharp performances of Fiennes and Turturro. \n\n --Shelly",

      "reviewBody": "Well Japan is fairly well-known for some of the really obscure, grotesque and outrageous movies within recent years. And &quot;Zombie Self-Defense Force&quot; or &quot;Zonbi Jieitai&quot; is one of those movies.\n\nI sat down to watch it because it is a zombie movie and also because it was from Japan. I like all things zombie, so that was the main reason for watching it. Plus, I like Japanese movies as well.\n\nThe story in &quot;Zonbi Jieitai&quot; is fairly out there. A UFO crashes in Japan and turns dead people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh. In the middle of this zombie crisis, is a small group of soldier who end up fighting the zombies. Trapped at a small inn, the soldiers are facing certain doom, and not everyone in the platoon is what they appear to be.\n\nDon&apos;t expect this to really be a serious movie in the zombie genre, because the story, the acting, the gore, yeah basically everything in the movie is so over the top, that it becomes hilarious. It was like watching a live-action Manga. The dialogue was so crazy at times and it was delivered just like in a Manga. And the acting was so out there, so overly dramatic and spoofy.\n\nThe gore in &quot;Zonbi Jieitai&quot; was actually quite good at times, so there is something interesting in it for gorehounds. Then on the other hand, there were times when the blood and effects were breathtakingly fake and hilarious to even just look at.\n\nI found &quot;Zonbi Jieitai&quot; to be enjoyable because it was so over the top. Everything was pushed to the extreme, and then just one further step. Remember, when you sit down to watch this movie, take it for what it is, a comical Japanese zombie comedy that is quite Manga-like in its presentation.\n\nNow, the zombies in the movie were rather interesting, especially because they maintained their odd quirks that they had when they were alive. Each and every one of the zombies were really fun to look at, because they all had their own unique personality.\n\n&quot;Zonbi Jieitai&quot; is a very light-hearted and comical approach on the zombie genre. It might just be enjoyable for you if you are looking for something weird and extreme.",

The love interest is attractive. The dogs are cute. Even the border-collie is great! My 4 yo loves the movie. We re-enact the &quot;Demon, save me!&quot; scene often. Demon is the name of the lead dog. Comical slapstick mishaps run throughout the film as Ted (Cuba) is constantly being chased by dogs, dragged through the snow, slides down hills, and suffers mild injuries. None of these are excessive, however, a few crude remarks, some adult dialogue and a suggestive image, are not appropriate for very young children. But reasonably acceptable for children age 6 and up.",

These movies were very popular during the beginning of his career, but more recently he has fallen into doing low class Chinese comedies, so I was refreshed to see him return to his roots. I was also surprised to see that Gigi Leung did a respectful performance.  I was also glad to see that she didn&apos;t sing the theme song, which was sung by Andy Lau.  The first time I saw the movie I was very touched by the father son relationship that was portrayed.  Overall, I feel this movie was quite good and deserves to be watched at least once."

All of us who love the 50&apos;s (and early 60&apos;s) sci-fi, low budget films are usually prepared for bad acting, bad monsters, cheesy sets, etc....but even when these films are bad, they&apos;re good &apos;cause they are fun. Not this one!  The actors(?) talk, and talk, and talk, hide behind doors and in freezers that don&apos;t seem to be cold and then talk some more. A little love interest is thrown in to spice up the action.....spare me!  To top it off, the &quot;fog&quot; is so thick that you cannot distinguish the actors(?) from the slime monsters, which may be a good thing. What was Robert Hutton thinking?.....bless his heart, he had some excellent roles in the 40&apos;s in first run features and then seemed to go to Hell in a handbasket.  This has to be the nadir of his career.  And Les Tremayne must have needed work badly to appear in this mess, albeit rather briefly, carrying a goat (what was that about?)  The story line is sketchy at best....slime people who have lived under Los Angeles forever, carry spears, come to the surface and produce fog to lower the temperature and build a wall around the city and..........whatever! MST3K did a good job with this but remember, this film was supposed to be taken seriously.  Do you think that Mr. Hutton was dropping acid when he made this.......you may have to do a couple of tabs yourself to get through this bomb."

      "reviewBody": "The original series starred Ernest Borgnine fresh off his film career which included an Academy Award winning performance as MARTY.  The real stars of the show were Tim Conway and Joe Flynn, two comics with perfect timing.  The rest of the crew was basically just wall paper (wall paper does have it&apos;s place, Gavin MacLeod made a career out of playing wall paper in this program, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, and THE LOVE BOAT).  The humor of the show required that Conway or Flynn or both be on screen to get a laugh. Like many TV shows of the time, two theatrical features were made (in color) and the second only with Conway and Flynn.  A remake of the whole thing flops mainly because of the lack of comic timing (a mix of slapstick and vaudeville) that Conway and Flynn brought to the original.  About the same time as this remake Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd attempted to remake another service related TV comedy SGT. BILKO.  Martin and Ackroyd have timing and still flopped with the genre.  So maybe the two shows could only be made at the time they were made with the people who made them.  That makes them really special and why Nick at Nite and TV Land will have little competition from new Hollywood.  Note:  If you have any original ideas move to Hollywood, apparently there are no writers in Hollywood with original ideas. They can use you."

There&apos;s some good performances especially by Lex Barker, who is quite weary and keeps on saying that it&apos;s none of his business, and Marianne Koch, who once again, is forced to stay with the heel. Sort of how she was coerced to be with Ramon in A fistful of Dollars. Having said all this, this western plods too much, the pace is slower than a tortoise and it lacks some spark as well as action. The gunfight was a bit of a letdown. Shame, because this could have been quite good.",

Liberally laced with interviews with folks like Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, it also includes insightful commentary from a (small) handful of liberated corporate executives.\n\nThe sum total is a compelling story of the evil that can be and is done by and in the name of corporations.  I say this as one who has worked in a corporate environment my entire career, and who for a very long time has had difficulty getting past the &apos;but these are almost all nice people -- I don&apos;t know any ogres out to intentionally rape &amp; pillage&apos; perspective.\n\nWhat I&apos;m gradually wakening to is the realization that yes, the corporate structure is very efficient at doing what it&apos;s designed to do -- which unfortunately does not include taking social responsibility or the greater good into account.  Instead it&apos;s ruthlessly focused on the bottom line, come hell (literally) or high water -- or polluted water.\n\nI highly recommend this film.  I know I&apos;ll be going back for a second viewing -- there&apos;s that much content, that I know I didn&apos;t absorb it all the first time around.",

Jay Chou&apos;s acting isn&apos;t exactly the most moving thing I&apos;ve ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you&apos;re just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It&apos;s a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There&apos;s an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It&apos;s formulaic but really, suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It&apos;s called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise, but we got a great laugh out of it. They would appear to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10.\n\nI laughed, I cried, I hurled. I&apos;d watch it again.\n\nEspecially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - I&apos;d LOVE to play on one of those.\n\nSlick enough for me, but I dig on trash cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) travels to Crystal Lake, the last known location that his missing sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) was seen. The police have searched with no luck, and Clay is searching alone. Local citizens have advised Clay not to go into those woods, because anyone who shows up missing is already dead, and he is wasting his time. Their warnings go unheard, because he must find and rescue his sister. During the search, Clay meets a group of thrill-seeking college students who have just arrived at Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex, booze and pot smoking. One of the students, Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) decides to help Clay find his sister, and they go into the woods. They find the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake and search the dilapidated camp house for any signs of his sister. They soon see why people don&apos;t come to these woods, because they encounter the evil and psychopathic killer, Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears).\n\n(My Comment) This is your typical teen slasher horror movie. By now, everybody should know that you don&apos;t enter the haunted domain of Jason, or you deserve what you get. We now have a bigger and stronger Jason who hunts his prey and not only uses his razor-sharp machete, but other instruments to carry out his nightmarish revenge. There are some terrifying scares scenes that made me jump, luckily there was no one sitting next to me. If you like slasher movies, the hockey-mask wearing stalker Jason will not disappoint, and you will have a bloody good time as Jason increases his body count. I was glad when it was over, because I couldn&apos;t take much more of this traumatic experience. (Warner Bros., Run Time 1:37, Rated R)(6/10)",

      "reviewBody": "Danny (Paul Rudd) has a bad day on the job and drags his loyal but dim-witted buddy Wheeler (Sean William Scott) down with him. Danny is a &apos;Red Bull&apos; style energy drink spokesman, Wheeler is the guy in the bull suit that jumps around beside him. In the same 24 hours Danny loses his girlfriend, license and job.\n\nIn reality he starts by losing the girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks), and his subsequent tantrum and stupidity sees him lose both license and job and sees him teetering on the verge of imprisonment. Somehow guilt by association sees Wheeler in the same predicament.\n\nTo avoid jail Beth – who happens to be a lawyer = lucky – wrangles community service instead. Service in the form of helping disadvantaged and troubled kids for a company named &apos;Sturdy Wings&apos;.\n\nThis shakiest of premises: allowing unreliable young men to mentor impressionable young boys, sets the scene for the slap dash stuff that follows. Miraculously enough though the threadbare premise is held together by enough jokes and amusing moments to make the thing worthwhile, largely due to the continued comedic stylings of one Paul Rudd, and the strength of the various supporting bit parts on display throughout.\n\nWhen allotted their respective &apos;littles&apos; (Danny and Wheeler are &apos;bigs&apos;) by Sturdy Wings boss and recovering alcoholic Sweeney (Jane Lynch) we immediately see where this is going.\n\nDanny considers himself &apos;normal&apos;, but in reality he is so concerned with not being deemed &apos;uncool&apos; that his disdain for cliché and obvious statements leaves everyone else bored by his constant judgment. He scores 16ish Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a medieval-style role player who is intensely insecure when not in character, and intensely-intense when he is.\n\nWheeler on the other hand wants no part of responsibility of any kind. He is more than happy being the jumping around sidekick in the costume and has no thought for his own future. For now he is all about the well let&apos;s just say boobies (and everything below). Of course he is allocated troubled young 8ish Ronnie, a profane little sh*t-stirrer who wants nothing more than to not have to deal with adults.\n\nEach kid has parental issues – but ones that don&apos;t kill the potential laughs – no abuse here, and the guys must get through to the children in their own way, and sucks; maybe learn a little about themselves on the way What develops is a rom-com with all the associated hijinks, temporary fall-outs and hitches, only between an adult male and a kid/youth, but that&apos;s not where the laughs are born.\n\nRole Models works best in the smaller roles, the now renowned Ken Jeong keeps his pants on this time and plays the King of the role playing game L.A.I.R.E., surrounded by his toadying minions and remaining in character even away from the game in his kingdom at the local cafe. Jane Lynch is a little OTT with the attempted mind games as the Sturdy Wings boss, but she also gets a few of the best lines in the flick, and there are numerous other bit roles – each with a couple jokes – filled by character actors that&apos;ll have you remembering them from other bit roles in other flicks.\n\nThe jokes are thrown about quick and fast, and while some don&apos;t work enough do to make Role Models a lot like I Love You, Man and Knocked Up, lightweight and amusing enough to justify your time, with occasional genuine humour (and unexpected nudity!).\n\nFinal Rating – 6 / 10. I can see the future. When I watched this 4 days ago I knew myself well enough that I wrote &quot;It really is a 6&quot; next to the rating. You might not recall Role Models as such a cracking laugh weeks after the viewing, but while you are watching it is a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "Produced by America and Spain, this stars Lee Van Cleef as a Union Army... Apache Captain (!) He&apos;s out to discover the meaning behind &quot;April Morning&quot; , a dying agent&apos;s last words. With very few leads, he starts a tense alliance with a corrupt gun-runner named Griffin (Stuart Whitman), but finds he&apos;ll have to work quicker if he&apos;s to find out information as his contacts have a rather annoying habit of dying - and just before they tell him as well. The film also stars Carroll Baker (Giant, The Big Country) and Percy Herbert, a bit-part Brit-actor who featured in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962) and a couple of &quot;Carry On...&quot; films.\n\nThe action scenes here work well, and the humour (mostly intentional) is fairly amusing. Many of the scenes are filled with tension - and the mystery of April Morning is played out well enough to sustain interest and keep you gripped right &apos;till the end. The music is hardly in the traditional style most westerns follow, although saying that the soundtrack is fine as it includes the novelty of hearing Van Cleef sing &quot;Captain Apache&quot; and &quot;April Morning&quot; with whom, if the lyrics are to be believed, he apparently has a date.\n\nI found this film really enjoyable and very entertaining. After viewing it, I can&apos;t get the title song out of my head, although that&apos;s most likely a negative point. With the right amount of action and suspense, and a dollop of good humour, this is a movie for little boys of all ages. Recommended."

Kevin Williamson splendidly has his way with stereotypical teenagers in a clever script stuffed with titillating genre references. All performances are outstanding - particularly Robert Patrick eats up every scene he&apos;s in - and the K.N.B. Effects Group delivers some of their best work, mixing CGI with traditional monster mayhem. Even with its plot-twists revealed after a first time viewing, this one&apos;s worth revisiting.",

Actress Mitsouko also appeared in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, alongside Sean Connery, and in several other eurospy. Wandisa Guida is also a sexy blonde, here as a villain. Susy Andersen is also beautiful and sexy, here in the role of a Soviet spy, Velka, who protects agent Fleming 077, played by Richard Harrison. Richard Harrison has also appeared in other Eurospy plus many adventure movies with gladiators in ancient Rome. Before the end, we have a general &quot;movie-like&quot; fight, more comic than real. Riccardo Pallottini, the cinematographer, proves a lot of skill, and Carlo Savina&apos;s music is not bad. Antonio Margheriti, the director, was a very prolific maker of various action films.",

Even though it can get corny at times and the portrayal of baseball here is very interesting and lots of fun but baseball fans today will have a field day pointing out its lack of accuracy. It is a very well made, very funny, very wild and very clever and inventive cartoon, even if other Avery cartoons did all that even better and took more risks.\n\nIt is no surprise that, as with a vast majority of Avery&apos;s cartoons regardless of the period, the animation is excellent. Very rich in colour, the backgrounds have meticulously good detail and the character designs are distinctively Avery in style and are fluid in movement. The music, courtesy of Scott Bradley, is typically lushly and cleverly orchestrated, with lively and energetic rhythms and fits very well indeed, even enhancing the action.\n\n&apos;Batty Baseball&apos; is never less than very funny and even hilarious frequently, managing to make baseball entertaining regardless of whether one is a fan of the sport or not. The timing is immaculate, coming thick and fast, and there are plenty of sight gags in classic Avery fashion, all hitting their mark.\n\nAvery&apos;s directing can&apos;t be faulted. Likewise with the voice acting and the engaging characters.\n\nIn summary, very well made and wonderfully batty. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "This is basically like a German &quot;sex report&quot; film in that, rather than being a single plot-line, it is actually a series of vignettes showing the active (VERY active) sex lives of international airline stewardesses. Of course, it eschews the ridiculous &quot;person-on-the-street&quot; interviews of some of the other &quot;report&quot; films and it doesn&apos;t even really have a central frame story tying all the random scenes together. You might also feel a little less like a pervert watching it since it is about adult airline stewardesses rather than schoolgirls like some of the other films (even though pretty much the same group sexy German and Scandavian actresses were in ALL these German &quot;report&quot; films). I should also mention these are early 1970&apos;s airline stewardesses (a movie about the sex lives of some of the ill-tempered beasts that work as &quot;flight attendants&quot; today might be better classified as a horror movie).\n\nThis movie was directed by Swiss sleazemeister Erwin Dietrich and features the uber-sexy Ingrid Steeger as perhaps the most recognizable actress in the opening vignette. (She meets an older guy on a plane, shags him rotten, and THEN gives him a tour of the city). Like Dietrich and Steeger&apos;s earlier collaboration &quot;I, a Groupie&quot; this is kind of a sexy travelogue with (the exteriors at least) filmed in world cities like Munich, Copenhagen, and New York City (which I, at least, appreciate more than most modern-day sex films that seem to take place entirely in some producer&apos;s condo in the San Fernando Valley). There&apos;s an especially good sequence of a pornography-fueled orgy in swinging Denmark. Unlike &quot;I,a Groupie&quot; or some of the other &quot;report&quot; films, however, this doesn&apos;t have wild shifts of tone where some stories are light-hearted and silly and others downright disturbing. This movie is just consistently silly.\n\nAs Dietrich-Steeger films go I&apos;d rank this ahead of &quot;The Young Seducers&quot;, but definitely behind &quot;I, a Groupie&quot;. It&apos;s better than most &quot;report&quot; films and pretty much all the American sexy stewardess films I&apos;ve seen though . Give it a gander."

      "reviewBody": "A cash-strapped prison board decides to reopen an old, run-down slammer that has been closed since 1968, putting no-nonsense warden Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith), an ex-guard at the establishment, in charge of running the show. When Sharpe orders two of the new inmates (one of whom is played by a young Viggo Mortensen) to break down the sealed-up entrance to the execution chamber, he unwittingly unleashes the vengeful spirit of dead convict Charlie Forsythe, who was wrongfully sent to the electric chair.\n\nWith the two men responsible for this dreadful miscarriage of justice currently residing in the very same prison as Forsythe&apos;s ghost, one might expect retribution to be swift, but director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) drags out matters for over 100 minutes, chucking in as many hoary prison drama clichés as possible in the process, whilst having his malevolent spook kill off several other characters for no discernible reason other than to pad out the action and meet the gore quota—except that the splatter here is remarkably tame despite the inventive nature of the deaths.\n\n5.5/10, rounded down to 5 for the cinematography, which utilises a blue tint and smoke throughout in a bid to add style and atmosphere, but which, in reality, only succeeds in making everything blue and smoky.",

      "reviewBody": "A boxer from the Soviet Union inspires Apollo to come out of retirement.\n\nThis is an enjoyable cheese-fest with memorable moments.\n\nIt feels like Rocky&apos;s character arc was done by the end of the first sequel, but in this one he is inspired to fight yet again by tragic circumstances. I think the story feels contrived and forced, but it sets up some entertaining moments of Cold War propaganda. He is in brooding mode like the previous sequel with an additional touch of self importance associated with the USA v USSR theme. Sylvester Stallone leads it well and stays likeable throughout.\n\nOther regular characters contribute well to the production with the likes of Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, and Burt Young lifting scenes with strong performances.\n\nRussian characters are mostly portrayed negatively, and I&apos;m including the fickle crowd at the second fight. Given the era this is hardly surprising, but they are insultingly one dimensional caricatures.\n\nThere is plenty of exciting Rocky-style spectacle, particularly the fights and training sequences. Steroid abuse aside, I like the (for the time) hi tech training methods and the contrasting styles between both camps. The use of the Wyoming landscape is beautiful and the Soviet art design is visually effective.\n\nAs much as I enjoy a montage, there are way too many. In fact the dialogue and fight scenes function mostly as a way to connect montages. I particularly dislike the &quot;best of&quot; franchise moments involving the song &apos;No Easy Way Out&apos;. All that said one of my favourite parts of the movie is the use of &apos;Eye of the Tiger&apos; to recap the end of Rocky 3.\n\nAs for the cheese, it is off the scales in this entry. It gets particularly cringeworthy towards the end, but if you switch the brain off and can see the funny side, it is arguably a memorable slice of mid-eighties pop culture. I remember loving it as a child shortly after it came out and my young daughter enjoyed it recently.",

Unfortunately, it fails on almost every level; a complete non-starter as a horror film and totally incoherent as a thriller.\n\nThe opening portion of the film is simply dull; a chance for the screenwriter&apos;s occasionally competent dialogue to be ruined by an ill-conceived cast. The character development is so lacking that all human aspect of the story is played entirely in cliché, and the standard of acting is poor even for a low-budget independent feature.\n\nOf course, the purpose of this film is obviously to provide either shocks or genuine, disturbing scares. It delivers neither. The film is utterly inept as a horror, offering nothing but a series of mild gore scenes to fans of the genre. Essentially, this film is mixture of poor acting, dull cinematography and a script that, despite a few good pieces of dialogue, is both confusing and simplistic in equal measure. However, the production team must be commended for successfully shooting a U.S-set film in Belfast, which is carried of convincingly.\n\nOverall, &apos;Freakdog&apos; is a poor effort when pitched against either major Hollywood horror films or the usual B-movie fare. It fails to deliver the necessary scares and constantly suffers from poor acting and a ludicrous storyline. I really cannot recommend this film, which is a real shame as I was hoping it would deliver so much more.",

We get to learn that men who thought they were wimps discover they have a pair of balls. The rules say this review must be at least ten lines. Ten lines are not really necessary for this action/comedy. It was fast. It was funny. Go see it. I guess I&apos;ve got to add more lines to get this qualified. You will see a side of John Travolta that you haven&apos;t seen before. The same with William Macey. Tim Allen was Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence was Martin Lawrence. Ray Liota, as always, was great.

I think I&apos;m not alone when I say that the best part of this film is the gorgeous and colorful cinematography and beautiful sets and costumes which make this a visually outstanding film however aside from this I think it is very forgettable. The acting is OK and that&apos;s really it, even Claude Rains, one of the greatest actors of all time isn&apos;t particularly memourable in this film. I&apos;m also not the biggest fan of the movie&apos;s tone, it just feels too light hearted and almost goofy, ruining most of the suspense, at least for me. 6.8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Polish director Jerzy Kawalerowicz&apos;s long gestated film adaptation of Bolesław Prus&apos; historical novel PHARAOH is an ambitious endeavor, dazzles in its epic scale and formalist gravitas with an exclusive Polish cast, which leads to one prescribed proviso: for purists, it is beggar belief to watch a movie about ancient Egyptians where everyone sports Polish through and through; but other than that, the film is a marvel orchestrated with vigor, mettle and pathos. \n\nThe story centers around the story of an apocryphal pharaoh Ramses XIII (a 20-year-old Zelnik graced with haughty handsomeness and solemness), whose hellbent effort to seize power and pecuniary autonomy over an ever-increasingly theocratic clutches of the clergy in the Ancient Egypt. \n\nThe movie opens with a static close-up of two scarabs, competing for their trophy, then reveals a throng of Egyptian soldiers marching in an expansive desert, and directly points out the strife between the young Ramses XIII and the High Priest Herhor (Pawlowski), in order to show reverence to the sacred scarabs, Herhor commands the troops to take a devious route which causes damage to the newly-built water channels, and a resultant suicide of the channel digger. The incident enrages Ramses XIII, and he vows to take down the clergy when he assumes the regalia. \n\nThat day would not be too long in waiting, but what also awaits him is an Egypt sapping in wealth and sway, the priests arrange unfavorable treaties with the neighboring Assyrians in order to keep warfare at bay, which ostensibly seems like a well-intentioned strategy to save the hoi polloi from the scourge of war, but the truth is, there is large amount of gold and other fortunes being squirreled away in the labyrinth of the priests&apos; temple, nominally can be only appropriated when in exigency, which the High Priests would never grant in favor of feathering their own nests. This is the touch paper which Ramses XIII deploys to foment the masses against the clergy, in an attempt to take the latter down once for all. Sadly he is still wet in his ears, and the priests are not ready to back down without a fight. \n\nAs a historical saga, PHARAOH is unusually lean on action pieces and subdued in its chromatic approach, one could imagine if the story were to be transposed as a Hollywood tent-pole in a post- BEN-HUR (1959) era, all the glittering and grandiose would suffuse its majestic set, and battleground bedlam pumped up by polished fighting competence. Here, in a much less ostentatious and more internalized style (costumes are astonishingly designed in its originally exotic verisimilitude), what comes about is a tragic tale of one young man&apos;s over-confidence in his prowess against something far more sinister, deceptive and ruthless than he has ever imagined, with a sideswipe to the benighted mob, when an eclipse crops up, all hell broke loose and burrowing a hole in the ground is their knee-jerking reaction. \n\nPerformance-wise, the cast rounds out a mostly po-faced dourness even for those who are laughing in the end (with Pawlowski emanating the highest voltage), sometimes emotes a ghost of urgency but none-too ravishing to be brutally frank. Yet, it is Kawalerowicz&apos;s arduous effort to minutely visualize a mythical epoch when primitivity and obtuseness overlay the world, yet through a tall-tale where a spate of human frailties abound and speak volumes of what one can assimilate into today&apos;s circumstances, it galvanizes new audience with its ritualistic posture and beguiling aesthetic attributes.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been wanting to check this out since learning that it won Best Feature at the 2003 NYC Horror Film Festival. Now after watching it I&apos;m guessing every other film it was competing against must&apos;ve REALLY sucked.\n\nMalevolence is in no way a bad film, yet it&apos;s just not that good either. The concept of mixing a robbery-gone-wrong story with a slasher film is pretty original, but this only makes it&apos;s heavy use of slasher clichés drag it down into mediocrity. What would be perfectly acceptable idiotic behavior from stupid teenagers in a fun slasher film, becomes unbearably frustrating because one would expect more from the unconventional characters portrayed here.\n\nAs the film stumbles forward through all the usual &quot;scares&quot; of the genre, I only became more and more frustrated by how a good idea is just thrown out the window in order to fall back on things that have been done to death (and much better) 25 years ago. All this is topped off by a soundtrack that was obviously intended to be &quot;old-school&quot; yet comes off as just really annoying and repetitive.\n\nStill, as far as low-budget indie horror flicks go, Malevolence is decently shot, and while it does bring in a new mix to the formula, it immediately waters it down by simply not doing anything worth-while with it.",

      "reviewBody": "World wide terrorism is fast becoming the stereotypical plot for new age films. They could be about corrupt inner governments, renegade police or as in this case, rebellious disenchanted rogue soldiers. The film is entitled &quot; Universal Soldier: Regeneration. &quot; This is part three and as with the original premises, dead soldiers who died in armed combat, were stored in cryogenic coffins, revived, repaired and returned to duty. In this third sequel, Russian terrorists have the added help of NGU&apos;s or New Generation Universal Soldiers which are improved, re-generated, deadlier soldiers. Dolph Lundgren returns as Andrew Scott and Andrei Arlovski, have kidnapped the children of the Russian Premier. In addition, radical soldiers, have also seized control over the Cernobal nuclear power plant. Together it poses a world wide threat when the rebels promise to detonate a huge bomb there, which will release a massive dangerous radioactive cloud across the world. In response, the governments activate some elite soldiers of their own including their former Universal soldier, Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who has under gone DE-programing, to combat the threat. The film is an improvement over the original in both drama and excellent acting. Ludgren and Van Dammn should be complimented on re-visiting former roles. With sufficient action, excitement and a generous supply of physical confrontation, the movie does a good job of keeping an audience entertained. ****",

She unexpectedly meets a young German man who is photographing the place, making an archaological record of it.  He meets her and wants to join her trip down memory lane.  It gets more and more interesting, with a great deal of psychological complexity throughout. \n\nThe only thing I would change is the ending.  I won&apos;t say what happens, but she needed to remember the letter.  It would have been better punctuated, as a story.  Beautiful cinematography, writing, acting, the whole bit. Outstanding!",

He wanted me to pay attention to the real story, that being that racism has no place in a free society. I did pay attention, and to this day, his instance that I watch the movie for content is among the fondest memories I have of my Dad. He taught me how to hunt, fish, drive a car, paint a house and respect people. It is all the more remarkable, especially since I grew up in an all white town in western PA. Also, I now live no more than a few hundred yards where the movie was made. The former VF Army Hospital is now mostly under the ownership of the VF Christian College - a great resource and an asset to our community. When my family moved here some 20 years ago, we immediately discovered the &quot;old army base&quot; and I frequently took our kids there to walk, play on the falling down miniature golf course and just try to imagine what the facility was like when it was in use (swimming pool, gymnasium, small duck pin bowing alley, full size golf course and two fishing ponds)-- and what the presence of the base meant to Phoenixville then. I actually played handball on that court that Artuhr Kennedy is tested on for obstacle perception. The facility specialized in head and eye injuries and had a very substantial psychiatric ward as well. Anyhow, along with the anti-racism message umbered in the movie, I enjoy the scenes of the old hospital and reflect on what it looks like now. And of course,-- the scenes of old Phoenixville, although way before my time, bring a sense of nostalgia to me that is hard to describe not being a native of the area. None the less, it&apos;s there. As an aside, for anyone who is interested; Phoenixville is where they filmed The Blob with Steve McQueen -- the Colonial theater still stands to this day and has become a landmark. Oddly enough, McQueen and Kennedy would appear together in Nevada Smith years later. It is indeed a small world.",

A shot that has stayed with me through the years is where actor Brian Blessed, in the character of J.S.Bach, disappears from one side of the frame at the end of a scene, and re-appears moments later as himself (narrating) on the other side of the frame. The film is somewhat dated, though (the hairstyles and roller skates of the Brooklyn Boys Choir, the discussion of the &quot;recent&quot; development of the Moog synthesizer), but that shouldn&apos;t detract from your enjoyment.",

      "reviewBody": "In the search for intimacy and meaning in the dehumanizing urban environment, quite personable, intelligent and attractive people have to resort to newspaper or online ads to meet someone for romance or just companionship. In this film, however, a man and woman, both attractive and personable, seek depersonalised sex, not involvement. Or so they thought. Of course they become emotionally involved, and then the question becomes: will they continue? \n\nThis is a very nicely judged piece using a combination of interview sequences intercut with flashbacks. There are no distractions: we focus almost entirely on Nathalie and Sergi as they are interviewed separately about their affair. Their versions are not identical but there is only one flashback version of each encounter so there is not a lot of confusion. The curious thing is that although intimacy develops it follows the rules of the original impersonal pornographic encounter  no names, no talk about jobs and families and friends, no swapping of personal detail. They meet once or twice a week in the same coffee bar and hotel room for six months or more, yet still know virtually nothing about each other (apart from their sexual fantasies). Why this holding back? Neither is currently attached to anyone else. The only explanation is that they really didn&apos;t want to get involved, or don&apos;t want to take the risk. Burned before? Who knows?\n\n Nathalie Baye as the (slightly older) woman is poised, charming and not obviously hung up about sex. She seeks the zipless f*** of feminist legend. She does have trouble expressing her feelings  for her `I love you&apos; are the hardest words in the language (all right, `Je t&apos;aime&apos;). Sergi Lopez as her homme de jour is a bit more emotionally expressive but still holds himself back.\n\nI suppose one could see the film as suggesting that the alienation of modern life can be traced to an unwillingness to become emotionally attached, that life is faster and cleaner if relationships are disposable without much pain. These two want intimacy, but they don&apos;t want to pay for it.\n\nIt&apos;s a well-made movie with plenty of Parisian bustle and lots of nice close-ups. It&apos;s all a bit sad, though. Have we been reduced to being consumers of personal relationships as well as sex?"

I believe that if any film bases itself on a computer game, then it stands to reason that is not going to take itself seriously for a split second! I played some of the DOUBLE DRAGON games for Nintendo when I was younger and they were pretty jokey themselves.  This little picture has great fights, great action and most importantly of all, a great sense of humour.  Robert Patrick camps it up wonderfully as bad guy Koga Shuko.  A young Mark Dacascos (DRIVE, THE CROW: STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, CRYING FREEMAN) kicks less butt than usual but is still enjoyable.  Alyssa Milano is great as the sardonic revolutionary Marion, and both Dacascos and Scott Wolf as the Lee brothers (Dacascos is &apos;Home Lee&apos; and Wolf is &apos;Ug Lee&apos;, geddit?) both have a fine line in sarcastic remarks.  The car chase near the start with the &apos;Dragon Wagon&apos; being pursued by Abobo&apos;s van is brilliant, especially with the use of computer graphics. Again, a classic example of good, mindless fun!",

Like the difference between&quot;Aloonda and Zugg-Zugg&quot;. (There&apos;s a difference?). It figures that the Japanese man would offer the translation,but he gives up and goes along with their slang. John Matuszak,former NFL player,was a perfect casting as Tonda. Some of their very important &quot;discoveries&quot; are a real hoot too. Look for a surprise actor playing the Snowman!"

      "reviewBody": "The Benchwarmers is definitely worth a watch if you are interested in some light heated fun. An unlikely trio led by Rob Schneider put a baseball team together and challenge the local bullies. David Spade does a great comedic role as one of the incompetent team mates. The humor effortlessly flows and the film doesn&apos;t try too hard to be funny. The look and situations of the characters are a riot. The scene where Spade and Schneider were hitting mailboxes with a bat at the back of a car was easily one of the funniest scenes in the film. Physical and silly comedy when done well is a treat to watch.\n\nDespite its humor it also touched on the serious topic of bullying and how its sadly prevalent. It was nice to see the bullies put in their place in the end. \n\nIt&apos;s an enjoyable experience where you don&apos;t have to think too much when watching it and enjoy a good laugh.",

First of all, you can take the film more serious, and the film doesn&apos;t add crappy humor, and no Raymond Burr scenes. I also like the haunting score by Reijiro Koroku, and the fact that they makers of film brought Godzilla back to his roots, and the film also has a bigger budget so, the special effects, Godzilla suit, and miniatures are more better made (not perfect though). This is in my opinion, this is second greatest Godzilla movie next to original un-cut Gojira.",

      "reviewBody": "When I think of the eighties teen genre, I think about John Hughes and John Cusack...and a little movie called Three O&apos;Clock High.  Three O&apos;Clock High is the greatest eighties movie that no one knows about.  It does, in fact, blow The Breakfast Club out of the water.  Casey Siemaszko is perfect in the lead as Jerry Mitchell and he is the ultimate underdog.  You can&apos;t help but love his character.  He definitely has a large degree of untapped talent. The most unforgettable character however, is Richard Tyson&apos;s infamous Buddy Revell.  I won&apos;t say that he completely steals the show, but he does come close to it.  Revell has many a one-liner and I quote him on a weekly basis. And who could forget Tangerine Dream&apos;s score.  They are also an integral ingredient of the eighties flick.  This is a truly brilliant piece of comedy.  Three O&apos;Clock High is a comic gem as well as a must see. \n\n &quot;You and me, we&apos;re gonna have a fight-today-after school-3 O&apos;Clock-in the parking lot.  You try and run, I&apos;m gonna track you down.  You go to a teacher, it&apos;s only gonna get worse.  You sneak home, I&apos;ll be under your bed. You and me...3 O&apos;Clock.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "This was the first (and probably the last) title from &quot;notorious&quot; XXX producer Marc Dorcel that I watched. Actually, my only reason to check this was the involvement of Jean Rollin as a scriptwriter. Some sources say he also helped Dorcel to direct this, but I am not so sure. The fact is that the only thing resembling the cinema of Rollin is the presence of a beautiful castle.\n\nBeing produced in the 90s, the film had to be shot on video and that is one of the problems. The video technology at the period was still very poor and, despite the above average budget for a &quot;movie&quot; of the genre, the image is ugly. It looks like a soap opera, not like a real movie. Dorcel is known for producing &quot;porno-chic&quot;, but there is nothing very &quot;chic&quot; here, except for the aforementioned castle.\n\nThe &quot;plot&quot; is more &quot;developed&quot; than usual, but it is still far from being minimally solid. I wonder what motivated Rollin to put his name in such a project, but I am glad this is the only porn video he was involved with.\n\nWhat about the actings? Well, in the 70s and 80s, the genre counted with real actresses, people who many times entered porn after failing in achieving a career in mainstream cinema. However, after the video &quot;revolution&quot;, actresses were replaced by models and any vestige of acting skills vanished. That is the case of Draghixa, the protagonist of &quot;Le Parfum de Mathilde&quot;. The poor girl can&apos;t even breath in a convincing way. However, the award for worst &quot;actress&quot; has to go to the gorgeous Erika Bella. She constantly looks at the camera (?) doing &quot;sexy&quot; expressions, but looks just ridiculous. And her all-girl scene with Simona Valli is a good example of how unconvincing lesbian action is in these productions. Just giving a real kiss in another woman seems much more difficult than engaging in sodomy for these girls!\n\nThe music, composed by Dorcel himself, is better than the library medíocre pieces typically used in the genre, but the feeling of soap opera is never surpassed.\n\nAs a final note, there is no perfum in the plot, so the title is nonsense. Not even a symbolic meaning can be attributed to it.\n\nIn short, for a porn video, this is a classic, but for a real movie, it is a catastrophe.",

COPYCAT (1995) is well-produced and gripping, with some interesting quirks of character. Sigourney Weaver gives a nice performance here, but Holly Hunter really defines the show as uncoppish cop M.J. Monahan. Many people will not like her performance for the very reasons that I do like it--Imagine Sarah Palin in the role of a homicide detective, and you&apos;ll see what I mean. Harry Connick, JR, is also memorable in his bad-guy role here.\n\nCOPYCAT has an interesting premise, but, as horrible as the following may sound, it would have been nice if they&apos;d taken it a bit further, having the killer imitate a few others before the big come-uppance. A little more on Peter Foley, who/why he is, and what motivates him would also have helped. COPYCAT is quite watchable if you&apos;re a fan of this genre, but the whole storyline is kind of TV-Land same ol&apos;, predictable, and nothing terribly original despite the winning premise.",

      "reviewBody": "Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn&apos;t have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. \n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie&apos;s action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character&apos;s are intelligent and highly believable. The movie&apos;s soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify&apos;s many of the movie&apos;s scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie&apos;s action scenes, so it&apos;s not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. \n\nIn conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan&apos;s vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Welcome to Collingwood&quot; offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of, was the 1958 Italian film &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;, directed by Mario Monicelli.\n\nThe Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can&apos;t be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine.\n\nThe film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. Whatever could go wrong, and more, is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo&apos;s funeral.\n\nThe best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these small time crooks do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end!",

It is light on action and heavy on psychological trauma. Andy Lau as Inspector Lau has taken care of all the moles - or he thinks he has. he is not sure and wants to be clear there is nothing tying him to Sam so he can be the good cop he wants to be. SP Leung is a creepy fellow and we are never sure just what he is. Is he a mole, or just a crooked cop. It is never clear.\n\nI was glad that Kelly Chen got a much bigger role as Dr. lee, but it would have been even better if we saw a relationship with Yan. It was obvious that she had love for him, but it never blossomed on screen. Yes, I know that would be a violation of the doctor-patient relationship, but it was there under the surface. Why didn&apos;t it come out.\n\nWe got to see quite a bit of Tony Leung in this film, and that is always a good thing.\n\nIt was very distracting the way the film jumped back and forth through time. It was trying to tie up the loose ends, but it was disconcerting.\n\nIt could have been an outstanding film, but it&apos;ll just have to be great to see the actors and enjoy their performance.",

      "reviewBody": "The best film ever made about school life; the rituals, the drudgery, the humiliation and ultimately the excitement. Anderson&apos;s masterpiece works on a number of levels, not least as one of the cinema&apos;s great pieces of surrealism. It&apos;s a state of the nation movie, a fantasy, an account of public school life told with an almost documentary-like precision and it&apos;s as fresh today as it was when it first appeared, (hard to believe that was almost 40 years ago or that Malcom McDowell was ever this young).\n\nUsing Jean Vigo&apos;s &quot;Zero De Conduite&quot; as a template, (it&apos;s not a remake), Anderson&apos;s movie is quintessentially youthful and so accurately does it depict its milieu as to appear almost arrogant. He handles revolution with a grandstanding authority and homosexual, (and heterosexual), schoolboy yearning more romantically than any other film I can think of, (Wallace&apos;s display in the gymnasium as blonde, beautiful, tousle-haired Bobby Phillips looks on is blissfully homo-erotic), and he does this with a masterly control of the medium. (His comments about financial restraints dictating the fluctuations between black-and-white and colour photography may well be true but the choices seem inspired, nevertheless and the great Miroslav Ondricek&apos;s camera-work is superb).\n\nHe was also a great actor&apos;s director, often working with many of the same actors both in theatre and in cinema and he extracts marvellous performances from the likes of Arthur Lowe, Peter Jeffrey, Mona Washborne and Geoffrey Chater representing the Establishment as well as pitch-perfect performances from David Wood, Richard Warwick, Rupert Webster, Robert Swann and Hugh Thomas, all new to cinema, as the students.\n\nThe film made Malcom McDowell a star and for a few short years, (here, in &quot;O Lucky Man&quot;, as Alex in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;), that star burned brightly before he sold out to Hollywood and his career began to flounder in a series of mediocre American movies, reaching a nadir with &quot;Caligula&quot;. But his performance as Mick Travis is a marvel and both it and the film that first encapsulated it remain among the finest achievements in British cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "I have been curious to see Letter from Siberia for several years, ever since I read that it was one of Werner Herzog&apos;s favorite films. Unfortunately, Chris Marker&apos;s work has often been hard to find on home video. Thanks to Soda releasing, Letter from Siberia is now available as part of a Region 2 DVD box set of Marker movies. While I am still working my way through the set, Letter from Siberia justifies the whole purchase.\n\nIn some ways, Letter from Siberia is like a travelogue that runs on PBS where an experienced traveler (Marker edited travel books) ventures to an exotic land and shows us armchair bound the sights. Letter from Siberia differs from these shows in two very important ways.\n\nFirst, the choice of destination is Siberia, which admittedly is exotic but not a place that would be called a tourist spot. For most viewers in 1957, Siberia was a barren wasteland where prisoners in Russian literature (and in life) were sent. Who lives there? This documentary shows the viewer some of the 8,000 free people who lived in Siberia in 1957. We are immersed in their cities, in their work, and in their customs. We even get to see a pet bear being walked through a town on a leash.\n\nSecond, none of those PBS travelers, as entertaining as they may be, are Chris Marker. He is a natural born filmmaker and storyteller. His images, captured on 16mm film, are vivid and texturally rich. The viewer feels like he can reach into the screen and feel the bark of the birch trees. In addition, Marker is not just a journalist; he is a poet. Marker draws on what the viewer thinks he or she knows about Siberia. Marker calls it &quot;the land of childhood&quot; because of its setting in youthful adventure stories, a place of Tartar raids and intrigues on the Trans-Siberian railroad. He then both refutes and adds to the mystique of Siberia, drawing history, culture, and geography into the unique portrait he is painting. \n\nPoetic is not meant as a synonym for dull. Marker&apos;s wry comments keep the film from ever getting too heavy. For instance, Marker interrupts his documentary with a satirical advertisement &quot;selling&quot; the many uses for reindeer. In addition, there is an animated short film about mammoths. All of Marker&apos;s observations, visual and aural, make for a viewing experience that is both entertaining and illuminating.\n\nSome might complain about Marker&apos;s choice to ignore Siberia&apos;s history as an internment site for prisoners. My response would be that there are several interpretations of Siberia which address this. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&apos;s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denosovich, published just five years after Letter from Siberia, is an excellent document of that aspect of Siberia. I think Marker means for his documentary to counter such views. Marker loves Siberia, its people and its terrain. After seeing the film, the viewer should have a change of heart about Siberia.",

Director Myers is among the most prolific porn-parody specialists, usually delivering a more poilshed product than this cheapie.\n\nFirst decision is to remove the violence from the story, probably to avoid any hint of censorship given porn&apos;s latter-day (post-Roughies era) reluctance to mix sex and violence in the same package. So instead of Freddy&apos;s scary metal fingers, he has a glove with dildo/vibrators for fingers.\n\nTommy Pistol is terrible, as usual, delivering verbal exposition of a story that Myers makes fun of to nil effect. He also humps busty Charley Chase in an interminable sex scene.\n\nRosano as Freddy gives one of his worst performances, and can barely come up with any cum at all in the climactic finale with Sophie. Gracie Glam is along for the ride to masturbate with Freddy&apos;s dildo glove."

Since the original &quot;Matrix&quot; came out a few years ago everyone has imitated its&apos; kenetic action style, which led me to think there&apos;s no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again.  But they did.  The Wachowskis have way out done the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and without a doubt have far surpassed the &quot;X-Men films.&quot;   At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins.  A little goofy but fun. The action though, I can&apos;t say enough about.  The center chase scene is awesome and the opening cycle scene is....  Okay, no more words, &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot; will not disappoint and by the time you reach the cliffhanger ending you&apos;re more than ready for a break from this double talking, mind bending adventure."

I have few doubts about it. because it has a story to tell. because the fragments of story are so bizarre and not more than sketches , than all remains at level of confusion. the film does nothing new. or interesting. or predictable. because it is only another action film, with a precise target, who gives few fights, a kind of love story, few crumbs of Star Wars and,, this is all. if you ignore Jon Foo who, maybe, could be the reasonable motif to see the film."

It is then that the buckets full of gore come in, and the sex stops.

      "reviewBody": "The film &quot;Los Últimos&quot; takes us into post-apocalyptic not-so-distant future in which there is war over water. This war reaches Latin America and the story follows a young couple trying to escape refugee camp in Bolivia and find better life in the west by the Pacific Ocean. \n\nThe script, penned by film&apos;s director Nicolás Puenzo together with his sister Lucía, also a film director and novelist, explores different angles of the war over water and in many situations hints on further and deeper issues that might not appear at first. The story shows the role of media, military contractors, journalism or medical aid in the war zone. Puenzo&apos;s eye for cinematography is absolutely stunning. The film is shot in several natural reserves of Bolivia and Chile and is complemented by very well done post-production of destroyed cities or military drones. \n\nThe young couple is portrayed by Peter Lanzani and Juana Burga, who is exceptional in her role despite the fact that the film is her acting debut. Who also stands out in her role is Uruguayan actress Natalia Oreiro who despite short screen time captivates the audience in well portrayed role of medic trying to help the couple. \n\nAnother remarkable element is the music. Composer Pedro Canale managed to combine soundtrack composition with traditional native sounds and vocals provided by Luzmila Carpio. The soundtrack matches beautifully the scenery and adds to the overall atmosphere. \n\n&quot;Los Últimos&quot; is a very well-done film, with outstanding cinematography and acting. It is an exceptional film as the post-apocalyptical genre is rather rare in Argentinean filmmaking. The film can be enjoyed by everyone looking for dynamic survival storytelling, and further, the audience gets a glimpse of the world that could be if water depletion continues.",

      "reviewBody": "Göran is making porridge.  For some reason this prompts him to deliver an improvised musing on the theme of Life Is Like a Bowl of Porridge, which goes roughly as follows: &quot;We start as individual oat flakes, each with an individual shape; then we&apos;re heated and mixed and we start to blend together with all the other oat flakes; we&apos;re no longer oat flakes, but we&apos;re part of something larger - something warm, nutritious, and, yes, beautiful.&quot;  Göran says this as though he&apos;s trying to convince himself.  And no wonder.  The porridge the camera reveals to us looks like repellent glomp.\n\nAnd up until that point - well, up until a little before that point; the film&apos;s arc is like a long walk up a very gentle hill and it&apos;s hard to pick the precise moment at which we make it to the top - the collective seemed just as much a dollop of repellent glomp as the porridge.  There were too many people too close together, the windows were never open, and for long stretches we never stepped outside, never even caught a glimpse of the outside.  Every single room looked and felt as though it were buried in the very centre of the house.  It was like living in a fetid warren, and it made me long for something cold and impersonal.\n\nBut even as we&apos;re gasping to escape we&apos;re being won over.  In the end the film really IS warm, and it&apos;s the pleasing warmth of a fireplace rather than clammy warmth of porridge.  The joyousness Moodysson concludes with grew so naturally out of what preceded it that the glow it casts is retrospective. I can&apos;t recall a single moment which I don&apos;t NOW (having seen the whole thing) recall with fondness.\n\nThe LOOK of the film is, in a quiet way, astonishing, except that it&apos;s so convincing you forget to be astonished.  You&apos;d swear it was shot in the 1970s.  (When I saw the trailer I thought was watching an ad for the reissue of a movie that HAD been shot in the 1970s.)  This is as great a triumph of art direction as any you&apos;re likely to see.",

It makes the viewer wonder if this was really what the director wanted to say with his movie; that, perhaps, he had multiple personalities in his head telling him what to do. Definitely the history of the gay culture is interesting as is the whole chapter about the gay counterculture of the sixties, but those other two parts, really: what were they all about??? And what was Mister Soukaz thinking?! The answer, as with all his movies, is to be found within the self of the viewer at hand.",

      "reviewBody": "To understand how this film came to be, you first should know the backstory. In 1999, Fox bought a pilot TV show called Manchester Prep, a &quot;reimagined&quot; prequel to the film Cruel Intentions.  It had all the same characters as the film and spread a fairly similar plot over the 22 episode arc.  The film&apos;s producing and directing team oversaw creation of the TV show and production began.  &apos;99 was a decent year for TV and one of the gems was a show called Popular.  Popular turned out to be....well, popular and Manchester Prep was canceled before it ever aired it&apos;s pilot.  The first few episodes were already shot, so it was repackaged with a few re-shoots and rewrites (and some gratuitous nudity) into the form of Cruel Intentions 2.\n\n The tonal changes throughout the film and different stylistic changes that plague the film are due to the segments of the TV episodes having been shot by different directors and then roughly tied together with reshoots by another director for the movie version. The film takes on a &quot;pulp&quot; feel as it plays on the inside jokes from the original film (which was designed to set up a connection between the show and the film as time progressed) and panders to the innuendos of the film in the lowest exploitative ways possible.\n\nIf you look hard enough you will find its connection to the first film, however viewing Cruel Intentions 2 before the original will likely dissuade you from viewing the original as this one lacks the sophistication and charisma of the original."

      "reviewBody": "As has been stated many times already, Ned (Paul Rudd) is not an idiot. Well, he kind of is. He lacks understanding of normal social protocol, and not in a genius kind-of-way, but as a hippie. Prone to frequent breakdowns in communication, one such instance lands him in jail. When he&apos;s out, he&apos;s off to live with his family. His sisters all treat him like he&apos;s an idiot. Hence, the title, &quot;Our Idiot Brother.&quot; \n\nNed is a good and caring guy. His sisters are completely different and completely different from each other — one is even British. In their own way, they are all selfish, demanding and insensitive people. But don&apos;t worry, Ned is our hero and protagonist. If you are currently sighing in relief, I understand. A career spanning two decades with 30-plus movie credits, and we&apos;ve only seen Paul Rudd in the lead role a handful of times.\n\nRudd has infused Ned with all the charm, likability and overall appeal that we have come to expect from him. Surprisingly, the less likable actresses playing the three unlikable sisters were at least able to add some humour to their characters. The three supporting actors probably could have stolen the show if they were given more time: Steve Coogan as the husband with a penchant for exhibitionism; Hugh Dancy as a creepy artist turned cultist; and Adam Scott as Rudd&apos;s long lost brother — not literally, he just has the same presence.\n\n&quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; is a comedy, one of those heart-warming comedies, where all of the characters start coming around to see the value of having Ned in their life. It takes them longer than us to realize his positive aspects because most of them are not fully-developed characters, especially the mother, I&apos;m not sure what the point of her was.\n\nUnfortunately, it&apos;s not a particularly funny comedy, but it is a likable one. A few ill-fated groin jokes would have been better off in a different movie, and a few jokes lost their humour after they appeared in the trailer, and after that there&apos;s only a few left to discover. It is funny, but not as funny as you would expect a comedy to be. But did I mention likable? Because that&apos;s what &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; is: sweet, charming and overall appealing.",

The film experiments with sound, overlapping dialogue and using crowd noise as a plot element.\n\nThe two standout actors are Walter Huston and a pre-stardom Boris Karloff. Anytime either of them walks on screen, everyone else just evaporates. Huston does a great job making the audience love and despise his character. And Karloff is just mesmerizing as Galloway, a convict hell-bent on vengeance.\n\nNo masterpiece, but it is an early sign of Hawks&apos; genius. And I would take it over Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940) any day of the week.",

It&apos;s about the night crew at Walnut Lake Supermarket being stalked down by a killer one night at work--the last night, before the store closes. The story takes just a little to get going, but it&apos;s entertaining the whole time. The killings seem to go pretty quickly, and the climax is fantastic! I just love the setting. I didn&apos;t particularly think ALL those freaky camera angles were so great. (ie: in the phone, under the sweeping broom) But some were really cool. Anyhow, I definitely recommend this for at least the great climax. The conclusion is a little unsatisfying, but still pretty good. Great movie!"

      "reviewBody": "Based on a true story and directed by Robert Siodmak, &quot;Escape from East Berlin&quot; is an uneven film about a real-life military chauffeur living in East Berlin (played by Don Murray) who, with the help of family and friends, digs a tunnel in order to escape to West Berlin.\n\nIt&apos;s probable that with several story changes, &quot;Berlin Tunnel 21,&quot; made in 1981, is based on the same true story. I found that film far more suspenseful. However, since the Siodmak film was made around the time that the wall was erected, it captures the atmosphere better. The film begins with a little bit of history, too, which would be interesting to those new to the material.\n\nIt looks as if &quot;Escape from East Berlin&quot; was made on a shoestring budget, as some of it seems rushed, and the subplot of Christine Kaufman, as a young woman who hides in the Schroder household and wants to escape with them, seems to have been dropped. Unless I missed it, there is no follow-up as far as her family.\n\nDon Murray heads a German cast that includes Werner Klemperer, and the film was done on location in Berlin. Murray smartly just hints at an accent. Of course one assumes all of these people are actually speaking German.\n\nCertainly this film captures the claustrophobia of those trapped behind the wall and the poor conditions under which they had to live. Definitely worth seeing, though for a nail-biting version of the same story, check out &quot;Berlin Tunnel 21.&quot;",

Emma and Irma have just returned from a meeting with the Pope, who admires their religious embroidery, when their nephew, Massimo Serato, shows up, fleeing from his widowed father. Emma and Irma spoil him in their tight-fisted way; he is young, attractive, gets into scrape with women, and spends what he imagines he will inherit.\n\nDirector Ferdinando Maria Poggioli&apos;s movie -- he also edited it -- is about the idiosyncratic expressions of love, and how it never works out as we envision.Serato is heedless, self-centered and really turns out to care for the very people he mistreats. His youthful egotism cannot encompass the pain he brings to other, even as his own pride and delusional belief that he does not care about money, only the things that money can buy, inevitably destroy his own vision of how things should work out. His spinster aunts worry about him and hate how he treats them, but inevitably give way, even as the more worldly one resists. Yet for everyone, it is the tribulations of life that force us to live.",

Which is quite distracting and keeps you from really getting into the movie.\n\nO yeah and then there&apos;s the sound editing.

In particular they want to check out a fabulous waterfall known as &quot;Bride&apos;s Waterfall&quot; (which is also another title for this film) that can supposedly grant a person&apos;s wish. Anyway, although it once had a fish canning factory on it, the company relocated and the island is now totally deserted. At least, that&apos;s what the group thinks. What they don&apos;t realize is that there is a masked psychopath who has been living alone on the island and when he spies the young explorers decides to kill them off one by one. Of course, this is hardly a novel concept as this scenario has been played out many times in many different ways. Some better and some worse. What this particular film has going for it is the beautiful scenery and the equally beautiful women in the cast who the director (Rizal Mantovani) has attired as skimpily as possible for an excellent effect. I especially liked Jenny Cortez (as &quot;Stacy&quot;) and Tyas Mirasih (&quot;Amy&quot;) in addition to the aforementioned Tamara Blezinski. Be that as it may, while this film has plenty of sexy women it doesn&apos;t have any actual nudity or scenes involving sex. But it does have some gore and a torture scene which might grab the attention of some people. All in all, if a person likes a horror film in the splatter category then they may want to check this one out.",

This film exhibits a dangerous trend in films today where the mentality of the 90&apos;s is transposed onto the 40&apos;s.  Directors and screenwriters would be well advised to do more homework on the period in which their films take place.

      "reviewBody": "Steve is a 17 year boy, still in school.  He has long since decided he is gay but only meets men in the park for sex.  When one of the people he meets in the park toilets turns out to be none other than the hunky head boy, Steve is unsure where he stands.  However their relationship grows into lovers and they both balance the feelings brought around by secrecy and feeling like no one understands.\n\nFrom the sparky opening and good sense of humour, I had expected this film would just be another in the line of Richard Curtis-lite style of British romantic comedies.  Indeed it does have this feel to it throughout - it has some good songs on the soundtrack and much of it is funny in that bittersweet way that British rom-coms seem to have claimed as their own. However what made this such a good film is the fact that it is a lot more sensitive and moving than most of this genre ends up being.  The plot may well drag a little at times, but it never really seems unrealistic or dull.\n\nThe characters are part of the reason it does so well.  It is rare in the mainstream to see gay characters portrayed fairly and without caricature - HBO&apos;s 6 Feet Under is one of the rare ones, but this does as well.  I wish that all those who hold up `Will &amp; Grace&apos; as a milestone in gays in the mainstream could all sit and see how much better it is when done like this! The dialogue is good and none of the characters are fake or pointless.  Of course some react the way you expect them to, but the fact that they have been drawn well stops them being lazy - just broad.  The film is weak in some pretty important areas however.  The main one being the lack of relationship between Steven and John - I never saw them together and all they had in common is their sexuality.\n\nThe cast do pretty well with the characters, even if some of them are being held up by the good script.  Silverstone is great in the lead - he gives a really low key performance that even extents to his `speech&apos; scene - where he could have really hammed it up some.  Gorton is not as good but does do sterling work.  The support cast are mixed although all do their jobs ably enough.\n\nOverall this is a great little film that will never get the same success as the Richard Curtis comedies from which it borrows a bit of it&apos;s style, however the script is really strong and it is quite unarming in how well it deals with the issues without cliché or lazy caricature of characters."

The supporting cast is unmatched--including great performances by Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond.  Look closely for Ken Curtis (Festus, from Gunsmoke) in an uncredited role.  The scenery is absolutly breathtaking--it makes me want to go home to Ireland--and I&apos;m not even Irish.  To top it off The Quiet Man has the greatest fist fight ever captured on film.  This is one of my two favorite John Wayne movies.  The Duke should have gotten an Oscar for this one.  Movie viewers won&apos;t be disapointed by this one.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in December 1985 after watching the film on Vestron video cassette.\n\n&quot;Blastfighter&quot; is a routine action picture, filmed in Georgia in 1983 by Italian filmmakers. Unreleased theatrically, it is now available Stateside in home video format.\n\nYank actor Michael Sopkiw (of &quot;After the Fall of New York&quot;) toplines as Tiger, a cop on the Atlanta police force just released from a lengthy prison term for killing the thug who murdered his wife and partner (but couldn&apos;t be proved guilty in court).\n\nReturning to his small hometown in Georgia, Tige soon runs afoul of th young Good Ole Boys tere, who are mistreating animals -they hunt deer and other forest denizens but do not kill them, delivering them seriously wounded to a local Hong Kong-derived merchant who requires live animals to fabricate medicine and aphrodisiacs from their innards. Tiger tries to run the H. K. dude out of town and stop the cruelty to animals, but as a result the heavie kill his pet deer and terrorize him.\n\nMatters deteriorate further when Tiger i hiking in the woods with his grownup daughter and two friends -the locals kill the friends and later shoot down his daughter, precipitating a fight-to-the-death climax. Film&apos;s title derives from a high-tech rifle Tiger uses in the final reel, which blasts out fireballs rather than conventional ammunition.\n\nCast is personable, especially Sopkiw and Valerie Blake as his attractive, feisty daughter, but the crudely postsynched dialog stamps this effort as an Italian import rather than an All-American picture. Dumb, inconclusive ending involving a shootout between Sopkiw and Italian thesp Geroger Eatman (duo previously teamed in &quot;After the Fall of New York&quot;) is very disappointing.\n\nOddest touch here, perhaps a first, is a pseudonym used for the director&apos;s credit. Lamberto Bava helmed the picture, but is credited as &quot;John Old, Jr.&quot;; his late father Mario Bava occasionally used the Anglicized name John Old with the fake moniker apparently handed down."

      "reviewBody": "I remember my intense eagerness to see this film. I wasn&apos;t entirely sure why at the time but when I finally saw it in 1990 I was devastated and soon addicted to this sad tale of city life spiralling out of control.  Its a film with an epic quality and a grand, sweeping style that turns the city scape into a character in itself. This was Uli Edel&apos;s (as he was then known) classic and it remains  a remarkably strong film.  Its not pretty and doesn&apos;t hold back in revealing the light and dark of its characters.  Brutal it may be, but there is something vital and alive seething in this movie with anger and pain. Its source is Hubert Selby Jr&apos;s  novel. I believe its a superior adaptation.\n\nThe film is based around a union strike which threatens to cripple the city of Brooklyn in the 1950s. The film focuses several characters; Harry, the troubled union leader struggling to come to terms with his desires for other men and his  gender-bending lover against the anger, aggression and hypocrisy of  the era; a woman, TraLaLa, who sells her body for money but finds herself committing the ultimate crime of her profession by falling for a client - an army man destined to hurt her; a family with a daughter pregnant out of wedlock; a gang of aimless young men hungry  for trouble; and a young teen looking for love in TraLaLa.\n\nIts a film full of fascinating performances which reinforce the greatness of this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh burst into the spotlight with her startling performance as TraLaLa. She embodies the role with unceasing honesty and vigour. It is her  late scenes in the film which rip at the heart, especially when she finds compassion in an unlikely source at the worst of moments.  Her portrayal doesn&apos;t seek sympathy - on the contrary Jennifer Jason Leigh gets deep inside the cruel and manipulative character to reveal the hope beneath without a false note. Peter Dobson, Stephen Baldwin are a brilliant combination as the thugs and Alexis Arquette is remarkable as their taunted worshipper, Georgette.  Ricki Lake, Sam Rockwell and Stephen lang also excel in a great ensemble film.\n\nI can still picture vividly the majesty and intensity of the strike  riot and the water spraying at the wire fence as strikers confront the police.\n\nThere are many great scenes such as this which combined with striking performances and an unflinching script and score make Last Exit to Brooklyn a modern masterpiece. This is a highly underrated film, mainly because of the view that the subject matter is too seamy, grotesque and extreme. And there is no doubt this is a confronting, violent and provocative film experience. Unfortunately, because of this widely heralded view, many people are missing out on an unacknowledged classic. Don&apos;t miss out."

What I thought was amateurish about it turned out to be the sound. The ever present ocean seems to add to the sound quality as if the viewer were really there, experiencing what actually happened.\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of Oliver Platt&apos;s best roles.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the intriguing Mr.Fawkes.  Lee Evans was also unbelievably riveting in his portrayal as the mentally disturbed young man.\n\nThis film is very representative of the small town in Britain with it&apos;s quiet undisturbed population that seems to be frozen in time, in contrast to Fawkes&apos;s father&apos;s life in America, which is busy and ever-changing, where the most important thing in life is money, as opposed to memories being just as important back in the small British town.\n\nThe best part of the film is watching (in small parts) the unravelling of the horrific event that had happened so many years before and turned the young man (played by Lee Evans) into the person he is today.\n\nA riveting watch.  See it."

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who calls this film superficial, banal or trivial has spectacularly missed the point and is exactly the same type of person who was levelling precisely the same kind of criticism at La Vita è Bella. Now, though I do like Benigni (in my opinion La Vita è Bella is a masterpiece and films like Il Piccolo Diavolo, Johnny Stecchino and Il Mostro are exceedingly worthy comedies - that said I thought Pinocchio was an expensive disaster), I will try to be as objective as possible. In La Tigre e la Neve, Benigni repeats the masterfully delicate feat he accomplished in La Vita è Bella: he touches on complex, spikey issues (in La Vita è Bella it was the holocaust, here we have the war in Iraq) in a fable-like, simple manner - he doesn&apos;t politicise the film, and he doesn&apos;t delight in the gruesome (and very real) aspects of war. Yet this is NOT trivialisation of the subject matter. To believe that is to believe that the true horrors of war (or the holocaust) can only be conveyed on the screen by a documentary-style approach, and that cannot be the case. Benigni is far more effective - he does not shock the audience with visual representations of war, but his comedy in the face of war creates a subtle paradox that makes the whole film even more touching. La Tigre e La Neve is a fable about love, love in the face of adversity, stubborn optimism, hope and desperation and relationships between people of different races and creeds. Don&apos;t expect to see a Michael Moore rant at the injustice of war - Benigni is far more subtle. Perhaps the only criticism I have is that Nicoletta Braschi&apos;s performance is not always one hundred percent convincing, but Benigni and Reno more than make up for it. I truly hope it makes it on an international level - definitely a film to watch.",

After, a little convincing attempt in the comedy with &quot;Paroles et Musique&quot; (1984) and a failed incursion in the thriller with &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (1987) which made the object of an American remake in 2004, he chose to tell the story of a family with numerous members drowned in their sentimental problems. Through the presented topic, the director was inspired by Claude Lelouch&apos;s cinema (Chouraqui has earned his spurs as an assistant producer with the latter). As a matter of fact, &quot;les marmottes&quot; is especially worth for its band of actors. From Daniel Gélin to Virginie Ledoyen (it was one of her first major roles) through Gérard Lanvin, Chouraqui invited a concentrate of well-known actors coming from different generations. Their talent is sufficient to make up the characters&apos; lack of depth and the director&apos;s impersonal style.\n\nIf you are a fan of Lelouch&apos;s and Sautet&apos;s cinema, that is to say if you are fond of sentimental movies, try this film. Otherwise, skip it.",

Well, yes, it is a little pretentious, and there are spots that move along too slowly, so you can&apos;t just &quot;let it happen&quot; as you do with most movies. This one requires you to pay attention.\n\nIt includes what must be the longest single pan to the side ever filmed. I&apos;m not sure how long it was, but it went on forever. I guess it must have gone more than 360 degrees, circled back to the original spot, where new sets had replaced the old. I&apos;m not sure. But it is dazzling. Actually, you can take virtually any frame from this movie and make it into a poster.\n\nFilms have been around for about a century, and there isn&apos;t much around that doesn&apos;t recycle old material. Peter Greenaway is an exception. Like him or not, he&apos;s a dyed-in-the-wool original."

      "reviewBody": "Before watching &quot;Vinyan&quot;,I read some comments of IMDb users. Most of all said that the movie is a crap, that nobody should waste one hour and a half of your life watching it. Well, I guess that I saw some other movie.\n\nFirst of all, the comparisons with David Lynch&apos;s works are not fair. Vinyan takes a direction that Lynch never got on his works (an original approach to ghost stories). So, don&apos;t believe if you read that this movie is a bad copy of Lynch&apos;s works.\n\nFabrice du Welz shows again why he&apos;s a great director,a truly great horror director (how can some critics call Darren Lynn Bousman, Eli Roth an Rob Zombie the &quot;horror directors of the new generation&quot;?). The atmosphere of his craft is fabulous, he manages to make the tension and insanity grow slowly and steadily.\n\nAnother great achievement of Welz is documentary feel that he impressed with his direction. The locations of the movies are also great, big and mysterious jungles, like if they were abyss that you just enter, but never leaves them.\n\nEmanuelle Béart,with his explosive beauty, and Rufus Sewell give great performances. The process of disintegration of their marriage showed by them as they delve into the jungle is awesome.\n\nFinally, this is the kind of movie that, before you try to comprehend it, you must feel it.\n\nIf you like it, watch &quot;Calvaire&quot;, Welz&apos;s previous work, a real horror gem.",

Most critics have said this is Burt Reynolds finest performance. It has some very touching moments that we could all relate to, and there are some very funny moments as well.\n\nJill Clayburgh is perfect as a normal, not so young, woman that you could run across anywhere. If this movie was made today, they would have cast a gorgeous 18 year old, with big lips that couldn&apos;t act.\n\nCandice Bergen, who is gorgeous, steals the show, with a hilarious scene involving her singing. The movie has aged some, and as a previous writer said, &quot;would never be made today.&quot; But for me, that statement is complimentary to this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "All too often, &quot;family films&quot; are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\n\n&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the &quot;world&quot; of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\n\n&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It&apos;s sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)\n\nP.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan&apos;s character in &quot;Amateur&quot;.  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself.",

The Italian writer Luigi MALERBA (1927-2008), who wrote novels such as &quot;LE MASCHERE / The Naked Masks&quot; and &quot;FANTASMI ROMANI / Roman Ghosts&quot;, was involved in the award-winning script.

Three young men leave their village in Niger for a 3-month visit to coastal Ghana, where they find odd jobs and earn enough cash to buy gifts to take back to their families.\n\nAlong the way they come across beautiful savannas, forests, hills, and an interesting village or two. Waiting in Ghana are teeming marketplaces, a gold mine, the ocean, and lots of opportunities to generally live free and easy.\n\nThis film offers an idyllic view, from a young man&apos;s standpoint, of West African life in the mid-1960&apos;s, about five years after independence, with the harsh aspects of reality removed. It&apos;s a highly selective, upbeat view that shows off some of the most touching and picturesque aspects of life in that era of post-independence West Africa.\n\nDirector Rouch&apos;s most amazing feat is assembling a huge number of more- or-less spontaneous clips that together give an impression--a partial and idealized one--of cultural diversity and the joy of living in West Africa.",

It had been on my list of wanna sees for years as it had won a major Oscar for Best Director- Frank Borzage.It was one of those tantalizing early talkies that had not actually been lost it had merely fell from sight. When I finally saw it last year at a Borzage revival, the film was a revelation.It was a pre-code delight about an ordinary couple, falling in love, struggling financially and having a baby etc.It most reminded me of the great silent film-The Crowd, which dealt with similar matters. What was especially fascinating to me was its depiction of &quot;average&quot; lower middle class types and how they lived and spoke in Depression America. The apartments... the slang, all of it, seemed real. It wouldn&apos;t be until the 50&apos;s neo realism hit American movies that we would see ordinary people depicted on the screen again, without condescension The movie has all the Borzage trademarks- love surviving against all odds, even an exciting if a little hokey climax.Unfortunately, the film has been slighted often in movie books,most likely, because the authors have never actually seen it. If it is ever shown again, try to see it. It&apos;s a wonderful peek at average city folks in Depression America.",

      "reviewBody": "Enjoyable rental for longtime Bud Spencer enthusiasts , but only for Carlo Perdesoli fans . Sympathetic and rogue Bull Webster (Bud Spencer) is a taxi driver with some work problems on his hands : the Spider Corporation , a huge financial holding company , has decided to buy out his taxi co-operative in order to make it go bankrupt and purchase its terrains at a low cost . Bull is almost driven to desperation by his pregnant daughter and kidnapped wife (Madden) , but then he finds the help an Angel , Victor (Thierry Lhermitte) , sent by Holy Brother (Jean Sorel) , as well as a winning ticket in his pocket to a lottery with the biggest prize of all time : $150 million! . With money like that , he can afford to make his contenders spoil his scheme , but then the valuable ticket is missing and Bull is looking relentlessly for his coat . But at this point , Bull&apos;s future starts to interest those responsible for the destiny of human affairs : The appearance of a nasty but beautiful demon (Carl Alt) sent by Lucifer (Ian Bannen) from Inferno and a likable Angel from heaven , these roles in earthly happenings create a bemusing mess . \n\nA light , plain and supernatural comedy that joins again Spencer/Carlo Perdesoli and director Barboni . It displays a fantasy plot in which Heaven and Hell send an Angel called Victor : Thierry Lhermitte and a Devil called Verónica : gorgeous Carol Alt to tempt Bud Spencer into evil or to convince him to do good . The simple story and the acting are up to Spencer standard , but lacks the punch and style from precedent and intimate films . It deals with a maze of situations that are funny , amusing , disconcerting , full of action , including lots of car chases and automobile crashes . Storyline is a little bit ridiculous but has its enjoyable moments here and there . It boasts a fine support cast as Carol Alt , Thierry Lhermitte , Ian Bannen , Jean Sorel and brief appearance from Riccardo Pizzuti , ordinary in Hill/Spencer movies . As always , Spencer will confront enemies by means of continuous struggles without blood . The fights are with no violence and predominates comedy and parody , the choreographic quarrels are slights and clean , along with cars crashes and the drivers flying to each others cars . Bud Spencer is nice as a corpulent , bouncing and grumpy Cab man but with good heart . Bud , the popular Latin movie actor who starred in innumerable spaghetti Westerns and action-packed potboilers during the 1960s and &apos;70s, was born Carlo Pedersoli (1929) in Naples. He was the first Italian to swim the 100 meter freestyle and competed as a swimmer at the Olympic games . He appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&apos;s epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in 1951 . He changed his screen name to &quot;Bud Spencer&quot; in 1967, as a homage to Spencer Tracy and to the American beer Budweiser . Teaming up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, the two made such international successes as I Quattro dell&apos;Ave Maria (1968) by Colizzi . Their ¨Trinity and Bambino¨ dual outings made both stars famous , particularly in Europe . In all, Spencer made 18 movies with Hill . After appearing in ¨Crazy plane¨ (1972) and owned an air transport company , Mistral Air , which he founded in the 80s . After 1983 , Spencer&apos;s movie career slowed down , though he did have a big success in the early 1990s with the TV action-drama ¨Extralarge¨ . The picture was realized twenty years later the famous Hill/Spencer movies , however this recent version was a flop because of ¨Trinity¨ time had passed . Lousy and horrible musical score composed by synthesizer . Very bad cinematography Alfio Contini , a perfect remastering being extremely necessary because of the film-copy is worn-out.\n\nThe motion picture was produced by the known Silvio Berlusconi and middlingly directed by E B Clucher . He began operating as a cameraman , and in 1961 became director of photography with the film ¨Rómulo and Remo¨, following : ¨Son of Spartacus¨, ¨Gidget Goes to Rome¨, ¨Il Monaco Di Monza¨ , ¨Django¨ , &quot;Django, Prepare a Coffin&quot; , ¨Massacre at Grand Canyon¨, and many others . At the same time he began to work as a screenwriter . The passage to the director , with the pseudonym of E.B. Clucher -Clucher was the grandmother&apos;s last name- came in 1970 with a &quot;traditional&quot; Western , ¨Ciakmull¨ that was not very successful . In the same year he directed the cult-movie ¨A man Called Trinity¨ with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer and Barboni conducted the follow-up in 1971 ¨Trinity is still my name¨ or ¨They continued to call it Trinity¨ and subsequently , many years later , ¨Troublemakers¨ . Among the keys to success there is certainly the irony brought to the rigid western and cold genre . So after the first and second film with Triniti/Bambino , Barboni went on filmmaking , which will also be huge commercial successes with other Hill/Spencer vehicles as &quot;Man of the East&quot; , ¨Crime Busters¨, ¨Renegado Jim¨ , &quot;Go for It&quot; who also wrote , along with Marco Barboni, the subject and the screenplay . The success of these films went beyond any expectation , resulting in one of the greatest collections of the time . If you are a fan of the 1972/1973 Trinity and other Hill/Spencer movies , you will enjoy this later release as a sort of beloved return . Although , if you have no history with the originals , I highly recommend you pick up the Trinity movies first . The film provided a nostalgic and familiar return to the agreeable and beloved Spencer role and is only for the hardcore fans .",

These two brothers were so real and the actors poignantly played their characters. They were human in their responses to the challenges in their lives and how they supported each other. Integrity and love prevail. The &quot;accidental heroes&quot; that help them along the way remind us how we all long to be heroes ourselves. That&apos;s why Clemente grabs our admiration. He revealed the triumph of the human spirit in so many ways - his enormous talent, humility and compassion for others on and off the field. C3K would be such a cool movie to have in the theaters this summer. I could see whole Little League teams going to see it together. Iloved the music. C3K did a great job in capturing the period.",

The film exceeded the boundaries of good taste that always epitomized British cinema.\n\n This superbly shot, deeply disturbing, complex, often pretentious, often brilliant parable of confused identity was the first feature directed by leading cinematographer Roeg, sharing the credit with artist Cammell.\n\n An eerily plausible Fox, cast against type, plays Chas, a sadistic gangster on the run who rents a room in the Notting Hill Gate home of Turner (Jagger), a reclusive, sexually ambiguous, washed-up rock star. Fox, his antithesis, is offered women and magic mushrooms before literally swapping personalities with the singer. \n\nFox abandoned the cinema for almost a decade after this film, such was its effect on him. \n\n\n\nVerdict A dazzling, ideas-rich, extraordinarily inventive full-stop to the 60s"

This look is done through the eyes of the last &quot;Ossi&quot; who had spend these very years in prison and is now released to a country  he only knows from television. But even this is a quite extreme setting, the movie makes no big deal of it. It tells every thing that&apos;s needed to tell and nothing more. It concentrates on details but constructs a subtle image of a whole society, a snapshot. Beside this, it&apos;s very well acted and made with love for it characters. Therefore it seems believable. All in all, I highly recommend this one to all, interested in the fact, that there still is more than one Germany, but also to all who just want to see a nice and human movie about the difficulties of finding ones way back into society.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve met a handful of war veterans throughout my life and, though none of them (to my knowledge) sustained permanent injuries in combat, I&apos;ve heard about plenty of other soldiers they fought with who weren&apos;t as fortunate. Even after a war ends, its impact on those who survived it will still be felt for years to come. And for the soldiers depicted in this film, throughout the remainder of their lives. Throughout the film, we see numerous soldiers with missing limbs, missing eyeballs, and deformed facial features. Though it&apos;s not an easy watch, my main takeaway was how it found poetry amidst the grotesqueness. While the footage of the soldiers and children is obviously far from uplifting, Gianikian and Ricci Lucchi illustrate the ways those people can go through surgery to either reconstruct or replace what they lost and make the best with what body parts they have left, even if they can&apos;t be made whole again. One particularly powerful sequence was a montage of close ups of various soldier&apos;s deformed faces. This sequence really tested my endurance as, not only were the deformities quite graphic to look at, but each face was focused on for an uncomfortably long time. The film followed up on this though with various close ups of soldiers who presumably went through facial reconstruction surgery as they hold up a plaster of what they originally looked like. Their scars are still visible if you look closely, but given the prior montage, this one comes as a relief. Other powerful sequences included characters performing everyday tasks, like a farmer tending to his crops with a robotic arm, while another powerful sequence showed a close up of a man having a fake eye put in place of a disfigured eye. After his procedure, I honestly couldn&apos;t tell the difference between his real and fake eye at all. I finished the film over an hour ago, yet I&apos;m still trying to make sense of the emotions it made me feel. In spite of the constant barrage of graphic injuries onscreen, it strangely felt hopeful. The people onscreen lost so much in the war, yet the worst is over for them and things will start to look up. If I had to nitpick something, this might&apos;ve been better had Stan Brakhage directed it. Some of the music choices seemed jarring and unnecessary. This is the kind of film where the emotional resonance of the imagery speaks for itself, so I don&apos;t think it needed a soundtrack. Aside from this, however, I quite enjoyed this film and may return to it sometime in the future.",

As a director, Sembène made full use of all minor as well as major incidents described in his book to depict a nation where some corrupt as well as influential politicians are shown to make merry while ignoring the plight of ordinary, poor Senegalese people who find it difficult to come out of &apos;vicious circle&apos; of poverty. Apart from his scathing assault on rampant corruption which unnerved Senegalese people immediately after their country&apos;s independence from France, Sembène directed all his anger at two principal scourges : cultural alienation and economic impotence. Although &quot;Xala&quot; has been classified as a comedy by many film critics, its political message cannot be overlooked. It is the reading of this message which would enable us to comprehend why the fortunes of some African countries were used by their leaders to further their own cause.",

Four girlfriends (up to five at one point as we learn in the sequel), able to stop his heart, master of combat techniques, uses two wolfhounds and a GSD to greet guests and escort them in (dog lovers, note the GSD&apos;s silver colouration, a rare combo with black in the US -- and note that a black and tan GSD is used in the sequel), forensic science genius, private jet owner, philosopher... the list goes on.\n\nThis is a fun film with plenty of outright silly moments. No more or less silly than James Bond films or even The Saint, the difference being Connery and Moore&apos;s characters appear to take themselves and their work much more seriously than Coburn&apos;s Flint does -- and with good reason. His clothing, made of fibres not found in nature on this planet, is at least three sizes two small; his pantlegs are configured for an imminent flood; his hairstyle rivals that of any British Invasion band member; his attitude toward women is similar to that of Alexis Zorbas (special albeit frail creatures that must be respected and loved); his shrieks and cries during hand-to-hand combat make Bruce Lee sound like Caruso.\n\nRecommended!"

Truthful and powerful even when he plays characters that are the opposite of truthful, the opposite of powerful that even don&apos;t seem to be there. &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; reminds us. He&apos;s one of the greatest American actors of his or any other generation. His face when he realizes he lost the little boy will haunt me forever. At the Golden Globes, in his devastating charismatic, humble way he thanked his parents. I thank them too Jeff, you are a wonder.",

      "reviewBody": "James Stewart in his brief &quot;fubsy&quot; period directed by Henry Koster with whom he worked several times successfully, most notably &quot;Harvey&quot;. Stewart plays Theadore Honey, a brilliant aeronautical engineer who has discovered a flaw in the design of a new airplane that will result in its tail falling off after a certain number of air hours. This British film is somewhat forgotten, but stands up beautifully in today&apos;s contemporary commercial air scene. A very winning and complex characterization by Stewart reminds us that although he was always &quot;himself&quot;, he had great range. A poignant performance by Janette Scott as his daughter Elspeth is perfectly complementary and, indeed, the father-daughter relationship is a major theme that helps take this film to a higher level. Glynis Johns is an air-hostess/nurse who answers the call of the script believably. Marlene Dietrich smokes her way through scenes as, well, Marlene Dietrich and creates a character thats an odd comment on today&apos;s celebrity patronesses. Lots of other good British actors like Jack Hawkins add heft.\n\nA very satisfying movie with a flight that will keep you white-knuckled.",

I didn&apos;t expect to enjoy it when I read about the plot.  Farm workers?  How could that be interesting... But oh, the haunting, heavenly silence of the fields undulating in the wind, a silence not sundered by any garish music. Everything about this film is tangible, real, alive.  The dialogue is sparse, believable, the bond between Bill and Abby is one of quiet passion that needs no dramatic proclamations to fuel it.  And Sam Shepard&apos;s farmer is touching.  I don&apos;t use that word very often, but I&apos;ll venture it here. I have watched this film now several times, and it is a delight each time when the farmer first sees Abby.  This perhaps the strongest and most believable love triangle ever put to film, and in my opinion, the most compelling.",

It is not like other horror movies because in the first one, the mask was different, other horror movies have the same masks for all the sequels that they have.\n\nI think that the return of Reese was good because she is able to understand Amy, in what is happening to her, when she realises that something is wrong, because of what happened the last time.\n\nAlso, Rebecca Gayheart&apos;s return at the end was excellent. I think that was a great surprise. I didn&apos;t expect to see Rebecca in the sequel before I knew, she had a cameo appearance. Not all horrors do that either. Even though the killer is different. The killer from the first one is in the second.\n\nWell this movie is great and I hope all of you enjoy it too!"

Not only did Griffin lose out on his fortune but he lost his mind too.  Eventually, Griffin escapes from a mental institution and returns to England.  By chance (or the stroke of the writer&apos;s pen) Griffin encounters Dr. Drury, a screwball scientist in search of a weirdo to test out his new invisibility formula.  Griffin sees invisibility as a chance to get the vengeance he craves.  So the demented doctor gives him the obligatory injection.\n\nThis is a long way from the quality of the original 1933 film, with Claude Rains.  There are a few familiar special effects but Leon Errol&apos;s attempts to provide comic relief meet with mixed results.  It soon becomes apparent that the film has nothing going for it other than invisibility as a gimmick. The plot is wafer thin and poorly written.  There is little action to speak of just a lot of standing around and talking or sitting around and talking. Clearly, this was an exercise to squeeze a few more dollars out of an aging franchise.  On the bright side, there are some decent invisibility effects, like when the invisible man dunks his hand into a fish tank or covers his face in flour.  That&apos;s not enough to recommend this film however."

While never explained, there is an assumption that our characters are the ragtag remaining few after some sort of devastating event or disease. The production avoids the cliché of a stark-devastated landscape in favor of one simply devoid of other people. The beauty of this piece lies in the fact that we find ourselves caring deeply about all the characters, despite their actions. A scene of one of our main character finding an old abandoned bathtub and taking a bath is both beautiful and sad at the same time. The most astonishing aspect of this film is that it manages to capture both the subtleties and personalities of a small cast without ever saying a word. There are no huge scenes and no hokey miming. Yet, we worry for the characters. I admit to being something of an easy mark but this film really touched me. I screened it for a film festival and have proceeded to tell people about it for months. It has managed to stay with me in a way that most of the recent mainstream releases (even when I enjoyed them) have not."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a fun spooky movie with a different look and without the usual nighttime menace. It&apos;s also an independent production that managed some notoriety, mainly for surprisingly impressive special effects. Actually, Equinox was sort of the Blair Witch Project of its daya bunch of unknowns hitting it lucky with a shoestring effort. If memory serves, the film even had a run at one of the prestige theatres along Hollywood Blvd. The effects are not so impressive by today&apos;s digital standards; however, by 1970&apos;s norms, they were the unexpected equal of any A-production.\n\nThe story itself is pretty well structured in flashback with an effective &quot;hook&quot; to get viewers interested. The plot doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense, but then it doesn&apos;t have to, since we&apos;ve got King Kong&apos;s albino brother, a castle that comes and goes, a lost book of the occult, and a shape-shifting forest ranger who&apos;s definitely not Smoky the Bear. Most of the scenes are well staged, except when the ranger gets in the girl&apos;s face, contorts his lips, and slobbers, in what I suppose was a wacky metaphor for supernatural sex. Sharp-eyed viewers may recognize Frank Bonner (Boers) from TV&apos;s WKRP in Cincinnati as Jim. He&apos;s easily the most accomplished of an uneven cast. \n\nIn fact there&apos;s an appearance of a time warp between the clothing fashions worn in the movie and the 1970 release date. In short, the hair styles and skinny pants of the movie are a long pre-Vietnam way from the bell-bottoms and long hair of counter-cultural 1970. I don&apos;t know what accounts for this apparent disparity unless release was held up for several years. Anyway, except for the rather hollow sound of the dialogue dubbing, this accomplished little indie remains an underground original."
