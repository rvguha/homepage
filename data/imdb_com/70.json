      "reviewBody": "I would like to begin by saying that this is most definitely not a bad a movie.  For anyone starved by the vapid potboilers showing today, this movie offers a refreshing change.  What it does not do, however, is distinguish itself in any positive way.\n\nMy main complaint with this film is its vapid intellectualism.  Quoting famous authors and using lots of fancy (even foreign) words is all good in principle, but when you fail to capture the secular humanism that all great art and literature represent you might as well be reading a McDonald&apos;s menu. To illustrate this, Jessica begins the film at a job she hates and with only the memories of a failed relationship.  She ends the film in another job she hates and with only the memories of another failed relationship. Where is the personal growth?  Why are we watching this?  The person that wrote this story seems to believe that simply because one relationship was hetero and the other homosexual, this somehow makes things different.  I do not draw such distinctions.\n\nAnother thing I did not like about the film was its poor characterizations. The arguments in the film are so trivial that it depends on deep characters to make us believe they are real.  I mean anyone that requires literature to get into the act of sex is really missing the point!  From a masculine point of view the entire sexual experimentation shown in the film is as bland and uninteresting as the men Jessica is shown dating.\n\nOne last comment I would like to make is that the thing this movie does best is bring itself down.  Routinely Jessica is told, &quot;You&apos;re too obsessed with perfection in others&quot;, and that is exactly true for the entire film.  She is also told &quot;you&apos;re too conservative sexually for this kind of lifestyle&quot;, and this is true as well.  What I would like to see is some kind change in Jessica to identify with these issues.  To use a quote, &quot;we must learn to be happy because of and not in spite of our flaws&quot;.  Rent Manhattan for a true thinking person&apos;s film, and leave this on the shelf."

      "reviewBody": "Inevitably, Scarface will be compared with the near-contemporary gangster films, Little Caesar and Public Enemy, and Paul Muni with their stars Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. What does it tell us about that era: that all three careers took off with portrayals of gang leaders? The three performances significantly differ. Robinson rises to the top by the use of a crafty intelligence as well as violence; Cagney by a type of shrewdness and personal charisma. Paul Muni&apos;s Tony Comonte is neither intelligent nor personable; his manners are crude; and at times he is almost childlike in his behavior: for instance, when he is enjoying a play and is interrupted after the second act, summoned to do another killing,and leaves a henchman behind, who can tell him later how it came out, then is delighted to hear that the &quot;guy with the collar&quot; didn&apos;t get the girl; rather, the rougher suitor. He can be described as cunning and animistic: a young wolf who eliminates any rival who stands in his way; finally the leader of the pack One can be moved by Robinson&apos;s last words, &quot;Is this the end of Little Caesar?&quot; or by Cagney&apos;s body falling through the open door of his family home, he having been killed off-screen. Comonte&apos;s death is that of a trapped or cornered animal, wordless in a beautifully staged sequence,as brutal as his life, depicted for the audience in every detail. Of the three portrayals, Muni&apos;s comes across to me as the most chilling, in its enactment of instinctive evil. How ironic that He would later win his greatest fame for his performances as Emile Zola and Louis Pasteur.",

      "reviewBody": "I have already seen quite a number of these so-called &quot;Dogma&quot;-movies, which are in general pretty good and mostly pretty strong stuff (the always revolve around human relationships and in most cases take place at family reunions, burials, parties or other meetings or get-together, where people can get &quot;out-of-control&quot;), but this is - at least in my humble opinion - one of the best and strongest of them.\n\nDirected by a female with absolute merciless, this one sets out to obviously destroy the last positive thoughts one could have about &quot;investment&quot;-bankers and I am notwithstanding to admit, that I hate the whole crowd. So when I saw this movie (about which I had never heard before) on the TV-program yesterday, I immediately decided to give it a try, despite it&apos;s late airing not much before midnight.\n\nAnd what I did get was more than what I had hoped for or dared to hope for: this movie is not so much about a party, which goes out of control (like the summary says), but about a bunch of people, who actually can&apos;t stand each other (at least most of them!), but who have been thrown together by fate in a business (and probably in a country), which does not take any prisoners, meaning where a person either &quot;succeeds&quot; or dies (economically and sometimes even physically). But this ain&apos;t a story about heroes, it&apos;s a story about emotional wrecks.\n\nThe whole movie, which runs app. 100 minutes, takes place at one setting, a big villa, and there are just 7 people in it (leaving aside people, who just appear for a few seconds), 3 (male) investment-bankers, 2 of them married, their wives, an au-pair-girl and the (pretty overweight) son of one of the 2 couples. But despite this rigid setting you won&apos;t find a boring moment in this movie! The get-together is set out as a party, organized by one of the married 2 investment-bankers, a hot-shot a few years ago, who wants to get a deal through with his boss (who seems to be pretty much of the same age), whom he has invited (together with his wife). The inviting couple has a highly overweight son, for whom the couple does not seem to care very much. Not a family, where you&apos;d wish to be born in, despite their enormous wealth. They also have an au-pair girl, who does not seem to have much to do, and who&apos;s involved in an unhappy love-affair with ... no, not with the inviting investment-banker, but with ... guess whom! The invited investment-banker (with his pretty overweight wife) is a detestable person, but obviously this is a business, where you have to lick a persons ass regardless how despicable he is. He brings another young investment-banker to the party, who must have seen or read Tom Wolfe&apos;s BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES and considers himself as one of those cool mega-deal-makers.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the party it is clear that none of the involved persons has any positive feelings towards any of the other persons, maybe except the inviting couple towards their au-pair-girl, for whom they seem to care (at least at the beginning). None of the investment-bankers like or at least respect each other and the same goes for the two wives, although all these people are in fact of very similar character and nature. It is just a question of time, until they clash at each other and that&apos;s exactly what happens as the movie starts to unfold.\n\nI won&apos;t tell more about the dialog and quarrel, which then starts out, except that this is a highly recommendable movie. Although I usually fall asleep during midnight-movies I easily stayed awake through the whole 100 minutes without getting tired for a second. This movie really has a punch, so IF you have a chance to see this - obviously rarely shown - movie, take the time and see it, you won&apos;t regret it.\n\nI give this 10 out of 10 points, although more critical viewers might rate it lesser (but I&apos;d say every viewer who likes dogma-movies would give this certainly an 8).",

Unfortunately the director couldn&apos;t make it due to family illness.\n\nOverall I felt the message was a bit muddled at times - particularly when Jeremy Irons visits the orphanages in Vietnam - and it dragged in parts. They spend an awful lot of time interviewing people involved in various incinerators around the world but the message is always the same so after a while it gets a bit boring. When they focus on the sea and the amount of plastic in it again they get different people to say the same thing which again gets a little irritating. Probably the most glaring example of this is the very beginning when it focuses on the trash mountain in Lebanon that is leaking into the sea. It alternates between long shots of the mountain, to Jeremy sitting on a trash covered beach looking pensive, then back to the mountain, then Jeremy.... I felt like standing up and going &quot;OK I GET IT!! LET&apos;S MOVE ON!!&quot; Having said that, Jeremy was a great choice of protagonist as he is both engaging and humane in terms of those that he encounters, and quite funny at times too. It ends on an optimistic note which is important for these kinds of documentaries as most of the content is fairly depressing. But I feel they could easily shaved at least 20 minutes off the running time without in any way affecting the narrative.",

      "reviewBody": "I read through a few of these reviews and the general analysis seemed to be that this movie sucks more than the lead character does in the back room of the Cheetah Club. Well, I guess if you take it at face value, it does.\n\n However, it&apos;s not meant to be taken that way (internally, with a glass of water?), and it&apos;s a shame that so many people did. Really, &apos;Showgirls&apos; is a campy, funny movie. It&apos;s a riot. And it&apos;s supposed to be.\n\nElizabeth Berkley, in the lead role, plays her part like an actress on one of those day-time soaps - which is probably exactly what Verhoeven wanted. She does everything dramatically. She sits down, dramatically; she takes off her jacket, dramatically; and if you watch closely enough you&apos;ll even see her eating fries dramatically.\n\nGina Gershon as femme fatale/lead dancer Cristal gives the best performance of the film. She obviously is in sync with the director and has a lot of fun with the part, and if you only watch it for one reason, watch it for her. Because, in the words of L&apos;Oreal, she&apos;s worth it. She&apos;s a great talent and it&apos;s a shame she&apos;s not recognised more widely.\n\nWould I recommend it? I don&apos;t know. It depends on your taste. If you&apos;re looking for a drama, go elsewhere. If you&apos;re looking for a quirky, funny movie, and you don&apos;t mind lots of naked ladies running around all over the place (yes, even if you&apos;re female - I am, and I liked it), go rent it. It might surprise you."

      "reviewBody": "DeVito is a hit-and-miss director. He&apos;s turned out some very good films and some very bad ones. Sometimes his satire just falls short (&quot;Death to Smoochy,&quot; for example); however, &quot;War of the Roses&quot; is his strongest directorial effort to date.\n\nIt&apos;s got everything - a clever script, great interaction between its two stars, exciting thrills, funny gags (without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity), and to top it all off, the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence, which is reminiscent of &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Rear Window.&quot; Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now, after many years together, bitter and at the end of their frustration. Deciding upon a divorce, they begin to split apart; however, negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose (Douglas) demands more from his wife, claiming it&apos;s his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside.\n\nDeVito turns in a performance as the narrator, and Oliver&apos;s lawyer, who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce. By the time the film has ended we&apos;ve seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity.\n\nThat&apos;s the crucial part of all this. Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable. Many times in DeVito&apos;s film, it isn&apos;t. &quot;Smoochy,&quot; for example, was clever satire at first, and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage.\n\n&quot;War of the Roses&quot; is more careful, and the arc is subtler. It&apos;s believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture.\n\nI&apos;d classify &quot;War of the Roses&quot; as one of the funniest, cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it&apos;s one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up. A cult film? Maybe; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance.",

      "reviewBody": "TEKNOLUST (3 outta 5 stars) Reading a synopsis of this movie you&apos;d think it was some strange-sounding porno... or a wacky comedy. A lonely, nerdy female scientist replicates herself into a trio of cybernetic copies. In order to live, these &quot;clones&quot; need regular doses of male chromosomes, found only in male sperm. So the eldest copy goes out into the world, collecting samples for the sustenance of her and her &quot;sisters&quot;. Yes, this definitely sounds like something that came out of the imagination of some sex-starved sci-fi nerd. Except... that the film was actually written and directed by a woman. So there is plenty of &quot;subtext&quot; and &quot;symbolism&quot; to &quot;legitimize&quot; a plot that sounds like it was dreamed up in &quot;Letters to Penthouse&quot;. Tilda Swinton is the main reason to watch this movie... she plays the scientist and the three copies and she does a great job of making each one of them a different character. Also there is one wacky scene where the three &quot;sisters&quot; are doing some weird interpretive dance (all on screen at the same time) that is just sublime! Unfortunately, except for Swinton, the acting is pretty awful. Actually, Jeremy Davies is okay playing a lovelorn copy guy who falls in love with one of the copies but all he really gets to do is make cute puppy eyes at Tilda. For a comedy... the tone of this movie seems awfully sombre at times. A quicker pace and some livelier dialogue might have helped this movie become a classic. As it is, it&apos;s an okay movie enlivened by the talent of Tilda Swinton.",

With this victory Graziano became world champion, something that did not last for long. Zale and Graziano met once again in 1948, and this time Zale finished his adversary with a knock out in the third round. Graziano wanted to come back in 1952 fighting against the famous Ray &quot;Sugar&quot; Robinson. In that fight, Graziano knocked down Robinson in the third round, but he recovered and finished with Graziano in the same third round. In any case, Graziano was a good boxer, and this bloody -violent sport put his life on the right track. Interesting to note that this was the first film (uncredited) in the career of the actor Steve McQueen. Sal Mineo again acted as a wrong young boy in New York. The actress Pier Angeli did a good work as Graziano&apos;s wife.",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock&apos;s &apos;Suspicion&apos; starts off as a slow moving silly romantic comedy before switching to a thriller. Hitchcock&apos;s style of narrating the story as the events unfold is brilliant as usual. Cary Grant turns on the charm button but it is Joan Fontaine who steals the show. Lina&apos;s increasing suspicion, confusion and despair as she discovers Johnnie&apos;s deadly secrets are skillfully displayed. Hitchcock maintains the element of suspense and increasing tension very well. However, it is the ending that is a let down and the only reason I can think of why such a closing was chosen was to fulfill the Hollywood &apos;happy ending&apos; standard. &apos;Suspicion&apos; could have been an excellent dark thriller had the ending been more plausible and made sense of all the preceding events. Yet, it remains a good job mostly because of the crafted way Hitchcock builds tension throughout the movie."

Structurally it is based on all the classical lovers comedies of Shakespeare or Wilde. The dialogue is funny. The film is well cast and well acted. The audience was laughing more than at any other of the ten or so screenings I sat through during the festival.\n\nSynopsis: a straight man, Caleb, who is striking out with girls takes a tip from his gay roommate to pretend he is gay in order to score better with women. Trouble starts when he is &apos;outed&apos; to a party of people and then becomes the object of a feral sex hunt by both gay men an fag hag women who want to &apos;turn him around.&apos; Ridiculous situation after another ensue culminating with an emotional and hilarious &apos;outing&apos; at a dinner party to his parents. Just as the ruse seems to overwhelm him, there is a resolution and happy ending for all (sound familiar?) I hope this one makes it to wider release.\n\nI agree with the 50% of viewers that gave it a 9 or 10.",

      "reviewBody": "An effective and efficient little film detailing the story of a military coup in an African country. This one&apos;s based on a novel by Frederick Forsyth, so it has more realism behind it than some I could mention, and as an added bonus the director is John Irvin, who later went on to make the equally authentic HAMBURGER HILL. This one stands out because it has an actual plot to it leading up to the big action scene at the end, and that alone makes it more original than 99% of the guys-on-a-mission type films that came out in the 1980s.\n\nChristopher Walken, twitchy and solemn, stands out in this early role as the hard-ass mercenary who&apos;s seen plenty of conflict over the years. Walken is a guy who seems to live and breathe his characters rather than the other way round, and he&apos;s one of the best things in this film. His trip to the made-up African nation of Zangora is fraught with peril and tension, and yet seems real throughout in the same way that a film like BLOOD DIAMOND had the ring of authenticity to it.\n\nThe violence that follows is expected yet none the less shocking for it, and even the character building exposition scenes back in the West are handled in such a way that you never lose interest in the proceedings. Then things shift up a gear for the pyrotechnic meltdown at the climax, which is more familiar to fans of action and war movies, but the strong storyline proceeding this moment makes it all the more full of impact.",

      "reviewBody": "This seems to me a fairly balanced look at the Venezuelan revolution, spearheaded by Hugo Chavez. Definitely something you should check out to allow you to form your own opinion. I can imagine this film being difficult to find in the US. I can also see how some ignorant American viewers might be unable to stomach the perception of the large amount of harm the USA has done to the world since the second world war - and especially in Latin America.\n\nI wish there had been a little more discussion of the issues separating the left and the right. I can understand that large corporations interested in maintaining power and money might be upset at the nationalization of the oil corporations - but those resources do belong to the folks that live there and should probably benefit them. As well, I am often astounded that rich and middle class people everywhere seem to think the poor are lazy and want to do nothing to pull themselves out of the holes they are in. That being said, I never saw any interviews or stories that specifically illustrated why the right was so opposed to helping the poor with medical clinics, helping to build farms that are self-sufficient or any other social or financial issues that separated either side.\n\nWhen you see the abject poverty in the barrios (in Caracas, the poor make up more than half the population) and nothing was done about it for decades, you have to think that the American backed elites really didn&apos;t understand that people - the majority - had had enough. The film does indicate the steps of revolution (historically all taken by the French, the Americans and the Spanish) and how it applies to the current situation.\n\nLove him or hate him. Chavez makes many excellent points in terms of humanities survival and extreme capitalism. If humanity continues on its present course, we are endangering our survival as a species.\n\nAnyway, check this film out and decide for yourself.",

The story is primarily told through the eyes of the little girls, and they go through the hard times of adjusting to a new life while learning loss and gain. There is a sense of magic and cultural identity in the film, and this makes it even much more touching when told through the eyes of the little girls who have had their lives turned upside down in the search for a new and better life in America. In some places, it is a little too sweet and magical, but I don&apos;t think it ruins the film because it is told through the eyes of the girl, and I am certain that many more immigrant families went through experiences like this and even worse than this. I also thought that the acting by the little girls was done well. It&apos;s a sweet film; it&apos;s a little sad, and it&apos;s magical. It just made me feel all warm inside. Go see it for yourself and see if you get caught up in the magic as much as I did.",

When he finds a relic of an ancient mask, he gets slightly more than he could have dreamt of; he becomes a cartoonish superhero and at last he can live out his desires; or not! \n\nThis film also introduced the very beautiful Cameron Diaz, and what man can forget her first screen appearance as she breezes in to the bank in all her splendour.\n\nHilariously funny, cracking special effects and a thoroughly entertaining story, the Mask is a winner people, and it&apos;s an absolute must-see for everyone who likes a bit of Jim Carrey madness.\n\n7/10",

If you don&apos;t have unduly high expectations, it&apos;s enjoyable enough. The consensus rating of 4-5 points (on a scale of 10) is about right.",

The apartment block is quite creepy as are the other residents. There are no real special effects or blood but i think thats a good thing because the script is excellent and the atmosphere and surrounding&apos;s are so dark and depressing it&apos;s not needed, and the ending wow, wow, and wow! totally unexpected. overall not quite as good as ringu but not far off i would recommend to anyone who likes Japanese horror and people who don&apos;t. p.s first comment and just getting used to new computer so sorry about spelling and grammar.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a dated movie that you have to take in its historical context. A bunch of free-wheeling hippie girls share a flat, a carefree attitude to sex, and a shocking disregard for the physical integrity of their big-spending boyfriends, whom they have communally decided to off after a few days of TLC. This attitude of breaking with conventions, political ideology, availability and excessive violence describes the Zeitgeist of the late 1960ies and early 1970ies very accurately.\n\nThe balance is offset when an old boyfriend arrives on the scene. As he describes himself bluntly: &quot;I&apos;ve got this washed-out charme that&apos;s irresistible&quot;. He is a memorable and unique character, a freeloader, strangely hideous like a Mick Jagger stand-in and immature, and still captivating. When gang leader Peggy (played surprisingly well by the iconic Uschi Obermaier, who was actually more of a &quot;media personality&quot; than an actress) hesitates to comply with the group&apos;s five-day-rule she offsets the carefully balanced group dynamics. The movie finishes with a memorable showdown on beautiful lake Starnberg: &quot;Are you hit?&quot; -- &quot;Just in the lung. No biggie.&quot; (&quot;Du, nur&apos;n kleiner Lungendurchschuss.&quot;)\n\nThe movie could have been better if there had been a few, homeopathically dosed scenes of ultragraphic violence. And as much as I liked the Thomas character (the movie is worth seeing for him alone), actor Marquard Bohm slurs his lines really badly.\n\nBut those are minor grievances, Rote Sonne is a bold, outstanding dystopic movie."

      "name": "Heart warming ~ and a joy to watch ... (rating: 10)",
      "reviewBody": "The Little Room (2010) delivers a heart warming story in no nonsense terms without fanfare. The entire concept is elegant. The central character, Rose, a nurse (Florence Loiret Caille) prematurely returns to work after a personal neonatal tragedy. On her rounds as community nurse one of her new patients is Edmond (Michael Bouquet) now in his eighties. Circumstances bring the two into closer contact more frequently so that an unlikely rich bond of friendship gradually but steadily ensues.\n\nFar from being the easiest of clients for Rose, Edmond is a man, who having lost his beloved wife some 40 years earlier, has only his unloving and unsupportive son Jacques (Joel Delsaut) to call &apos;family&apos;. For Edmond, a diabetic, life holds few surprises or joys and understandably he is undisturbed at the idea of giving up on the will to live. Somewhat cruelly, Jacques intends his father be taken into care so that he may start afresh in New York. That is Edmond&apos;s likely fate until the encounter with Rose.\n\nWhile Rose is portrayed as neither glamorous nor affected she possesses a warm heart and clear mind. She encourages Edmond to do the simplest of things such as eating, and to accept insulin shots. Few words are exchanged but her presence and willingness to regard Edmond as a man, and as a real human being has a profound effect that slowly restores his will to live little-by-little.\n\nA small cooker fire transpires in Edmond&apos;s home. Rose is there and deals with it - though black smoke chars the kitchen. The son enters, sees the state of the kitchen and along with Rose&apos;s boss they both blame her for allowing the fire, while also accusing her of becoming too involved. Her boss decides Rose is not yet ready to return to work so soon after losing an unborn child, compelling her to take a lengthy &quot;vacation&quot;.\n\nMarc (Eric Cavayaka), Rose&apos;s live-in partner, chooses to leave her to work abroad. After their separation Rose finds she has ample time available to care for Edmond whom she then takes to her own apartment where he stays. It becomes apparent Rose feels a need to substitute for her lost child by caring for Edmond ~ in a wholesome way. An undoubted friendship develops. They start to talk, dine together and go out. Edmond takes an interest in Rose once he realises that she miscarried and still grieves long after her tragic loss. Rose takes Edmond to her child&apos;s cemetery; where at the graveside he shows her which plants will last longest. While this may sound sombre or slow it is incredibly touching – the pace of events seem real, there&apos;s little music - it just comes down to immaculate acting by the two principle leads so that this story works brilliantly.\n\nEdmond stays with Rose, which they enjoy keeping as their secret, while Jacques unaware of this situation eventually reports his father as a missing person. Marc returns to Rose and also forms a bond with Edmond.\n\nDramatically, the story picks-up apace when Edmond chooses to go on a mission and journeys alone to where memories of his deceased wife are strongest. The effect of Edmond&apos;s sudden unannounced disappearance stirs the deepest emotions in Rose.\n\nUnfortunately, to avoid spoilers this where descriptions of the story stops!!! As so often the case with French cinema a human story is told in a fascinating and gripping way. Stéphanie Chaut and Véronique Reymond co-direct and co-write with empathy, immaculate timing, without interference of intrusive sound tracks and cleverly involve viewers in every characters&apos; situation. This tale is about humanity, compassion, dignity, and life&apos;s unexpected events; and not for a moment does it drag. A remarkable thing... in Florence Loiret Caille&apos;s portrayal of a ordinary dowdy community nurse she plays the part with undeniable charisma and subtly oozes sex appeal. If you can catch this film it should not be missed. It&apos;s a treat."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Downtown&quot; is a box office crash &amp; burn from 1990. Basically it is yet another unsuccessful attempt to follow-up on the success of &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (without the benefit of Eddie Murphy). These inter-racial, buddy picture, cop movie, comedy-action features simply don&apos;t work without a talented comic and Anthony Edwards of &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; fame is only mildly funny. Add to this a more serious group of themes than Murphy had to deal with and the incongruity of mixing these conflicting genres makes the whole a lot less than the sum of its parts. \n\nYet &quot;Downtown&quot; is more entertaining than its &quot;bomb at the box office&quot; reputation would lead you to believe. The production design, filming, and editing are first class. Although the action scenes are unconvincing, this is due more to lamely inserted comedy elements than cheap staging. \n\nMuch is genuinely embarrassing such as when a PCP abuser holds a little girl hostage, with a gun to her head, and the subtext lamely plays the scene for laughs. What genius thought that scene would work? And they wonder why these things lose money? In this exercise in schizoid film-making, Anthony Edwards and Forest Whitaker are the standard odd couple partnering up to solve the murder of Edwards&apos; former partner. Nerd boy Alex (Edwards) in his worst scenes listens to Beach Boys music and in his best scenes is paired with his girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller). \n\nAlex is a suburban patrolman who has been banished to the worst downtown Philly division because of a confrontation with a slimy bigwig (unconvincingly overplayed by David Clennon). Dennis (Whitaker) is a detective with a lot of baggage that makes it difficult for him to warm up to Alex.\n\nBut Alex and Dennis eventually bond (big surprise) and Whitaker turns in a pretty good performance (much too good for this material). Whitaker and Miller assist the marginally talented but generally likable Edwards enough that it is possible for the average viewer to suspend disbelief most of the time and actually get into the story. Just be prepared for a lot of extremely lame moments that would have been more entertaining had the editor relegated them to his deleted scenes bin. \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

Anyway, the character of Guendalina is wonderfully played by young Jaqueline Sassard and this only justifies my four stars. It seems like the whole movie were created only in order to evaluate and underscore the young actress&apos;s talent. On the contrary, the other characters are little more than clichés: Guendalina&apos;s father -the usual, handsome woman chaser- , her mother, a beautiful unsatisfied woman, and the pathetic boyfriend, too stupid to capture any empathy from the viewer. What particularly disappointed me is the representation of the scenery. A poor and insignificant photography gives no idea of the emotions that the Versilian landscape was used to communicate to poets, artists and especially painters, such as Boecklin and Carrà. And please...at the end of the movie we are informed that the location is Viareggio. But all the shots at the seaside are taken in Forte dei Marmi, a place which is famous for its magic light, also in Autumn and Winter. Where did that stunning light go?",

And while I cannot bring myself to turn it off, I also can&apos;t help but fondly remember watching all of his movies that he made before this one, the spark that say The Graduate or Catch-22 had, and this just feels a little flat. But at the same time, it seems to completely succeed in doing what it sets out to do, creating something suffocatingly real, like watching the most depressing moments in my life played back for me with dim lighting and blonder actresses. The fact that Candice Bergen goes away after that also helps. Upper middle class ennui is something that&apos;s almost always tedious to watch, but this is actually affecting. Nonetheless, this feels like the beginning of the end for Mike Nichols. He would never again make anything on a level with Catch-22, and he followed this one up with Day of the Dolphins. Seriously. wtf. Also for the curious, pop star Arthur Garfunkle (as the back of the DVD box puts it) gives a surprisingly strong performance in this.",

The monster looks a bit plastic-y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets.\n\nPerkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man-eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you&apos;re not too squeamish.\n\nIt&apos;s not really a scary horror, although it has it&apos;s moments. The performances from the entire cast are spot-on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Isabelle sizzles and Perkins fascinates, providing the icing on a tasty if unremarkable movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those films where &quot;nothing happens&quot;, where the frame stands as a window into the world of tedium. It&apos;s contrasted against this humming nothingness, mirrored in the film in the empty stretches of desert, that the small gestures can reverberate outwards to the eternal, to give us a portrait of life as we might know it by our own existence, elsewhere, in some other time.\n\nThese fleeting human moments, painful or exhilarating in their small profundity, largely make the film for me. A man stealing a glance at a passing girl in a diner, glance which may or may not be casual or mean something else, and which makes the woman sulk in jealous consternation. The woman trying to penetrate the hard, unyielding, demeanor of the man, asking him as he drives what is he thinking, the man saying nothing. The irritable tantrum of the man when their car won&apos;t go any further in a dirt road, that reveals the male child inside, petulant and impotent at the sight of failure.\n\nElsewhere Dumont fails to cut as incisively. The contrast he gives us in the first pool scene, &quot;do you love me?&quot;, &quot;do you like my penis?&quot;, is simpleminded at best.\n\nThe film works despite all that, first as a tangible reminder of the meaninglessnes of craving, here in the form of carnal animal sex that needs to be consumated, almost exorcised, the moment it builds. The nothingness of Dumont&apos;s desert world is not the shunyata of the Buddhists though, a realization of the world in true form. Rather it&apos;s a limbo where souls in disconnect aimlessly drag their feet yearning for a sense of direction or purpose when the only sense possible is a sense of still time. This shines for me in the latenight scene where David finds Katia sitting by herself at the side of the macadam, they seem like they&apos;re washed ashore in some other plain of existence. A pall of simmering, unspeakable, violence hangs over this like the shifting rents of dust in a dirt road, so that at least a breaking point can be surmised to be waiting at the other end.\n\nThen it works for me as a painful vehicle that brings us at the brink of the existential void. I&apos;m not very enamored of the act of random cruelty that makes this possible, the randomness makes sense yet at the same time it&apos;s so easy as to be schematic, but the monster that emerges on the other end is a shocking sight to me because I have the memory of the flawed human being that used to be.\n\nThe dysfunction of the protagonists then, foremostly human, also foreshadows doom. That malaise we see but small traces of in their behavior must exist out there too, in the rest of the world that is largely kept from our eyes.\n\nDumont doesn&apos;t dare go any further than this, that is if we accept there is somewhere to go, but as an agnostic lament it goes far enough."

These usually require to be propped up with some effort, but what Lubitsch does simply requires letting go of, in particular letting go of our need to prop up fiction a certain way.\n\nUsually understood as a gift for wit, his famed &apos;Lubitsch touch&apos; is actually a mastery of something else, spontaneous illogicality. I have written about him in a few other posts so will not bore you here. It&apos;s the continuous shift of context, the dismantling of our expectation that story plays out a certain way.\n\nThe story could be anything, here a man and woman court each other while vacationing in the French Riviera. He&apos;s the blustering American type who won&apos;t take no and won&apos;t tiptoe around European niceties. She&apos;s elegant and smart but will not stoop to be wowed by money like her shyster father.\n\nIn the usual mode, they would brush and bounce off each other whilst trying to top each other for control over the story. This as hardwon love that surprises. That&apos;s fine, plenty of enjoyable films were being made in this time, what we now know as screwball. For me it&apos;s all a matter of how we brush, how much narrative space the players create by pushing and pulling, in which self can take shape, actual visible shape, as the story we watch. Capra has a very agile touch in It Happened One Night. I happen to find His Girl Friday coarse, par the course for Hawks.\n\nIn Lubitsch&apos;s world, we shift and shift again in a jazz merry-go-round of elusive self. Here&apos;s some of it. They meet as strangers in a store, cooperating over trying to buy pyjamas. He decides he&apos;s smitten, but uses money to come close to her. So what happens? She agrees to be bought as a wife but gives him a thankless marriage for it, although in love herself.\n\nThis is lovely work, clean, vibrant. Some if are just gags, like having married seven times before her. But quite a bit of it is that wondrous surprise where emotions express themselves in paradoxical ways."

Geoffrey Rush (what&apos;s HE doing in this movie?!) as Steven Price is actually a very interesting character, which can be attributed to either the effort the script takes to set him up, and/or the brilliance of the Oscar-winning actor in the role. Price&apos;s wife, Evelyn, gets similar treatment, but it is here the screenwriter(s?) get lazy.\n\nThe strangers in the house DO get a minimal amount of character set-up, i.e. who they are, what they do... but this information is never touched on again. One would HOPE that all ths information is being displayed for some higher purpose-- the background of these five strangers, the cat-and-mouse game played by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Price, and Mr. Price&apos;s fascination with fear that is set up so intensely in the movie&apos;s opening minutes.\n\nBut alas, none of this GOES anywhere. It is all completely independent from the agenda of the House when I felt like it should all tie together, somehow. There are three forces at work here-- the ghosts who haunt the house, the humans who are trapped in it, and the Darkness that lives beneath it. These are all separate entities, we find, but for what purpose? This movie could have gone on another ten minutes, some loose ends could have been tied up, and I could have given it a much higher score.\n\nInstead, what was truly an INTENSE build-up, sputters out at the very end of the movie. It didn&apos;t even feel like an end, it just felt like the movie stopped, and we&apos;re left without an explanation to what happens to the survivors-- including the most interesting character in the movie, the House itself.\n\n7 out of 10. Fun to watch, truly terrifying, but incomplete.",

At 3 hours and 40 minutes it is a big ask for audiences to be engaged, particularly as it is basically just a series of long conversations between faculty and students.\n\nPerhaps because it is closer to my school era, I also didn&apos;t find it quite as fascinating. Every individual conversation is interesting, but the film is probably a hundred minutes too long.",

      "reviewBody": "Before the hair transplant, before he ate all the pies, before he went mad, and before everything was uttered in an inaudible whisper Seagal made his debut with this confusing, over-plotted thriller directed by Andrew Davis. Seagal plays Nicola Toscani, a ludicrously-named ex-CIA cop (as are virtually all Seagal characters) with family in the Mafia. Seagal conjured up the story (which was then expanded, of all people, by Steven Pressfield and Ronald Shusett) and it&apos;s probably his first effort at ego-massage. The opening narration is semi-biographical and the beginning of Seagal confusing fantasy and reality.\n\nThe plot, despite being from 1988, still comes across as contemporary and relevant. Nico quits the CIA in the &apos;Nam after witnessing a crooked superior taking advantage of the war to become a drug baron. Many years later he encounters that same villain who is abusing his status of being &apos;above the law&apos; to seize more drug territory and pump more drug money into the CIA. War is always profitable.\n\nIt would be an intriguing plot for a 135-minute movie. But Above the Law tries to cram it all into 99 minutes and in the style of early 80s Charles Bronson. Don&apos;t get me wrong, Andrew Davis has always had muscular direction and takes the material seriously, but the heavy story and ambitious commentary are mostly squandered for the sake of making sure the credits roll after an hour and a half. The ending seems rushed, leaving just a little to much confusion and too many dots unconnected.\n\nStill, it&apos;s interesting to see Seagal young, thin, and talking clearly.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in December 1990 after watching the movie on Live video cassette.\n\nDirect-to-video release &quot;Whispers&quot; is a superior thriller, with potential as a sleeper success in the home video market. Name of novelist Dean R. Koontz co9uld be a boost.\n\nIn a field glutted with predictable would-be chillers, Canadian made pic delivers a truly novel storyline and a very satisfying payoff.\n\nSteve Martin&apos;s wife Victoria Tennant is well-cast as a patrician writer who&apos;s attacked in the opening scene by Jean Leclerc, a rich guy she met briefly. The police, led by Chris Sarandon and his sexist partner Peter MacNeill, take a lackadaisical attitude until a second attack occurs and Leclerc is killed by Tennant in self-defense.\n\nWith plenty of intriguing details and foreshadowing, film evolves into a maybe he&apos; a vampire picture, as Leclerc returns to wreak havoc. Explanation of what&apos;s really going on is offbeat and ingenious. In fact, if this film had received a theatrical release, it would probably have been advertised with a &quot;Don&apos;t reveal the ending&quot; warning like such classics as &quot;Diabolique&quot;.\n\nOften in satin lingerie, Tennant is an ideal lady in distress while Leclerc has the rugged good looks to personify her nemesis. With old-age makeup on, Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs is terrific in a single scene as a former brothel madam recounting the story of Leclerc&apos;s boyhood. It&apos;s a perfect example of how to inject exposition without boring the audience.\n\nFinale explains the film&apos;s title as the chirpings of cockroaches in an extremely gruesome scene."

      "reviewBody": "Love and Other Drugs (2010) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nDirector Zwick will probably always be known for his big-budget epics but this small comedy-drama is actually a return to the likes of his earlier films like the underrated ABOUT LAST NIGHT... Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a pharmaceutical salesman who just wants to build his career and ride it as high as he can. Maggie (Anne Hathaway) is a free-spirit suffering with Parkinson&apos;s who doesn&apos;t want to be tied down or have anyone actually help her. The two meet up, become sex buddies and soon other emotions start to sneak in. LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS isn&apos;t a classic movie and it&apos;s certainly far from a good one. I was really shocked to see how many issues there were in this movie including the fact that the first hour is pretty much a raunchy comedy and then out of no where we get thrown head first into a very deep drama. I don&apos;t mind movies that jump around from laughs to drama and then back to laughs but the first half of this thing really don&apos;t lead you to believe we&apos;re going to get some heavy drama so when it comes and then stays you really wonder what happened in the screenplay and why such a drastic change comes out of no where. This is an incredibly uneven movie but at the same time the two lead performances are so great that you&apos;re willing to overlook the flaws because their characters are just so irresistible. There&apos;s no question that the main reason to watch this film would be for Gyllenhaal and Hathaway who are both fabulous and you can&apos;t help but feel with any other actors this film probably wouldn&apos;t have worked at all. I really thought Hathaway was the stand out here as she dives head first into this troubled character and I thought she nailed every aspect. She has no problem playing the loose, free-spirit and she doesn&apos;t have any issues when the character is suffering from her illness. The way Hathaway goes through her emotions was very believable and she made you feel as if this was a real character with these real problems. Gyllenhaal is just as good in his role as he&apos;s the one who plays the immature guy who eventually gets a dose of medicine and has to wake up from his little play world. I thought the actor handled the raunchy stuff extremely well but he was also believable during the more dramatic moments. The two stars have a lot of chemistry together and they really do come across like a real couple. Oliver Platt and Hank Azaria are both good in their roles but the screenplay doesn&apos;t offer much for either of them. The same is true for Josh Gad who plays Gyllenhaal&apos;s brother who has a porn addiction. Gad&apos;s performance is just fine but his character and his issues really seem out of place and especially when the drama aspect of the story hits. The film takes place in 1996 just as Viagra was about to take off and this drug war has a big part to do in the screenplay but this here is just another aspect that felt tacked on and in the end it really wasn&apos;t needed. The film is very uneven and there are many flaws but I think the performances make it worth viewing and the non-stop nudity by the two stars will probably make it a high rental for years to come."

It&apos;s an entirely forgettable production that looks and feels like any old low budget haunted house flick as there&apos;s no real connection to the other films in this series. What we have is a very typical horror film in which a group of friends move into a dilapidated old house in order to renovate it but instead find themselves menaced and then possessed by a gang of spooks.\n\nBy all accounts this was an early straight-to-video film and that shows in its level of ineptitude. Absolutely nothing happens in this production that we haven&apos;t seen done better in other horror films and the various scare scenes are a joke. The direction is probably the worst thing about this, as he chooses to shoot most of his scenes in the dark so that the viewer is straining to see what&apos;s going on. The only familiar member of the cast for me was the lead, Kim Coates, who&apos;s gone on to appear in the likes of BLACK HAWK DOWN, but like the rest of the actors he gives an entirely undistinguished performance.",

      "reviewBody": "In what was unfortunately his next to last directorial effort, Tod Browning creates a fun flick with a good gimmick (and good special effects), fine acting, and ultimately a truly touching quality. As we can see, our vengeance obsessed main character may be an antagonist but is not really a villain. His love for his daughter and mother comes through strongly, and with an actor as compulsively watchable as Lionel Barrymore in the lead, the movie is certainly easy enough to follow.\n\nBarrymore plays Paul Lavond, a banker framed by his partners and sent up the river, who at the beginning of the movie breaks out of Devil&apos;s Island prison in the company of a persecuted scientist, Marcel (Henry B. Walthall), who&apos;s devised what *he* thinks is the answer to the worlds&apos; hunger problem: shrink everybody and everything so that the quantity of the worlds&apos; food will then amount to more. The thing, Marcel and his wife Malita (Rafaela Ottiano) are clearly mad, and despite Pauls&apos; own misgivings about their actions (yes, our antagonist does have some morals) he&apos;s still okay with using them towards his own ends.\n\nThis leads to some fairly well realized sequences in which &quot;miniaturized&quot; dogs, horses, and people are controlled by masters such as Barrymore. The sequences in which Lachna (Grace Ford) and Radin (Arthur Hohl) go about particular missions are entertaining every step of the way. In general, the film is a little talky and never terribly scary, but Browning does generate some palpable suspense and in one great moment, as the clock is ticking, the character Matin (Pedro de Cordoba) feels his conscience getting to him. Maureen O&apos;Sullivan, as Lavonds&apos; daughter Lorraine, and Frank Lawton, as ambitious and cheery taxi driver Toto (!), make for an appealing couple. But getting to watch the interesting Mr. Barrymore at work is really the main reason to watch &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot;, especially as he dresses in drag as Lavond masquerades as a doddering old character named Miss Mandilip.\n\nSet in Paris, and scripted by Garrett Fort, Guy Endore, and Erich von Stroheim, this does have solid atmosphere going for it, as well as an affecting, emotional ending. This may not be quite as memorable as Brownings&apos; other works, but is worth a look for fans of genre films from this period.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Just watched it for the third time in as many days. Oh, Edingurgh looks gorgeous, and so does Dame Maggie. I admit to knowing very little about her, but this role alone would make me a lifetime fan.\n\nRather than another summary and interpretation I want to riff on a few seemingly random points ...\n\n1) The costumes. Fabulous, fabulous period costumes. The grey of the &quot;gehrls&quot; ... all those pleated skirts and dropped waists! Sandy&apos;s little gingham number! The bloomers ... oh, how sweet those bloomers were (and I mean nothing perverse by that, I just thought they were cute, and I&apos;ll own up to always wondering what was under those &apos;30s skirts). The school uniforms, the effect of the repetition on that gray, gray, gray, and those tidy peter-pan collared shirts: you could easily see why Miss Brodie fancied herself a bit of a Duce herself, she seemed to be surrounded by a uniformed army. And then ... against the greys of the girls, the greys, whites and blacks of the staff -- wonderful houndstooths and glen plaids, especially on the headmistress -- Miss Brodie, impossibly slim and hipless, in radiant plums, flame colors, paisleys and asymmetrical jackets. If only I could have a tailor like that. It worked, it absolutely works still: it doesn&apos;t look a bit garish, as so many Technicolor extravaganzas can.\n\n2) Miss Brodie&apos;s blindness to who Sandy really is - her insensitivity to her; going on about how &quot;ordinary morals will not apply&quot; to the allegedly-beautiful girl (well, she&apos;s blonde anyway) while failing to look beneath the glasses of the real stunner, Sandy. Who with the slightest bit of knowledge about pre-teen girls would do that - harp on a friend&apos;s beauty and negligently add, &quot;Oh, but you have insight, dear&quot;? The whole set-up: Sandy&apos;s elevated to a peer-like relationship, Sandy&apos;s confided in, yet Sandy is only a mirror for Jean, not valued, not truly noticed. I believe that&apos;s the dynamic - almost like a neglected lover&apos;s - that triggers Sandy&apos;s betrayal.\n\n3) Sandy, and her amazing transformation. My jaw actually dropped when we saw her with the painter: did they film over a period of years, I wondered? How could that little girl be THIS young woman? Going back and watching - the schoolgirl uniform, the tousled short hair, the whole expression, look in the eyes, everything. The over-sized glasses. The most convincing precocious-12-year-old performance. And then - pow, an adult! all without CGI. That was impressive.\n\n4) The giggling and sexually curious girls. Hey, I do remember being 12, and yeah, it was like that! \n\n5) That incredible dance scene, the 2 girls tangoing while speculating on &quot;doing it.&quot; Fantastic blocking. And funny, and charming as hell. I especially like Sandy&apos;s aggressive cranking of the Victrola. \n\nI personally detested the painter - the whole notion of the father of 6 tomcatting about, well, yuck - and his manhandling of the ladies is simply vile. But those were the times, I suppose. The headmistress was sublime. The overall look is artful but not overdone and all perfectly unified and beautiful. Enjoy - I certainly have!",

However, my reaction at the end of the two hour flick was &quot;Yeah, so???&quot;.  Telling of the intertwined lives of a cop and his brother and a girl and her lover and a handful of other people, this character driven  flick wanders to and fro interminably, jumping around in time,  examining the details of their fatalistic and pragmatic lives as they fuss and stew and brood over the this and that of their existence.  Given subtitles and a soup thin story with no moral, no message, no hero, no villain, just character study heaped upon character study and no character that&apos;s even likeable, &quot;Thieves&quot; will not have much appeal for the masses. Recommended for French speakers or French film buffs only. (B)",

      "reviewBody": "I remember the first time that I saw this SF chiller was at a local drive-in theater in the late 60&apos;s as the second feature. I don&apos;t remember what the first one was--that&apos;s how creepy  &quot;Unearthly Stranger&quot; was for me. For a low-budget film it has everything: wit, intelligence, excellent acting, compelling direction, and for it&apos;s modest budget more than adequate (minimalist) use of special effects. I&apos;ve seen it a few times since on t.v., and just recently acquired a second or third generation copy on ebay. I was waiting for the scene where the professor&apos;s wife ( whom we already know is a tad unusual) goes for a walk into town and loiters near the public schoolyard, where the nine-to twelve-year-olds are playing. While standing there, the children, one by one, begin to take notice of her, and in a mass, start backing away from her...well, if you haven&apos;t seen it, what follows is worth the price of viewing by itself.     A bit of info: many years ago a friend told me that this film was actually inspired by the SF novel &quot;To Walk The Night&quot; by William Sloane, originally published in 1938. When I finally got a copy, I was surprised how the closely the plotline of &quot;Unearthly Stranger&quot; hews to Sloane&apos;s novel. Hard to understand why the producers would fail to give credit where credit&apos;s due...at any rate, find a copy where you can, and pray for it&apos;s release on DVD!"

Although entertaining, the film has extremely violent and shocking scenes (like in the one in which Leguizamo destroys Caruso&apos;s  character), but that was necessary, in order to show the brutality and cruelty of every one of the main characters. Ving Rhames, who was great in Don King, has  a small, but memorable role, and Leguizamo gives the movie&apos;s outstanding performance, it&apos;s sad to see this actor, who has great dramatic capacity, making bad comedies, but in The Split, he had the chance to deliver his very best.Caruso comes out well, but the trailer of the film passes the idea that he is the leading actor on the film, but he isn&apos;t, he has just a supporting, although good, part. Finally, I recommend this thriller."

Because the name of priest Jeryz Popieluszko was far to be unknown in Romania of 80 s.\n\nThe film has the gift to remind a martyrium and its genesis.\n\nIt has, in same measure, the sins of Chistopher Lambert in a role deserving more acting than good physical look and the fist of cliches , maybe for seduce a larger audience.\n\nBut its essential virtue is the status of cry in the last years of Comunist regimes in Central and East Europe. And, not the last, the inspired work of Ed Harris. One of films bz Agniesyka Holland . This last definition remains useful ."

      "reviewBody": "First off to the reviewer complaining that it was too long the whole thing was an hour and 10 minutes! Have some patience It&apos;s one of the shortest movies i&apos;ve ever watched!\n\nThis movie is about a family that owns a house out in the countryside of Spain. There is a legend involving the maze that is attached to their house. However the kids who are curious types are forbidden from their father from going in there.\n\nBeing a huge fan of hand camera horrors I was eager to discover this little gem. It&apos;s short and to the point before you know it. I have seen various ones such as Noroi, rec, etc, i am a veteran in this vein so take it from me it&apos;s good!\n\nThe thing I liked the most about it was it was very realistic feeling and very intense and creepy and at one point when they&apos;re in the woods I checked how much time was left on the movie cause i was anticipating a scare in one scene and I rarely do that with movies unless they&apos;re scary\n\nBottom line is, if you like hand camera horrors, realistic scenes and tense feelings with goose bumps watch this now and enjoy it! you won&apos;t be disappointed. \n\nPeople on IMDb tend to rate hand camera horrors really low for some reason but I think most people that review and hate on them don&apos;t actually like that &quot;genre&quot; \n\nTo create a great environment for this type of movie: turn the lights out, watch on a big screen, and by yourself its only 70 minutes who cares if you&apos;re alone. I guarantee you if you set that formula up for yourself you&apos;ll be wide awake after like I am.",

      "reviewBody": "Juice is yet another hood film that presents itself honestly and with a good sense of realism. It doesn&apos;t capitalize on anything but the reality and the dangers of growing up in a city lead by gun violence and senseless murders. In the mix of it all are four Harlem boys all portrayed effectively by Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Jermaine &quot;Huggy&quot; Hopkins, and Khalil Kain.\n\nThe boys call themselves &quot;The Wrecking Crew,&quot; and are trying to survive with what they have in a dangerous town. They spend most of their time at an arcade or a record shop when they cut school a little early, most of the time being harassed by the police or a gang in the process. One day, one of the boys named Bishop (Shakur) buys a gun, and convinces the other three members to come along in stickup. They rob the store, and from that moment on things go from bad to worse for the boys.\n\nThere is a subplot involving another one of the gang&apos;s members nicknamed &quot;Q&quot; (Epps) who is an aspiring DJ, and has a big DJ competition the night of the planned robbery.\n\nWriter and Director Ernest R. Dickerson has worked as the cinematographer on various Spike Lee films, and this marks his very first shot behind the camera. While Juice is passable and well-made, it suffers by comparison with film&apos;s made by Lee like Do the Right Thing and School Daze. It also can be compared to Boyz N The Hood, another excellent hood film by John Singleton.\n\nI believe because of Spike Lee films and works of John Singleton is the reason why Juice has slipped through the cracks. It has a following, but because of strong critical acclaim surrounding the other pictures and this one just having mixed reviews is the reason why this isn&apos;t remembered as well as the other films.\n\nThe moral of Juice is great about a psychological change one person can go through in a matter of time, the message about gun violence, and strong friendships being tested. However - this is taken in a more clichéd manner than any other hood film I&apos;ve seen. We don&apos;t know a whole lot about the characters, and we don&apos;t know about they&apos;re raised. We don&apos;t get the parental backstory which is what Boyz N The Hood was cluttered with.\n\nI&apos;m recommending Juice for its morals, its sense of realism, and its subject matter. However, the delivery is a little askew, and the four boys aren&apos;t developed as well as they could be. This is still one more realistic hood film that many should make time to see, but this film only reaches the level of average to decent while all of Singleton&apos;s films surpassed the above average mark.\n\nStarring: Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Jermaine &quot;Huggy&quot; Hopkins, Khalil Kain, Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by: Ernest R. Dickerson.",

The story was told so well that I felt she understood the underlying messages. We were able to have a very long discussion afterward about war and accountability of those who unjustly cause wars. We talked about recognizing the humanity behind the &quot;enemy&quot; soldiers who are, for the most part, just doing their duty to country. These men have wives, children, fathers and mothers who love them just as much as the families of the soldiers on &quot;our&quot; side.\n\nI literally was speechless at the end of the film. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending caught me a little off-guard with its VERY poignant and thought provoking message.\n\nThe characters were well developed and I really felt that i could empathize with each man&apos;s approach to the situation they were in.\n\nThe impact of the movie far exceeded its budget. I was very impressed with the actors (for example, the beautiful French woman...who WAS that?). \n\nI think I was most impressed with the acting of the Medic (The exchange of looks between him and the German prisoner at the end of the movie was classic!).\n\nI read a lot of the reviews prior to watching this film, so I had somewhat of a biased opinion about what I might see. I have to admit, I found myself feeling like the movie exceeded my expectations and was VERY much worth it. I don&apos;t buy many movies...this is one I definitely will buy for my private library."

      "reviewBody": "The story of jazz great Charlie Parker. The film follows his rise from clubs to records and follows him across tours, drug abuse, personal loss and his eventual death. At the time of his death at 34 he was so eaten up by drugs that the coroner assessed his age at 65.\n\nThis is a well put together film about a creative but flawed artist. The plot doesn&apos;t glamorise him too much, although it maybe sympathises a little with his addiction and doesn&apos;t show it quite as harshly as it could have done. That said he is a pretty unpleasant person when he isn&apos;t performing. The film focuses on his adult life, which is good as it saves us child actors running around and it means more time is spent on the important years. The covers a lot of time, but it doesn&apos;t feel rushed. His drug addiction is honestly handled and it shows both the ups and downs of his life as a user.\n\nThe direction is pretty good, it&apos;s obvious Eastwood likes his jazz, and he uses the clubs well getting a great sense of mood. Elements are quite funny and this tempers the more tragic side of his life well. Whittaker is excellent in the lead role, but Diane Venora as his wife is not as good. She doesn&apos;t totally carry her lines in the same way - she&apos;s OK but you feel like something is missing. The rest of the cast come and go - there are good performances all round from a mostly low-key cast. The main star is the music, and it&apos;s treated with a lot of respect with Eastwood giving it plenty of time and creating a good mood for it to work in.\n\nOverall a tragic story well told with a good central performance and great music."

      "reviewBody": "After watching the trailer when it was first released, I didn&apos;t feel what I always feel when I see Jason Statham in an action movie, which is giddy. There was something missing, but how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action packed movie? I just can&apos;t. &apos;Safe&apos; ended up being good. Not great, just good. The beginning was a little slow, but the way they told the story, was a bit of bouncing back between Luke Wright (Jason Statham) and Mei (Caroline Chan), so it didn&apos;t really come out running, but I guess I can&apos;t complain too much about it because it definitely picked up after. As I stated earlier, how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action movie. The action was amazing. It&apos;s that kind of action where the audience is either clapping or yelling, &quot;Ooooohhhh snap!!!&quot; followed by some laughing. The storyline was decent, I mean, it didn&apos;t really stand out and there are a few scenes where you can probably figure out what&apos;s going to happen, but it got the job done. The acting was sub-par once you take out Jason Statham and Catherine Chan (Mei), who I thought did a really good job for her first Hollywood movie. There were a few cheesy lines, some epic quotes, one of which I put in the subject title and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll enjoy it too when you hear it and some funny moments; more than you usually expect from an action movie, which wasn&apos;t so bad. \n\n&apos;Safe&apos; is your typical Jason Statham action flick. I think it&apos;s fair to say, we don&apos;t watch Jason Statham movies expecting Oscar nominations; we watch his movies mainly because the action is phenomenal. If you want to watch a good, action packed movie, then &apos;Safe&apos; is a safe bet this weekend. See what I did there?",

It is about the aging of people who have a purpose in their life; maintaining their vitality and ability to compete in sports. Although it is a documentary, it nevertheless has a half dozen people who are the leads. None are professional actors, but the film crew followed them for up to 4 years while filming them in their homes. Thus, the film is about that handful of people. It is about their life, their loves, their hopes and their past. The film ends at the completion of the World Masters Championships in Finland in 2009 in Finland. And with all competitions, there have to be winners and losers in the competition. But there were no losers in how they took the results.",

      "reviewBody": "Return To Paradise is one of the best films you&apos;ve never heard of. It was buried in the summer of 1998 to mostly positive reviews and was later unsuccessfully reinvented 9 months later here in the UK on the back of Psycho which also starred Vaughn and Heche. Its been unfairly treated by the now defunct Polygram as it is a quite incredible little drama with some superb performances and some moments of great power. \n\nThe premise is relatively simple. Three friends on holiday in Malaysia. Two leave. The police arrive and find hash where they were staying. The third is put in jail. Two years later a lawyer finds the two remaining men in New York and tells them that their friend was found guilty of trafficking. They must go back to share the punishment or he will die in 7 days.\n\nIts a frightening dilemma and you can&apos;t help but ask yourself the same question. Would you go back? If one goes back they go to prison for 6 years. If both go they will have 3 years each. All of the arguments are put forward, making the answer not seem as clear as originally imagined.\n\n The timeframe is made even tenser with titles reminding us of how many days are remaining. Vince Vaughn plays our hero who doesn&apos;t always act in the morally correct way we expect him to do. He doesn&apos;t immediately decide to go back, making us question if we would either. Vaughn gives the finest performance of his career as the not completely likeable &apos;Sheriff&apos;. Anne Heche plays the increasingly desperate lawyer who will do anything to save her client from execution. And her desperation is made completely believable by Heche&apos;s multi-faceted performance.\n\nAnd then Joaquin Phoenix plays the imprisoned Lewis who has little screen time but whenever he&apos;s on he totally captivates. His video message to his two friends is heartbreaking. There are numerous twists which serve to further the emotional capital which is placed in the conclusion.\n\nAnd by the time the suspenseful court scene arrives, you will find yourself nervously hoping for a happy ending. Needless to say the film ends with a succession of unspeakably powerful scenes. Its hard to remember a film which I found as moving as this. It serves as a very poignant anti-drugs message. Its impact will stay with you for days, making it really quite unforgettable. Hunt this down. You will be richly rewarded."

I honestly can&apos;t fathom why, since their production values are way above average, there are several acclaimed actors appearing, and - most of all - they are really cool flicks!\n\nThe middle one (&quot;Mark Shoots First&quot;) is the least of the bunch, but still very worthwhile, while the first (&quot;Mark the Narc&quot;) and this third entry &quot;Mark Strikes Again&quot; (a.k.a &quot;The .44 Specialist&quot;) are solid Poliziotesschi classics as far as I&apos;m concerned.\n\nRebellious cop Mark Patti goes undercover and joins a young couple of terrorists, hoping to eventually unclutter the much larger network of terrorism that is active all over Europe. He must report his findings directly to Interpol agent Altman, but it&apos;s not certain everyone can be trusted.\n\nMany in highlights in this one, ingenious story aspects as well as adrenalin-rushing action footage. There is an extremely violent shootout in a secret service headquarters, a hotel massacre, a number of brutal terrorist attacks, and the tense hijacking of a passenger train. On the lighter side of things, Marc has a steamy night with a lewd girl whose bedroom is full of mannequin dolls, a corpse originally gets transported through the city during rush hour, and two thugs on a motorcycle gets a lot more than they bargained for when they snatch the wrong bag during a drive-by robbery. The always reliable Stelvio Cipriani delivers another dazzling score, and the supportive cast contains a couple of respectable names and faces, like John Saxon, John Steiner, and Paul Muller.",

      "reviewBody": "That &apos;s what Truffaut wrote about &quot;Rue des Prairies&quot; when it was released.Instant karma:as everything Truffaut and his clique used to slag off was to be dismissed by the &quot;true&quot; French cine buffs ,&quot;Rue des Prairies&quot; sank without a trace.\n\nI must admit I&apos;m far from being a Denys de la Patellière&apos;s fan. One can save,in his filmography,&quot;Un Taxi Pour Tobrouk&quot; ,an entertaining war movie saved by its actors ,and mainly &quot;Retour de Manivelle&quot; his successful attempt at a film noir.\n\nBut in this film,he was really inspired.Is it the excellent cast featuring an imperial Gabin ,with efficient supporting young newcomers such as Claude Brasseur ,Pierre Brasseur&apos;s son,Marie-José Nat and a moving Roger Dumas who almost steals the show from the old star?Is it the witty funny dialog by Audiard at the top of his game?Had Truffault displayed more tolerance,more understanding and more perceptiveness,He would have admitted that his Antoine Doinel was really Fernand Neveux&apos;s close relative .The only difference is that Fernand is a working-class boy whereas Truffaut&apos;s hero was a middle-class offspring (didn&apos;t his mother have diplomas?)\n\n&quot;Intellectuals do not like the people &quot;Alain Paucard writes in his excellent insightful review in &quot;Guide des Films ,tome 2&quot;.The book rates &quot; Prairies&quot; higher than &quot;les 400 coups&quot; and I can find little fault with the opinion expressed.\n\nGabin came back from war in 1942 to find his wife dead and a baby (not his) in his bedroom.A widower,he will raise the toddler with his son and daughter.Fifteen years later,the three children try to &quot;make some money and not to fall into the ranks of suburbia&quot; .But dad is not prepared to accept it.\n\nTHe first one(Pierre Brasseur) ,a cycle champion, trashes his father in the gutter press ,cause he has learned to be good at selling himself.\n\nThe second one (Marie-José Nat),who used to work in a shoe shop poses for fashion photographs .She falls for a greybeard who could be her father.\n\nThe bastard is a tormented soul.He knows where he comes from ,and although M.Neveux is a a father to him,he has grown into a rebel without a cause.\n\nBut the most important thing in &quot;Rue des Prairies &quot; ,as M.Paucard wrote ,is the class struggle.This subject is hinted at in the best scene of the movie,when Gabin comes to see his daughter&apos;s lover.The luxury apartment,where a mass by Bach is heard on the record player ,this posh man whose doctor put to starvation diet (tea and Biscottes)and who can give this blue collar champagne,tea,or whiskey but who has not got any &quot;Pernod&quot; the par excellence proletarian beverage.Such a scene talks louder than one hour and a half of Godardesque rhetoric.And if it were not enough,the last scene ,in the courtroom of honor &quot;where the judge pounds his gavel to show that all are equal and the law&apos;s on the level&quot; shows a bourgeoisie afraid of a populace turning anticlerical and anti-militarist (but he &apos;s got the war cross says a more human judge).A justice which is hard on the Poor .It&apos;s revealing that Neveux&apos;s two other children side with THAT justice.",

It is a combination of a good old-fashioned romance &amp; a look at what happens when an ordinary man is brought into the world of espionage. Connery is very good as the boozy, world-weary publisher who considers personal relationships more important than Cold War one-upmanship. Michelle Pfeiffer, apart from being very pleasing to the eye as usual, was also pretty believable as the Russian trying to do the right thing. What&apos;s more, Klaus Maria Brandauer deserves an honourable mention as well. OK, the plot is complicated &amp; sometimes hard to follow, as are most of Le Carre&apos;s works (&amp; also, doubtless, the real world of espionage), but it is worth the effort. If you are seeking a simple good guy beats bad guy film, then don&apos;t watch this or any other realistic spy film. If, however, you want a story that manages to combine cynicism &amp; romance, I recommend this one."

      "reviewBody": "...Perhaps not. But for nearly 2 1/2 hours in &quot;Funny Girl,&quot; Barbra Streisand at least makes a convincing case for herself.\n\nForget about the television airings you&apos;ve seen. Throw away your old video cassette copy. Instead, see the restored, widescreen, road show version now in limited theatrical release. It is the ONLY way to truly appreciate the talents of Ms. Streisand and, more notably, the film&apos;s brilliant director, William Wyler.\n\nMovies today no longer look like movies. The highest compliment one can pay &quot;Funny Girl&quot; is that it is a grand, glorious MOVIE in the truest sense. Wyler&apos;s brilliance is never more evident than in his glorious treatment of the &quot;Don&apos;t Rain on My Parade&quot; sequence, the stunning camerawork of &quot;The Swan,&quot; and the incredibly effective set-up of the &quot;My Man&quot; finale.\n\nMs. Streisand doesn&apos;t really give a performance; she simply is Barbra. Every &quot;Barbra-ism&quot; that we have come to know, love and hate over the years is already crystallized at this point. Her brashness can be off-putting, but by the end of the movie, one is completely won over by the sheer enormity of her talent and presence. Yes, you can see the beginnings of the blind egomania that has marred her performances for the last 20-odd years (to be generous); but you cannot deny her brilliance, either. And to see her extraordinary face in full-screen close up is breathtaking. Kudos to the director, lighting director, and make-up artist for making Streisand appear so wonderful in this.\n\nFrom the sweepingly orchestrated titles to the high-drama impact of the showstopping finale, this is Entertainment with a capital E. About 20 minutes could have been trimmed, and exactly why Omar Sharif was cast remains a mystery; but at the end of the picture, these quibbles are trivial. Did I laugh? Yes. Did I cry? Yes. Was I thrilled, excited, entertained? You betcha."

      "reviewBody": "One-Eyed Monster, the story of a blood-thirsty penis on the rampage. If you&apos;re reading this blurb of a review, you&apos;ve most likely seen other flicks that are like One-Eyed Monster. You may have seen Teeth, Bad Biology or maybe even Killer Pussy, so you&apos;re probably pretty psyched to check out another flick with deranged genitals. And if you really enjoyed any of the above films, you should definitely give this film a look. If you didn&apos;t like them, there&apos;s no reason for you to watch this one. It&apos;s just more of the same goofy genital humor.\n\nA blazing meteorite/beam of energy type thing crashed into Ron Jeremy as he was star-gazing at the night sky. Not long after, the new found home of the alien entity is now on the loose (it detached itself) and on the rampage. Throw in some forgettable characters and situations, and you got One-Eye Monster. It&apos;s basically just a slasher film with a killer penis on the loose.\n\nThere&apos;s not much to be really impressed with in this flick. The humor is okay, with maybe a few smiles or giggles throughout. Though, I do have to admit the jokes, although pretty weak, are delivered with charm and it&apos;s obvious all actors involved are pretty into the film. Well besides Mr. Napier. His character was either hit or miss. His long story, telling his bizarre memory of Vietnam was a total snooze. The black dude was like a bad soap opera star, and brought a forgettable serious role to the film. Actually whenever the movie tried to go serious, it fell flat. Almost everyone else played an OTT role and for the main part did an alright job.\n\nA big gripe was the lack of nudity in this one. There was one scene of boobs, and I think that was it. If they had a scene where they showed a full naked Ron Jeremy, the house would have come down. Shame. They kept the nudity to one chick and the fake alien weiner. Also, the gore is very minimal. Remember in the trailer where the guy gets split in half? That, and a couple sprays of blood is all I can remember. That was disappointing as well.\n\nI had high hopes for this new entry into the subgenre of genital horror, but I was let down once again. The jokes and silly acting was abundant so you may laugh a bit, but it&apos;s just an average to below-average comedy. And as a horror, as it is a hor/com, it doesn&apos;t do well there either. The gore was weak, the nudity disappointing and the situations bland and cliché.\n\nIf you&apos;re easily pleased, and all you need is the idea of a killer penis to make you happy, you should be golden. But if you have experience with these types of movies, this is just more of the same. Just so you know where I stand with the above flicks that I mentioned, I enjoyed Killer Pussy (great nudity) and Teeth (bizarre dark humor) about equal, with this next and Bad Biology (tried way too hard to be funny) last.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those &quot;mythic&quot; films, the 1932 Joan Crawford vehicle not available anywhere, not even for TV broadcasting, because it&apos;s been in a legal tangle for decades and decades; the film in which Crawford wore one of the most famous outfits ever displayed on screen, a beautiful Adrian creation, a white evening dress which was copied in its time and sold to eager female fans in Department Stores along the United States.\n\nIn this glossy film, Crawford plays the title role, a rich and spoiled heiress, who&apos;s been living the &quot;wild life&quot; in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay with debonair man-of-the-world Emile Rénaul, played by Nils Asther only to regret it when clean-cut Jerry Darrow (Robert Montgomery) comes into her life.\n\nThis is a star-vehicle all the way, with Crawford being photographed in the most ravishing poses, positions, from the best angles; much care was put in the in the lighting and her make-up &amp; wardrobe. Perhaps this is one of the films in which I&apos;ve seen Crawford at her prettiest and sexiest, wearing a chain of exquisite, sophisticated Adrian designed evening dresses and suits, furs et al, all carefully designed to conceal her broad shoulders, which later became a trademark of hers. At this time she had not fully developed into the dramatic actress she later became, but in spite of some heavy melodramatics, her performance is good.\n\nHer co-star Robert Montgomery has little to do in comparison but being well-bred and nice and he is good, as usual, at it. Nils Asther is the &quot;heavy&quot; here and being a Swedish, believably interprets an European, evil, magnate who doesn&apos;t want Letty let go; maybe his style of playing the continental lover (sometimes displaying heavy emoting) may seem somewhat artificial to modern audiences, but in all he&apos;s OK as the villain, considering it was filmed in 1932.\n\nOne of the greatest rewards of the films is watching seasoned pros as Lewis Stone, May Robson, Louise Closser-Hale and Emma Dunn playing expertly their secondary roles. Robson is magnificent as Crawford&apos;s long-suffering dowager mother; Closser-Hale endearing as Crawford&apos;s loving personal traveling companion and maid; Emma Dunn, very sweet as Montgomery&apos;s mother and Lewis Stone at his usual &quot;knows-best&quot; as a D.A.\n\nIt is a shame that this film is not available for everybody to see, because it&apos;s good and part of America&apos;s Cinematic inheritance and history and should not be prevented from airing because of some 70 years-old legal entanglement. I&apos;m grateful of having had the chance of buying a fair-quality copy from a private collector, but I would like to have the chance of seeing a sharp, clear, pristine transfer of the notorious &quot;Letty Lynton&quot;."

The depiction of a union activist entangled with politically incorrect jelousy for his teenager wife is hilarious but also quite poignant. The setting in proletarian working class Milan is credible and realistic. A little gem of a movie. Something might get lost in translation/dubbing but definitively a must see also for non Italian viewers!",

Although the portrayal in this film is surely exaggerated, it is sadly probably not far from the mark.\n\nAs is well-known now, this film came out around the same time President Clinton had a sex scandal of his own to deal with. Some have accused him of deflecting criticism by talking up violence towards Iraq. The fact this film was made just before such an event makes it even more important.\n\nWith a great early performance by Kirsten Dunst, and the winning combination of William H. Macy, Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro... can this film really ask for more? Oh, and there&apos;s Denis Leary! (Willie Nelson and Shooter Jennings, too!)",

      "reviewBody": "The above headline could be a reference to a great deal of movies: The Godfather, Grease and pulp fiction (that all signs indicate it occurs in the late 70&apos;s). This movie is not by any means the indulgent romanticist movie (movies that deal with gory wars rarely are) but to some more than others, this movie is a reminder to an era that is forgotten in the abyss of history books.\n\nBefore I go into detail about the film, I&apos;d like to elaborate on the period of time that directly inspires and evolves the story. The year is 1947, The U.N decides to establish one Jewish state and an Arab one in the British ruled territory named &quot;Palestine&quot; that is roughly the size of  New-Jersey (the state, of course).\n\nAt that time, there are approximately 500,000 Jews in Palestine, large part of whom, reside in Tel Aviv. Among the endless ethnic communities populating the young metropolis, there are Jews from Egypt. I myself am a descendant of an Egyptian family and I&apos;m noting that because I am aware of the fact that what seemed familiar and authentic to me, might seem enigmatic to others.\n\nThe plot of the film centers around a 15 year old kid named Sammy, the eldest of a four children family, ran by the stern yet sensitive widowed mother (Gila Almagor in a very credible and moving performance. Sammy is well read but his academic aspirations have to be set on hold as he shares the burden of co-provider of his family.\n\nThe puberty of Sammy occurs in the time of turmoil for the Jewish inhabitants of soon-to-be-Israel.  The time where Mutiny movements such as Etzel and Hagganah are at their peak of activity against the British rule and Sammy is torn between his obligation to support his family and his need to fight the  war against the Arab neighboring countries which launched an attack a day after the U.N. resolution.\n\nTo make matters worse, Sammy gets involved romantically with a 25 year old librarian of russian descent (Michal Bat Adam), an affair that for all sorts of reasons, Is frowned upon by his family and companions.\n\nThe movie is low on plot development or pacing but it&apos;s compensated by a wonderful cast (strangely enough, the leading role is one of the least impressive performances of the film) that encapsulate the Jewish-Egyptian state of mind.\n\nBy &quot;state of mind&quot;, I refer to the community with the openness of the Arab culture combined with the civil ways of Alexandria (which inhabited most, if not all of the Jewish people in Egypt). Alexandria is a European city that happens to be located in Egypt a great deal of this community&apos;s grace is attributed to that fact. As you can tell, the movie touched me in a way that disables me from being completely objective about it.  However, the fact that the movie received an Oscar nomination for best foreign film and the fact that this movie is considered to be one of the best 10 Israeli films ever made (A statement to which I disagree) may indicate that the movie speaks to people of different ethic backgrounds and eras.\n\n7.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter."

The finale in the rainstorm with the road turned to mud is made even worse by the fifteen or so actors who have to create some stage business out of nothing.\n\nAnother cavil: as others have pointed out, Romy Schneider is onscreen for barely five minutes and gets equal billing with Piccoli and Piccolo who have so much more to do. The supporting actors are thankfully very good: Michel Aumont and Julien Guiomar are villainous as corrupt real estate moguls, and Charles Denner, whom I&apos;ve loved in many films, does a great job with a crook who wants to see justice done, on his terms.",

Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s best performance ever, this movie is a true drama. \n\nThe focus of the movie is of course Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp). However, there are really several focal points in the movie, all of which add to a powerful storyline. As the title of the film suggests, just about everything seems to be a hardship for Gilbert, yet, somehow he manages to come to terms with reality and in the end obtains a newfound respect for life.\n\nWith good performances by supporting actors and actresses (Juliette Lewis, Darlene Cates, Leo D., and all the other &quot;Grapes&quot;) and a nice comic relief from the city coroner (Bobby McBurney) and the local handyman (John C. Reilly), this movie should be seen by anyone who wishes to put themselves in a place where country roads and beautiful greenery give way to the perils and pitfalls of smalltown life.\n\nOverall great acting, a good story, and something with which we can all relate. &quot;What&apos;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; is an excellent movie!",

The blurb said something about, &quot;Before there was Jackass, there was Cap&apos;n Video...&quot; Frankly, this didn&apos;t enthuse me so much. I&apos;m lukewarm at best about Jackass. If you feel the same way, forget about the whole Jackass thing and just watch &quot;Beauty Day&quot;. There is so much more here to enjoy.\n\nAs with any documentary, the subject is key to how interesting you will find it. If the subject is a person, then that person needs to be interesting or special or exemplary in some way. Or all of the above and more. In Ralph Zavadil, director Jay Cheel has a unique and endearing subject. Yes, Zavadil is the creator of a pre-Jackass cable TV show that featured him jumping off stuff, setting stuff on fire, rigging up motorized stuff, and just generally playing the fool, but the man, Ralph, turns out to be much more than that.\n\nHe&apos;s had some hardships, but nothing TOO disadvantageous. He&apos;s injured himself; one crucial time quite seriously, but he&apos;s recovered fully. He&apos;s had and then lost true love, but he&apos;s coping with that OK it seems. His old career is over, but he&apos;s got a job with a close friend that he seems to enjoy and is good at. He tries to resurrect the Cap&apos;n Video show and it doesn&apos;t quite work out, but he&apos;s not depressed about it. In other words, Ralph is an optimist and a big-hearted positive force in the world. If he never even thought up Cap&apos;n Video (though that seems unlikely) he would still be an interesting and lovable specimen. Actually, it&apos;s his intelligence and balanced world-view that come across so strongly; more so than any Jackass-like tom-foolishness.\n\nIt&apos;s Ralph that makes this documentary and Jay Cheel is wise enough to let it happen that way. He doesn&apos;t get in the way (Gasland!!!) and you might even assume that this is Ralph&apos;s own project a la Cap&apos;n Video, although production values are...ahem...CONSIDERABLY higher.\n\nThis reminded me of my very favorite documentary, &quot;The Devil at Your Heels&quot; (Robert Fortier, 1980), which, coincidentally, is also Canadian. Both feature characters that effect you as you watch them; characters that remain in your heart and mind long after meeting them. The difference being that Ralph is a smarter and more positive force than the poor doomed Ken Carter. (If you haven&apos;t seen &quot;The Devil at Your Heels&quot;, seek it out. It&apos;s quite remarkable.) \n\nThanks Ralph and Jay. You made my day.",

But, my goodness, I know the victims are long dead, but the level of disrespect in this is off the charts. This is the most shameless, exploitative, low-brow tripe masquerading as a true crime documentary I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s almost like the creepy, pretentious superfan they kept talking to had directed the documentary. The different narrators are laughable, from the &quot;old-timey newscaster&quot; voice to the &quot;ghostly&quot; woman voice to the voice meant to be Albert Fish&apos;s, they all increase the awfulness tenfold. The documentary trivializes the deaths by focusing on terrible, &quot;artsy&quot; &quot;reenactments&quot; and inserts (that all look like total crap, BTW).\n\nThis documentary was made by a failed film school student who loved Albert Fish. I&apos;m actually curious to know about Albert Fish, but I&apos;d do better watching a random on YT talk about it. In fact, there are YT channels who do a better job than this by far.",

      "reviewBody": "Big, dumb, loud, and fun. Four words that could aptly summarise the appeal of this blockbuster movie which proved a hit with audiences back in &apos;92 and spawned three inferior sequels. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is probably Van Damme&apos;s most successful mainstream movie to date and his pairing with Lundgren as the enemy is a good one; Lundgren&apos;s height alone gives him the imposing edge over the smaller, tougher Van Damme and their final one-on-one battle is one to remember. Packed with lots of hard-edged violence and some unwanted comic relief from a highly annoying female support (Ally Walker), UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a movie that gets better as it goes along.\n\nAt first, the sheer woodenness of Van Damme and Lundgren is inexcusable. I know that they&apos;re supposed to be playing emotionless dead robots, but even after they first rebel they seem wooden and unable to even say their lines convincingly. Thankfully this wears off as time goes on and the pair settle down into their roles. In fact Lundgren goes a 360-degree turnaround at the end and actually becomes quite good as the psychotic soldier who believes that he&apos;s surrounded by the enemy. Van Damme? Well, here he plays a more sympathetic character than usual which will no doubt endear him to female fans, while still providing the high-kicking action that the fans expect. Ally Walker is terrible, though, as the intensely annoying female lead, and although it&apos;s good to see Ed O&apos;Ross make an appearance as a colonel, he&apos;s underused and killed off quickly.\n\nThe flimsy plot strings together a scene of big-budget action sequences (no surprise, as most of Roland Emmerich&apos;s films are thus styled, e.g. INDEPENDENCE DAY) which are pretty impressive. From the opening hostage stakeout at the Hoover Dam to the shoot-up at a motel, to the climatic truck chase and the final battle with Van Damme and Lundgren, things just keep getting better and better. The high body count sees lots of people getting shot or killed in nasty ways, and of course there&apos;s the usual quota of bullet-shedding and big explosions.\n\nLundgren&apos;s method of death at the end of the movie (like you couldn&apos;t guess) is highly graphic and unexpected. The loud score is sufficiently adrenaline-pumping to work and the film tries so hard to please that the feeling rubs off on the audience. Although it may be dumb entertainment, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER &quot;delivers the groceries&quot; so to speak and is quite watchable in a forgettable way, in that it passes the time and engages the attention but doesn&apos;t leave much impact afterwards. It may be a popcorn movie but it&apos;s undoubtedly a well-made one.",

This is how some people living on the periphery of civilized world have to make their way through all odds ...... fighting for their own life and their would be child&apos;s life.\n\nBut it takes sharpened intellect to appreciate this movie. People and the X-generation who are used to watching fiction films directed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas can never grasp the true meaning of life and its struggles. People born with silver spoons in their mouths can hardly watch such movies for they lack the sheer imagination that is characteristic of suffering/solitude/empathy and a longing to sacrifice everything for the posterity.",

      "reviewBody": "I love experimental and avant garde cinema, even though once one strays past the superstar directors (Bunuel, Cocteau, Robbe-Grillet, Jodorowsky, Arrabal, etc.) it can be tough sledding. Alain Fleischer&apos;s ZOO ZERO is one of the dumbest of the failures -it makes Fred Haines&apos;s film of STEPPENWOLF look professional.\n\nFleischer&apos;s non-career is littered with these alliterative titles (REGLES, RITES; ROME ROMEO), signalling abstract surrealism, and that&apos;s what he delivers up. With an annoying soundtrack that emphasizes Mozart&apos;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; but includes distorted sounds worthy of Herschell Gordon Lewis amateurish HOW TO MAKE A DOLL, he has created a film designed to test one&apos;s patience.\n\nIt&apos;s shot at night with monochrome or duochrome effects, in an apocalyptic setting of the zoo, lorded over by guest star Klaus Kinski (who speaks only through a trendy vocoder stolen apparently from Peter Frampton but suggesting Stephen Hawking (!)), and a cabaret setting starring the ethereally beautiful &amp; decadent Catherine Jourdan. She&apos;s a singer doted on by Pierre Clementi, without whose presence a film like this would feel half empty, while dwarf Pieral looks after Jourdan&apos;s career as her mean manager. Add to the mix an endlessly laughing guest star Alida Valli (she provides the project with &quot;instant class&quot; given her previous career). Silliest touch is casting that sturdy French character comedian Rufus as the chauffeur of the vintage Cadillac, who has a part-time career as a ventriloquist with a duck as dummy named Donald (!).\n\nIf this sounds stupid, it is, with a capital S. It&apos;s all atmosphere, visual allusions, and mucho tedium as Fleischer tantalizes and frustrates the viewer in equal fashion. In my film festival-hopping days (back in the &apos;70s) there were many films like this floating around, of which only the most grotesque (and sexually charged -c.f., WEDDING TROUGH or years later SINGAPORE SLING) got one&apos;s attention. Fleischer keeps Jourdan under wraps except for one brief scene, and his film suffers.\n\nThe presence of dwarf Pieral, who was so brilliant in the Cocteau classic directed by Jean Delannoy, THE ETERNAL RETURN, hints at Jean Cocteau as the inspiration for this nonsense. Cocteau wrote the guidebook for avant garde effects with his classic ORPHEE, and Fleischer studiously copies.\n\nStaring at Jourdan kept my attention but I was quite disappointed at the misuse of Kinski here - it falls squarely in with his sincere love of working for &quot;manageable&quot; (read: HACK) directors. Shortly after watching ZOO ZERO I saw Gerry O&apos;Hara&apos;s 1965 Swinging London movie THE PLEASURE GIRLS, and Kinski was outstanding in that forgotten softcore opus -again able to push the director around. Claire Denis was an assistant director for this one, and she tried her hand at this sort of crap with TROUBLE EVERY DAY."

Scarlett Johansson is both very pretty and talented and the camera lovingly moves around her, searching for her beautiful eyes and puffy lustful lips, very much reminding me of Bertolucci&apos;s love for the beauty of Liv Tyler in &quot;Stealing beauty&quot;. Colin Firth is again producing a most powerful impact by his tall dominating figure, deep beautiful voice and reserved yet sensual and passionate attitude. A strikingly good picture in the ocean of mediocre productions.",

      "reviewBody": "Fright Night, Lost Boys and Near Dark are the holy trinity of 80s vampire flicks. And arguably three of the best vampires movies of all-time. Just recently I returned to this piece of 80&apos;s horror gold and I have to say, I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it.\n\nFright Night is about a kid named Charlie Brewster who accidentally discovers that his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, is a vampire. The movie is about Charlie and friends setting out to destroy the vampire. But Mr. Dandridge is no slouch and is more of a threat to them, then they are to him.\n\nBesides being one of the best 80&apos;s horror films, I think it&apos;s also one of the best movies of the entire 1980s. The movie is full of great performances, especially Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige and Roddy McDowall as TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent. It has fantastic make-up effects that are sorely, sorely missing from today&apos;s horror flicks. And it also combines a great feel of horror with a realistic touch of comedy and drama. The best and funniest aspect to the movie for myself is how they portray the vampire character. I won&apos;t spoil it for you, but the guy enjoys wearing very &quot;tata&quot; clothes, eats &quot;fruit&quot; all the time, and has a live-in roommate. This movie is classic! Fright Night has a sequel that some say is equally as good, but I wouldn&apos;t be one to say that. But, I do enjoy the sequel and definitely think it&apos;s worth a view. If you&apos;re a fan of horror and vampires, this is a must see flick. Welcome to Fright Night baby!",

      "name": "The enchanted forest is a nice comedy-fantasy film  with fabulous interpretations , luxurious cinematography and a magical musical score",
      "reviewBody": "Shot in Galician style , it deals with various stories intertwine themselves and revolving around a magical forest surrounding a village called Cecebre . The film shows the adventures of the human inhabitants of the shrubland of Cecebre and how their paths cross over under the shelter of a lively forest where animals , people and plants form a harmonious system . It notably tells the misfortunes of Malvís (Alfredo Landa) , a farm hand sick of the shortages of his trade , who decides to become a bungling outlaw and hides in the shrubland under the alias Fendetestas , and who is joined by a kid as an apprentice , Fuco . As Malvis assaults and robs the people cross the lush wood . It also deals with Geraldo (Fernando , ¨Chato¨ Valverde) , a well-digger who lost a leg while whale hunting and is in love with Hermelinda (Alejandra Grepi) , who is leaving to the city fed up with her domineering , stingy aunt Juanita (Encarna Paso) ; of the D&apos;Abondo family , as the wealthy Sr. D&apos;Abando who rents his mansion to two sisters Gloria (Alicia Hermida) and Amelia (Amparo Baró) ; of the lost soul of Fiz De Cotobelo (Miguel Rellán) , a spectre or ghoul who wants to go Cuba , being damned to follow the procession of spirits ; and of the lords and ladies of the parish ; there is also a witch (Maria Isberts) who gives advises , lucky charms and predicts future events , among other characters .\n\nThe Enchanted Forest is a 1987 marvelous Spanish comedy-fantasy film stunningly directed by José Luis Cuerda, based on the eponymous novel written by Wenceslao Fernández Flórez , with an enjoyable script by the prestigious Rafael Azcona . The flick is pretty well , though is marred by a direct sound and , being overlong , including lots of roles . The film has a large ensemble cast headed by the great Alfredo Landa who gives a top-notch performance as a botcher bandit . It was a critical success winning five Goya Awards including Best Film , Best Director and Best Actor , Alfredop Landa . Support cast is frankly extraordinary such as : Fernando Valverde as the worried cripple who attempts to declare his love to Hermelinda , Miguel Rellán as Fiz De Cotovelo , Alicia Hermida as Gloria Roade , Amparo Baró as Amelia Roade , Fernando Rey as Sr. D&apos;Abondo , Manuel Alexandre as Roque Freire , Encarna Paso as Juanita Arruallo , María Isbert as Moucha , Antonio Gomero as civil guard , Paca Gabaldón as Sra. D&apos;Abondo and several others . \n\nIn addition , a spotless pictorial cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and a willingness , almost perfect of the elements of each shot , every sequence , every space ; being filmed on location in Sobrado dos Monxes, A Coruña, Galicia, Spain . Aguirresarobe subsequently would make a prestigious career in Hollywood such as ¨Fright night , ¨The twilight saga: eclipse¨, ¨The road¨ , ¨The others¨ and many others . Furthermore , a magic , evocative and sensitive score by José Nieto . El Bosque Animado (English: The enchanted forest) was compellingly directed by José Luis Cuerda . Cuerda is a veteran professional , being his film debut ¨Pares and Nones¨ a typical Madrid comedy . He subsequently directed this ¨El Bosque Animado¨ also with script by notorious Rafael Azcona and based on Wenceslao Fernandez Florez&apos;s novel . In the nineties he followed directing failures as a drama titled ¨Viuda De Capitan Contreras¨ and more comedies as ¨La Marrana¨ and ¨Tocando Fondo¨ , a farce about the economic crisis . His greatest success corresponds as producer , as he produced hits for Alejandro Amenabar as ¨Tesis¨ and ¨Abre Los Ojos¨, among others . His highly-acclaimed and successful movie was ¨Lengua De Mariposas¨ , it has a rating as better than average and is a beautiful and powerful film . His most personal movies were two comedies with a peculiar and surrealist sense of humor , this ¨Amanece Que no Es Poco¨ and the following titled ¨Asi en el Cielo Como en Tierra¨ but in anti-religion trending .",

Who would make a film\n\nabout an air-race between London and Paris, and do it as a comedy, with almost perfect dialogue, details and acting, but the British?\n\nA number of vintage aircraft (circa 1909) were repaired/constructed\n\nand flown for the flight sequencies, from the minuscle Demoiselle (the replica too small to have a male pilot!) via big, boxkite-like Cody&apos;s, inspired by Farmans to the Antoinette, which was 100% original!\n\nAs in any slapstick film there are villains (Terry Thomas, and Eric Sykes), pompous Germans, elegant Italians, flirting Frenchmen and the honest guy, of course!\n\nLiking both British humour and aircraft, plus the good acting, the clever and exciting cinematography, and the excellent directing from Mr Annikin I can&apos;t but smile!\n\n9/10, easily!",

      "reviewBody": "Egoyan immediately sets the noir tone of &apos;Where The Truth Lies&apos; by revealing so much yet cleverly not telling anything. The film gets straight to the point right from the start as we are introduced to a Jerry Lewis Dean Martin type entertainment duo, a haunting image of a corpse in a bathtub and a determined young lady wanting to write about her idols. The slick editing allows the film to maintain its steady track. Egoyan finely contrasts the 50s and 70s. The wonderful mise en scene, flashy lighting and score bring out a 50&apos;s feel. While the score brings out a lot of mysteriousness of the 70s (the sex and drugs phase). The camera-work deserves mention. Most of the scenes of the 50&apos;s scenes were effectively done with long shots, while a lot of the 70&apos;s scenes were shot with quick snaps.\n\nThen there&apos;s the unusual cast that includes Kevin Bacon, Alison Lohman and Colin Firth. Bacon gives an energetic performance as the younger Lanny Morris of the 50s and he brings a &apos;lost&apos; maturity as the 70&apos;s Morris. While a majority have stated Lohman as being miscast, I found her to have the right combination of naivety, sex appeal and vulnerability as Karen. The actress certainly holds her own in the presence of the more accomplished actors and bravely carries the film. Firth is remarkable and he completely sheds his Darcy image and gives a more restrained (and sometimes explosive, where required) performance as Vince Collins. Rachel Blanchard demonstrates the right kind of deceitful innocence and enigma.\n\nSome have stated the sex scenes to be of a &apos;cold&apos; nature. However, I didn&apos;t see it that way. Sexuality is an integral part of the film and it is hinted that each character sees it differently. Bacon&apos;s Morris pays a lot of attention to his sexual partner&apos;s eyes and after-sex behaviour. I can&apos;t reveal much about the other characters without spilling out spoilers but their views differ. There&apos;s the frighteningly erotic love scene between Alice and Karen followed by a distraught look on Lohman&apos;s face. The last sex-scene was particularly disturbing as this is the scene that brings out their alternative side.\n\nHowever, the revelation in the end was a bit of a letdown. Not because of the twist which is clever enough but the motivation behind it would have worked better had more background information been provided. Where The Truth Lies&apos; mainly works because of Egoyan&apos;s unique presentation and storytelling, the visual flair, the performances, the score and the stunning combination of all the themes ie, sex, drugs, sexuality, murder, fame (sounds a bit clichéd but it is shown differently)."

      "reviewBody": "There are so many things to love about this film, starting with all of the places it takes us to and how beautifully they&apos;re captured. My goodness, it&apos;s gorgeous at times. There&apos;s also a wonderful little lookahead to technology of the future; though it&apos;s only set 8 years later, in 1999, there are all sorts of advances shown that are fun to compare to how things really turned out, such as the video phones, the Russian surveillance program with the animation of a bear that informs the user &quot;I&apos;m searching,&quot; and what Max von Sydow is cooking up in the desert. The soundtrack is comprised of great songs from an all-star list of bands from the period, and they fit the mood of the film perfectly. The film has got an apocalyptic feeling to it, and yet the story is playful and light, because the focus is on stolen money and chase that goes all over the world in the first half. As Solveig Dommartin&apos;s character puts it, &quot;If it was the end of the world, why shouldn&apos;t we go down laughing?&quot;\n\nI confess that for most of the runtime I thought this would have been better either as a drama/chase focused on the threat of nuclear Armageddon, or as a science fiction film about the technology of extracting images out of our brains, which is what we see in the second half, but not both. Aside from making the film god-awful long, it wasn&apos;t clear how these two things were really connected, that is, until the final half hour or so. Wenders seems to be saying that the threat to humanity may not actually be what everyone was worried about at the time, nuclear war (or in this case, a catastrophic nuclear accident), it may be people become addicted to technology, and having it steal their souls. It was absolutely remarkable to see the characters staring down bleary-eyed into their devices, when 30 years later we&apos;ve all ended up staring down into our phones. What was a wonderfully organic community out in the Australian outback, with time for dancing and music amidst all of the research, becomes fractured, with isolated individuals caring more about their devices than others. I absolutely loved this aspect of the film.\n\nWhile it had a lot going for it, so much so that I might have rated it a little higher, I also struggled with it. Four hours and 47 minutes is a lot, and the film drags at times. In the first half it suffers from escape sequences that seem hokey in their conception and then not all that well acted, and in the second half, it just lags. I&apos;ve liked William Hurt elsewhere, but did not like him at all here; I thought his performance was weak from beginning to end. Solveig Dommartin is just barely passable; while she brings a certain soul to the role and is easy on the eyes to say the least, she delivers her lines with very little range. Thank goodness for Max von Sydow and Jeanne Moreau, who were such a joy to see. Maybe I&apos;m being too hard on the film or maybe I would have liked the three hour theatrical release that Wenders dismissed as the &quot;Reader&apos;s Digest&quot; version better, I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s got lots of moments that are 5 star and overall it&apos;s definitely worth seeing, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it without reservations.",

      "reviewBody": "Anni Rosar, one of the best loved German character actresses, is somewhat out of her element in this role as a melancholic old spinster. Rosar was known for her rough and grumpy personality, as well as her comedic flair. In this film, the 70 year old uses her acting chops to tuck at your tear glands. - Deeply religious, Rosar&apos;s character spent her life as a domestic employee with wealthy family. In hopes to earn herself favor with God, she finances her nephew&apos;s seminary studies. For years she sends money to this nephew, only to eventually learn that he is a charlatan who took advantage of the woman, spending her hard earned money on his own support and amusement. Shattered by this revelation, Rosar wants to find absolution, fearing her soul is in danger of not being accepted to enter heaven. - Many empathetic bystanders, particularly a kindly young priest, are touched by the old woman&apos;s deep faith. The final scenes are very sentimental, even if a bit far fetched. The overall effect of this gorgeous color production (still rare for late 50s German cinema) is that a very pleasant &quot;Heimatfilm&quot;, a timeless feel-good movie. This is the kind of film expected to be shown during Holiday programming...in the early days of television, when only 3 channels offered only a few hours of programming each day. It&apos;s definitely above-average old German family fare!",

      "reviewBody": "The Oscar-nominated documentary &apos;Garbage Dreams&apos; is a film that sees global issues at an absolutely grassroots level. It shows how international companies and the desire for modernization lead to the marginalization of the poor and the inconvenience of the general population. But it focuses on Adham, 17, Nabil, 18, and Osama, 16, three Zabbaleen youths, and Leila, a social worker and teacher of the community&apos;s new recycling school. The film is &quot;about&quot; the &quot;Zabbaleen,&quot; the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; whose community collected and recycled trash in the city of Cairo for many generations.\n\nCairo, a city of 18 or 20 million now, nobody knows for sure, never had a system of garbage collection -- but for a hundred years or so it has had the zabbaleen. Zabāla in Egyptian Arabic means &quot;garbage;&quot; zabbāl is a garbage professional/expert/person. The Zabbaleen are a 60,000-strong community of people who live in a place on the outskirts of the city called Mokattam. They are known to have routinely recycled 80% of the waste they collected, which they got directly from people&apos;s houses, gathering it up and sorting it with infinite care in big plastic bags, even the smallest objects, cutting off the tops of cans, shredding up plastics, and feeding the edible waste to a herd of hogs that they had. They could keep pigs because they were Coptic Christians, and so, unlike Muslims, permitted to eat pork. This warm and engaging and saddening documentary tells the story of the Zabbaleen and the terrible luck that has recently befallen them through globalization: multinational companies have been brought in by the Egyptian government to collect the trash, turning the Zabbaleen into marginal scavengers.\n\nOf course the conditions of the Zabbaleen were unhealthy, living among piles of garbage, and they lived in poverty. But as we learn from Mai Iskander&apos;s film, they have always taken great pride in their work. And well they might. What they did was good for the environment, provided them with a livelihood, and rid the huge city of mountains of waste. Too bad the explosion of car ownership in Cairo in recent decades has led to smoggy air. But modern trash removal systems, even with curbside recycling, never recycle anything like 80%. Much of what they collect is incinerated, including organic waste, leading to more carbon dioxide in the air and producing miles of landfill.\n\nBut this is getting ahead of ourselves. &apos;Garbage Dreams&apos; is first of all about people, and it focuses on those four inhabitants of Mokattam. Adham is a youth whose father is in jail, leaving him head of the family. His dad is doing time for building an addition on the roof of their house without a permit, so Adham would have an apartment and could get married. But getting married is exactly what Adham doesn&apos;t want to do. Nabil, the handsomest of the three, speaks less, but when he does, he always has something to say. He&apos;s artistic and paints murals, and raises pigeons on the roof. He&apos;s peaceful and sits up there gazing out on the world with the birds perched on his arm. In the course of the documentary he establishes himself as a man in the traditional way, by getting married. Osama is a problem boy, always complaining and making excuses, never sticking to any job but claiming that&apos;s because it interests him to try different things. Is he retarded, or cleverly devious? He always has a big grin, and takes care of his younger siblings. He wants to better himself. In the end he goes to work for the foreign garbage collection company and says &quot;50% of them respect me, and I&apos;m working on the other 50%.&quot; In two years he says he&apos;s &quot;filled out&quot; and become a &quot;lover,&quot; and he gets married.\n\nWhen the disaster of the foreign companies strikes, Leila presides at meetings of the Zabbaleen. They go around to sample groups of people and propose their putting out their trash in separated form, hoping evidently to be appreciated for their help.\n\nIn a memorable and for them momentous segment of the film, Adham and Nabil are sent by an organization to Wales to observe modern western refuse collection and recycling. They marvel at the green land, the controlled traffic. They pick up English quickly. They wonder at the lovely equipment the recyclers have. Back home Adham (deftly) works a scissors machine to decapitate cans. Here it happens on an assembly line that does it all touch-free. On the other hand, the boys note that the Welsh garbage people have &quot;organization, but not precision.&quot; Their elaborate system is not as comprehensive as the Zabbaleen&apos;s; they are missing 30% of what they could recycle. Adham dreams of having his own can recycling factory. When they get back, Adham sits and listens to tapes of their Welsh lady sponsor&apos;s favorite song, dreaming of coolness and expanses of green grass.\n\nNabil notes that, despite their marginalization now, they&apos;re also more visible in the world at large to champions of recycling, who see the Zabbaleen (and their counterparts in other poor countries) as heroes of a green future. \n\nThe impoverished Cairenes in &apos;Garbage Dreams&apos; are full of life and hope. But they&apos;re also angry about the hand that recent events have dealt them. The film, which is beautifully photographed (Mai Iskander has many years of experience as a camera person), is a seamless and intimate of portrait of people whose personal lives mirror public events. Iskander&apos;s father was born and raised in Egypt, and she visited Cairo often growing up and knew Mokattam from being taken to a wedding there as a teenager.\n\nShowing at the IFC Center in New York in January 6-12 2010, &apos;Garbage Dreams&apos; has won a dozen festival awards and is being sponsored for home hosted DVD showings. It was screened at the Saul Zaentz Media Center in Berkeley by the Gaia (Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives) group.",

      "reviewBody": "One day back in 1962, documentary filmmaker François Reichenbach was traveling from Normandy to Paris when he saw a sign reading &quot;Loué: 4km&quot;. He went to this place (a small town of 1,800 people or should we say a big village?), had a good meal there and decided to spend the night at a local hotel. The next morning, when he looked out of his bedroom window at the village square, he was astonished by the activity prevailing there. Under his eyes, a military march past in one corner, a gathering of cows in another as well as several other mini-events were in progress. Fascinated by this unexpected sight, Reichenbach decided to stay in Loué, and not go back to Paris. He actually spent most of the following year in Loué, filming the events (or non-events) punctuating the everyday life in this small town (or should we say big village?) situated in the middle of the countryside. In what was to become &quot;La douceur du village&quot;, his camera fixed for all Eternity the rehearsal of the town&apos;s brass band, the wedding of the mayor&apos;s daughter, a funeral, an agricultural show, children attending an elementary school class, the draft board examination, and so on. But, although relevant as an ethnographic document, the filming of such trivial activities might well lack dramatic power. Fortunately aware of the problem, Reichenbach found a suitable solution : to supplement the images with an offbeat commentary. To be true, commentary is not the right word, it consists rather in a long monologue delivered by a late career schoolmaster. Moreover, this speech is not in direct relation with what is shown on the screen but takes the form sixteen lessons of general science, whose subjects range from &quot;the Poppy&quot; to &quot;Progress&quot;, from &quot;the Cow &quot;to &quot;Marriage&quot;, and the like. Expressed in a peremptory, self-satisfied, pontificating tone, these &quot;lessons&quot; purport that there is a role each human being is bound to play in (a rigid) society, at each age and for each sex. In a lifetime men or women have no other choice but to be born, to work hard (at manual jobs only), to do their military service (reference is made to the two World Wars but none to the Algerian War!), to marry (no other sex life considered than heterosexuality), to be a faithful and supportive wife, to have kids... before dying a natural death (according to the master, no blood crime has ever been committed in Loué!) Thanks to such a device, Reichenbach manages to bring additional depth to his film by giving more scope to what could have been a mere report. Through the schoolmaster&apos;s conservative speech, he puts the people shown on the screen into a broader sociological and ideological context. At the same time, this conventional peroration sounds so incongruous, simplistic and outdated (it was already outmoded back in the early 60s!) that it automatically creates laughter, humor being an unexpected but welcome added value. The trouble though is that, in the long run, this omnipresent lecture winds up being monotonous and boring, not to say a bit annoying. The film runs 47 minutes and at the end of half an hour, it becomes hard to bear. Reichenbach seems to have forgotten the rule according to which boredom was once born from uniformity. He should either have cut about a quarter of an hour or else instilled some variety into the soundtrack. Another small defect inherent in having the schoolmaster&apos;s voice accompanying the whole film is that it creates a mocking distance, itself implying a certain condescension from the intellectual Parisian director. Not everybody will agree with those two criticisms, the most obvious evidence of it being that &quot;La douceur du village&quot; was awarded the Best Short Film Award at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. But whether or not you blame him for the two shortcomings mentioned above, François Reichenbach must be credited for giving life to this interesting (and overall entertaining) sociological document, which doubtless constitutes a landmark in in the filmed history of our country.",

I was expecting it to be terrible, after reading IMDb reviews, but it actually turned out to be OK. The setting of the film is what gets the most marks from me - I love seeing the shots of the house and island from the sea. It&apos;s THE perfect setting for a horror film. I do think it was a little wasted on this particular film though. Never mind.\n\nThe film itself isn&apos;t too bad, it just drags a bit in some places and I didn&apos;t like the witchcraft theme. I found the scenes where people are transported via that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; style vortex extremely cringe-making. It looked like something from a cheap 80&apos;s sci-fi film! Other than that I thought the death of the old woman was excellent - she gets her lips sewn together and is hung upside down above a lit fireplace. She can&apos;t scream for help and the others have no idea she&apos;s there. Now there&apos;s an original death for you! The parts where the helicopter flies around the house are also excellent - the people inside can&apos;t signal for help because the house has trapped them inside. \n\nI would recommend horror fans to give this a watch, it&apos;s silly and boring at times but the good bits make up for that.",

      "reviewBody": "With a stellar cast and mediocre plot, this movie is well executed and the acting skills of the leads raise the movie above it&apos;s material on paper. Redfor seems to be enjoying himself and the writers gave each character little human quirks that can&apos;t help but make you smile. In one seen, Redford, playing a lawyer is sharing an office with &quot;Kelly&quot; his new partner after he gets caught shaking the sheets with D. Hannahs character and he is moving from chair to chair in the small office finally stating, &quot;I&apos;m a pacer&quot;, someone who needs to walk back and forth in order to think clearly.\n\nThere is an opening scene with a 60&apos;s party that has a Warhol feeling&quot; to it that I enjoyed, as I grew up in those times. And while it plays only a small part in the movie, it brought back a flood of good memories for me. (Anyone remember &quot;The Electric Circus?&quot;)\n\nD. Hannah gives a completely 80&apos;s reminiscent piece of performance art that is very pych. connected to the wounded character she plays, and if you wait for the credits, you find she played a big part in authoring the piece.\n\nBasically, its the types of movie that is not even in your top ten or twenty, yet you can&apos;t help but enjoying it each time you watch it, and you are pleased to see it on the schedule when it is. Kind of a &quot;non-guilty guilty pleasure&quot;, I can&apos;t help but enjoy the cast, the full of holes plot and poor continuity, (the faux pas of timing and lighting are mentioned in other reviews.) Even Redford&apos;s little girl in the movie is one of those kids you have even and enjoy, but can&apos;t recall her name. there is an early character role played by Christine Baranski who either got some work done or simply learned how to use her assets better later in her career.\n\nJust watch with an excepting, open mind and you may not only enjoy it, but it may be a cult favorite at some point. *note-my wife is a wall st. attorney and absolutely hates the film as do many other lawyers we know. why? Who knows? Maybe they&apos;re strung too tight to let go and enjoy the simple ride."

      "reviewBody": "From the land that spawned probably the most zombie films to this date, ranging in quality from excellent to exremely dull, comes one film that rises above nearly all the rest. DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE (aka CEMETERY MAN) is that film, and if you haven&apos;t seen it yet, you are seriously missing out. The story is about lonely cemetery attendant Francesco (Rupert Everett (!?) in one of his very early roles)and his mute, Igor-like assistant Gnaghi. Every seven days, the dead rise from their graves (for no real apparent reason...) and it is Francesco and Gnaghi&apos;s job to dispatch them. The 2 live a pretty solitary existence until a mysterious woman comes along and into Francesco&apos;s life. Cut to the chase- Francesco and the woman have sex on her newly buried husband&apos;s grave, and when he returns from the dead, everything goes haywire from there...\n\nDELLAMORTE DELLAMORE is several films rolled into one...zombie gore film, dark comedy, romance story - similar in some ways to perhaps DEADALIVE (not nearly as silly or gory), but this is a hard film to make a comparison on. It really is it&apos;s own unique experience and should definitely be viewed by anyone into horror/zombie films. Again, one of my all-time zombie favorites...Highly Recommended 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "In 1943, in Munich, the student Sophie Magdalena Scholl (Lena Stolze) finds that her brother Hans Scholl (Wulf Kessler) has formed the resistance group The White Rose with three other friends of the University of Munich and they are distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets to other students and wall writing political statements against Hitler. Sophie decides to join the group and is assigned in principle to small tasks.\n\nMeanwhile the Gestapo is investigating and hunting down the group. While distributing pamphlets in the University of Munich, Hans and Sophie are arrested by the Gestapo that also finds Christoph Probst (Werner Stocker). They are sentenced to death and beheaded in the guillotine.\n\n&quot;Die Weiße Rose&quot; is a wonderful film of idealism and courage during World War II and based on a true story. I saw this film for the first time in the 80&apos;s and after watching &quot;Sophie Scholl - Die Letzten Tage&quot;, I have decided to see it again on my rare VHS.\n\n&quot;Die Weiße Rose&quot; shows the big picture about the resistance group &quot;The White Rose&quot; and &quot;Sophie Scholl - Die Letzten Tage&quot; is a dramatization of the last days of Sophie. The story about a German resistance group against the atrocity of Hitler and the Nazi is unusual and both films have many scenes in common and practically complete each other. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Rosa Branca&quot; (&quot;The White Rose&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "You know those moments in American movies about fictional presidents where the heroine (it&apos;s almost always a heroine) realizes just what a normal, decent, lovelorn man-of-the-people the president really is, a moment that usually solidifies her love for him? Well, leave it to the Koreans to construct a movie almost entirely out of scenes like those. In fact, this film&apos;s President Han (Ahn Sung-ki) is such a man of the people, he hangs out in subways with bums and drives the occasional cab to find out what his citizens really think! His approach to policy amounts to centrist vagaries like &quot;Our policy shouldn&apos;t be superficial or formal, but full of hope for the future is most important.&quot; Yes, Ahn Sung-ki makes a very cuddly president, which is probably why a no-nonsense high school teacher named Choi Eun-soo (Cha Ji-woo), who takes no crap from his bratty daughter, eventually falls for him after a series of romantic moments (on a city bus, at a jazz festival, in a tavern closet, on a rainy Seoul sidewalk and via a piano serenade of &quot;Love Is A Many Splendored Thing&quot; - that in any other cinema besides Korea&apos;s would be loosely termed as stalking. If one had to pick a Korean actor to play the Korean president, it would be Ahn Sung-ki, and I&apos;m absolutely certain the dignified, popular actor would top many filmmakers&apos; lists as well. Now if only one of them had thought of the idea before writer/director Jeon, who wallows in candy floss sentimentality that doesn&apos;t require much conflict and has little payoff, Ahn could have had the role of a lifetime. Of interest in this film is the fact that the characters discuss (and constantly hear the theme song from) the Hollywood soaper LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING, which featured Korean-American actor Phillip Ahn in a sizable role. 3."

      "reviewBody": "This film was directed by Mrinal Sen. He had a knack to represent things and character in some different fashion. They are differently narrative and finish with an uneasiness in the mind of the audience. Audience would not feel fully satisfied with the ending but would believe that it was what the film was destined for. I heard he has influence of European films, specially french in his works and it just proved so true to me. The camera work, sound, representing characters are very unlike of Indian movies of that time and I can now understand why he is compared to Satyajit Ray. To me this film seems very well acted and plotted. I don&apos;t know, probably I could relate with the movie more and that&apos;s the reason I am more interested in it? &quot;Khandhar&quot;, the ruined house is the movie I am talking about. One of the best performances of Shabana Azmi with a gloomy melancholy narration of past is what wondered me. The unspoken words, the helplessness, the unresponsiveness towards what is happening in that time set the film apart. Audience will feel a bit of dissatisfaction, a gloom over the plot. The main theme is of a ruined house where three friends come to see one of the friend&apos;s ancestral house which is in a verge to be ruined. They came there to have good times and there could the story be ended but Shabana Azmi turned this table around and took the charge from here. It was indeed not a solo performance by her but she put the best on it. She is my one of the favorite actresses but she just broke her record and set it to a distance difficult to cross. She had been thoroughly submerged in the character and you can not apart her from the character. As a director Mrinal Sen had some experiment with the background and camera. He extensively chose some background focus and some sudden wonders. I am feeling lucky that I came across this film on my own--just by delving inside. Would like to watch more films like this in coming days and try to find more from themcause films are made for a cause.",

The mood and creepiness was pretty intense at times.\n\nIt is NOT just a remake of the original movie, as some would have you think. Yes, it uses that format, and follows it pretty closely, but does it better and takes it a few steps farther. Just because it uses the same format doesn&apos;t mean it is the same movie. That is like saying all &apos;Cop&apos; movies or all &apos;Buddy Pictures&apos; are the same, just because they also follow the same format.\n\nIf you saw the first movie, you will recognize everything that is happening here, but that doesn&apos;t decrease the sense of dread and hair-raising-on-the-back-of-your-neck scariness. Instead, I think it will increase your enjoyment as you watch things develop. Talk about things that go &apos;bump in the night!&apos; And sometimes in the daytime, too! I thought this movie was more intense than the original, and it helps to put the original into a context, and makes more sense out of it all.\n\nIs it a perfect movie? No, but show me a perfect movie. They all could be better in SOME way, and this is no exception, but I think it is a pretty darn good movie, and worth the time.\n\nOh, I should also tell you kind of &quot;Where I&apos;m coming from.&quot; I LOVE a good horror movie. I LIKE to be scared. But I hate slasher, torture, vicious movies or movies that get too overt about hurting people. Give us something we can feel, something we are afraid of, but don&apos;t make us sick. I think Paranormal Activity 2 is just my kind of horror movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Charles is a young provincial coming up to Paris to study law. He shares his cousin Paul&apos;s flat. Paul is a kind of decadent boy, a disillusioned pleasure-seeker, always dragging along with other idles, while Charles is a plodding, naive and honest man. He fell in love with Florence, one of Paul&apos;s acquaintances. But how will Paul react to that attempt to build a real love relationship? \n\nOf the so-called French New Wave directors, Claude Chabrol has been called possibly the most mainstream (though less celebrated than Truffaut or Godard). We could also say he has a remarkable amount of stamina. &quot;Les Cousins&quot; was at the beginning of his career, and for decades he kept making great movies, including the notable &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; in 1991... and still kept going.\n\nI love this film&apos;s blend of decadence and death. A simple man, with studies on his mind, is exposed to some bizarre scenes of sensuality, violence, crime, and even Nazi elements (in 1950s France?). This is what it is like if you take two opposing elements and allow them to spin out of control.",

If you love the &apos;80s (this movie was filmed &apos;89) and miss the simplicity of that era, then you&apos;ll probably enjoy Taking Care of Business. Yes, there&apos;s cheesy dialogue and overacting and all that good stuff. The bottom line is that the jokes work. Not to mention that both Belushi and Grodin are perfect in their roles. Grodin does what is expected of him and Belushi plays the type of happy go lucky character he should&apos;ve always played. This is a great movie for those who want a short and well deserved break from the digital age.",

The scene that really clinched it for me was the horse racing scene. Ingrid and Cary do the same scene! It&apos;s scary. All they did was update the plotline a little (ie, virus instead of gunpowder for the Nazis), throw in some action (well, a lot of action), and bogus technology, and you&apos;re set.\n\nWatch Notorious for yourself and see what I mean..."

This is one of the most vomit inducing performances i have ever come across.\n\nThis being said, i encourage the use of this movie in film studies as a &quot;How NOT to do it...&quot; educational movie.",

I could almost see myself in their places so many years ago. Of course, my siblings and I wouldn&apos;t have done some of the things these grandkids end up doing.  The last 10 minutes of the film make up for some rather boring parts spent on the adult characters."

      "name": "A tasteless comedy of extraordinary magnitude!!",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; is tasteless, unsophisticated, and decidedly sophomoric... and one of the most hilarious films ever made! A string of politically incorrect segments made by the creators of &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, &quot;KFM&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-rated romp that today, nearly 30 years after its release, would be too shocking to even warrant the dreaded &quot;NC-17&quot; rating. Forget those unfunny amateurs Broken Lizard or the overrated Farrelly Brothers. We&apos;re talking naked breasts, oral sex, racial slurs, violence... and yet each segment leaves you delirious from not only laughter but disbelief at the fact that the Zuckers actually go away with all this. I&apos;ve discovered that it really takes a certain kind of innocence to make a movie like &quot;KFM&quot;, a naive belief that people will simply laugh at the crude spectacle of it all. Segments include a wholesome couple listening to a 1950s style &quot;how-to&quot; record on foreplay (wait till you see what the record comes equipped with), a thrill seeker whose trademark stunt is going to a crowd of black men and yelling out the N-word (how bold is this scene? No one has dared imitate it since), and a political debate between two analysts that ends with one of them cheerfully telling the other to &quot;blow it out your a**&quot; and giving them the finger. The highlight is the mini-movie within the movie, &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot;. A parody of all the Bruce Lee films, its hero, Loo, fights the evil Klahn, a one-armed criminal mastermind with a fondness for the phrase &quot;extraordinary magnitude&quot;. It also pokes fun at the endless fights from the Lee films, as well as the characters&apos; fractured English (little trivia, the actors really were Asian and spoke poor English in real life, so it wasn&apos;t intentional on their parts) The twist ending of &quot;Yen&quot; is one of the goofiest things you ever saw in your life. Despite the often offensive humor of &quot;KFM&quot;, it&apos;s not a mean film by any means. No one is really safe from the wacky chaos it inflicts, and it&apos;s just hilarious. In our time of hand-wringing political correctness, &quot;KFM&quot; offers a cathartic experience of laughing out loud at our fears, prejudices, and, yes, stupidity. This is indeed a finger-lickin&apos; good comedy.",

Not a great film, but when you&apos;re drunk, even the principal looks kinda cute (especially tarted up, a la Carla)."

      "reviewBody": "When I saw &quot;Capote&quot; I was really impressed by the presentation of the story and the quality of the acting. When I saw &quot;Infamous&quot; today, I was caught up with the story in a way I had not been before. It was closer to the experience when I read the book many,many years ago. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is about killing human beings, and I believe that it is no more right for cold blooded murders to do it than for me do do it as a member of society that authorizes the death penalty. I believe that the film as well as the book makes people think about this issue The cast was superb, and I said the same about the earlier rendition, but this time the characters were fully developed and believable under the circumstances. I had been impressed before, but this film is different from the last--it is more emotional, more detailed in rendition of the characters, and more interested in showing not just the destruction of Truman Capote, but in sharing the ideas that he expressed in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;.\n\nWhen I was growing up (I am 62 now) I recall that I did not like Capote when I saw him on talk shows repeatedly. I really knew nothing of gay culture or what even that meant at the time, so it had nothing to do with the sexual orientation. It had to do with the ego that was constantly expressed and realted to nothing that I really cared about.\n\nBut what was incredibly important to me then and now is that we can lose track of the fact that we are all human beings, a point that was stressed in the film. Killers may be killers, but they are us, in a way, filled with some of the same ambitions, hates, emotions that most of us can control. What separates us from them might not be very much, so why do we need to kill them as they jailed their victims? It is easy to kill, but not so easy to try to understand. This film hits an emotional level that the previous film did not. I am pleased that it ultimately was made. I am also pleased that the quality of the performances, the writing and most especially the direction, were so superb. Watch the scene where the farmer speaks only to Harper Lee and not Capote. It is an incredible monologue, but the circumstances are noted.",

      "reviewBody": "Even at this early stage this interesting feature from Canada has the look of a future cult movie. It&apos;s decidedly left-field in subject matter. In it a female medical student with financial troubles turns to the shady world of underground surgeries. Before long she is carrying out more and more outlandish procedures. Pleasingly this one is directed by women. It&apos;s ridiculous in this day and age how rare it remains for women to be given the director&apos;s reigns. This film shows that the female vision can be very twisted and macabre indeed. The directors are identical twins Jen and Sylvia Soska who appear in a cameo as Eastern European sisters who crave bizarre body modifications. Their direction is very stylised but with grit where necessary. I&apos;m not usually queasy when it comes to movies but I can honestly say that one surgical scene left me looking away. The third female presence is star Katherine Isabelle of Ginger Snaps fame. She is very good in a dark and sexy performance. She is a great anti-heroine and her revenge moment on a man who attacked her is one that had me inwardly cheering.\n\nSeeing as this is a Canadian horror film perhaps a comparison with David Cronenberg is inevitable. But in this instance it&apos;s a fairly relevant one as in many ways this is another example of the body horror sub-genre. It&apos;s a film that combines contemporary sadistic horror with a view of an unusual subculture of people who modify their bodies through surgery. It isn&apos;t a very story driven film to be fair and it sometimes lacks a bit of overall dynamism but this is only a relatively minor observation and it is pleasingly original for the most part. Overall the feature could perhaps best be described as what would happen if Clive Barker was to direct a film that combined elements of Hard Candy and Audition.",

      "reviewBody": "I read the reviews. I said to myself, &quot;Well, this could not possibly be as bad as all that.&quot; Well, it is. It starts right away. The patterns on the balloons keep changing from shot to shot in the credits. And there are many of them talking on the radio. What happened to the other folks with radios? Did they not call for a rescue ship? Nobody knows... It never comes up in the movie.\n\nThen these four goofs come on shore and one is still holding a raft in his hand and it talking about having to build a raft. Why? At that point they just arrived and have not searched around the island and already have a fully inflated rubber raft.\n\nAnd they immediately ask &quot;How will we get over these bluffs?&quot; Why do they need to. Wait for the pickup from the people who are coming to get you. No mention of that. Seems like the opening credits and radio chatter is from a different movie.\n\nWell, it goes from there off onto several different plot threads. They intersect from time to time, minimally. And there is that laughing fool. He even laughs while he is drinking his moonshine. Quite a talent. And what is he laughing at so much? That spinning, pink ammo box is just too much! And the confusion of plots (snakes, tarantulas, machine guns, trident that turns women into vampires, a brain without a head running everything, John Carradine speaking gibberish) continues until, thankfully, this movie is done.\n\nMy great thanks to the director for not making the movie ANY LONGER! And you won&apos;t believe the ending. I guess it is an ending. Or they just ran out of film. Not fulfilling at all.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Verder dan de Maan&apos; is the new movie from Stijn Coninx. It tells us the story of a family living on a pig-farm, struggling with each-other. Huub Stapel is being portrayed as the typical drunk low-life husband who tries to be the good father, but who regrettably has a drinking problem. The wife is being played by Johanna Ter Steege, who is protecting her children and trying to save the family. Nothing new under the &apos;moon&apos;.\n\n This movie has been officially selected to be our entry for the Oscars in 2004. Unfortunately for other, far better Belgium films, this decision was made by people who obviously don&apos;t have a clue what Belgium currently experiencing with films like: &apos;The Emperor&apos;s Wife&apos;, &apos;De Zaak Alzheimer&apos; or &apos;Any Way The Wind Blows&apos;. All magnificent films made in 2003 in Belgium, in a country where we make maybe 10 feature films per year. It is a disgrace that we have to go to America with this pathetic excuse for a film. I don&apos;t get it! This movie resembles a lot Antonia (1995) who won an Oscar for best foreign film. And this is probably the reason and the only reason why this film has been send. Poor Belgium!\n\nThere are few Belgian actors playing in this movie. Practically all of them are coming from Holland. There is a lot of over-acting and the scenes are very cliché and old. I felt that I was kind of looking at a film from the 1980&apos;s. The film doesn&apos;t surprise us in any way. And Stijn Coninx hasn&apos;t made anything good since &apos;Daens&apos; (1992). His film &apos;Licht&apos; (1998) was very bad. &apos;Verder dan de Maan&apos; is one big mistake and shame on those responsible for sending this film to the Academy Awards!",

      "reviewBody": "A second seeing of this film recently confirmed my impressions on seeing `Missing&apos; (1982)(qv) also a second time a few months back. Costa-Gavras has things to say and he does not mince up his message. \n\nIn `Missing&apos; he succeeded in getting Jack Lemmon to play a convincing role, and in `Mad City&apos; he managed to get John Travolta to carry out the best role I have seen him in: his playing of a deranged simple worker real mad at having lost his job is truly memorable. Dustin Hoffman ably supports but without exceeding himself overly.\n\nHowever, rather than the actors in themselves, it is the story itself which is more important and its message: getting the story on your TV news programme before your competitors is much more important than any other considerations  such as in this case, a group of schoolchildren held hostage with a shotgun aimed at them. But do not worry about them  get the story live on TV at any price, what a scoop! what a sensation!\n\n And thus we live at the dictates of that ogre of communications called TV: whether wars in Rwanda or Afghanistan or Palestinians blowing themselves up in Israeli cafés or airliners crashing into the WTC, the most important thing is to get it live on screen for the hungry masses. We are at the mercy of papirazzi, that merciless squad of camera-toting fame-seekers, who have no scruples at getting their story first or even inventing it.\n\nThanks for the message, Costa-Gavras: I learnt it long ago, but you tell it well.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is fast disappearing from cinemas, which is a pity, as it is an authentic Australian drama of some substance. Show biz personalities are notoriously lacking in self-confidence, unsuccessful ones even more so. Yet like the lead player here, they still tenaciously cherish the dream of making the big time against all the indications. Jean (Brenda Blethyn) is a British comedienne of the &quot;nudge nudge, wink wink&quot; variety who once appeared with the likes of Benny Hill, but who gave up her career to marry John (Frankie J Holden) an Australian crooner of country music. The marriage produces the brain damaged Mark (Richard Wilson) and shy younger son Tim (Khan Chittenden). John, reduced to being a security guard at a supermarket, moves out and Jean puts in long days at a works canteen to support her family while still trying to resuscitate her stage career with the aid of her sleazy manager Shane. These distractions do not prevent her from being very possessive of her babies and when 20 year old Tim becomes involved with the uninhibited Jill (Emma Booth) Jean&apos;s hackles rise.\n\nPerhaps if Jean displayed some real talent as a comedienne it would make up for the fact that she is actually not a very nice person. As it is, it&apos;s hard to feel sorry for her. Brenda Blethyn plays her all stops out, which is what the part requires, but it does verge on caricature. The rest of the cast are OK, with Emma Booth very appealing as the free-spirited Jill, but rather overshadowed by Brenda&apos;s Queen Lear (or perhaps it should be Queen Leer) act.\n\nThe western suburbs of Sydney setting is well realised and one can almost smell those smoky leagues clubs where clapped-out British entertainers go to die. One reviewer has perceptively remarked that the movie is about letting go  of your impossible dreams, of your children now they no longer depend on you. In Jean&apos;s case her personality and circumstances have combined to make this exceptionally difficult, and it is this that provides the drama. Keith Thompson is a veteran TV writer with a good ear for the Aussie vernacular and he draws his characters from life. The romance between the shy Tim and bold Jill is a pleasant contrast to Jean&apos;s fulminations, but Khan Chittenden under-acts a bit. Rebecca Gibney, usually a glamour-puss, is amusing as one of Jean&apos;s permanently sloshed friends.\n\nIf this was a made for TV piece, the critics would praise it to the skies, but as it is, it&apos;s just a decent drama. Watching it I wondered how Julie Walters or Anne Reid would have gone as Jean. Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress, but on this occasion the volume was turned up too loud.",

      "reviewBody": "Michel Gondry is a very talented filmmaker especially when it comes to visuals. His music videos and films go beyond simple video marvels into a world of simple visual trickery. This is something Gondry is very good at. Furthermore, he has a do it yourself mantra when it comes to filmaking. He&apos;s not into the marvels of CGI. He&apos;s more into what you can do without it.\n\nBut it takes a little more than visual trickery to make a film a success. Be Kind Rewind is a prime example. The film starts off well enough. Mos Def helps run a video store owned by Danny Glover&apos;s character. The store is probably one of the last remaining stores catering to VHS. Jack Black is Mos Def&apos;s left of center friend who works at an electrical plant. Through some plan to sabotage the plant, he becomes magnetic, erasing all the tapes.\n\nOur heroes are forced to re-record the movies and do it through a process called &quot;sweding,&quot; producing 10-15 minute versions of the film, using a wide array of do it yourself techniques that Gondry himself has utilized in his work. An example is a simple trick where filming through a fan makes the film look old. All of this is fun. The way the guys try to truncate the film&apos;s stories into a little time or their lack of knowledge regarding some films like Driving Miss Daisy. the crude effects are fun and are prime examples of why we love Michel Gondry.\n\nThe downside to the film is the script, penned by Gondry. Clearly, the film is built around the sweded films. But I was starting to think that watching the sweded films would&apos;ve been more fun than watching Be Kind Rewind itself. Gondry never fully fleshes out his characters or resolves some of the subplots. The visuals are fun, but when Gondry&apos;s forced to wrap up the movie, it becomes a little sporadic and we start to realize the the film doesn&apos;t go much beyond its rich concept.\n\nThere is something great to take away from this film. And while I have some reservations about the film, my recommendation for the film is based on Gondry&apos;s filmaking vision. That is to say, there is clearly a joy of filmaking associated with Gondry that will have me continue to look forward to his work. If you&apos;re not sure what I mean, take a look at his promotional materials or at his other short films. The man loves filmaking and has fun with this movie. However, I&apos;d recommend he build an alliance with some good screenwriters that would help his visions become fully realized, and not just good natured diversions, as this film is.",

      "reviewBody": "Major racial overtones surrounded the Jack Johnson/ James Jeffries boxing match before and after the fight in Reno, July 4, 1910. Jeffries, an ex-heavyweight champion who hadn&apos;t fought in six years, was enticed with a huge paycheck to come out of retirement, with an arranged match against African-American boxer Johnson, the reigning champion. Jeffries, 35, never lost a fight, but was totally out of shape before accepting the challenge.\n\nLabeled the &quot;Great White Hope,&quot; Jeffries had to lose 110 of his overweight 330 pounds before the fight. Johnson was in superb shape, but this match, on the basis of Jeffries&apos; untarnished record, was labeled the &quot;Fight of the Century.&quot; Nine movie cameras were set up to capture the scheduled 45-round action. In sweltering 110 degree Nevada summer temperatures, the fight went 15 rounds before Jeffries was declared a technical knock out loser to the superior Jackson. When word went out of the match&apos;s results (this was before radio or TV, yet through instantaneous telegraph cables, the news hit the public quickly), African Americans raced onto the streets dancing with jubilation. Whites, humiliated, attacked those celebrating, igniting nationwide riots.\n\nCompounding all the chaos, when the movie of the Jackson win was subsequently scheduled to be shown throughout the U.S., the potential of additional race riots was evident. Such threats of death and destruction from the playing the film was so great that the two-hour movie was banned throughout the South. So jarring were the riots on that early-July period Congress took action to prohibit boxing films to be shown across state lines, beginning in 1912. Congressional action on the ban lasted nearly 30 years, until 1940 when it was permissible to view out-of-state boxing films.",

      "reviewBody": "How does a soft, liberal-arts civilian like me even approach a document like &quot;Restrepo&quot;? I don&apos;t give myself to blind, reflexive worship of the military; before, I have reviewed &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side,&quot; an investigation into some chilling crimes committed by individuals in the armed forces, almost surely with the knowledge and approval of their superiors. This, however, is a film, shot by two insane journalists who spent a year with American Army troops in Afghanistan&apos;s Korangal valley, and it portrays men who are different from the rest of us in that they have faced and survived the impossible.\n\nOutpost Restrepo was named after a beloved comrade killed in action, and it was dug and fortified under constant enemy gunfire. The Taliban just hated giving up the position, and the men describe how they would dig for several minutes, then be forced to pick up their weapons and return fire, and after the gunfight died down, go right back to digging. The outpost is only several hundred meters from a larger base, but in case of an attack, support might as well be stationed in Germany.\n\nThe all-seeing documentarians capture the men&apos;s brutal physical labor under a constant state of siege and barely-adequate resupply, until violence and discomfort become life&apos;s permanent background. The soldiers are forced to go on regular patrols through the countryside, tracking the progress of development projects and trying to build trust among the locals, whose allegiances are never clear. If they are only listening with one ear, if they&apos;re only out to hedge their bets between the fighting sides, who can blame them? \n\nThe film culminates in an account of a firefight during an offensive called &quot;Rock Avalanche&quot; – words that the testifying soldiers cannot say without a shudder. The mission consists of the men being loudly airdropped on a hilltop and moving around valleys and mountains until attacked by the Taliban. They push onwards, trying not to think which step will finally trigger the inevitable ambush. The ambush occurs; the live footage cuts out, and for several minutes, we follow the brutal firefight only through the soldiers&apos; testimony. It is gut-wrenching. The pain and terror of the men who return fire without knowing which of their fellows are still alive and if they themselves will live for another minute are suffocating. Then, the footage is back, and we see a private wailing like a child over the dead body of the unit&apos;s favorite commander. If this can happen to the best among us, he says, what chance do the rest of us have? \n\nIt is an astonishing thing to contemplate, but even at the end of so much hostile fire, the Americans have the better deal. The young men who passed through the trials are scarred and damaged by their experience, but they knew the date when it would end, and the bird was there to take the survivors back to a better life. The local Afghans&apos; pain has no end. Frightened, grimy faces peer out of gashes in dirt walls. Children hide their eyes, dressed in scraps of their grandparents&apos; clothes. The doorways of their mud shacks open into black pits – even in midday, the sun is unable to dispel the darkness. The village elders are a sight from another millennium – gnarly, weather-beaten, half-decayed faces that seem to have been chopped out of rotting tree trunks. You could easily give every one of them a couple of centuries, but who knows? They may still be in their thirties. I&apos;ve had some rough years as a child of the third world, but I can&apos;t imagine even a tenth of what these people go through in their lives.\n\nSo many excellent films have come out of our latest painful conflicts – &quot;Restrepo,&quot; &quot;Generation Kill,&quot; &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side,&quot; &quot;Gunner Palace&quot; Almost all of them have been financial failures. Who wants to spend ten dollars to get depressed and emotionally drained? What exactly are we supposed to feel at the end of &quot;Restrepo&quot;? Not hope. Maybe futility, weariness and an incredible desire to think about something else.\n\nI wondered if the place I saw in &quot;Restrepo&quot; really exists on the same planet as the Metropolitan Opera. Will its misery ever end?",

      "reviewBody": "The first film from Hungary to examine the 1956 anti-communist uprising does so from a sober but not always serious point of view, through the eyes of a boisterous Budapest family swept up in the resulting turmoil. Most of the action is witnessed by ten-year old Tomi, who aside from everything else has to shoulder the extra burden of his own sexual awakening, next to which the Soviet invasion is only a happy excuse not to go to school. The film will likely be compared (somewhat unfairly) to John Boorman&apos;s more polished wartime coming-of-age comedy &apos;Hope and Glory&apos;, which it actually pre-dates by several years. It may lack a consistent narrative thread, but individual scenes are priceless, like the hair-raising moment when an afternoon joyride on a railroad handcart takes several children through a tense forest ambush. Altogether it&apos;s a timely, touching reminder of how, even in moments of total social chaos, human beings will always remain refreshingly, fallibly human.",

The Three Musketeers is such a timeless story, and I was expecting something decent while not expecting something completely faithful. Is this Three Musketeers completely faithful adaptation-wise? No, though it is far better as an adaptation than Burbank Films Australia&apos;s version. Is it the best version? Again no(the 1973 Richard Lester film), though not the worst. The story is charming and adventurous with the basic feel of the story evident in most scenes, and the dialogue doesn&apos;t suffer from being too overly-simplified, in fact it is suitably witty in spots. The music is wonderful, with many classical music favourites like Night on Bare Mountain, Pictures at an Exhibition, Marche Slave and Lohengrin shown and used to good effect, though the best used was the Charpentier Te Deum, the most fitting to the music of the time period and suitably rousing. The characters I had little problem with, Constance is far less annoying than she is in Burbank&apos;s version, the villains are suitably antagonistic and the heroes are engaging. Milady doesn&apos;t quite have the haunting quality she does in other versions but is enticing nonetheless. I loved the colour and fluidity of the backgrounds also, the character designs are not as fluid but serviceable at least. The voice work is solid. All in all, liked it very much. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

This is a shame, since while it&apos;s not Keaton&apos;s finest work, it ranks with his funniest.  In one scene, Buster falls into a pit with a lion. Afraid of getting eaten, he pampers the lion and gives it a manicure.  What follows is one of the funniest visual gags I&apos;ve ever seen."

Even though it&apos;s disturbing, the story is great, the film is excellently shot - the film IS motivated to tell that story, however weird it may be.\n\nI recommend this movie, especially if you&apos;re looking for something new, something to think about; if you&apos;re studying film or if you&apos;re just bored. :)\n\nMy last comment is: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it to others.",

This was one that my parents had recorded, that I watched over and over laughing as hard at the next viewing as I had from the previous. Upon reading the book many years later I discovered it hardly follows the story closely, but that doesn&apos;t matter because its a great film nonetheless. The cast are delightful in their comic turns, which even use slapstick to rather amusing consequences (my favourite scene involving a tin of pineapple slices). The story following 3 gents in the 1920&apos;s as they attempt to have a relaxing holiday on the river Thames, despite the distractions of women and the English weather - it&apos;s delightful to see how society didn&apos;t allow women of standing to simply meet men without a formal introduction first. There&apos;s no real point to the film but its nice to see great traditional comedy without the swearing and sex that is poured into films these days... A timeless film that I shall always treasure.",

      "reviewBody": "An elderly woman wants to be young again. She has lots of money and enlists a mad scientist who works all day in the basement with his nuclear device to transplant brains atomically. Brought into the picture are three young women who will provide the body, once the process is perfected. One woman gets a cat brain transplant and runs around scratching people and screeching. Another is a victim of cat-woman and loses her eyesight. The third becomes the target for the transplant. Unfortunately, there are failed experiments running around the house, particularly a young woman who has no brain at all. She is just there to provide amusement. The old lady continues to bully the young women who ask to leave, but stay just because she tells them to (apparently, they need her to let them out of their contract and she will call immigration and get them sent back). When they finally act, it is too late. There is also an old lech who can&apos;t wait for the old lady to get a new body, but comes to realize that he is going to be left in the dust. He then becomes a possible roadblock, although the old lady is so mean spirited she doesn&apos;t seem to care. Nevertheless, the transplant does finally take place but with different consequences than the old lady had anticipated. \n\nThe biggest problem has to do with trust. The scientist works at the behest of the old woman, but seems to have his own agenda. He is annoyed by her constant meddling in what he is doing. He betrays here of course. So much of the movie is in anticipation of finally doing the transplant. We just can&apos;t get there and the ride is long and tedious.",

      "name": "Easily one of the best Wuxia films ever made!",
      "reviewBody": "What i&apos;ve seen simply can not be fully described, it&apos;s a movie full of emotions and heroism. Whoever directed this movie knows his craft even more than Kurosawa and Godard ever did. Incidentally when i already mentioned J.L.Godard, i must admit that i&apos;m a bit perplexed why so many European critics constantly comparing this film to Godard&apos;s style... i don&apos;t remember Godard ever did an epic film like this. Anyway, this wuxia film cares more about the characters than most of the films of this genre i&apos;ve seen in the past, including Touch of Zen or One-armed Swordsman, this gives them a very good development throughout the film.\n\nOf course, the movie has a very challenging nature right from the very beginning as to the way how some of the fight scenes and story development being treated on the film. What i liked the most was the second half of the film because only then it started to give the meaning what the film is about... the characters! Not one scene or just a one single second of the film is wasted, everything there has the reason and meaning. The romance as much as the action of the film are evidently the most important and the most effective. It kind of shows the viewers that the romantic sub-plots is what this whole series is supposed to be about. Honestly, i found myself crying several times during the film, especially in the middle when Zhang Jingchu talks about love with so-yeon Kim, that scene is almost unbearable in terms of the emotional intensity induced mostly just by looking at both actresses&apos;s eyes and facial expressions and almost no dialogue(!)... strictly genius! Another (almost) cry inducing scene is right at the end when Hanzhiban decides which way to go, which is clearly one of the most important and emotional moments in the film.\n\nThe fact that this movie is in no way some popcorn is also one of the aspects i admired very much because it&apos;s much more demanding than usual wuxia films were used to be in the past. It tries to carry several strong messages and images that can very easily grave in your mind, so i must warn you all that it&apos;s a very memorable film that you won&apos;t certainly forget so soon.\n\nThe movie is an obvious antithesis to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero or House of Flying Daggers, strictly speaking, it&apos;s one of the most realistic wuxia films out there and far better than any one of those futile attempts at this genre. But on the other hand this is also a movie that relies on the imagination and acuity of intelligence of the viewer. What we have here is a very intelligent movie that goes against many expectations as i noticed, and that&apos;s a good sign i think because i believe that best and the strongest films are usually those that situate themselves on the border between love and hate.\n\nHowever, be aware that if you find yourself entirely immersed in this fictional world of seven swords throughout the movie you won&apos;t be disappointed in its powerful end... and trust me, it&apos;ll leave you wanting more. A perfect testament of the perfect movie! It&apos;s without any doubt one of the best wuxia films that appeared in the recent years but i&apos;m sure that only the time will tell that it&apos;s probably destined to be the best wuxia film in the Asian film-making history. Just wait if you want or see this fascinating and magnificent jewel immediately!",

I expected shocking violence and gory thrills, based on the film&apos;s reputation, but what I got instead was a thinking, feeling, bizarrely creative film.  This was my first Takashi Miike film, and my expectations were low, partly because he&apos;s so hyped, and partly because I&apos;m over being shocked, and his films have a reputation of being, well, shocking. The character of the cop is especially palpable, and the scenes that take place in his home are more like the quiet moments of a Beat Takeshi film. This dramatic realism is somehow anchored in the otherwise chaotic flow of the rest of the film.  There&apos;s a real anything-can-happen vibe to this film that keeps you on the edge, yet when you reflect back upon it, there are really only a few heavy action sequences.  I thought that was pretty brilliant, though some may feel disappointed by the low count of flipped cars.  Hey wanna see an action film?  See Formula 51; that had plenty of action, with no damn reason for any of it.  And what a forgettable film that was. Dead or Alive is rollicking and at times inexplicable, but never boring. Highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "Kamal Haasan, the central character, is a man terribly soured by his unvaryingly devastating encounters with the opposite sex. He develops a pathological hatred for women and uses his charm to seduce young women and kill them immediately after having sex with each. These proceedings are recorded watched repeatedly by his adoptive father and mentor, another crazed woman-hater with a similarly disillusioning experience with the female sex, who vicariously enjoys his protege&apos;s exploits. The old man stays holed up in a far corner of the house watching his son carry out what he is too infirm to do.\n\nKamal&apos;s hateful view of women slowly begins to change when he meets Sridevi, a young and very beautiful shop assistant whom he easily attains by virtue of his good looks and wealth and marries, owing to her insistence. What was once another conquest to him slowly begins to rouse his tender feelings, but his fostered urges are as assertive as ever, and he enters a confused phase.\n\nSridevi, meanwhile stumbles upon Kamal&apos;s father, whom Kamal had told her was retarded and was not to be disturbed, and gets the shock of her life. She somehow manages to shut him in and tries to run out but Kamal returns before she gets a chance to leave the house. Sridevi puts on an agonising mask of normalcy and bides her time to escape. Kamal gets called away on business that night and she packs up her luggage and leaves the house, but is dramatically intercepted by Kamal who gets word of her flight through his watchman. A tense chase ensues, which ends in a graveyard in the dead of night, with Kamal stumbling and falling on a cross which pierces him.\n\nHe is subsequently jailed but gets mentally retarded and loses his bloodthirsty ways. He keeps repeating Sridevi&apos;s name, as it is his only coherent thought, and all other memories have been erased from his mind."

      "reviewBody": "This disaster movie is not like other disaster movies. Other disaster movies tend to follow a very rigid structure and not stray from it.\n\nFirst we meet the primary characters and we get to know them through scenes of &quot;everyday life&quot;.\n\nThen the secondary characters whose &quot;lives will be changed forever&quot; are introduced.\n\nLastly the &quot;enemy&quot; is introduced. Mostly in the form of the mighty bureaucrat who won&apos;t evacuate the city or close the beaches or whatever.\n\nThis movie introduces one secondary character and uses tertiary characters for all the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; who are just supposed to die anyway. This enables the movie to concentrate on the efforts of the hero(es) to fix the situation and not have to show a lot of pointless drivel about dogs trapped in rain pipes and children being caught under buses.\n\nPlus, the characters are actually well drawn and the story is somewhat believable.\n\nI was entertained for an hour and a half and that&apos;s really the point, right?",

The alien girl who comes to Earth to assist the Purple Monster (Roy Barcroft) was played by Mary Moore, who had been married to Clayton Moore, who was playing second leads and stunt man roles at Republic. Moore said in his biography that he and Mary were married 8/19/1940 and only stayed together for about a year. Apparently they were too focused on their careers at that time. At the time of separation, Moore said he had possession of the dog he had given to Mary and she wanted it back. When the dog did not respond to her calls, Moore said he paid her $25, which was what the dog cost when he bought it and she left the apartment. In 1945, she must have still been using her married name judging by the credits. In the fight scene she does with Linda Stirling, she was doubled by stuntwoman Polly Burson. A humorous anecdote about the serial was told by the star Roy Barcroft. Barcroft recalled having to &quot;skinny down&quot; his big frame to fit into the Purple Monster costume. At the time, he was living in the Los Angeles suburb of Jackson Heights. He referred to himself as &quot;The Jerk in Tights from Jackson Heights.&quot; Regardless, this serial and Manhunt of Mystery Island (where he played the evil Captain Mephisto) are two of his best known and best loved serials for Republic."

The thought of being alone on Christmas deeply saddens me, and I think it goes back to seeing little Ebenezar Scrooge left behind in boarding school while all the other kids had families to go home to for Christmas.\n\nI cried just like Mr. Magoo&apos;s older Scrooge did when he saw himself as a kid singing:\n\nWhen you&apos;re alone, alone in the world When you&apos;re alone in the world Blown-away leaves get blown in the world Swirled-away leaves get swirled\n\nA hand for each hand was planned for the world Why don&apos;t my fingers reach? Millions of grains of sand in the world Why&apos;s mine a lonely beach?\n\nWhere are the heels to click to my clack? Where is the voice to answer mine back? I&apos;m all alone in the WOOOOORLD!!!\n\nNone of the other versions caught this scene the way this one does. Not Bugs Bunny, Bill Murray, Albert Finney, Mickey Mouse. Maybe Alistair Sim, sort of.\n\nSimplistic, yes, but it&apos;s the scene that still sticks in my throat as I choke back an adult tear. It&apos;s the scene that makes this version, truly unique, all alone in the world."

      "reviewBody": "The second movie in the Shaft series (&apos;Shaft&apos;s Big Score!&apos;) was a big disappointment being a tired retread of the dynamic first Shaft movie, a film which basically created the blaxploitation boom of the early 1970s. &apos;Shaft In Africa&apos; sees director Gordon Parks and creator/writer Ernest Tidyman replaced by John Guillermin and Stirling Silliphant, a safer more Hollywood team which would hit pay dirt the following year with &apos;The Towering Inferno&apos;. It doesn&apos;t have much of a blaxploitation feel to it, it&apos;s more of a James Bond thing with a black Bond, but that&apos;s okay, it&apos;s entertaining enough, and a definite improvement on the lacklustre &apos;Shaft&apos;s Big Score!&apos; Richard Roundtree once again plays super cool private dick John Shaft. This time he is coerced into going undercover in Africa to try and break a slavery ring run by the evil Amafi (Frank Finlay). Roundtree is one cool mutha, and this movie features more sex and violence than the others, so it&apos;s easy to watch. Vonetta McGee (&apos;Hammer&apos;, &apos;Blacula&apos;) plays Shaft&apos;s main love interest, but he also finds time to bed Amafi&apos;s sexy and amoral mistress Jazar (Neda Arneric) along the way. It&apos;s a pity that there weren&apos;t more Shaft movies after this as you could see the series having a lot of life left in it. Instead Richard Roundtree made a TV series which lasted a couple of years, and then his career started to slide into obscurity. By the 1980s he was mostly playing supporting cop roles in dumb action movies. Why this happened is anybody&apos;s guess as Roundtree was, along with Fred Williamson, the coolest and most charismatic of the 1970s blaxploitation stars. Both actors deserved a lot more mainstream success."

Sadly, I was disappointed. The only half-decent thing is the plot. Its not a ripoff like many Bollywood movies, and has some originality to it. Note that I said some, not all.\n\nShahid Kapur is appalling, he does a horrible job and does not fit into character at all. Amrita Rao does not do anything apart from looking pretty, and I raised my eyebrows with Arshad Warsi&apos;s performance. I like him as an actor, he has done great roles, but I don&apos;t like this one. The character was very fake.\n\nTo sum it up: VLHTA is mostly a film that we will be enjoyed by kids. There isn&apos;t much point in the movie at all, its what I would call &quot;rubbish&quot;. Even Sanjay Dutt&apos;s incredible presence could not save this movie."

His bizarre ramblings became pretty popular in the German corner of the Internet and ultimately inspired the creation of this movie.\n\nOf course, this is complete low-budget trash that for some inconceivable reason some quite famous German actors agreed to star in. It is fun to watch, but you&apos;re going to miss out on a lot if you&apos;re not familiar with the stuff that inspired it.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Muse&quot; from 1999 is an Albert Brooks film, starring Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Bradley Whitford, Mark Feuerstein, Jeff Bridges, and cameos by the likes of Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Jennifer Tilly, Lorenzo Lamas, and others.\n\nBrooks plays Steven Phillips, a Hollywood screenwriter who has written 17 films. When he goes to a meeting at Paramount, where he has a deal, he&apos;s basically told that they want him off the lot by 5 p.m., his deal is cancelled, he&apos;s lost his &quot;edge&quot;, and his script is terrible. And by the way, so were the last couple of films.\n\nDiscouraged, and at his wife&apos;s (MacDowell&apos;s) suggestion, he goes and talks to his best friend Jack (Jeff Bridges) who explains that he used the services of a Muse, Sarah Little (Stone) for inspiration. He calls her for Steven and Steven rushes to see her. \n\nWell, this Muse is an earthly pain in the you know what. Anyone who goes to see her has to bring a gift from Tiffany. She wants to be put up at the Four Seasons, have a limo at her disposal, and health foods purchased for her. She spends perhaps five minutes with Steven, who does get an idea for a script. Meanwhile, unable to sleep, she&apos;s moved into the guest house/office on his property. She&apos;s also turned his wife into the second Mrs. Fields by encouraging her to market her cookies. \n\nVery funny comedy with the hapless Brooks nearly driven out of his mind by this woman. And the film has a delightful twist.\n\nSomeone mentioned the party Wolfgang Puck throws for Steven&apos;s wife (Puck is serving her cookies). Steven gets into a conversation with a man who can&apos;t understand English and misinterprets everything he says. It is hilarious.\n\nThis isn&apos;t considered Brooks&apos; best, but given for what passes for comedy today, it&apos;s practically Pulitzer Prize material. Well worth seeing.",

This is perhaps the only movie I know of that deals directly with Buddhism from a western point of view, as opposed to Asian movies like those of Kurosawa, or such recent films as &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; which deal more with the political and social aspects of Tibetan culture rather than Buddhism itself. Because Buddhism is drawing increasing interest in the West, a dramatization of the classic story of the Buddha is useful and entertaining. As a high school teacher, I have seriously recommended this film to students a number of times.           The movie is well filmed, and, besides the traditional story of the Buddha,in its ancient Indian setting and with all of the mythical elements, it does gives insight into Tibetan culture, and can be linked to &quot;Kundun&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; which are excellent, sympathetic films about this Asian country that has received so much undeserved harassment.",

Yet it is exquisite -- both with landscapes and with actors. This is especially true with Trevor Howard, very powerful as a boozy miner.\n\nThe other star is that great actress Wendy Hiller. Her role is far from entirely sympathetic. She suffocates her favorite son, well played by Dean Stockwell. She is demanding in a quiet way and selfish in a manner passing itself off as martyrdom. But what a gorgeous performance! Mary Ure was a fine actress. Somehow, though, the character she plays doesn&apos;t entirely work in my view. It seems more from kitchen-sink realism, like the Shelagh Delaney plays that were filmed around this time. (And where have they gone? Why don&apos;t we ever see &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; or &quot;The Leather Boys&quot; anymore?) Heather Sears is good but I have to admit, to my embarrassment, I found it hard to shake her excellent performance in the tile role of &quot;The Story of Esther Costello&quot; from my mind. Her being a bright young woman taken with Stockwell, therefore, startled me throughout. That is my own failing and surely not hers.\n\nThis is a superb movie. All of it is good. But for me, the scenes involving Hiller are the most compelling. Howard, too, is superb. And Stockwell as Paul. The family story is heart-wrenching.",

Oh, and this femme fatale has a large claw that extends from her groin and tries to kill people. This Italian film is heavily influenced by THE EVIL DEAD, but you can see director Andreas Marfori just doesn&apos;t have the talent to pull it off. It is like he watched Raimi&apos;s film with no translation. It is a shame as the film has many things going for it (nice camera work, great locations, tons of gore), but Marfori just can&apos;t get it to gel thanks to his incredibly wonky staging. He also overdoses on the use of the steadicam. The final scene with Coralina walking away from the carnage while followed by the steadicam goes on so long that it becomes a joke. Just when you get tired of it, the director then cuts to her continuing to walk with the camera in front of her for another minute or so. Jeez, such a shame."

      "reviewBody": "After reading the reviews here I wanted to put in my own 2 cents. This movie is basically about being a parent in a modern age. There are three story lines, one about a nurse in NYC, one about her husband, a computer geek with lots of money, and one about about their nanny.\n\nThe one thing the woman, the man, and the nanny all have in common are the sacrifices they make for their kids. The man and woman both have very successful jobs, and the nanny from the Philippines works in the US to earn money for her kids back home. However, the sacrifices they make are so extreme that each person becomes detached from the very reason why they made these sacrifices in the first place: Their children.\n\nThe film presents us with a critical portrayal of this lifestyle, and as such in the end this is a tragedy.\n\nThis is an excellent film, highly recommended, especially for those of us who must balance work and family life on a daily basis.",

In this particular one the bumbling heroes stumble on a tree that when you drink the water around it, you revert to your youth.  I think they were running from pirates, but I can&apos;t recall for sure.  Anyway, the only way to &quot;grow up&quot; is to take a leak (thus passing the magic water out of your veins).  So at various times the three &quot;funny&quot; guys get out of various troubles by turning into kids and occasionally whizzing and growing older.  If you&apos;ve got Brazilian kids, they&apos;ll probably like it, but the American ones will probably find it pretty stupid, even if it is dubbed."

The key thing is that this is very human in the way the relate the way they arrived at &apos;American Beauty&apos;. Robert Hunter and Phil Lesh are particularly articulate in the way they describe the development of the record. The only member of the band who didn&apos;t contribute to the film was Bill Kreutzmann, and that&apos;s his business.\n\nWhen I first saw this, broadcast on the BBC as part of their &apos;Classic Albums&apos; series, it was stated that this was Garcia&apos;s last television interview. I don&apos;t know if this is true, but it must be one of the last. Whatever your own reaction to &apos;American Beauty&apos; - it can elicit tears and smiles from me - Jerry Garcia has a permanent wry smile when talking about it on this film. Ever the joker."

      "reviewBody": "A movie like this can be viewed in two main ways: a human example of a scientific study (with on screen replications of the study, and a moral conclusion); or a lesson in learning for the participants (the wild child will learn how to spell his adopted name; his teacher -- and we the audience -- will learn how to feel!). Truffaut kind of merges both into something of unique value. It feels a little removed, and it becomes clear that that&apos;s to prevent sentimentality. It&apos;s unsentimental, but Truffaut is a quiet master; as is the case with David Lynch&apos;s &quot;The Elephant Man,&quot; his auteur sensibilities shine through the story so that it fits in neatly with his catalogue -- here we have another film with a naked boy&apos;s bum, and young children being goofy and walking in packs. What the film is is an intense magnification of the troubles of child-rearing, emphasized twofold by Truffaut&apos;s role in the film: he is the &quot;mother&quot; giving birth to the film; and he is the father raising this &quot;wild child&quot; within the film; good-natured, but without the inherent understanding of the boy that his housekeeper has (and without the inherent understanding Truffaut the director has of cinema).\n\nIs it possible to feel bad watching a Truffaut film? And even better than making you feel good, he&apos;s not being sneaky about it -- instead of crass manipulation (and what kind of film could be more easily made manipulative than a one about boy left to survive in a forest and how he learns to be &quot;human&quot;?), he imbues each frame with soft, gentle love; so instead of jerking our emotions around via contrivance of the characters, he trusts us enough -- and his own talent enough -- to allow us to latch on to feeling his respect and love for cinema itself. (And he wisely keeps the film in mostly medium shots.) Nothing is really highlighted, but occasionally a particular image will be so fine that it&apos;s hard not to notice it, like the one where the camera is raised above Victor as he slouches back to his room after being told he can&apos;t accompany Truffaut to the doctor. (Or the sly visual gag where Truffaut is teaching Victor letters with the boy&apos;s fingers, and he manages to basically flip the audience the bird -- then has Truffaut swat his fingers with a cane.)\n\nTruffaut isn&apos;t interested in the kind of acting displays that normally accompany this kind of film; the acting is subdued and realistic (but then again, how would we ever know how a wild child would act?). The boy is limited to acting without words, and it&apos;s a very good performance: whether he&apos;s grinning wildly in a bath or swaying back and forth or opening his mouth as wide as it can go in an act of effrontery, it&apos;s a performance that refuses to indicate how we should feel. There are some scenes that portray confusion so well but don&apos;t rub our noses in it, like the one where he&apos;s trying his hardest to follow instructions and eat his soup properly, but can&apos;t help himself and sticks his face in the bowl. After Victor makes a craft and impresses Truffaut with it, Truffaut writes in his ongoing journal how joyful he is but to forgive his enthusiasm over such a small triumph -- that&apos;s the best way to describe how the film feels: a series of small triumphs of gentle subtlety. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Intruder (1997) was the directing debut of Kan-Cheung Tsang (and still is), who has and had written many films before and after Intruder, but this film shows he can direct, too. Intruder tells the story of mainland Chinese girl (Wu Chien-Lien ), who is, with her husband, a wanted criminal and they have to get to Hong Kong in order to stay alive and be free. She murders one girl and gets her ID and goes to Hong Kong and now she should get an ID for her husband, who is still in mainland and needs an ID, too. The girl has found a perfect victim (Wayne Lai) who lives alone in the woods and has not many friends and all she has to do is get his ID and that she WILL get by any means..What follows is a night of pure terror, depression and brutal and savage mayhem that won&apos;t leave the viewer alone even after the viewing.\n\nIntruder is very intense and dark thriller and these are the elements, that make Run and Kill and The Untold Story so great and unmatchable classics in Hong Kong terror cinema. It rains all the time in Intruder and nothing seems too bright or optimistic, and this reminded me a little of David Fincher&apos;s Se7en. In Intruder, there is one positive character, a little girl, which brings some hope to the misery in the film. The cinematography and lightning are gorgeous and create very ominous moments and scenes. The editing is at times too fast and irritating, and I think they should have concentrated a little more on those edits and finish this in its perfect form. Now it looks like it was finished in horrible rush. Anyway, the overall atmosphere is so chilling and the film has many nasty surprises and memorable elements, it is easy for Hong Kong enthusiast to like this and this also ranks almost as high as those mentioned masterpieces of the genre.\n\nThere is a certain theme in this film and it is more than depressing and pessimistic. I think that those two murderers, wife and husband, can be seen as a dark side of humanity and of that cab driver (Wayne Lai) in particular, because we learn that there are many bad things this cab driver has done to others in past. And it really rains all the time and there is a definite feeling of pure evil present all the time, so I think that the murdering characters can be seen as Rutger Hauer&apos;s hitcher in The Hitcher by Robert Harmon: not necessarily a realistic character but something very wicked and bad that lurks more or less deep inside every human being. I love these kind of films, because usually they are so powerful that the result is something very special, and that is the case in Intruder, too. There is no necessarily a happy ending, because once the evil has been released, it is hard to keep it on the background and away..\n\nThere are, however, couple of usual faults in Intruder and they can be found a little too often in these films. The aforementioned unfinished looking editing is one fault, and the other is that there are too many &quot;easy&quot; conclusions in the story and characters seem to be able to do impossible things and those things have become cliches. There are no explanations for certain scenes that should have been explained in order to fully appreciate the film, but I think they are easy to forgive, because there are so many positive things in this film. \n\nThe violence and other stuff that gave Intruder CAT3 rating is pretty disturbing but it is also left to imagination and not on-screen all the time. But this doesn&apos;t mean Intruder is easy for everyone to watch, because the scenes are very very brutal and violent, and the overall tone is so dark and pessimistic. So this cannot be recommended to any other than Hong Kong extreme cinema enthusiasts, but it is no use in expecting this to be some kind of blood bath: the effects are not too plenty, and this is not some kind of splat fest. There is no nudity in this film, so the high 3 rating was earned due to the violence and brutality, both graphic and mental.\n\nIntruder deserves 8/10 but it would have earned more, if only those mentioned little flaws were not there. Still, this is one of the finest examples of what these Orient film makers can create with the tools and magic of cinema. Intruder is again something that is very difficult to imagine coming out from some other country or Western film makers.",

      "reviewBody": "Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas were inexorably linked not just by their co-starring films together, but by the fact that Hedda Hopper in one of her books did a chapter on both of them. She entitled the chapter, The Terrible Tempered Twins and she bemoaned the fact that these two instead of being good little captives of the studio system that kept her in business, had the audacity to chart their own careers. Go into the production end and take total responsibility for the work they did.\n\nIt would never have worked had not Lancaster and Douglas not been good judges of the roles they were best suited for. Some stars never wanted that kind of responsibility or felt they were poor judges. William Holden said point blank after one picture where he was the producer, the responsibility was too much for him. Robert Taylor was widely quoted that he stayed with MGM as long as he did because he felt they knew best how to present him and what were good film properties.\n\nBut Burt and Kirk knew their minds and made their own careers work. Fortunately before both of them in the Nineties were felled by illness and Lancaster left us, they gave us one more co-starring part. \n\nThis one&apos;s a comedy though, something different for them. As Harry Doyle and Archie Long two elderly crooks released after a thirty year stretch for robbing the West Coast Flyer train, they find roles perfectly suited to their age and personality.\n\nLancaster&apos;s old and he knows it, but he still wants to be treated with some dignity. Douglas hasn&apos;t quite figured it out yet, but in time he gets the fact that time&apos;s caught up with him. They just can&apos;t adjust to changing times so they try all kinds of things to fit in. And then they decide on one spectacular coda to their lives and careers in the wonderful world of crime.\n\nThe two men are in great form and they get some able support from Alexis Smith, Charles Durning and Dana Carvey in the supporting cast. But special comment must be made for Eli Wallach&apos;s seeing eye hit-man. Good thing his part is not as long as the stars because he steals every scene he&apos;s in.",

Chopra, one of the most acclaimed Indian film-makers of all time, has given some of the most memorable films on female themes like &quot;Insaaf Ka Tarazu,&quot; and &quot;Nikaah.&quot; &quot;Tawaif&quot; remains relatively an underrated and unnoticed film by him. Tawaif stands for a courtesan or a prostitute and the film depicts prostitution is due to some unwanted circumstances of life and even under a prostitute dwells a lady who wants to live and love. The theme just beautifully unravels in the film with some touching sequences. The best thing of the film is the Urdu language it uses which feels just mesmerizing and the formal presentation of the setting and character just makes it a film to treasure. Rishi Kapoor, Rati Agnihotri, and Sushma Seth were the ones to give the best ones in the film. However it couldn&apos;t also avoid the regular characters of formulaic movies played by Kader Khan, or Asrani. Few songs are also good. Overall, it&apos;s the simplicity and the sensitivity with which the story is dealt, makes this film even a treat to watch. I had watched this film over 15 years and still today I&apos;m touched with certain sequences of the film.\n\nRating: 2 stars out of 4",

This is a pretty left field film which has the benefit of some great actors with the leads particularly good, who suck you into a spiders web of a story which though the big revelation does not wholly ring credible, is none the less well worth watching. As a footnote, this smart little indie film just shows how big Hollywood so often wastes millions of dollars on unworthy projects and poor film making.Finally i thought that Amber Valletta made the film work, while she was ably assisted by Michael Keaton who has become a really impressive and very versatile actor, who has left Batman a very long way behind.",

      "reviewBody": "Mario Soldati, one of the most artistic of directors and one of the chief exponents of &apos;calligrafismo&apos;, is probably best known for his superlative &apos;trilogy&apos; based upon the novels of Fogazzaro. Her performance in the first of these, &apos;Piccolo Mondo Antico&apos;, had proved a turning point in the career of lovely Alida Valli and here she plays the title role in this splendid adaptation of one of Honoré de Balzac&apos;s greatest novels which forms part of his monumental cycle &apos;La Comédie Humaine.&apos;\n\nThe character of Eugénie is certainly one of Balzac&apos;s most appealing but the novel&apos;s real claim to posterity is the portrait of miserliness in the shape of her father Félix, unmatched until that of George Eliot&apos;s &apos;Silas Marner&apos;.\n\nFélix Grandet, with all his avarice and cunning, is a gift of a part and here it is relished by Gualtiero Tumiati. The scene where he cheats his rather passive daughter out of her mother&apos;s inheritance lingers long in the memory as does that in which, about to breathe his last, he is dazzled by the gold of the crucifix held over his head.\n\nEugénie has nobility of soul and although Plato valued virtue over gold, this characteristic can often make for a one-dimensional character but not as played by Alida Valli who is magnificent. She is fully deserving of the Nastro d&apos;Argento she received for her portrayal.\n\nShe waits seven years for her first and only love Charles to return only to discover that this shallow, selfish character is to marry someone else for social advancement. Giorgio de Lullo, who mainly worked in the theatre, is perfectly cast in the role. Grandet&apos;s long-suffering wife, a thankless role on paper, is brought to life by Giudetta Rissone whilst Pina Gallini impresses as Nanon who is so much more that just a housekeeper.\n\nAll of Soldati&apos;s hallmarks as a director are here in terms of fidelity to the spirit of the original, his eye for detail and his classical restraint. Art direction, cinematography and score are exceptional.\n\nApart from his literary gifts, Balzac is a master of characterisation, possessing an uncanny understanding of the human heart, especially in relation to money. He himself did not pen the words &apos;Gold cannot be pure and people cannot be perfect&apos; but this old proverb suits his works admirably.",

      "reviewBody": "There are three common errors made by directors of historical films that Michael Winterbottom neatly avoids in &apos;Jude&apos;, his adaptation of Thomas Hardy&apos;s novel.  Firstly, he creates a picture of a livable past, not some shallow collage of country houses and Dickensian squalor but a world in which a normality, of sorts, might reign.  Secondly, he sets out to explore that normality, instead of simply judging the past by present values. Finally, he is working with a script that is neither archaic and stiff nor laced with modern anachronisms.  Add to this strong direction and casting (Christopher Ecclestone is excellent in the title role, and a young Kate Winslett fetchingly appealing as Sue), and the result is a good film; but it lacks something of a dramatic punch.\n\nI haven&apos;t read the book, but one senses from the film that it may represent a fierce attack on then-contemporary values, particularly those involving marriage, values which drive the characters to their ultimate misfortune. One senses this, but in the movie this theme is played down, so the story seems merely to tell of the ups and downs of Jude&apos;s life, presented as fairly accidental happenings.  A terrible tragedy eventually occurs; and, because of what has happened in the past, a second, avoidable, tragedy then follows.  The problem, dramatically speaking, is that the second tragedy appears smaller than the first, thus the end of the film serves as an anti-climax. Without a unifying sense of accusation, we, instead of a powerful polemic, are left with only the tale of an unfortunate.\n\n &apos;Jude&apos; is one of the better, and the least sentimental, of historical films. But something of the point has been lost in translation.",

This is based on a true story about a sadistic couple who killed dog lovers (the truth is stranger than fiction). In this film, Mr. Shamoto (Mitsuru Fukikoshi) owns a tropical fish shop. His second wife is Taeko (the still amazing Asuka Kurosawa, who was the star of the stunning &quot;A Snake Of June) and his daughter Mitsuko live with him. Mitsuko shoplifts and is threatened with the police but Mr. Murata (a terrificly over the top Denden)persuades that shop owner to let her go. It turns out, Murata owns a large tropical fish store and agrees to have Mitsuko work for him. If this sounds too perfect, too much like a perfect turn of events..it is. Eventually, Mr. Shamoto leans about Murata but he is in too deep by then. Not for the faint of heart, but it is a riveting, sometimes gory horror/drama, with a little black comedy thrown in. The acting is uniformly very good. Worthy of your time, especially for admirers of Mr. Sono&apos;s work, but not for everyone.",

      "reviewBody": "I picked this one up in a thrift shop as it had weird cover art featuring an exploding aeroplane above an ocean full of sharks fins, people over-board a ship and an odd large alien shaped hand. Anyway as the credits rolled for this Italian/Spanish co production, I noticed the music was by the (usually god-like genius) Stelvio Cipriani and the main star was Andrés García, the handsome muscle guy who starred in Tintorera. The film starts with a voice-over intro about U. F. O&apos;s and the Bermuda Triangle... Strange occurrences begin happening in the Bermuda area (will they ever learn?) as boats, ships and helicopters (yeah!) disappear into thin air after a high pitched screeching noise is heard, the sea water bubbles and a weird green light pulsates into red (very basic not so special effects).\n\nA rich old guy&apos;s much loved daughter and her new husband (wearing possibly the smallest white hot-pants I have ever seen) experience the same fate and the old guy wants to find out what happened to them. So he hires a bloke (money no object) with a theory about the disappearances to go and search the area they went missing. He takes with him Andrés García and an old sailor who likes the whisky, an Alsation dog and some some other bland characters (divers etc.) Anyway, as they search you really expect something to happen, but sadly it never does. They search the area for what takes up nearly the entire film, dodging the occasional stock-footage shark and discovering rocks unlike any other found before. One of the divers who sports a beard gets possessed by something in the water and the dog growls at him. It really is this exciting. Eventually Andrés and the other guy discover an underground (and under sea) grotto with a huge statue like one found on Easter Island.\n\nI won&apos;t give away the ending, because I want other people to watch the entire film (like I had to) see what the climax would be. I will say though, that silver body suits and crash helmets do not make for good space aliens with intelligent and supreme powers.\n\nThe score by Stelvio Cipriani was a lot more orchestral than I was expecting (not like the superb &apos;Tentacoli&apos;) and there&apos;s no suspense to speak of, but if you like the look of Andrés García, you wont be disappointed as you do get to see him in very skimpy underpants for almost the entire film.",

      "name": "Fluffy Action Comedy with Appealing Cast",
      "reviewBody": "Although far inferior in both concept and results, &quot;Knight and Day&quot; has its roots in the classic screwball comedies of the 1930&apos;s. Cute, seemingly coincidental airport encounters connect an attractive blonde, Cameron Diaz, who is en route to her sister&apos;s wedding, with a handsome man of mystery, Tom Cruise, and a series of wildly improbable events ensues. An early scene aboard a near-empty airliner is perhaps the film&apos;s highlight, as Cruise does battle with unknown assailants, while a blissfully unaware Diaz primps in the restroom, intent on seducing Cruise. Perhaps if the humor and pace of this scene had been sustained, the film would have been more successful. If Cary Grant were the dashing stranger and Katharine Hepburn the unwitting accomplice, the film would have been classic.\n\nHowever, while they are attractive leads, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are not Grant and Hepburn. Although the pair have undeniable star power and seem to be having fun, their eyes were likely focused more on the paycheck than on the superficial script which lacks the witty exchanges of classic screwball comedy. Also appearing for the money is a talented supporting cast that includes Viola Davis, Peter Sarsgaard, and Paul Dano; unfortunately, none of these gifted performers have roles that stretch their acting skills. With chases, gunfights, and rapid cutting, director James Mangold keeps the film moving at breakneck speed as the cast chases a &quot;McGuffin&quot; in the form of a super battery, whose importance is often lost in the sometimes confusing proceedings.\n\nAlthough even the classic screwball comedies stretched credibility, Mangold&apos;s film uses CGI to create sequences that are beyond preposterous. At times, Cruise seems to be a super-hero with supernatural powers; his close encounters are unbelievable even for a Batman or Fantastic Four. As the complicated plot unfolds, the characters&apos; motivations seem to shift, and the audience is kept guessing as to who can and cannot be trusted and who is working for whom. The action, light comedy, and appealing performers will hold viewer interest throughout, although, like cotton candy, this fluffy piece will fade from memory before the closing credits finish rolling.",

      "reviewBody": "In July 2005, Australian filmmaker Scott Hicks started shooting a documentary about the composer Philip Glass to celebrate his 70th birthday in 2007. Over the next 18 months, Hicks filmed Philip across three continents - from his annual ride on the Coney Island &quot;Cyclone&quot; roller coaster, to the world premiere of his new opera in Germany and in performance with a didgeridoo virtuoso Mark Atkins in Australia. Born in Baltimore, Glass discovered music as he worked in his father&apos;s radio store. Hicks documents his early studies and the somewhat precocious formation of his own ensemble to make certain his unusual compositions had a chance to find an audience. The 12 parts of the film focus on different aspects of Glass&apos;s work and both public and private worlds. The rapport Hicks developed over the prolonged shoot is indicated by candid conversations in which Glass addresses the off-camera Hicks. This rapport results in an affectionate and intimate portrait of Glass. A recent visitor to Melbourne to perform Book of Longing, his collaboration with Leonard Cohen, Glass&apos;s works include opera, theater pieces, dance, film and song. Fan&apos;s of Glass&apos;s music will love this film and it offers a wonderful introduction for strangers to his oeuvre.",

As you watch this movie you can &quot;feel&quot; the mood that Marjorie is portraying at the time, just by the look on her face. For example, during the the &quot;Easter&quot; scene, her eyes and smiles say it all, you can see she is in love, and as she sings &quot;White Christmas&quot; at the end you can feel the sadness of her character - throughout the entire movie she says more with her facial expressions then the most popular movie stars do today in their entire careers... If you love truly good acting, Holiday Inn will make you smile and make you cry, it will bring back memories of a time when ladies could truly dance in high heel shoes, we don&apos;t see that type of dancing these days in movies. Picture quality, sound and special effects are not of primary importance in these kinds of films, these are the kind that rely on your own imagination and feelings, much in the way you do when you read a good book. \n\nThese older movies serve up so much good feelings they could be used to replace prescription meds for those feeling bad.",

Its a &quot;I&apos;ve got nothing better to do and some time to kill&quot; matinee movie, but still worth watching once."

This funny little thing does magic (though often violent) and makes friend with an 11-year-old boy to protect the world from really ugly extraterrestrial invaders that seem to be from the same race as the ones in MARS ATTACKS! Announced as a children&apos;s movie by some Japanese insiders I found this movie quite entertaining (and I am already 36 years old) with its typical Japanese humour and creativity that are a mixture of slapstick and surrealism, not to mention some great special effects. I bet the TETRA robot saying things to children like in JUVENILE would make millions as a merchandising article. Even adults want to befriend him.",

      "reviewBody": "Lionel Cosgrove is a good guy having a tough time with things. Ever since his father died saving him during a swimming accident Lionel has been taking care of his mother. But unfortunately his mother must have come from the same parenting class as Norman Bates&apos; mother since she is as manipulative and smothering. But things seem to be on the up and up for him when he starts a romance with a local shop owner&apos;s daughter. But a date to the zoo takes a turn for the worse when Lionel&apos;s overprotective mum follows him and manages to get bitten by a &quot;rat monkey&quot;, a particularly nasty creature whose bite is killerliterally. The bite turns his mum into a zombie and each one she bites turns as well. Pretty soon poor Lionel is living in the house of the dead and fighting off a lecherous uncle scheming to grab the estate.\n\nPeter Jackson (of Lord of the Rings fame) once again proves he is more than able to give us the gory goods and make us laugh the entire time. This insanely entertaining flick has buckets and buckets of blood and gore, probably one of the (if not THE) bloodiest around. For a film with a miniscule budget (approximately $3 million) he makes every penny count and turns out a very nice looking film. The comedy is pure slapstick and at times dark as pitch. The actors attack their various roles with a solid energy that gives the film a maniac pace. &quot;Brain Dead&quot; (aka &quot;Dead Alive&quot;) is the best splatter comedy money can buy.",

The story has been told x number of times. But what makes &apos;Bringing Down The House&apos; likable is Queen Latifah, Steve Martin and Joan Plowright. These three provide some laugh-out-loud moments some including Martin and Latifah&apos;s dance number, Martin dressing and talking &apos;black&apos;, Queen Latifah and Missy Pyle&apos;s catfight and doing a break-dance, Plowright&apos;s pompous and stuck up character getting stoned, Peter&apos;s neighbour catching him and Charlene in a compromising position. The chemistry between Latifah and Martin is convincing and both have a good comic timing. Thus, even though the story has nothing new to offer, the funny moments make &apos;Bringing Down The House&apos; fun to watch."

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;ve had Scarface, now we have it&apos;s offspring. If your a Jeff Bridges face, run, not walk, down to the video store and hire this gem. You&apos;ll be entertained to the max. The movie throws us right into the action with Bridges and his group of cops from the sheriff&apos;s department about to apprehend an hispanic drug dealer. Bridges and his pal too, aren&apos;t shy about taking a tot of whatever from a cannister, prior. Forced to shoot this dealer down, as one of Bridge&apos;s mate is taking a whacking from one, of those nasty Louisville sluggers, he&apos;s questioned along with his friend. That night, him and his friend get sozzled, Bridges, the more drunk of the two, who tends to fall off bar stools. He falls into a guilt drunken phase, the following scene an emotional one between him and his family, over some awlfully sad music. Bridges is so believable in his role here, we really acknowledge what a great actor this guy is. To think he never won an Oscar until 2010&apos;s Crazy Heart is criminal. We move a few months down the track to an AA meeting that Bridges is attending. Here, one of the other members, gives him a fat fee, to help this young prostitute, Sunny, (an awesome performance by Alexandra Paul, prior to her Baywatch days) get free of her pimp, Angel (Andy Garcia in probably his best role still). For all we know, this woman stranger could be her mother. His attempt to protect her fails, when Sunny is snatched from Bridges in one blood splashing action scene, worthy of it&apos;s R rating. Again Bridges falls into a pit, blacking out. When he comes to, he&apos;s the one who must unravel this mystery, with the help of Sunny&apos;s hooker friend, Sarah, played by Rossanna Arquette, very good in her role, but not great like the others. You&apos;ve gotta love Angel&apos;s pad. A big castle like building that has been used in a cheap &quot;City lights film&quot; I won&apos;t mention. This spread operates as a casino and bordello, where in one scene, we see just how dangerous Angel really is. A small electic tram transports it&apos;s customers to it&apos;s entrance up top. This film has style, it&apos;s valet guys sporting it too. I love the scene where Bridges and Sarah meet Angel and his goons in the big car park outside this big museum, where a lot of angry expletives are exchanged in some good meaty and funny dialogue. Let&apos;s face it, this movie doesn&apos;t have the best script in the world, but there are some classicly original lines that stick, one involving Sunny, describing her anatomy. Bridges and Garcia share this colorful conversation over sno cones, Angel proudly provides. How cool and original is that. Sarah is snatched back from Bridges who was trying to get answers from her, thus he must get her back as she&apos;s in dangerous waters now. This flick uses great L.A. locations and is beautifully shot, Hal Ashby&apos;s last film too. The Lawrence Block novel is vastly different, where it&apos;s set in New York, and the pimp&apos;s name is Chance unlike the Chance character in the film, Angel&apos;s silent partner I guess. You&apos;ll get this joke if you watch this film. Another scene involving a string of expletives takes place later in a warehouse as we build towards our climax. They were really in need of a script doctor that day. The climax is rewarding, as is it&apos;s happy after scene. What we&apos;ve got here is a good drama, a little disjointed in bits, as in it&apos;s dialogue, but it&apos;s exciting, involving, and more so, it&apos;s different. And those sort of movies, I like. Though slow paced, this really didn&apos;t bother me. It works for this movie as we get really get to scratch the surface of Bridges and Arquette&apos;s characters. For me, what I loved most about this timeless flick, was it&apos;s locations. This is one of those eighties bucket list classics you must see. This was another &apos;86 movie I would of loved to seen at the cinema, but we can&apos;t turn back time, can we.",

Kiefer Sutherland is the agent on his tail.\n\nIts not a bad movie its just been there done that with form over content film making. There is no real tension because the actors are in roles they&apos;ve played a dozen or so times before (Sutherland in 24 each week)so you can pretty much walk them through whats happening.Thats the problem here, its all been done before, better.\n\nThe real question is: Do I really need to pay 10 bucks a head to see whats a essentially a big screen TV movie? I think not. As I said its not bad, its just not worth running out to the theater to see. Wait for cable where this movie really belongs.",

      "reviewBody": "John &quot;Johnny Rotten&quot; Lydon cameos and Executive-Produces this social/political fantastic coming-of-age film. Nikolaj adores his eccentric hippie parents, especially his extremely unconventional father. Christmas is celebrated around a tree strung with bananas (summing up the father&apos;s feelings regarding the religious reasons for the holiday), and the holiday&apos;s good-humored Christmas dinner table blessing includes quotes from Nietzsche challenging beliefs in Christ and/or Christianity. But when Nikolaj&apos;s mother dies in a tragic accident, Nikolaj&apos;s anger helps to guide him toward punk, The Sex Pistols and a need to rebel against the hypocrisy and bleak future that he now sees his school, society - and yes, even his dad - leading him to. The problem is, rebelliousness has always been encouraged, not disciplined, in Nikolaj&apos;s home. Plus, Nikolai&apos;s dad was also badly damaged, and is now feeling a similar need to lash out. How do you stand up against your father when he begins following you down YOUR path and listening to YOUR music? Plus, he goes so far in supporting your rebelliousness that he actually comes to your school - rather brilliantly - to defend you when you are threatened with discipline after throwing a bottle at your school principal, hitting him in the head, during a bullshit public speech. Effectively, your dad is growing up just as much as you are. But still, there remains much to lash out against. For one, Nikolaj&apos;s father drags him along as he retreats to a hippie nudist colony, a personal journey for dad that turns out to be about little more than a need to shagg some woman from behind in the bushes. Then there&apos;s his dad&apos;s overly familiar playfulness with one of Nikolaj&apos;s teen-aged female friends. The last straw is broken, however, when Nikolaj&apos;s band gets their 1st public gig and - needing a drummer after their regular one has a bad reaction to some drugs - Nikolaj&apos;s father is called upon by the band to sit in with them. SONS OF NORWAY is a delightful and very thoughtful film that provides seems honest, while avoiding easy answers.",

There are many tell-tale indications of this, such as in the inconsistency of the characters. Palpable tension is generated between characters without any warning, and then it is forgotten by the next scene.\n\nAnother glaring issue was the pacing of the story. If you saw the trailer, you would think it centered around this bank robbery by two normal guys. However, this is only one small piece of the movie. The opening was simultaneously slow and somewhat insufficient, then everything sped up tremendously, and then the latter half of the film was dragged out to fill up the remaining time needed for the movie to be taken seriously.\n\nIn all, I would rate this film a 6.5/10 since it was still entertaining and done by clearly talented actors. However, note that this is far from their best work, probably because the actors were confused about who their characters were.",

Here, however, in Elizabethtown, the leading man is a hole on the screen. No charisma, no projection, no involvement. I&apos;m not a teenage girl, I grant you that, but I don&apos;t think Cameron Crowe made this film for teenage girls. There was something about returning, about rediscovering and/or perhaps about first love. Elizabethtown aims higher than most teenage bound movies. The comatose performance of Orlando Bloom makes everyone else appear as if they were high on something. Billy Wilder is always a little bit present in Cameron Crowe&apos;s movies and Kirstin Dunst&apos;s character is a Wilder character if I ever saw one. I kept seeing the young Shirley MacLaine, or longing for, I should say. Dunst is an interesting actress but here she has to work with a wooden leading man, so that piece of miscasting throws the whole well intentioned enterprise way off course. Never mind, my love and admiration for Crowe will survive this one.",

So she looks for other men for emotional and practical support ... Like many other films from developing countries, it is less polished and stylised than your typical Hollywood movie and is relatively slow moving. In fact, the only negative thing I have to say is that in the first half it really is too slow moving. The plot only takes off in the second half and it is only now that the characters start to develop greater depth and complexity and you wish, afterwards, that more time had been spent on this part of the film. Apart from that, it is beautifully shot and contains in Darlene&apos;s charismatic character a person that retains an enormous amount of genuine happiness even in the most adverse circumstances. It is also, despite the extreme poverty it depicts, warm, funny and has three brilliant actors in the main roles, with Lima Duarte (Osias) standing out in particular.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps one of the only genuinely good Stephen King adaptations, Carrie&apos; follows the tragic tale of Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a young girl who is continually made to suffer at the hands of her bullying classmates and not helped by her overbearing, religious mother Margaret (Piper Laurie). Carrie, however, is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed(?) with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so, it seems, do these potentially lethal abilities. \n\nBrian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King&apos;s first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek&apos;s performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film. Somehow managing to perfectly embody the typical school life of the usual high school outcasts, Spacek was able to bring to everyone the appalling life that so many teenagers are forced to tolerate. From the opening scenes where Carrie is utterly humiliated at the hands of her classmates after Carrie&apos;s hysterical reaction to her first menstruation, to the painfully wretched ending it becomes nigh on impossible not to sympathise with Spacek&apos;s character. Spacek was quite rightly Oscar-nominated for this performance. Spacek&apos;s performance was enhanced by fellow Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religious-nut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance. \n\nDe Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie&apos;s powers he focuses on the torment (and the tormentors) of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a one-dimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous `Prom Night&apos; scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.\n\n Carrie&apos; is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast (which features John Travolta in an early role) was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion Carrie&apos; is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. &apos;Carrie&apos; is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for Carrie&apos;  9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw PAHR while in high school, and it was the beginning of a long and drawn-out love affair with the film. The look, feel and sound of it drew me in at once, and the open-endedness of it appealed to my romantic teenage notions, striking me as being terribly, terribly profound. I searched out the book, and the sequel (both out of print in the US) and had a good long obsession over the film.\n\nYears later, I still appreciate it deeply, but I realize now that if I were to see it for the first time today, I might not be quite so entranced. Yes, it is moody and beautiful, full of deliciously gossamar images, beautiful actresses, a haunting soundtrack, and a hypnotically slow and deliberate pace... but I can now see that it is a very youthful effort on Wier&apos;s part. It is decidedly a young director&apos;s film, firmly mired in the style of its era (the 70s). The heavy-handedness of the direction is evident in many ways, mostly in the repeated metaphors of Miranda as a swan, an angel, etc.... It has anachronistic costumes, makeup and hair, although the sets design is attractive and accurate enough.\n\nHowever, let it be noted that the film is far more about symbolism and atmosphere than anything else, and on that front, it succeeds admirably. Among the highlights:\n\nThe repressed Victorian schoolgirls, whose burgeoning sexual longings are channeled into torrid, purple verse and close romantic friendships\n\nThe famous corset-lacing scenelet\n\nThe implied relationship between Mrs. Appleyard and the &quot;masculine&quot; Miss McCraw\n\nThe disappearance of only the &quot;pure&quot;: Miranda (love), Marion (science), Miss McCraw (math), and the rock&apos;s rejecting Edith (gluttony), Irma (worldliness), and all men.\n\nOne might go on about the sexual imagery of the rock itself, with its monoliths and chasms, but I will refrain. Because after you&apos;ve seen the movie, you realize how many times these things have been hammered into your head.\n\nI still love this film dearly, despite the obviousness of it all. I wish that a soundtrack were available, as the original music is lovely. If you know a teenager, or are one, this is the movie for you. May your love affair with it go on as long as mine."

      "reviewBody": "Penitentiary III (1987) \n\n* 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nToo Sweet (Leon Isaac Kennedy) is in the boxing ring when he goes crazy and beats the other boxer to death. He&apos;s sentenced to three years in prison and sure enough he gets there just in time to join a boxing competition put on by the warden and one of the most powerful inmates there.\n\nThe final film in Jamaa Fanaka&apos;s trilogy appears to have a bigger budget than the first two and it&apos;s certainly much more polished but at the same time there&apos;s no question that it&apos;s the weakest of the lot. Cannon produced and released this third film and it&apos;s hard to believe that you could ever say that they made the &quot;best looking&quot; film of a series but I think this is part of the problem.\n\nThe film just look too good for its own good. The less-than-stellar quality of the first two films made them perfect exploitation movies. This film here doesn&apos;t reach the same levels of camp and it just comes across as a rather bland &quot;C&quot; movie without too many memorable scenes. The highlight is a scene early on when Too Sweet must battle an almost demonic character that turns out to be a midget! This fighting scene is good and certainly the best thing about the picture.\n\nThe performances are much better this time around and as I said there&apos;s no question that this film looks a lot more professional. Sadly, the story itself is nothing original and there&apos;s really just nothing all that entertaining here. It&apos;s really too bad because the first two films are so awful that you can&apos;t help but love them. This third film just doesn&apos;t have the same charm."

I could barely contain my excitement during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, I just wanted to scream out loud I was so excited. When we left the theater there was a ~60 year old woman delicately shadow boxing on her way out the door.

And make damn sure we mutilate young adults while they are barely dressed so we can become aroused by the beauty of the human body and then become horrified at the dismemberment. It never ceases to amaze me what incredibly horrific visions today&apos;s young filmmakers can dream up. Even more pathetic, someone is paying them to do it. When the audience finally says &quot;no I won&apos;t watch this tasteless, senseless waste of talent and money,&quot; perhaps they will stop making it.\n\nNot likely, unfortunately."

Instead of his usual epileptic zooms, the cinematography in this is measured and carefully composed. The acting is also another plus. William Berger&apos;s portrayal as the Father Confessor is the epitome of slime and pretense. Let&apos;s not forget Susan Hemingway and her effortless performance as the innocent heroine of the title. In closing, this is a MUST-SEE picture and proof that Franco could make a film that would cater to the arthouse crowd."

The B&amp;W photography really lends itself to any Lovecraft adaptation, and this flick doesn&apos;t skimp on the atmosphere. The music also helps a lot, which never once falls into the dodgy Casio-synth chasm that many a low budget movie does. The actors put in great performances all round too.\n\nI saw this at a time when I had recently read the original stories for the first time (in preparation for my own Re-Animator short) and was impressed with the faithfulness of the adaptation. In terms of re-creating Lovecraft&apos;s sense of dread, Matzke has done a stellar job. \n\n5/5",

He gets progressively more drunk as the principal interview proceeds;  a man who was already brutally honest reaches inspired levels of candor befitting the finest of Irish alcoholics.  This is interpolated with many deftly executed segments of a more purely art critical nature.  Highly recommended to anyone wanting more of Bacon and his art.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Private Number&quot; is a nice little romantic picture about love between the haves and have nots. Representing the latter is lovely Loretta Young, a penniless young woman who decides to apply for a job as a maid and on the other side is handsome Robert Taylor, who happens to be the son of the wealthy couple who employ her. Back home from college for the summer, Taylor presumes Loretta is one of the guests for the party welcoming him home but even after discovering her actual status is bewitched enough by her beauty to still pursue her. Looking on with malice is head butler Basil Rathbone who wants Loretta for himself (his creepy demeanor and malevolent running of the house staff cancels any possibility Loretta would want him). Taylor persuades Young to secretly marry him, planning to announce their marriage after graduation. Trouble is Loretta with child while he is away at school, leading a jealous Rathbone scheme to destroy her relations with the family.\n\nRobert Taylor was only a year into his stardom when this film was made in 1936 and he is once again in the type of role he specialized in at the time, the dashing young heir pursuing a young woman in a Cinderella romance but one that has turns with misunderstandings and mistrust. It&apos;s almost the same story as &quot;Small Town Girl&quot;, a better picture he also made that year. On loanout here to 20th Century-Fox, the MGM hunk was the undisputed heartthrob of the moment and among the top five box office stars (he would have been unrivalled in the late 1930&apos;s had Fox not quickly developed their own matinee idol in Tyrone Power later that year.) Taylor&apos;s very good but since Loretta Young was a Fox contractee, her character dominates the story. Gentle and graceful, Loretta was a moderately talented actress very capable in light stories like this one.\n\nThe supporting cast is hit and miss. Earthy chatterbox Patsy Kelly steals the film as Loretta&apos;s best friend, one of the family&apos;s other maids, and the excellent, elegant character actress Marjorie Gateson is quite good as Taylor&apos;s mother, taking a shine to Loretta early on and making her a personal maid. Basil Rathbone, alas, was always unsubtle when playing a villain and here he&apos;s such a creep it&apos;s hard to believe the family would ever believe he was looking out for their best interests. Paul Harvey was also a little excessive as Taylor&apos;s father. On the other hand, the underrated Monroe Owsley, is a bit of a surprise. Always cast as untrustworthy dalliances for movie queens (Stanwyck, Mae West, etc.) here he comes across a believable nice guy. We (and Loretta!) should have known better! Kane Richmond, a Robert Taylor type for B movies in that era, has a brief role as the family&apos;s chauffeur.\n\nThe film audaciously has many parallels with Loretta Young&apos;s private life, one wonders if the studio had concocted this little story to put some confusion in the public re speculation about her private romances, as if the public hearing the Hollywood whispers might conclude it was all just a movie plot. Unwed Loretta had just given birth to Clark Gable&apos;s child which much of Hollywood suspected but it was never acknowledged until the 1990&apos;s when Loretta was near the end of her life. In this movie, Loretta has to fight an annulment so that her baby will remain &quot;legitimate&quot;. If that&apos;s not nervy enough, how about a scene where Patsy Kelly rhapsodizes about Clark Gable&apos;s screen sex appeal to which Loretta whole-heartedly agrees!\n\n&quot;Private Number&quot; is basically just a pleasant but unremarkable romantic drama, the screen equivalent to a paperback romance novel but with beautiful stars and a smooth production to hold your interest.",

Till the end of the movie, I considered the plot of movie to be an improbable one. But on seeing the title card only, I understood that researches are going on globally over the centre point of the movie. Acting is perfect. No one overdoing it or lacks it! Absolutely no cinematic or heroic deeds in this movie! This movie clearly exhibits the negative side of modern science. Another hidden gem!",

      "reviewBody": "Carrying on in the rich tradition of famed Berlin Philharmonic conductors Von Bulow, Nikisch, Furtwangler, Celibidache, von Karajan, and Claudio Abbado, Sir Simon Rattle&apos;s enormous talent and charismatic personality are in full view in Thomas Grube&apos;s moving documentary Trip to Asia: The Quest for Harmony. The film was shot during the orchestra&apos;s concert tour in Asia that brought them to Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Tokyo. While it provides only a superficial sense of the destinations, the power of the music to touch us is palpable and the intimate look at the musicians&apos; and their personal struggles is compelling.\n\nThe Berlin Philharmonic, one of the premier orchestras in the world, is a self-governing public foundation with the power to make its own artistic and financial decisions, a condition insisted on by Rattle when he signed in 2002, and this decision making power is evident when we learn that several orchestra members are on a lengthy probation and will be voted in or out when the tour comes to an end. It becomes quite clear that simply having a love for music and being technically impeccable is not all that is required. There is that elusive fit with the orchestra that is hard to define but becomes clear after an extended tour.\n\nTrip to Asia features powerful performances of music by Richard Strauss (Ein Heldenleben, A Hero&apos;s Life), Ludwig von Beethoven (Eroica Symphony), and the modern composer Thomas Ades, whose Asyla is introduced. Grube supplements the concerts with interviews with the musicians who reflect on how well they cope with the competition, the desire for recognition, the loneliness of hours and hours of solo practice, and the enormous pressure for excellence they face every time they go on stage. Some speak to the camera and talk about how they were always loners and never felt accepted at school and how their instrument allowed them to offer something unique to others and to take pride in who they are, perhaps for the first time.\n\nThe 126 musicians of the Philharmonic know from experience how crucial it is to subordinate their individual personalities to the greater good of an organization, and the documentary is as much about the aspirations and self-doubts of individual performers as it is about the orchestra and its artistic achievements. Rattle is intense as he talks about what it is like to perform in an orchestra steeped in its own rules and traditions. &quot;All of us&quot;, he says, &quot;go through things that demands a pulling together of our disparate parts. The minute you start thinking it&apos;s about you, you&apos;re in crisis. When you don&apos;t believe that the music is something much greater, you have a problem.&quot; The grind on the musicians is evident and also on the camera crew. As the director describes it, &quot;The team has gotten only three hours of sleep a night since our arrival in China. We&apos;re beat, not just because of the time difference, but because we rise before the orchestra and go to sleep after they do.&quot; The film documents the grueling travel, the rehearsals and the master classes, the stresses that build up before a performance and, for some, not knowing if they will spend their life with the orchestra or move on to a different career. The high point of the film is the enthusiastic reception in a public square in Taipei where 30,000 people cheer the orchestra. After that, the final stop in Tokyo seems anti-climactic and the end of the tour is finally heartbreaking for those who learn they are not accepted as revealed in the closing credits.",

      "reviewBody": "For the genre movie that this is, it&apos;s a pretty enjoyable movie to watch. It&apos;s definitely no worse or better than any other similar simple straight-forward action flick from the &apos;90&apos;s.\n\nOf course the movie is suffering from more than 1 problem though. One obviously is its story. It&apos;s simple and actually doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense and is a real unlikely one. I mean, why did Red ever let the truck drive off from his place, only to dangerously attempt to hijack it later, on the very same day. But oh well, without this story we wouldn&apos;t had all those exploding trucks and action scenes within this movie.\n\nWell, it&apos;s not like the action is much spectacular though. Funny enough there are lots of exploding trucks and cars but they already seem to blow up when one of the passengers farts. Action-wise this movie just isn&apos;t good or spectacular enough to watch.\n\nAnother problem with the movie is that it has far too many villains in it. It&apos;s like the main characters against the rest of the world. The movie also doesn&apos;t seem to be able to make a choice who to make the main and most important villain of the movie, with as a result that all of the villainous characters aren&apos;t really anything memorable or evil enough, since the movie spends to much time on showing the many different villainous characters of the movie.\n\nThe movie is from the period when Patrick Swayze&apos;s career of course already was more or less on a death end. Nevertheless he&apos;s always good and serious with every role that he plays. He&apos;s also credible in this role, despite his already showing age. He was perhaps a tad bit too old at the time of this movie to play the main lead in an action movie. Meat Loaf mostly seemed to have had fun with playing his role, which shows on the screen. But like I said before, since he plays a villain, he didn&apos;t get the screen time he deserved. There are parts in the movie were he completely disappears, only to show up 20 minutes later again.\n\nBut despite this all, the movie is good and entertaining enough to watch. It&apos;s current rating on here would suggest that this is one of the worst action flicks of the &apos;90&apos;s but it hardly is. It&apos;s also no better than some action flicks but also definitely no worse than some others.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Actually, only Mary Wickes has been replaced, which is no surprise, since she is passed away... As for the new guys: Michael McKean is average as Sarousch. (This might have been a nice role for Tim Curry, though...) Jennifer Love Hewitt is very good as Madellaine! Also, her singing voice is magnificent! Haley Joel Osment has a good role too, but isn&apos;t as good as he was in Beauty and the Beast: A Magical Christmas. Now for the bad things. Character design sucks!!! Sarousch looks uglier then Quasi himself! The music sucks too. It has absolutely nothing in common with the church music from the first movie. Also, the special effects are lousy! The bell &apos;La fidele&apos; should look like it has diamonds and juwels all over it. So it could have been shining like the sun. Instead, it is badly drawn... Actually, the entire animation is done crappy... and off course, the story... It&apos;s not as bad as it could have been! But certainly not worthy for a sequel to such a great movie!!!\n\nIn conclusion: Kids will like it. No person in the world will actually love it! Even if your a collector like me: don&apos;t buy it. In Holland it had one good thing: it came out 2 months earlier then in the US..."

      "reviewBody": "Since watching this film I have picked up a biography of Dorothy Parker as well as a book of her verse, that is how fascinating I find her to be. Not only her, but the performance of Jennifer Jason Leigh as well, though many have criticized her voice, I didn&apos;t find it out of place at all. The film involves us in her life in the 20&apos;s, when she was a theater critic for Vanity Fair. Throughout the film are celebrities of the time, Robert Benchley, Alexander Woolcott, Howard Ross, Charles McArthur. The cast is first-rate, particularly Campbell Scott. It is a very quotable movie, full of venomous one-liners, most courtesy of Mrs. Parker. One can certainly admire her spirit to persevere and excel in a world dominated by men. It is helpful to know the members of the Round Table, but isn&apos;t necessary in order to enjoy the movie."

      "name": "ANNE OF THE INDIES (Jacques Tourneur, 1951) ***",
      "reviewBody": "This is one of several period sea-faring yarns of its era, which has the added distinction (although not in itself unique) of a female buccaneer at its center. At first, both leads – Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually, thanks no doubt to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Velvety-voiced Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship’s obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor, and Gomez is suitably larger-than-life as Blackbeard The Pirate.\n\nThe cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan’s wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom Jourdan instills the first pangs of love (which, however, does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword-wound); incidentally, the film was the second exotic teaming of Jourdan and Paget in one year, following Delmer Daves’ BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne’s character is her falling out with Blackbeard’s crew, and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded Jourdan, Paget and Marshall.\n\nWhile the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type, Jacques Tourneur’s energetic direction and Franz Waxman’s grandiose score ensure an above-average effort that moves along at a brisk pace; incidentally, Tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way, differing running-times are given for this film (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version I watched was the shorter one.",

I don&apos;t usually look up reviews or synopsis&apos; of movies before buying them just because it kind of spoils the fun, but I would have made an exception for this one. I was expecting some &apos;raunchy&apos; T&amp;A sci-fi spoof as it IS called &apos;Bad Girls From Mars&apos; and the tagline being &quot;and you thought Earth girls were easy...&quot; (honestly expecting some kind of &apos;Earth Girls Are Easy&apos; spoof). What I ended up with was so far from what I expected that I&apos;m not sure why I kept watching it... ok, I know at least a couple of reasons... well, more than just a couple. I mean, you can&apos;t miss them because they&apos;re in nearly every shot!\n\nThey certainly deliver on the T&amp;A, buuut that&apos;s about it. The movie is a spoof, but of slasher flicks and it&apos;s done very poorly. Then again, you&apos;re not watching it for the plot, right? There is absolutely zero acting talent. The only one that I actually found even remotely entertaining was the detective, aside from that, it was like watching a bunch of sentient boards that just escaped the lumber yard. This probably would have worked better as a porn like it&apos;s trying to emulate rather than being a softcore &quot;late night Cinemax&quot; movie.\n\nOh well, it was ok to watch, but isn&apos;t memorable in any way.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It is difficult to imagine a more powerful, emotional story than the real life heroism of George Hogg. He was a British journalist who truly saved the life and dreams of 60 war Chinese war orphans during the 1937 invasion by Japan.\n\nThe good news is that the story is remarkable, but the downside is how director Roger Spottiswoode (&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Turner and Hooch&quot;) is stuck with two miscast leads. Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn&apos;t have the chops to pull off strength of Hogg and much worse is the downright horrible performance of Radha Mitchell as Lee, the war hardened do-gooder. The combination of these two severely weaken the film, but luckily not the story.\n\nChow Yun-Fat and the great Michelle Yeoh play important supporting roles and both are excellent in their English speaking parts. Both are masters at letting simple facial gestures express the bulk of their thoughts. The children in the film are a pleasure to watch, though, we really don&apos;t connect with any of them.\n\nSome of the landscape is beautifully film and Spottiswoode does a good job of portraying the hardships of the 700 mile Silk Road journey, without it dragging the pace down. Again, the power of this story is unmistakable, but it is certainly not given its due by this rendition. Make sure to stay for the credits as we are treated to first hand memories of some of the surviving children (now very adavanced in age, but extremely lucid).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; is original. It&apos;s not quite like any &quot;teen movie&quot; I&apos;ve ever seen. Just as its source material offered a fresh twist to the dork-meets-girl scenario in ink, the film offers the twist on screen.\n\n&quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; centers on unconventional teenage rebels; these aren&apos;t the hoodlums you&apos;d expect to see smoking pot on street corners. In fact, these characters are essentially adults trapped in awkward teenage frames. They have sophisticated tastes and profound desires, but they also carry themselves clumsily and desperately try to shed their virginity. This mature immaturity makes both Nick (Cera) and Sheeni (Doubleday), along with a number of minor characters they meet throughout the film, compelling and unique human beings.\n\nAs Nick Twisp, Michael Cera carries the film. His awkwardly clever narration provides for fairly consistent laughter, and his quest for Sheeni&apos;s heart puts him through a dramatic ringer. As good as Cera is as lovable loser Nick, nothing can prepare the audience for his work as Twisp&apos;s alter-ego: Francois Dillinger. Dillinger is the anti-Nick, which also makes him the anti-Michael Cera, but Cera pulls off his boldness and iron will hilariously. Cera&apos;s dual performance keeps the film fresh when it begins to get a little dull.\n\nAs Sheeni, the primary love interest, Portia Doubleday concocts an unconventional leading lady. She seems to embody every characteristic of the female teenager at the same time, and it&apos;s not hard to see why Nick would idolize her.\n\nThe film focuses on Cera and Doubleday for the most part, and their relationship is strange, and therefore refreshing. Clichés are avoided, unexpected roadblocks pop up, and teenage love rears its ugly, fascinating face. The romance seems real, as well as funny.\n\nWhen &apos;Youth in Revolt&quot; turns its focus away from the youths, it&apos;s hit-or-miss. Jean Smart is fine as Cera&apos;s aloof mother, but the character itself is one-dimensional and strangely conventional for such a nonconformist movie. Steve Buscemi is fine as the father, but he&apos;s not given much to do. The standouts among the supporting players include Fred Willard as an immigrant-phile, Justin Long as Sheeni&apos;s stoner brother, Mary Kay Place as Sheeni&apos;s Bible-wielding mother, and the two unknowns who portray Nick&apos;s friends, Lefty and BJ.\n\nAside from a couple of intentionally quirky animated sequences and one or two clichéd stock characters, &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; plays by its own rules, and it wins marvelously.",

      "reviewBody": "To understand this movie requires background that Keiji Muto is not an actor, but a world famous wrestler. It is basically a stunt, and why so many scenes are basically the premise: what if this wrestler is doing things. You can almost hear them laughing behind the camera at his antics. When I learned who this guy is, I liked the movie a lot more.\n\nIt is both Somai&apos;s most baffling film and his most surreal vision. Another way to understand it is the neo-noir drifter genre; in American films, from The Man with No Name trilogy, to Rambo, or in Japanese films, the Samurai films.\n\nHe is a mountain man who enters Tokyo mixing up in the criminal underworld. The film calls him King Kong. We constantly see him in the context of buildings. He is always manhandling people left and right. Kids tug at hum, pull him, kick him. He grabs women asking to marry, and their reactions are genuine, they do not know they&apos;re being filmed.\n\nThose scenes breaking the fourth wall are completely fascinating. Not only do the extras look right at the camera but it is framed in a way where we are forced to look at the extra reacting, smiling, watching the filming during those long takes. Somehow it doesn&apos;t effect the illusion whatsoever. It seems to excite the performers too. I think the extras breaking the fourth wall reflect its themes about a character who does not belong so is constantly stared at, laughed at, gawked at. I have never seen that before in a film. It is Somai&apos;s inner cinema anarchist tendency we see a lot in PP Rider.\n\nHis movie is comically shallow, but it&apos;s honest. This is how his counterpoint is this opera singer. The woman version of a barebones mountain man is going to be: sensitive, artistic, graceful opera singer. Where do we see this? In Popeye the Sailor Man. This level and frequency this film operates in is really like a ten year old wrote this.\n\nThe point when he shaves it is a striking transformation. Suddenly I totally understood the movie on a gut level. Now the mountain man means business.\n\nBefore then, the scene he returns to nature and lives as a mountain man again. The hero returning to nature to ready himself for the final battle, this is a fundamental story beat in the heroes journey. The movie, like him, takes detours into odd tangents, but never lies.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Somai is that he gets these actors, usually actresses, and gives them the floor. People who dream of being in films want to be understood by the camera like in his films. He always leaves nothing left of them, while creating some kind of monument to them. At the end, I am left with a hundred questions, but surrender this movie is a gift. The guy, he is loveable, the movie could not exist without him. It is a big and glorious vision that is rough around the edges, you can nitpick it to death, or surrender to the greatness.",

      "reviewBody": "In movie history we have many different styles of movies. Action, adventure, mystery, suspense, and of course children&apos;s films. Sadly, Andy and the Airwave Rangers is neither of these. What genre is Andy and the Airwave Rangers? The genre is known simply as &quot;horrible&quot;.\n\nThis has to be the worst movie I&apos;ve ever seen. First of all, the story is about a kid who watches a magic HVS tape and then sets off on an adventure to something called the &quot;colordome&quot; to save someone, or something. Then all hell breaks loose and he&apos;s forced to team up with people from different movies and ages, like warriors and princesses and whatnot.\n\nThe funny thing about this movie, though, is the weird cinematography and sets. In one scene, we see a high quality set, Andy is hiding out on a starship. The film quality is good and we can see the characters, except for Andy&apos;s actual face. It&apos;s always darkened by shadows and whatnot. Then when we cut to close-ups of Andy&apos;s face, we are in a big, extremely fake looking set with a whole different video quality, with Andy sitting behind one metallic prop, with an orange light in the background to make it seem &quot;starshipp-y&quot;. It&apos;s almost as if the original Andy didn&apos;t want to be in the film, and many close-up scenes were re-shot with another person playing Andy.\n\nBesides that, there&apos;s not much to this movie. Don&apos;t show it to your children, lest they kill themselves. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID.",

Each performer gets to play in the same set in 54th street in Manhattan (hence the name) but with different colors reflecting the personality of the group or individual.\n\nThe common thread between all acts is that the music and performance is front and center, any context or description given are just a plus and the viewer is left alone to enjoy the virtuosos at work.\n\nIt&apos;s inevitable to pick favorites among all acts, for me Michel Camilo&apos;s dexterity, timing and taste are top.",

The English translation is way above par for the era.\n\nThe DVD I purchased contained no credits, or any sort of menu at all. The editing is very shaky at times, but I&apos;m sure the equipment in those days was very difficult to use. It appears that this movie could have been filmed anywhere, as there are only a select few scenes that actually show famous places in San Fransisco.\n\nThis movie is a must see for any martial arts fan.",

      "reviewBody": "A horrible film. Simply horrible. Much worse than might be expected of a cast, most of whom have at least played a few really good roles in their lives. My expectations weren&apos;t particularly high, and I definitely didn&apos;t expect a masterpiece; but even truckloads of popcorn can&apos;t turn this movie into something remotely entertaining. I did my very best to follow the story somehow, in spite of its (to put it gently) fragmentary beginning. After that, however, all sense is lost completely, until nobody knows anymore who is chasing whom and what for. Utter chaos. The animated sequences that somehow manage to amuse in the beginning, become irritating soon. I have a strong impression that the director of this movie tries to imitate Oliver Stone&apos;s manners, but whereas Stone uses them as a means to convey something, in this case it&apos;s nothing but tricks. Add a few misplaced comic sequences to the mix, lots of action sequences that would have worked if we knew at least what they are about, and there you have it. It looks like they tried damned hard to conceal a lack of budget and a lack of script, but failed on both accounts. Expect for the title song, which is sort of funny, the songs aren&apos;t worth mentioning either. The background score is better, in my opinion. As for the acting: \n\nAjay: not bad, but nothing particularly good either.\n\nZayed: how is it possible that this actor keeps on playing in movies, despite an obvious lack of talent? \n\nRitesh: a nice role and well performed. The most bearable part in the whole movie, if you ask me.\n\nSunil: completely colorless, which is a pity, because he&apos;s too good an actor for this type of junk. \n\nEsha: never liked her until I saw &quot;Darling&quot;; not too bad in this movie, I&apos;d say. \n\nDiya: hard to say. I like her, but I don&apos;t know why myself. \n\nShamita: it took me a while before I was sure this wasn&apos;t Shilpa, but Shilpa&apos;s younger sister. They are very similar to each other, in the same way as Kareena and Karisma are. Not so bad either.",

      "reviewBody": "The book that this movie is based was one of the biggest best-sellers of the 1960&apos;s by the author of &quot;The Great Imposter&quot; (also adapted into a movie starring Tony Curtis). The book was hailed by one critic as giving a sense hope in a crazy world. And that&apos;s what this story is about, a kind of modern David and Golliath. Or maybe the town-drunkard-turned-mayor versus Nazi Germany. \n\nThe village of Santa Vittoria is no Rome. It&apos;s just a small town in Italy where the townspeople live very simple lives. They would be almost destitute except for one small commodity they all share: the town makes and exports wonderful wine to all parts of the world. They may not make as much as Mondavi, but it&apos;s a good living. Now, it&apos;s War World II, and the Germans have infiltrated the town. Not because they love the small-town folk of Santa Vittoria and want to protect them. They want their world-famous wine to help finance the war. But of course, the townspeople are dependent upon the wine for their livelihoods. So Anthony Quinn, perfectly cast as the town drunkard who ends up mayor, comes up with a plan. They give the Germans some of the wine and insist that they have given all the town possesses. \n\nHardy Kruger as the German officer in charge of the operation is unconvinced. They seemed too happy and too willing to give up their wine. He knows the townspeople are hiding more wine, and he will use all means at his disposal to retrieve every last bottle. The cat and mouse game is on! Can a bunch of simple-folk led by their clownish mayor in rural Italy outwit the likes of the German army? I vastly underrated movie that is mostly hilarious from beginning until end. There are a couple of references to torture but mostly it is quite a fun plot. Will Anthony Quinn and the town through sheer determination wear down the stubbornness of Hardy Kruger and the Germans, who seem absolutely relentless in their conviction that more wine exists? And now out on DVD!\n\nPlease vote for this movie on sites that have influence on DVD releases to get this movie available!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Silenced...&quot; as the title suggests, is a powerful film about a mute and deaf school in Gwangju (South Korea).\n\nIn 2005 Kang In-ho arrives at a school where children are deaf, but quickly realizes that something is wrong, as children were cloistered in a kind of autism. The reason is simple; they are suffering from pain through twin-principals and other teachers. Kang In-ho, first was blind towards the horrible acts, however, he wakes up very quickly and puts his life in the background to devote him entirely to these children in the deepest distress.\n\nWritten and directed by filmmaker Dong-hyuk Hwang, who runs his second coil after My Father (2007), based on the novel by Jee-young Cong taking Novel in one hand and camera in the other, Hwang Dong-hyuk takes us into a hell where cruelty is watchword. Men who abuse children are already a disgrace, but when equipped with a handicap that prevents them to express them while we pass this stage to speak only to be demonic. Moreover, work is in addition to killing these demons, exposing South Korea where levels of justice are rotten to the point that despite overwhelming evidence, everyone comes out innocent or at worst a slight slap on the wrist. Such injustice deserved to talk about it, and if the literature does not always express them on a large scale, the cinema can more easily, and in 2011 the film has been a blow, pushing the government to close the school and start a new trial.\n\nHwang Dong-hyuk, who directs his cast with strength and power, conveys a strong message with an eye opener. We can feel the players involved, everyone is in the place and nobody is ever too much, especially children, crying for truth, despite their silence, but the look says a lot about the work of management. No melodramatic pathos, not only the accuracy enhanced by fluid narration and exciting, equally divided between face to face with the horror and the trial, or rather mock trial. The director also quite unsettling talent to film scenes touching, working the image at the point of giving an atmosphere of morbid poetry returning the stomach (although almost everything is hidden), to the Unlike scenes about bullying that they go into bestiality at the lowest.\n\nSilenced is a work that takes you to the gut, but also a masterpiece at all levels, sad, very sad, because during filming (like writing a book) hopelessness was most certainly in the spirit all, nobody is expecting that the film can shake rotten legal foundation at this point to the bone. The arrival of this film is welcome, but it remains a work paradoxically awful cinematic should play a social role, rape, torture, and death stories of children who have so far had very little impact. We think Hwang Dong-hyuk has done considerable work, but we also think these children whose childhood or life, were stolen. \n\nThe story is very centered and never leaves its intention, as I said earlier it is based on the true story, we can feel the sufferings of the characters.\n\nThis is a take on the human with animal instinct and the actions will shake the base of humanity.\n\nRecommended to everyone who can digest the kinky truth.\n\n9/10",

      "reviewBody": "The film makers of this documentary take the viewer into areas that would have been off limits to anyone wanting to explore the life of the children of some Calcutta prostitutes. About ten children are showcased in the film as one of the directors of the documentary, Zana Briski, involves the children in something positive as she teaches them how to use the camera in capturing the world around them.\n\nIn gaining the children&apos;s confidence, they, in turn, tell us about how they see life in that hostile environment. Most of the girls shown in the film would probably end up in the same situation their mothers went through, as it appears life for them is a vicious circle in which there is no escape. For the boys, in spite of the natural talent shown as they take pictures, the mean streets of Calcutta don&apos;t promise much either.\n\nAs a documentary, Ms. Briski and Mr. Kauffman, show us how they were able to give the children a different way to look at life, but one wonders what has happened after they finished their work. Are these young girls and boys better off because this experience, or did they go back to the only way of life they knew about?\n\n&quot;Born into Brothels&quot; is a sad commentary on our society at large, because where there is poverty, as it&apos;s the case in Calcutta, women will resort into the kind of life where they can get by without any education or skills. These women are actually the victims of a system that penalizes them for just being in the wrong place, at the wrong time.\n\nLet&apos;s hope Ms. Briski and Mr. Kaufamn were able to instill in these young girls and boys the idea of looking for something better in their lives if they escape the poor surroundings in which they were born into.",

Col. Langdon (Brian Keith), carried on almost openly\n\nLeonora gives aperture to her forcefulness and vigor in a passion for horses and riding She is attached to a handsome white horse she calls Firebird and she provokes her husband by telling him that the animal is indeed a stallion with the emotional nature of man...\n\nLeonora&apos;s husband (Marlon Brando) is a devious, insecure, impotent Army major, a hidden homosexual preoccupied with an unsociable, lonely rider who canters around the field in the nude and whose sexual emotional stress is diminished, secretively, at the bedside of the major&apos;s wife holding her clothes and looking fixedly at her marvelous hot body\n\nPrivate Williams (Robert Forster) is another lonely man fascinated by the fiery Leonora and her thoughtful and gentle comments to him He takes to visiting the Penderton house at night looking attentively in the windows, observing with total recall and complete joy Leonora&apos;s nakedness, but also watching the Major in his study \n\nKeith&apos;s neurotic wife (Julie Harris) is well aware of her husband&apos;s affair with Leonora but she only feels well from her close friendship with her houseboy, Anacleto (Zorro David), an affected companion who shares her penchant for the arts and is in every way the opposite of her abrupt, strong husband \n\nFlavored with bitter insinuations and insulting sarcasms, Brando and Taylor&apos;s few scenes have enough flames to burn the silver screen He&apos;s a tormented human being while she&apos;s delicious but shrill and insensitive Aware of her physical beauty she fights back when she&apos;s rejected, instigating him with her impudent, insolent, shameless manner that offend his very being",

      "reviewBody": "What a lovely biopic. I had barely heard of Selena when she was killed, and I&apos;m no fan of Tejano music. But this picture was a wonderful tribute to the young talent. The movie is a celebration of her life, rather than fixating on her death, as one would expect with her family so involved (controlling) with the film. This approach also just felt right. I&apos;m sure that Hollywood, if it had had its way, would have sensationalized this aspect to the max. I don&apos;t know how much of the film is factual, and how much is apocryphal. A local reviewer wrote that a true biography of Selena would have to wait a few years, and be done without a Quintanilla looking over both shoulders.\n\n All I can do is rave about Jennifer Lopez. Her beauty, her talent, her sheer magnetism flows right out of the screen. She was amazing. Since her biography subject died so young, she was able to avoid the problems, inherent in the genre, of trying to age the actress to match the aging of the subject. Constance Marie, who I&apos;m not familiar with, was quite good as Selena&apos;s mother, although she did have to deal with the question of appearing to age 15 years. Every cast member seemed right for their part, and everyone did very well. The film seemed well-directed, in that I never thought about the director at any time during the film.\n\n Overall, the movie was very sweet, with obvious tragic overtones. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Tender Dracula (1974) \n\n* 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nWeird French mix of horror and comedy has two screenwriters and their girlfriends going to the home of a retiring horror actor (Peter Cushing) who played Dracula countless times in his career. It doesn&apos;t take long for the guests to wonder if he was playing Dracula or if he&apos;s the real thing. Well, I&apos;m really not sure what to say about this film other than it&apos;s quite rare and that&apos;s a good thing. While the film isn&apos;t nearly as horrible as it&apos;s reputation, the entire thing is quite bizarre to say the least and in the end it comes off like an Abbott and Costello film with a lot of nudity and sex jokes. I do wonder if the filmmakers had Abbott and Costello in mind because I couldn&apos;t help but think of some of their monster mash movies and of course it&apos;s quite fitting that they&apos;ve got Peter Cushing here playing the &quot;Dracula&quot; character. The film pretty much has the two writers and their two hot girlfriends running around and encounters countless bizarre things. This includes Cushing but we&apos;ve also got blood in the bathtub and various other strange things throughout the castle. One running joke involves the horror star wanting to do romantic movies but it&apos;s not all that funny. In fact, most of the comedy here just doesn&apos;t work because the direction is simply all over the place and if you check out Pierre Grunstein&apos;s credits you&apos;ll notice this was the first and last time he worked the director&apos;s chair. To say the film is uneven would be an insult to the word uneven. You really can&apos;t tell what exactly they were going for because the pacing is off but there&apos;s also issues with the screenplay. The script simply goes on and on at times and you just sit there wondering what the whole point is. Even worse is that the horror elements really don&apos;t work either but I must say that you do get a good performance from Cushing who is at least energized and appears to be having fun. The supporting players really aren&apos;t all that memorable, although there is plenty of nudity with the two female leads. TENDER Dracula has pretty much been forgotten and there&apos;s really no reason for anyone to re-discover it."

I would have to say that this film is not my favourite so far and leaves you feeling that some vital parts of the book are missing. However this is worth watching and I feel this will only disappoint the most hardcore Harry fans! \n\nWith all of the films you can notice that the acting is improving with the maturity of the characters. You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint. \n\nIn all a great family film, a pleasure to watch and I would recommend this film to most people. I am glad that the final film will be split into two parts, to be honest they could have done it with this film! \n\n*** For people who have never seen any of the films or read the books I took my friend with me who has not seen or read any of the books and he was completely lost throughout the film (Although he still enjoyed it!). If you wish to see this I would recommend you need to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix first. Otherwise you may find this film a little confusing.",

      "reviewBody": "(There Are Spoilers) Inept yet very unintentionally funny police drama about a big time mobsters son who instead working as a top man and white collar executive in the family business gets hooked up with a bunch of local bank robbers and ended up being shot to pieces after an half hour shoot-out and car chase that destroyed half of downtown L.A.\n\nBig time mob boss Vincent Sloan gets the bad news on the TV that his hot-headed and crazy son Marcus was gunned down after the biggest shootout in L.A history that also cost the lives of four of his co-bank robbers pals. \n\nFinding out the names of the five policemen who did in poor Marcus the Sloan Mob rubs out within two days four of them leaving only the cop who actually put Marcus in the city morgue Det. Ray Morgan as the only surviving Marcus shooter. \n\nTracking Det. Morgan with the help of the police brass, who are really working with the Sloan Mob, the gangsters end up killing Morgans wife and two children after shoving his van with them down a cliff, Det. Morgan though badly hurt survived. Being placed at Father Navarras Holy Innocence Missonery outside L.A by his partner Det. Cassidy, in order not to have the corrupt cops tip off the Sloan Mob where he is. Ray slowly recovers and then takes on the entire Sloan Mob. \n\nRidicules story thats so bad that it&apos;s funny with Morgan in a number of incredible car chases and shoot-outs, that look like they were done without the use of computer photography enhancement, that make up for the terrible acting and unbelievable storyline with Morgan seeming to pop up and disappear out of and into thin air in many of the scenes he&apos;s in. There&apos;s a number of shoot-out where the bad guys are shooting round after round straight at Morgan, who in many cases is no more the ten feet away from them, but never could hit him. It&apos;s as if he has an invisible force field around him. \n\nTaking out most of the Sloan Mob and two of his sons, Andrew and Devon, Morgan has it out with the remaining mobster at their drug/coke factory outside the city at the end of the movie. Knocking off almost half of the mobsters at the factory before the top hoods even know that he&apos;s there Morgan blasts and kicks away at the remaining mobsters, as well as their police cohorts. Turuing both mob chieftain Vincent Sloan and his remaining son Nicky into toast and grill cheese by the time the film is over. \n\nThe crooked cops working for the Sloan Mob are so bad and ineffective that they only help Morgan in putting the Slone&apos;s mobsters, as well as themselves, out of business. Gary Daniels as Det. Ray Morgan is very good in the action sequences but when it calls for him to show any feelings or emotions he comes across looking has if he&apos;s having a very severe attack of gastro-enteritis. \n\nWhat I think was the acting highlight of the movie was that of the hysterical and uncontrollable Robin Curtis playing mobster Vincent Sloane wife Julie. Curtis was so corny and off-the-wall in her scenes where she screamed shirked and pleaded, very unconvincingly, for Vince to get out of the crime business that her actions looked like they came straight out of the Madonna &amp; Brittany Spear school of bad acting.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I just saw this movie and I started thinking that may be I have seen too much Asian horror because I just had one good jump of fear while watching this film. Even when I have to say that this is the most &quot;frightening&quot; scary-dolls movie I have seen, I have to say as well that, as an Asian film I was expecting more tension and good psychological horror. It actually only contents a little dose. It has more gore than I expected and that I&apos;m used to (regarding to Asian&apos;s movies). Besides, at some point it gets quite predictable, the climax is loose, and a pair of special effects are cheesy. On the other hand the acting was really good, the atmosphere was well studied, because,I mean, the dolls were amazingly creepy and well located. The plot is not bad, it&apos;s well justified, but I realized that this is an Asian movie with a north American horror style and that&apos;s what I didn&apos;t like of it. No offense. Anyway... at this moment I&apos;m wondering if to get rid or not of my old Barbie doll that I keep in my wardrobe. May be she can get upset. :D",

      "reviewBody": "I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS:TMOB poster autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film &quot;camp&quot;. Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio &quot;knew best&quot; and how &quot;no one will take such a film seriously&quot;. I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got.\n\nThe flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing &apos;camp&apos; was the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.\n\nSTAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal&apos;s death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it hadn&apos;t been for the flacks.\n\nTear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.\n\nBut destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.\n\nDoc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.\n\nSIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it&apos;s a lot more serious. Yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors. And, yes, there _is_ a one-sheet of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol. Ely&apos;s wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words &quot;DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL...Coming Next Summer!&quot; POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are. At the time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants, and carrying Paramount portfolios.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1985, Vabank 2 was made, and to what high expectation! And it was worth waiting, since the sequel is none the worse. All the familiar guys and gals are here. Evil Kramer runs away from prison with the help of the hilarious crook Sztyc, Kwinto is threatened to be murdered, and the tight spiral of adventures begins anew. Here we see all the brilliant cast  Jan Machulski, Beata Tyszkiewicz, Leonard Pietrazak and many many others. They play with such evident infectious pleasure that you simple cannot breathe out during the film. All is here  kidnapping, murder, fire in the garage, terrible revenge of Kramer, and the extremely interesting intrigue about Kwinto&apos;s death. You cannot say for sure if he was really killed or not. Humor is everywhere here  smart lines of each actor, impossibly funny part of the prison director, as well as of masqueraded Nazi officers. Up to the end, you cannot guess what the final may be like. And the only sad part here is that you may see those Nazis and feel that very very soon the real fascist armies will take the whole Poland This film is so clever and bright that it may be praised as one of the all-time-best sequels ever made, along with Matrix 2 or Star Wars. Highly recommended for the connoisseurs of intelligent humor and cleverly thought over plot.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a shame that this movie can&apos;t be shown in high schools, as an educational video. It would certainly serve a terrific purpose, of how one small mistake can change the rest of your life forever.\n\nBeverly (Barrymore), at fifteen, falls in love with the quarterback of the football team. She decides one night at a party to show her love to him, by presenting him with a poem, she&apos;s written for him. Unfortunately, being as naive as she is, she presents it to him, in front of all of his friends, where she is then made fun of. Feeling sorry for herself, and very hurt, she runs upstairs to the bathroom, in the house where the party is taking place, crying. There, she meets the man she will soon fall for, and give herself to, for the very first time. However, this boy is not the boy she wants to marry, but is forced to, by her parents, because she is now pregnant. At fifteen, and married, she is now faced with a new life, and new responsibilities. The movie circles around this new life, and how she is able to overcome so much, with so very little. Her deadbeat husband, small and poor home, young child to raise, and at time hopeless future, all gang up on her, while she tries to overcome all of it. Her dreams are not unrealistic, but rather unreachable because of all the problems and mishaps that happen throughout the next fifteen years of her life.\n\nIt&apos;s poignant, sweet, funny and honest. There is not one person who will watch this, and not relate to at least one thing from the story. Although it may take place in the 1960s-80s, it&apos;s still very true to life, and understandable.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone, and hope that everyone will see the power of a message this film holds. It&apos;s really an amazing true story, and there aren&apos;t many like this out there.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Seventh Chamber&quot; is one of those rare, tiny, indie films that you run into by accident and because its modest budget or unique subject matter never really gets the recognition it deserves. I came to know it because I&apos;ve been an avid admirer of Edith Stein or (as she was known in religious life and the Catholic Church) St. Benedicta of the Cross. It was made via Italy and Hungary and is dubbed in Italian (a minor flaw). It tells the later part of this famous German Jewish philosopher&apos;s life. It concentrates particularly on her conversion to Catholicism and her consequent entrance into the Carmel (a strict, cloistered convent of the Carmelite nuns). These incredibly important decisions made some monumental changes in her life, such as her life-long rift from her beloved mother and the rest of her, very traditional Jewish family. Where she shined as a philosopher, teacher and lecturer, she was failing in her humble duties as a new nun. She was already in her forties when she entered the convent and had to carry on various domestic, physically demanding duties, normally intended for young girls usually entering the order. Feeling isolated, tired, old, lonely and heartbroken over losing her mother, she persevered in her calling. What initially started as a background story, in the second part of the film is masterfully pushed into the foreground: the Hitler party taking over the Germany and the eventual persecution of the Jews. Edith, now in the convent, is still very much aware (and terrified) of this growing hatred and the rising atrocities that will forever change her life. Maia Morgenstern (Mary from Gibson&apos;s &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;) plays Edith in a bravura, tour De force performance that you&apos;ll never forget. But, the real strength of this film is its vision. It was filmed in a slightly abstract way, not necessary following linear story-telling. Also, while historically accurate, it chose to develop its own style by a &apos;free interpretation&apos; of Edith&apos;s experience. Sometimes this can hurt the film on account of &apos;artistic license&apos;. Not here. It respects the facts but by zeroing in on Stein&apos;s possible interpretations, some of them coming from her own writings, and some not. This gives the story a considerable edge and is, simply, staggering in emotions. It is not an easy experience to watch and it is not entertaining in a traditional sense. It was not meant to be, however. The story of this individual, similar in fate to all Jews in WWII Europe, is a heavy, heartbreaking account, no matter what the circumstances. That, in fact, is the story of the film, more than being a narrative biography of a person. Once you see it that way, it will take a life of its own and you will be completely immersed in it and not likely to forget it soon. The films this bold and unique are not being often made. It was never picked up by the Hollywood for its difficult subject matter (the protagonist is a nun) and that&apos;s good because it retained its originality and vision. &quot;The Seventh Chamber/ Room&quot; will touch the deep corners of your heart and psyche, making it a truly powerful, important and simply unforgettable viewing experience.",

He&apos;s so positive and uplifting about every aspect of the miniseries, that it&apos;s really refreshing and enjoyable to watch. He even tears up recalling parts that meant a great deal to him. If he&apos;s embellishing the experience, it&apos;s still appreciated. I hate it when actors don&apos;t show up, or are sarcastic during interviews. I think they should have more respect for the process they agreed to.\n\nI had heard Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown married in real life, so it was fun to see them together, and executive producer David L. Wolper shares some interesting behind the scenes stories. Check it out on the DVD!",

      "name": "Twenty floating heads can&apos;t make you laugh but a couple of actors can grab your heart",
      "reviewBody": "I was expecting to come away with a sassy name for this new genre, the Hollywood-ensemble rom-com, but there was nothing clever to provide any inspiration in &quot;What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting&quot;. The best line that I have heard to describe this comes from a fellow IMDb user, gregeichelberger, &quot;It&apos;s &quot;New Year&apos;s Eve&quot; in the neo-natal unit; &quot;Valentine&apos;s Day&quot; with a uterus; &quot;Knocked Up&quot; times five.&quot; That sums up the whole thing perfectly.\n\nThe Hollywood ensemble is this frustrating trend to load the movie with as many stars as possible, so you have only floating heads and no actual characters. Surprisingly, one of the worst offenders is the similarly-themed indie dramedy &quot;Conception&quot; (2010) where we get to follow 9 (yes, 9!) different couples. This movie isn&apos;t as bad, there are only 5 main couples.\n\nThe intertwining of them is very limited. The four other girls basically all watch Jules (Cameron Diaz) on her reality TV shows. The timing, on the other hand, is all in sync. They get pregnant at the same time, start showing at the same time, and give birth at the same time. The point is of course that you don&apos;t know what to expect since each girl&apos;s pregnancy is different and experiences it differently.\n\nJules is going to control it – whether her partner tags along or not; Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is going to lie her way through adoption if that&apos;s what it takes; Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) wants the joy but gets the worst; Skyler (Brooklyn Decker) is going to make it perfect, just like herself; Rosie (Anna Kendrick) doesn&apos;t know what she&apos;s going to do. If the movie had left it at that, it would have been cute, romantic, funny and heartfelt, and possibly empowering.\n\nBut then they introduced &quot;the dude pack&quot; which is even worse than it sounds. They are a group of fathers, led by Chris Rock, who are given the stupidest sounding lines to try and make funny. It was painful how unfunny it was. Imagine if you will, a Hollywood writer being paid to come up with never-before-said lines to turn into popular catch-phrases. The way &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; was almost successful (but ultimately not) with Sudeikis&apos; &quot;I would like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states&quot;. That was exactly the case with the &quot;comedy&quot; in this movie. All of their lines were met with a few unimpressed question marks on faces but never any laughs.\n\nHowever, the mothers-to-be were pretty good. Some were on the boring side, but two were able to deliver enough humour and heart to almost make up for the entirety of &quot;What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting&quot;. I don&apos;t know what it is about Anna Kendrick but she makes my heart melt every time she&apos;s on the screen. Extremely cute, in a relatable kind of way, and able to hold our hearts, she was the one that got us through this movie. Elizabeth Banks was able to go as over-the-top as only pregnant movie heroines are allowed to and gave it her all to deliver the comedy of what not to expect. Of course, it wasn&apos;t quite enough because we do know exactly what to expect.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m surprised at the opening negative reviews this film is receiving on the board. The suggestion this film is the worse Sayles had to offer gives his last couple films a better rating than they deserve -- the baby adoption one seemed unfinished and the one with the Florida (?) resort building was a bit bland to say the least. It is quite true that Silver City does not meet the standards of &quot;Lone Star&quot; and other great Sayles films -- he has gone into a bit of a slump. Still, this film suggests we might hope he is climbing out of it.\n\nThe film still seems more about sending messages than entertaining. The obvious Dubya clone is too broad, and we don&apos;t we see how he ticks. Richard Dreyfuss is great as the campaign director, though he too doesn&apos;t really get another screen time. Still, on the whole, there is a lot to offer, especially the sense of place (though some of the mountains look like fake background). Sayles also offers some great supporting characters, as always. Daryl Hannah must be underlined here; she is quite a find -- who knew?\n\nLiking the film, I guess, depends on liking the former news reporter given the role to investigate an embarrassing find. I enjoyed Danny Huston&apos;s character and found his investigations handled well. The caterer/chef he hires to help him out also gives a nice performance as does Huston&apos;s ex-g/f, the reporter. As do others they both meet along the way. For instance, the scenes involving an investigative website and rightwing talk show host were enjoyable.\n\nThe film ends on a realistic note that is refreshing. It tells a story, stories actually, while preaching its message. And, some of the &quot;bad guys&quot; (including Kris Kristofferson) are not portrayed as evil slimebags or anything, adding a sense of fairness to the whole thing.\n\nA flawed movie that remains an enjoyable movie for mature moviegoers."

James Caan is perfectly cast as Frank, and throughout the film he holds the weight of his performance up as if it were only five pounds, portraying Frank as tough, fearless and thick skinned. But in the diner, as well as in his interactions with Okla (played by Willie Nelson!!!) he is able to open us up to more. The photo Frank has in his wallet is a very strange yet alluring glimpse inside his mind and his heart that he would not otherwise show. Tuesday Weld&apos;s reactions as Jessie also help show us how he is slowly winning her over not just by being aggressive, but by showing vulnerability. From then on, I knew the film had established itself as a great one, as I now clearly understood Frank&apos;s true motivations. It proved to me that the film is just as much a character study than is a heist and gangster film. And boy, does it deliver on both fronts.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Santo Contra Capulina&quot; (&quot;Saint Vs. Capulina&quot;) is an incredibly silly movie and is worth about 3 on the &apos;ol quality scale. However, just because a movie is bad does NOT mean it&apos;s not enjoyable. Like all the Santo films, it&apos;s incredibly silly, packed full of problems with the plot and not anyone&apos;s idea of sophisticated entertainment. After all, these are the supposed real life adventures of a masked luchador who NEVER takes off the mask--fighting the forces of evil while wearing a mask and a snazzy sport coat! But, I have never seen a Santo film that was boring--and this one is certainly entertaining.\n\nBefore I go on, I should mention that I had never seen the comic Capulina before I saw this film. Although I know he&apos;s beloved in his native Mexico, as a non-Mexican, I have no such love or nostalgia watching him and assume his humor is something that grows on you...like, perhaps, mold. I thought he wasn&apos;t very funny, though seeing this broad comic helping Santo fight crime--now that was pretty funny.\n\nCapulina is a totally incompetent night watchman. He mostly just sleeps on the job and it&apos;s not surprising that evil has chosen to invade the warehouse during his watch. However, although this should be easy pickings, Santo shows up and beats the crap out of the baddies. And, now he has somehow gotten a new friend--Capulina. This is strange, however, as &quot;Santo Contra Capulina&quot; translates to either &quot;Saint Versus Capulina&quot; or &quot;Saint Against Capulina&quot;--implying that they are fighting each other. The only time this almost happens is when there is an evil robotic duplicate Capulina fighting Santo--and I actually liked this part. The trick cinematography was excellent and it did make me chuckle...just a bit.\n\nAs for why all this is occurring, it&apos;s all the doing of an evil madman who is trying to replace people with robots AND smuggle diamonds. It&apos;s all rather strange but it IS a Santo film! I say the best thing to do is to try not to think--just enjoy the action, laugh at all the times the baddies have guns but drop them to fight with Santo and thrill to relatively fat wrestlers pummeling each other. \n\nBy the way, the other reviewer said that there were no wrestling scenes- -just fighting. Well, this isn&apos;t the case, as there is one small scene where Santo is in the ring with a robotic wrestler.",

      "reviewBody": "For a long time unavailable on DVD, this 2007 Tartan release finally addresses that, but is it worth it?\n\nLike most, I love classic Bergman and find anything else by him interesting, at the very least. Coming just after the heavy and emotionally draining making of his The Virgin Spring, in 1960, the DVD blurb tells us that the director needed to &apos;tell a joke&apos; - this resulting oddity revealing a waspish comedic streak from someone known as a deep, complex and often depressive writer and director.\n\nIt launched Bibbi Anderson, who would become Bergman&apos;s famous face in his massive hits Persona and Wild Strawberries. In The Devil&apos;s Eye, she plays the virgin Britt-Marie, daughter of a cleric. At age 20, the Devil has decided she&apos;s ripe for de-flowering, but she&apos;s promised to a boring but reliable older man. Taking the form of Don Juan, the infamous Lothario of legend, the devil attempts to seduce her. Who will win? Heaven, or Hell, or indeed, both?\n\nFrom the very outset, with its odd introduction and even odder harpsichord note, this one is set to be a comedy. It&apos;s very theatrical; caricatures and grotesques mix with the ordinary, mirrors and imaginative sets convey hell. Period detail rubs shoulders with 20th century Scandinavian domesticity. One can see many possible influences, all moulded in a vast cooking pot and quite a strange mixture is the result.\n\nI&apos;m sure one could look into it all a lot deeper than I did - one of the greatest things about Bergman is that most of his films can be watched at a differing angle and a whole new aspect is highlighted, helped enormously by his intelligent and often poetic dialogue. Watching late at night when concentration levels were ebbing, I took it as it was presented - amusing, satirical, with sexual references, a wit and with a big sparkle in this Devil&apos;s Eye.\n\nTo answer my question - yes, it is good, but oddly, so un-Bergman like (though some scenes in Fanny &amp; Alexander, for example, share this mischief) I wouldn&apos;t say that this film is essential Bergman. For those who want all he did, then yes, obviously and maybe those who want to know more about his inner psyche. Those expecting a more formal classic, might be well put-off, it&apos;s the sort of &apos;what the hell is this?&apos; that may well result in the &apos;stop&apos; button on the remote being pressed.\n\nThe transfer quality is excellent though the subtitles appear slightly smaller and more &apos;European&apos; than on other Tartan Bergman&apos;s I have.",

The final product is insulting, to say the least.\n\nThe creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.\n\nTo finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga&apos;s, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.\n\nIf you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don&apos;t skip it, then at least don&apos;t pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don&apos;t need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many.",

      "reviewBody": "William Malone didn&apos;t exactly deliver a good movie here. Far from, actually, but heck, it was his first one. Still, you&apos;ll have to tolerate some atrocious &apos;chop-chop&apos; editing, some bad acting and a plot way too basic for its own good. All the events in this film move at the pace of a snail that&apos;s stuck in the mud. The whole story is played by the book, and it&apos;s one with not many pages in it (just enough to write down the premise: a murderous creature is loose in the city and two people must stop it). Surprisingly, things do remain watchable most of the time, somehow. The creature design is pretty cool, but also nothing more than a man in a rubber suit. A bit of full frontal female nudity during the opening-scene and a lack of gore throughout the entire film is what we get. But my guess is that it&apos;s still worth a watch for lovers of obscure creature features (honestly, I myself didn&apos;t mind watching it). &quot;Scared To Death&quot; always seemed to me a bit of a stupid, unsuitable title for this kind of film though. Given the place where the creature resides, why not dub it... &quot;The Sewer Dweller&quot;? Malone&apos;s first outing even got some sort of a semi-(un)official sequel nine years later, called &quot;Syngenor&quot; (1990). Would have been much easier if they had called that one &quot;Syngenor 2&quot; and this one simply &quot;Syngenor&quot;. Aw, what the hell am I talking about.",

      "reviewBody": "Sir Laurence Olivier, Carol Lynley, Keir Dullea and Noel Coward star in &quot;Bunny Lake is Missing,&quot; a 1965 black and white British film directed by Otto Preminger.\n\nA young woman, Ann Lake (Lynley) and her brother Steven (Dullea) report the woman&apos;s little girl, nicknamed Bunny, missing when she can&apos;t be found at her school on her first day of class. The detective in charge, Supt. Newhouse (Olivier) soon finds out that Bunny&apos;s things are disappearing from the new apartment where she, her mother and uncle live, and Newhouse begins to wonder if Bunny ever existed at all.\n\nThis is a dark, atmospheric film that takes the viewer into an adult world where a child&apos;s fantasy life is explored and often accepted - the cofounder of the school on its top floor listening to children&apos;s dreams on tape as she writes a book about children&apos;s fantasies; the man who runs the doll hospital; and Ann herself, who had an imaginary friend as a child called Bunny, named after a character in a book.\n\nIs Bunny Lake missing? Was there ever a Bunny Lake? Is Steven trying to cover for his sister? &quot;Bunny Lake is Missing&quot; is very offbeat and will make you uneasy as you, along with Newhouse, try to figure out what&apos;s going on.\n\nThe acting is very good - Olivier obviously did this role for money - there is nothing particularly interesting about it, though he does a good job. The pretty Lynley gives an ambiguous performance - she&apos;s either a grieving mother, a nut, or both, and Dullea is equally ambiguous - does he know more than he says he does? Is he placating his sister?\n\nNoel Coward has a showy if small role as the Lake&apos;s landlord, a rather strange bird into S&amp;M who proudly shows one of the detectives the skull of the Marquis de Sade.\n\nThough not entirely satisfying, this is a great movie to see on a Sunday afternoon. It takes you right into the darkness of London and leaves you there as it travels through a child&apos;s strange world and comes out in illusion? Reality? Or madness?",

The movie talks upon the adventures and misfortunes of two no brain teenagers from the beginning their acquaintance , when Harry (Derek Richardson) and Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) meet themselves at high school . The picture narrates the various pranks , the mischiefs with schoolmates and teachers (Eugene Levy) . The respective parents (Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman) try to resolve the problems without success . They are idiot pals who are continuously doing jokes and seeing lustfully by the opposite sex . \n\nThe film mingles irony , chuckles , giggles , comedy and numerous sex jokes . And of course , there&apos;s very bad taste , being the extreme when happen the incredible scenes on the crap in the bathroom . The comedy is cheesy and gross-out but has some moments here and there . The film is an embarrassing and absurd mess , the plot is ridiculous and monotonous and is formed by several humor set pieces , being quite disagreeable and graceless . There are some steamy hot scenes and some memorable and hilarious happenings of dirty humor which will rejoice the rogue aficionados to these kinds of things . Neither the players , nor the filmmaking seem to be nice , and the storyline is utterly embarrassing , but , curiously , it has some amusing moments and I found myself laughing in some times of the movie . Eric Christian Olsen was repeatedly denied the role of Lloyd because the producers thought he was &quot;too good-looking&quot; . It was only after seeing some home-video footage of Eric in full make-up improvising a scene with already-cast Derek Richardson that they gave him the role . The cast secondary is pretty good , such as : Luis Guzmán , Rachel Nichols , Eugene Levy , William Lee Scott , Shia Labeouf , Bob Saget , Julia Duffy and Mimi Rogers . Lin Shaye was the only cast member to star in both the original Dumb and Dumber and the sequel . The motion picture takes part of the large group about filthy and dirty humor , such as : ¨Scary movie¨ , ¨American pie¨and sequels . The previous film (Dumb and dumber) is much better ; plus , there were Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey who are greatest actors , here the protagonists are unknown . Rating : It&apos;s a awful turkey . Disconcerting as well as inferior sequel and bottom of barrel . Yawner and snooze is continued.",

      "reviewBody": "Great old DeMille flick about the persecution of Christians in ancient Rome. The movie starts with Emperor Nero (Charles Laughton) laughing and playing music while Rome burns. When someone reminds him that the people might hold Nero responsible, he quickly decides to blame the unpopular believers of the new Christian religion. As Christians are being rounded up and killed, Roman prefect Marcus (Fredric March) falls in love with a Christian girl (Elissa Landi). This doesn&apos;t sit well with Empress Poppaea (Claudette Colbert), who&apos;s in love with Marcus, and she conspires to have the girl arrested.\n\nCharles Laughton gives an outrageously hammy performance and I loved every second of it. I wish he had been in the film a lot more. Fredric March is good, as always. Lovely Elissa Landi does an admirable job in probably her biggest role but she&apos;s eclipsed by Claudette Colbert. What this film is perhaps most famous for is the scene where Colbert takes a bath in donkey milk, in which we see quite a bit of what God gave Ms. Colbert to work with. She&apos;s a beautiful woman and it&apos;s a very sexy scene. The sets and costumes are great, as one expects from a Cecil B. DeMille picture. It&apos;s just a really good film, entertaining and dramatic, with some provocative bits of sex and violence that will surely please pre-Code fans. If for no other reason, see it for Colbert.",

Danny Devito did a wonderful job playing a teacher in the army.(a job he didn&apos;t ask for and is not looking forward to)He is brought in to teach these kids that everyone thinks are stupid. Every one of the characters left an impression in my mind. They all did a wonderful job at playing their roles.Each one of the student&apos;s are different and everyone knows someone in real life like each one of them. It is a little like dead poet&apos;s society but with more comedy and a more &quot;happy good feeling&quot; I am always in a GREAT mood at the end of this movie!",

However, I remember that I felt mesmerized by it&apos;s ambiance and that the ending declares important thoughts that are just as relevant today. We are missing the point. Just as it does not help in 1987 to build fallout shelters because they only cause other problems that are greater for the future, it does not help to feed and immunize millions of the world&apos;s poor today if we have no food for their children and grandchildren tomorrow. Technology and fairness cannot solve these problems today, just as fairness (letting everybody in) cannot work in a fallout shelter. Our Earth is a lifeboat, and there are only finite seats in any vessel. This is neither cruel nor selfish. It is a simple declaration of truth. The sooner our policies face the truth, the sooner the suffering will end.",

Solid, strong always with something interesting to tell, always looking for the truth... well almost, here Mr.Stone might sold his soul to &apos;Emperor&apos; Chavez, by celebrating all his speech and not dancing with wolves, but dancing with other puppets to honor Chavez. Here only President Lula and President Kirchner save the day and their dignity by advising Chavez, and Stone himself to put some limits. A pamphlet made to satisfy everyone who hates Fox News &amp; Cia. ... I also dislike them, but why using their same type of dark strategies, lies and misleading? Today Venezuela, Bolivia and others we are still struggling with a fake democracy. That&apos;s the best proof to see Mr.Stone was/is blinded with the epiphany. Maybe that&apos;s way 90% of the documentary is presenting everything as truth and nothing, but the truth. Where everyone who disagree with his Emperor is a bloody capitalist. Even myself I&apos;m might be getting in trouble for submitting this, but that&apos;s what they want from us, to be afraid, to live afraid... yes, the same way the Bush&apos;s want(ed) the world to be and control it. If Mr. Stone truly believe on his other films, about freedom and democracy, at least he should be ashamed of this one (and don&apos;t keep the change).",

      "name": "Solid counterpart to &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot; was released in 1968, 11 months after the hugely successful &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. Both films have similar plots and were based on real-life WWII units -- &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; was loosely based on the Filthy Thirteen and &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot; more tightly based on the 1st Special Service Force, AKA The Black Devils.\n\nTheir plots are similar in that they each involve a group of military delinquents being trained for a big mission and then the execution of that mission. They differ in that the 1st Special Service Force was comprised of both American and Canadian soldiers, rather than just Americans.\n\nAlthough &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot; is based more on fact it&apos;s still a very Hollywood-ized depiction of events. For instance, actual members of the unit objected to the way the film limits the groups warm relations with the locals of Helena, Montana, (the city nearest their training base) to a major brouhaha in a saloon.\n\nThe first half of the film takes place mostly at the dilapidated base near Helena, but was shot at a base in Lehi, Utah, which is a decent substitute since it&apos;s only 350 miles due south of Helena.\n\nGenerally speaking, &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, but that&apos;s only because the latter film is so great, plus it came first. Yet it has some aspects that are just as good in their own way and sometimes better. For instance, the final mission in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; involves the unit&apos;s raid on an opulent German château, which -- while good -- is hardly a typical WWII combat scenario; the final mission shown in &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot;, by contrast, involves the brigade&apos;s taking of a German stronghold atop a rocky mountain in Northern Italy, an excellent battle sequence.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s next to impossible to beat Lee Marvin as the commander of the unit in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, William Holden is very strong in the counterpart role in &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot;. However, he was too long-in-the-tooth for the part as the real commander of The Black Devils was much younger, but that&apos;s not a big deal.\n\nDespite the above criticisms of the saloon brawl, it is a highlight, as is the scene in the mess hall where a hand-to-hand combat trainer is introduced. It&apos;s an extremely well-staged sequence.\n\nClaude Akins is great as the ape-like Pvt. Rockman, but his hysterics at the death of his Canadian comrade in battle is overly melodramatic. As if he wasn&apos;t prepared for the likely death of a fellow soldier in battle.\n\nFINAL SAY: If you&apos;re in the mood for a late 60s war flick in the mode of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;The Devil&apos;s Brigade&quot; is a quality option.\n\nThe film runs 130 minutes and was shot in Utah &amp; Italy.\n\nGRADE: B",

      "reviewBody": "Having basically grown up with them, I admit to being a sucker for the cheesy sword-and-sorcery flicks of the early 1980s. However, this was one I had never heard of before coming across it – nor am I familiar with the work of its director, since he mostly dabbled in vulgar comediesthough I am sure some have nevertheless tried to build a cult around his resume&apos; in view of his surname being similar to that of a certain American film-maker! \n\nAnyway, this (originally intended as a sequel to Franco Prosperi&apos;s GUNAN, KING OF THE BARBARIAN released earlier that same year) is pretty much standard fare though marked by a couple of excesses that make it unintentionally hilarious. Upfront is the intermittent narration, which is so utterly downbeat and gravely-spoken to boot that I swear the speaker was on the verge of tears at times! The other is the sheer display of histrionics by the villain who frequently – and not always with good reason – takes to shouting out the hero&apos;s name at the top of his lungs; incidentally, his beef with him is merely because the latter has killed a number of his priests-cum-minions, thus thwarting an onslaught on a neighboring villageso I wanted to yell back at him: &quot;Get over it already&quot;! As usual, the protagonist is muscle-bound yet thoroughly bland: at the beginning of the film, he survives the obligatory extermination of a peaceful tribe; eventually, he leads the remaining members of the clan to a promised land (along the way to which, some have begun to despair and almost turn against him – sounds familiar?!); as if that were not sufficiently Biblical, the hero is named Sangraal which, literally, means &quot;Holy Grail&quot;! \n\nHe has a blonde girlfriend but soon also sets his sights on the daughter of the people he defended; conveniently, another assault sees the former killedwhich the hero is forced to watch from afar while strung up (crucified, get it?). Rather than start life anew with his other girl and make life easier for all of us, he determines to bring the dead woman back to life (yep, they keep coming!) and seeks out a hermit-like sage with the help of an Oriental archer who comes out of nowhere but subsequently breaks our balls by incessantly spouting Charlie Chan-type aphorisms! Pilfering yet another fashionable mystic source, the villain and his men worship a topless goddess who lives inside a fire a&apos; la SHE (just as bloodthirsty and constantly threatening her disciple when his every ruse to dispatch the hero inevitably fails!).\n\nLater on, the protagonist and his two companions are attacked by blind creatures that live in caves and sport webbed fingers – maybe their tatty &apos;costumes&apos; were borrowed from Sergio Martino&apos;s ISLAND OF THE FISHMEN (1979)? – before stumbling upon a secret weapon, an unwieldy arrow-shooting contraption that barely sees service thereafter! Eventually, hero and villain engage in a one-on-one by the sea, with the latter ending up impaled on his own dagger! Mind you, in spite of my disparaging remarks, one cannot really hate this type of juvenile (nudity and gore notwithstanding) fare too much – in fact, on the strength of this, I acquired two other minor efforts (albeit from American exponents) in this vein i.e. Jack Hill&apos;s SORCERESS (1982) and THE WARRIOR AND THE SORCERESS (1984), though I probably will not be getting to them just now...",

      "reviewBody": "War and Peace, to many, is synonymous with a colossus of a book. The ultimate door-stopper. It is among the most complex and epic works of literature ever written. In 19th century Moscow and St-Petersburg, youths grow, make their mistakes hearts are bound and then broken and then the great war against Napoleon tears all these lives apart. Leo Tolstoy created intimate portrayals, compelling characters and epic action, telling the story of an entire country and an entire era effortlessly and elegantly. So if books are often difficult to adapt, this one should be completely impossible (witness the shallow King Vidor adaptation).\n\nThis film is the stuff of legends. Reportedly one of the most expensive productions ever created, Sergei Bondarchuk&apos;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; benefited from the Red Army&apos;s involvement and the Soviet Government&apos;s financing, and clocks in at about 7 hours. It is as faithful to its source as could be imaginable. In fact, it almost transcends its source.\n\nAdmirably cast (the angelic Liudmila Savelieva is ideal as Natasha Rostova and the director was unbelievably wise in casting himself as Pierre Besukhov), elegantly transcribed into a witty screenplay and enacted with class and conviction by its immense cast, &quot;War and Peace&quot; is not just a good adaptation. Its merits as a film are colossal. The cinematography defies any other film, particularly during the battle scenes: rejecting the painterly staticism of Barry Lyndon and the simple charging and distant shots of older films, the violence in Sergei Bondarchuk&apos;s epic mirrors that of Kingdom of Heaven (2005!!!), as the camera flies over a never-ending battlefield at full speed, glides aver frantic canons and divisions, crashes into mêlées and follows haunting stampedes of riderless horsemen (a potent metaphor for how the great leaders of the time lost all control over the conflict&apos;s proportions). All this without a pixel of CGI in sight (and all the better for it as it presents shots that the eye would simply refuse to believe if generated by a computer) The epic battle of before the sack of Moscow is so colossal and devastating, that even Napoleon looks confused at how to feel before the ocean of corpses sprawled before him. This is the greatest display of cinematic warfare ever committed to the screen. That the calmer scenes manage to sustain that level of excellence is a testament to how grandiose an effort this film is. The display of repressed emotions and overt tenderness are heart-breaking and many episodic scenes stand out magnificently, such as the wolf hunt, the opening balls (easily rivaling anything in &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;) and the duel. This is a film to which the fantastic &quot;Dr Zhivago&quot; feels like a small appetizer Bondarchuk&apos;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; reaches beyond the book and in doing so successfully is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. It is cinematic poetry and entertainment of the highest order. And to sum things up in an overused  but never more appropriate than here  they&apos;ll never make&apos;em like this again.",

These shorts were developed as a test (and to practice animation) before the full-length film was in production. They used these as a sort of training before making the film.\n\nThese short clips were enjoyable and clever in their own right. However, they are not very memorable. The only one that seems to stick with me in any way or form is Wallace and Gromit playing tennis with some sort of automatic tennis player.\n\nDie-hard Wallace and Gromit fans and any fan of this technique of animation would enjoy these, but I would recommend the Wallace and Gromit shorts &apos;The Wrong Trousers&apos; and &apos;The Close Shave&apos; to anyone who hasn&apos;t seen Wallace and Gromit.",

McCarthy finds a mysterious comic book and reads cryptic ancient passages from the tome, which unleashed the titular Ghoulies upon the unwitting college students and staff. This entry in the series is sadly missing the stop motion Ghoulies of the first two films, but I did still enjoy the old school puppet effects. The film was also more broadly comedic, particularly in giving the Ghoulies voices so they could deliver cheesy horror themed one-liners. &quot;Ghoulies Go to College&quot; is nothing brilliant, but it makes to pretensions about what it is, so if you enjoy the horror sub genre of little things attacking large things (i.e. everything from &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; to &quot;Troll&quot; to &quot;Puppet Master&quot; to &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot;), which I am most certainly a fan of, you will likely enjoy the silliness of &quot;Ghoulies Go to College,&quot; which also feature the film debut of Matthew &quot;Scream&quot; Lillard, and supporting roles by Jason Scott Lee, Marcia Wallace, and Kane Hodder.",

Valentina is a fashion model (this is a giallo, after all) whose journalist boyfriend manages to talk her into taking an experimental LSD-like drug for the sake of a magazine article. He assures her she&apos;ll be wearing a mask and a doctor will administer the drug, but once she&apos;s high as a kite he takes the mask off and starts taking pictures of her. While she&apos;s ripped to the nines and well muntered, larging it the &apos;nth&apos; degree and chewing her cheeks, she also has some sort of vision where she sees a man punching a woman in the face over and over again with a spiked glove. \n\nThinking it was all part of the trip, the next day she gets sacked from her job and finds her face plastered all over her boyfriend&apos;s magazine. She also finds out the &apos;doctor&apos; was a doorman, goes mental, and throws a brick through her boyfriend&apos;s window. Then she starts seeing that killer around the place, and it seems that not only did she not hallucinate a murder, but the drug might have triggered a repressed memory of murder she may have witnessed six months before – and it gets even more complicated than that!\n\nWe know the killer right from the start, but we have no idea who he is, what he&apos;s up to, or why someone is in a loony bin for a murder he seemingly committed! Many other characters turn up to badger Valentino, and two very shifty gentlemen, including a knife throwing, giggling Luciano Rossi, roll into town for some reason too. The police are pretty much useless in this one, so can she turn to one of her two boyfriends for help? That&apos;s right, two, and one of them is a sculptor looking after two Japanese kids, for good measure.\n\nJust like Ercoli&apos;s previous film Death Walks on High Heels, this one is a bit too long, but the pay-off is well worth it! Just about every character that makes it to the end of the film ends up on the roof of an apartment block for a final fight/punch up/stabbing/gun fight, and this is where Ercoli finally unleashes the nastiness. One character even ends up splattered across the pavement with his brains lying next to his head and his cigarette holder poking through his face. Kinds of wakes you up a bit when that happens in a film.\n\nSo then, another good, solid, beautiful looking giallo from Ercoli. I can&apos;t wait to watch the next one: Open the Door, Get on the Floor, Death Walks the Dinosaur!",

      "reviewBody": "This was on Austrian TV some months ago. For people outside Austria, TV is often the only source to see Austria films. In addition this was produced for the domestic market, as everyone is speaking in their specific dialect, which means this is one of the charms of this film to me. It is not a &quot;sophisticated comedy&quot; though, but still one where language is one source of enjoyment. \n\nThe title gives away what this film is about. And as it is a comedy, the ending gives itself. So, a perpetual student has not reported the death of his grandmother and is still claiming her pension and attendance allowance. As someone from town hall wants to congratulate her on her 95th birthday, things become critical. The student wants to &quot;borrow&quot; a sedated person from a hospital, but as he elopes with a famous actress, a lot crazy situations ensue. \n\nYes, it is some kind of crazy comedy. The humor is often rather blunt, but they never fall into the trap of vulgar overacting. It might have helped to trim the film a bit, as some jokes are repetitive. I am also sure that this film definitely will lose in translation. Some characters seem to have stepped out from a Seidl flick. Watch it to ensure yourself Austria also has mainstream movies.",

      "reviewBody": "FW Murnau was a fantastic director, all his films being extremely well made, rich in atmosphere and thematically intriguing and even daring in a way that is still quite unique and ground-breaking. It is not hard to see why his films influenced a lot of major directors, why he was one of the best and most influential directors in his day and it is sad that he didn&apos;t make more films and that he died too young. Even his lesser work is still worth seeing if mainly for historical interest.\n\nLost for a long time but rediscovered and available in a not too bad print, &apos;Phantom&apos; is one of Murnau&apos;s minor films. It is nowhere near on the same level as &apos;Nosferatu&apos;, &apos;Faust&apos;, &apos;The Last Laugh&apos; and &apos;Sunrise&apos;, people will say that it is unfair to compare and that it should stand on his own. Which is fair enough, but it is hard not to when his best work is as brilliant as it is and when some other films are still worth watching but a little bland at the same time.\n\n&apos;Phantom&apos; is one of those cases. As said with a few others, the acting even for a silent film tends to be too theatrical and overdone. Was expecting more from Alfred Abel, good in other things but a bit miscast here. Not just in age but for my tastes he is too wild and comes over as borderline neurotic.\n\nThe story for &apos;Phantom&apos; is somewhat too slight for the running time, feeling like an over-stretched short film. Less intertitles and ones that didn&apos;t slow the film down too much and it being less flashback heavy would have helped a bit. Lorenz&apos;s descent felt too rushed and out of nowhere, needing a lot more time to progress, that way it would have been easier to root for him.\n\nHaving said all of that, &apos;Phantom&apos; is not a bad film despite how all of that sounds. It is beautifully directed by Murnau and as expected wonderfully made. Some very atmospheric and imaginative photography and quite transfixing imagery that allows one to provoke thought. Luckily doing so without being too heavy on it.\n\nAppreciated too its use of themes not explored a lot in films those days and would be considered quite bold to portray. Some of the acting comes over well, with a great performance from Grete Berger that genuinely unsettles.\n\nSumming up, worth uncovering but far from a Murnau essential. 6/10",

That was easy, since the trailer for the film points in that direction entirely.\n\nWhat I didn&apos;t expect was a thoroughly entrancing inside view of the Victorian theatre.  Not to mention comprehensive.  Everyone is covered in this - from the stage boy through the chorus through the leads and producers and assistant directors.  The telling of the complex relationships between the directors (Gilbert and Sullivan) and the leads is particularly poignant - whether dealing with the actors&apos; considerable egos or their individual popularity among the chorus, nothing presented doesn&apos;t ring true.\n\nI loved everything about this movie. It&apos;s a great story, told wonderfully by all involved. It is truly a film of much love and craft.\n\nAnd I expect I&apos;ll be attending the next run of the Mikado next time it comes to town.",

After the defeat of Jena in 1806: A handful of soldiers held a mill on the Saale for a while against the French superiority. In this way, the Prussian troops can get to safety behind the backs of the combatants.\n\nThe German CINECITTA Divo Horst FRANK achieves an excellent performance, dashing and sensitive all in one. Jörg PLEVA, Volkert KRAEFT and Martin LÜTTGE can be seen in other roles.\n\nVery unusual film from this time! Worth seeing!",

      "reviewBody": "Wow... that person who gave it &quot;zero stars out of ****&quot; is a little confused... though not without entertainment value. His comment &quot;Shakespeare would have been apalled&quot; is laughable. why? Because most of his whining was about the plot itself. Does he not realize that Shakespeare WROTE the play A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, and that that makers of the movie followed the original play TO THE WORD, except for a few dialogue cuts that didn&apos;t affect plot? And then he went on to whine about how frivolous and silly the plot is...\n\nyou know what? All of Shakespeare&apos;s comedy plots are silly and frivolous. That&apos;s the point. Remember, in his time, he wasn&apos;t an intellectual mastermind... he was an entertainer for the masses. He gave the playgoers what they wanted in his plays, whether comedy, tragedy, or history- and what they wanted was love, mistaken identity, gratuitous violence, a few laughs, and to be entertained. Yes, he was a great playwright. One of the first, in fact, to really give changeability to his characters. Most writers of his time used purely stock characters. Good guys, bad guys, drunk guys, slutty chicks, virtuous chicks, idiots, smart guys... but never 3-dimensional characters. This is what Shakespeare changed. He created 3-D, CHANGEABLE characters.\n\nAnd don&apos;t start on &quot;Oh, you are being shallow&quot;. Shakespeare DID put a lot of deeper meanings and metaphore into his plays- but that DID come secondary to entertainment. And even his great plays like Hamlet and Macbeth, with some serious psychological &quot;WTF???&quot; going on, were pretty contrived. I mean, the end of Hamlet involves four dead bodies on the stage, mostly due to mix ups (Hamlet gets stabbed by Laertes&apos; poisoned sword, they keep fighting and manage to switch swords, Laertes gets stabbed with his OWN sword, the queen drinks the poisoned wine meant for Hamlet, then warns him, and he stabs the king AND makes him drink the poisoned wine. Nevermind Ophelia&apos;s previous suicide because Hamlet was pretending to be insane, Polonius getting stabbed by Hamlet because Hamlet thought he was the evil king, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern dying in Hamlet&apos;s place when they were sent to get him killed, and of course, the death of Hamlet&apos;s own father by having poison poured in his ear) So don&apos;t start bashing the filmmakers. You said the only good thing they did was the atmosphere... but really, that&apos;s all that was left up to them- the presentation. The play was already written, the characters already created, the plot already silly and Chick Flick-y. Sorry. That idiotic &quot;Shakespeare would be apalled&quot; thing just bothers me. I mean, he wrote the fricking thing. So, the only conclusion I can draw from this inane and snooty review is that, like many others, the complexity of the play and its many subplots confused the hell out of you (May I say something about attention spans here??), so you tried to turn it around and blame it on someone else because you&apos;re too much of a dolt to figure out what&apos;s going on.\n\nOk, having ranted- I&apos;ll make this brief. A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream is like a comedy-chick flick with the added advantage of a cool atmosphere and Shakespeare&apos;s poetic dialogue. It&apos;s a funny romantic comedic fantasy. If you like that sort of thing, see it. If you don&apos;t, then don&apos;t. And for God&apos;s sake, if you can&apos;t understand that dialogue, don&apos;t blame it on the filmmakers. There ARE people out there who DO understand it, you know."

Watch anything that made you laugh once, even for a 5th time over, before you even look at this &quot;movie&quot;.\n\nMy first review ever on here... \n\nI just had to warn the people.",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who&apos;s thinking that they will get the story of Captain William Kidd is in for one disappointing viewing. This is not the story of the real William Kidd who in fact some say, may not even have been a pirate, merely a British privateer. There&apos;s some controversy raging to this day about whether he left some buried treasure in and around the New York City area. In fact colonial New York is where the captain&apos;s base of operations was, though New York gets the barest mention in the beginning of the film.\n\nThis version of Kidd has him as a cockney with a burning ambition to rise in class. Actually Kidd was born in Scotland in either Aberdeen or Dundee depending on what source you use. He&apos;s a clever rogue, after sinking a king&apos;s ship and then accusing that noble captain of piracy.\n\nGiving that story to King William III of Orange, Kidd gets a ship and he picks a crew of cutthroats and sets sail to do more plunder.\n\nCaptain Kidd suffers from two faults mainly. It&apos;s badly edited, the film clearly begins at a point where some previous action took place explaining some of what we see. Probably something of New York where Kidd began his career. A whole lot of things are left up in the air because of this. Secondly, Randolph Scott is horribly miscast in a part that Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. should have played. My guess is that none of these gentlemen could be secured for a loan out from their studios. Even Cornel Wilde or Louis Hayward would have been better.\n\nBut what enjoyment you get in the film comes from Charles Laughton&apos;s florid performance as Captain Kidd. Basically what he&apos;s done is taken his Horace Prin character from White Woman and set him to sea. Laughton&apos;s overacting is nicely counterbalanced by Reginald Owen as a valet he&apos;s hired and takes to sea to teach him the fine art of being a gentleman. Laughton overacts outrageously, but I&apos;m sure he realized that without it, the film would have been dull as dishwater.\n\nGilbert Roland, John Carradine, and Sheldon Leonard are all part of Laughton&apos;s gang of thieves. Barbara Britton looks properly demure as a heroine caught up among them. And Henry Daniell, the man with the built in sneer in his voice, for once plays a good guy as King William.\n\nCharles Laughton fans will love Captain Kidd. And Laughton was even more outrageous when he reprised Captain Kidd when he met up with Abbott and Costello. But that&apos;s a whole other movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is NOT a film that the average film viewer will love. Many will be alienated because of the film&apos;s strong language and rather amoral characters. Many will be alienated because the film is so strange and,....well, strange! But, if you have a high tolerance for these factors, then you&apos;ll no doubt have a great time watching this cult classic. Just be prepared--this is PROBABLY NOT a film for grandma and the kiddies! In addition to very harsh language, there is drug use, sex (though you don&apos;t see anything) and violence galore.\n\nThe film almost defies description, though I&apos;ll try. Emelio Estevez stars as a rather low-key guy who falls into the job of repossessing cars. And, once he takes the job, he finds that the subculture is bizarre. In fact, the people he works for are the most motley crew of freaks you could imagine. And, into the midst of this group of freaks comes a plot about stolen alien corpses and a car trunk that vaporizes anyone who opens it!! Heck, I won&apos;t even bother continuing...suffice to say it&apos;s just weird.\n\nOverall, while the acting and script occasionally fall flat, the film is funny, twisted and never fails to surprise--particularly the hallucinogenic ending! In addition, the film has a great sound track--one of the best I&apos;ve heard. It&apos;s full of punk music AND retro 50s rifts that I particularly loved. Who would have thought I would have liked music from the likes of Iggy Pop and The Plugz?! Plus, if you really like the tunes, you can buy the special edition which comes with the movie on DVD and a music CD as well.\n\nBy the way, as you are watching here are a couple interesting things to note. The food in the movie is all in generic-style containers and say &apos;food&apos;, &apos;beer&apos; and the like. Also, note when the one punk is dying--listen to his death speech--it&apos;s a classic!",

      "reviewBody": "Rod Taylor is &quot;The Liquidator&quot; -- well, his superiors think he is, anyway -- in this 1965 spoof of the spy genre, directed by Jack Cardiff.\n\nThe &apos;60s was certainly an interesting time for films - spy films, spoofs of spy films, caper films, big historical films, and sex comedies. Here we have a spoof of the James Bond films, with Rod Taylor playing Boys Oaks, a war acquaintance of Colonel Mostyn (Trevor Howard). The British Security Services is frustrated and embarrassed as they have a number of spies in their midst. It&apos;s time to liquidate them, so The Chief (Wilfrid Hyde-White) orders Mostyn to find someone.\n\nMostyn remembers Boys and his impressive actions during the war and drafts him. Of course, he doesn&apos;t exactly tell Boys what he wants. He offers him a gorgeous apartment, beautiful women who hang around, a nice car, and after Boys signs his life away, Mostyn drops the bomb. Boys tries but he fails in his first assignment and instead saves the subject from the train tracks he was just about to throw her onto. The other thing is all the travel - Boys really doesn&apos;t like to travel. So Boyd has to come up with a solution or lose the perks.\n\nI thought this was an okay comedy, nothing special. Jill St. John plays Mostyn&apos;s beautiful, sexy secretary, Wilfrid Hyde-White plays the bureau chief; the film also features Akim Tamiroff. There are some funny moments and I like the premise. Entertaining.",

He quite steals the film from Kurt Russell a crime reporter and Mariel Hemingway who is Russell&apos;s girlfriend and the last woman Jordan stalks.\n\nRussell has truly grown to dislike his job on a big city paper in this case Miami where he&apos;s gotten a specialty in crime reporting, the more lurid the better. He&apos;s considering an offer from a small town Colorado paper to take over as editor.\n\nThat&apos;s when things get interesting. Jordan is a serial killer who Russell has been writing about and in his twisted way considers Kurt to be some kind of personal publicist for him and his peers. Now he starts calling to give him heads up exclusives knowing that this will lead to Mariel&apos;s own abduction.\n\nThat&apos;s the one thing about criminals of the psychotic mind. They don&apos;t reason like the rest of us. It sounds wild and improbable the notion that Jordan has, but that&apos;s the hard part for FBI and local profiler&apos;s jobs, getting in those sick minds to see how they work.\n\nJordan is one sick and twisted puppy. The rest of the cast is fine, but he really stands out in The Mean Season.",

      "reviewBody": "Carlito&apos;s Way (1993), is a brilliant cinematic work. Pacino&apos;s performance as Carlito Berganzi displays the duplicity and subsequent torment between his reformed spirit, and the endless seduction of the street, embodied more specifically as his reputation,legacy,those who know him, of him, and those whom he allows in his innermost circle. Sean Penn is phenomenal as the lawyer representing Carlito, his metamorphosis into character is testament to his depth of talent. Penelope Ann Miller, as the long-suffering love of Carlito&apos;s life is dramatically and visually enchanting. The casting is perfect. The supporting cast superb, perfectly augmenting the film. The script is alive with literary devices, the story line(s), characters, dialogue, themes, sub-texts,etc., make this an almost endlessly watchable film. Of this genre, Its all there, action, suspense, violence, confrontations, chases,  prerequisite street and wise guy character profiling with the right dialogue to make it work. Directed, executed and rendered a cinema great. Carlito&apos;s Way is atypical of the gangster genre, although it adheres to certain basics. It is also  a love story, not boy meets girl, ad nauseum, but real, destined soul mates, wrenched apart and thrown back together five years later by some abberation of fate. As one experiences spiritual,moral disintegration, the other the anti-thesis. Carlito&apos;s Way is a mix of genre&apos;s veiled with diligent artistic discretion. I even see certain thematic similarities to Casablanca. Watching Carlito&apos;s Way I had the feeling that De Palma wanted to resurrect and redeem poor old Tony Montana, Scarface (1983). Perhaps it was self-redemption, or a means to a great film with a second view or maybe the fun of bringing back that great ensemble of talent, based on a similar theme. A sequel of sorts, not to diminish either film in anyway. Released exactly ten years after Scarface, the comparisons are more than obvious. Ten years later, De Palma and Pacino. Oliver Stone missing, but another great script. In Carlito&apos;s Way, Pacino again plays a Hispanic drug lord. Now Puerto Rican in New York City, before Cuban in Miami. Now drug lord repentant, whereas in Scarface, drug lord vehemently unrepentant and devoid of remorse, from beginning to surrealistic end. Instead of classic gangster genre prerequisites employed in Scarface, such as, coming from the bottom, rising in status, trust and favour in the eyes of the mob boss, eventually killing him, and gaining his empire his woman(Michelle Pfeiffer). Love? Its not in the equation- Carlito only wants to unite with his TRUE LOVE. To redeem himself in her eyes, after causing her the heartbreak of losing him forever.(Which it would have been, if not for the quirk of intervention by Carlito&apos;s coke addicted, sociopathic lawyer). Carlito seeks solely to prove to his love that he is truly changed, honest, sincere, and even has a plan whereupon they can live happily ever after. Carlito and his girl are likeable. Upon viewing this film one is compelled to empathy, wanting them to escape insurmountable odds (the almost onmniprescent serpent-like &quot;street&quot;), finding and deserving of happiness as long as they may live. However, it is though The Angel of Death has been hidden somewhere in every frame of De Palma&apos;s film, casting a shadow, waiting patiently to put his hand upon...\n\nEven the ancillary characters from Scarface are brought back in legions for Carlito&apos;s Way. Carlito&apos;s Way is Scarface with &quot;feelings&quot;. Which is another similarity in the two films, &quot;feelings&quot; is the Achille&apos;s Heel of both Carlito Berganzi and Tony Montana. I also believe both films were vastly underrated and overlooked by the mainstream media, but upon populist vote, they are both widely esteemed as &quot;classic&quot;. I&apos;d give Carlito&apos;s Way (1993) nine out of ten. If I saw a ten, it would be a life changing event.",

      "reviewBody": "This offbeat art/sexploitation flick is at once typical of an adventurous era in European cinema, and a sort of &quot;fine--but what are you gonna do with it?&quot; curio. Handsome Ray Lovelock (who sings a couple uninspired folk-troubador songs on the soundtrack) is a longhaired motorcyclist lured into the forest idyll of three classic Eurobabes circa 1970 (big hair/wigs, near-Kabuki levels of makeup, outré couture wear when they&apos;re wearing any clothes at all) living in a pop-art palazzo in the middle of nowhere for no reason at all. Of course, something supernatural is going on, and it&apos;s hardly a spoiler to say that once these three glam spiders have had their way with this male butterfly, he won&apos;t be riding off into the sunset but meeting a considerably grimmer fate. \n\nNot as much fun as the Swinging London blowout &quot;The Touchables&quot; two years earlier, which had a similar Adam-held-captive-by-three-sexy-Eves premise, this takes its allegorical aspects just seriously enough to be rather ponderous, partly because it&apos;s a little too highly polished in presentation without quite being eccentrically individual enough in style. The aesthetic is a little like high-fashion advertising--skilled, artistic, but a little arid. When the violence finally arrives it is bracingly unbridled, but more attention to the creeping dread of the horror undertow and less mild, picturesque erotica would have made the movie seem less mannered and empty as it idles its way towards the inevitable. Still, if you&apos;re a fan of such vintage counterculture/Eurotrash kitsch, it&apos;s certainly worth seeing once.",

It has a very interesting premise, which I don&apos;t remember having seen in other movies, at least not in the fresh way it is presented here. The scientific explanation for why we are &quot;disgusted&quot; by certain things was excellent and I learned something new. The characters were all likable, even the seemingly bad guys. I didn&apos;t know who to root for. I guess I liked both sides, because neither side was actually bad. You find out why when the movie is about to end. The acting was superb to say the least. Actually, I was surprised by the number of good actors and actresses in this movie. They were all good-looking and knew what they were doing. The movie was not really scary, but it was entertaining. I could compare it to The Lazarus Effect (2015) in style, which interestingly enough has the exact same rating on IMDb. All in all, if you&apos;re looking to be entertained, do watch this, but if you want to get scared, look elsewhere. This is science-fiction, Thriller, Mystery with some Horror elements.\n\nFinal score: 7/10",

The other characters - and their actors I&apos;ve already forgotten, ten minutes after it&apos;s finished. They might as well been office furniture for all their presence and acting.\n\nThe script is obvious and rather boring as we now know all about Plutonium - it has no excitement value whatsoever. The movie seemed to have the budget of a TV pilot &apos;special&apos; - it&apos;s so obviously struggling that it&apos;s rather embarrassing. The direction, too, is particularly feeble, without any panache or style whatsoever.\n\nI&apos;ve been generous with my 3/10. It&apos;s not going to be too awful for those that might buy the DVD if they have a good idea of what sort of movie they&apos;re getting but for most Hot Potato is a waste of time and effort.

This movie did indeed show something different and has a lot of comedy to present and a few twists too. Tusshar Kapoor did great acting, as usual lol, i didn&apos;t find much problems in this movie and would say that indeed i would definitely watch this movie again as it is definitely the worth. Unlike any usual romantic movie this movie like i have mentioned brings out a whole different but yet great flavour and the twist in the movie makes it even more interesting. Still not getting the picture? What are you waiting for?! Go and watch the movie! :D",

      "reviewBody": "This definitely isn&apos;t the most exciting movie about law enforcement (it took me three tries to finish it because I kept falling asleep). Instead of car chases and shoot-outs it contains a lot of dialogue (some obviously improvised) and focuses mostly on the relationships between the various interesting characters. It is a kind of a police procedural, but even there it focuses on the more mundane aspects of police work that the much more famous Hollywood(and slightly more famous Italian) cop movies tend to skip over.\n\nThe whole thing wouldn&apos;t work though if it weren&apos;t for the acting. Gerard Depardieu plays one of his sympathetic anti-heroes, the kind of guy you really shouldn&apos;t like, but eventually really do. Even though she was only about 18 at the time, Sophie Marceau manages to hold her own against the great Depardieu as a potential femme fatale who is mixed up with the Tunisian drug dealers he is trying to bust. It&apos;s well known that Marceau is a &quot;Bond girl&quot;, but it&apos;s not often mentioned that (with the possible exception of Eva Green) she&apos;s also the most TALENTED of all the &quot;Bond girls&quot;. I was impressed with Sandrine Bonnaire for another reason. I knew she was a formidable actress from Claude Chabrol&apos;s &quot;L&apos;Initiation&quot;, but I had no idea how cute and sexy she was in her younger years. She has a much smaller role as a 19-year-old prostitute Depardieu&apos;s character picks up, but she handles the requisite French-movie full-frontal nude scenes both Depardieu and Marceau uncharacteristically fore-go.\n\nThe crime story here is interesting too in that both the Tunisian criminals and the cops are obviously flawed, but not unsympathetic characters. (You kind of don&apos;t want anybody to win or lose).This is kind of a slow-going flick, but ultimately it is worth it."

      "reviewBody": "Lenny (1974) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nBob Fosse&apos;s masterpiece takes a look at the short life of comic Lenny Bruce (Dustin Hoffman) who would die at the age of forty but not before breaking down certain doors for future comics. The film follows his rise up through the ranks thanks in large part to the controversy that followed him due to the nature of his act. I&apos;ve always felt that LENNY was one of the best movies of the decade and even after all these years it&apos;s still a very sharp, at times funny but mostly sad look at a man who deserved much better than he ever got. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that the film was like the light shining from above on both Fosse and Hoffman as the two were perfectly meant to bring this film to the screen and boy do they really deliver. Fosse&apos;s style here wouldn&apos;t work with most directors but the way he uses it to get to the emotion and power in the story is quite amazing. The film jumps back and forth through different periods of Bruce&apos;s life and the way Fosse uses this to build up the subject is something interesting to watch. Just take a look at a rather innocent scene where Bruce talks his wife into having a threesome with another woman. Just look at how the silence is used and the impact this has for this scene. Hoffman gives one of his greatest performances here, which is saying quite a bit considering how great he was during this period of his career. I thought he really did a remarkable job at not copying the real Lenny Bruce but instead taking him and forming him into this character. I thought Hoffman really gave an incredibly powerful and emotional performance and especially as Bruce begins to crack due to the pressures of the courts and the drugs. Valerie Perrine is also excellent in her role of Bruce&apos;s drug addicted wife. The B&amp;W cinematography is some of the greatest you&apos;re ever going to see. This is certainly one of the most beautiful films you&apos;re ever going to see and especially the way the lighting is even in the simplest scenes. LENNY often gets beaten up by some critics because it&apos;s not 100% accurate but I&apos;ve yet to see any bio pic that is. To me this is clearly one of the best movies of the decade and features one of the greatest performances you&apos;re going to see."

That&apos;s definitely an attribute that&apos;s hard to find in a genuine musician these days.\n\nTo step up like they did and tell &quot;them&quot;--the people that make up this mold that we&apos;re all supposed to aspire to fit--that they were wrong. Not only are &quot;they&quot; denying the music of its full potential, they are hindering their very moneymakers--the artists themselves. People have tossed around these brilliant ideas only to be shot down by the people in control. Music itself should never have anyone or anything that&apos;s trying to control it, instead, it should be given room to grow to it&apos;s full potential. A true emotion felt in song cannot be controlled. It stands in all its glory unaided. It&apos;s a vicious self-destructive behavior of music industry executives. Ironic really that they pollute their products by taking the direction into their own uneducated and under-passionate hands. And the only reason they do this is because they fear putting out an unpolluted product in the first place. Contradicting Logic.\n\n&quot;Strong Enough to Break&quot; is an graceful and yet candid portrayal of how this happens to artists everyday. It also shows the effect of outside supremacy on the artists themselves, and what consequently happens to the music. This is an audacious piece that&apos;s worthy of a voice, and a big one at that. They definitely have something to say. So, are you listening?",

      "reviewBody": "The thriller genre has been well explored and perfected over decades of cinema. While some familiar elements and conventions are to be expected in a new release, you would expect, at the very least, that a new entry tops the previous ones.\n\nAnd sadly, Deception does not. The movie almost feels like a remake of Curtis Hanson&apos;s Bad Influence. A movie that was made almost twenty years ago and features two main characters that are carbon copies of those of McGregor and Jackman, only they were played respectively by James Spader and Rob Lowe.\n\nWhatever &quot;twists&quot; are found in Deception, you see them coming from a mile and they fall flat. The acting? Everybody seems to be cashing his check. One-dimensional characters and an aimless plot make for a boring two hours. Even the &quot;list&quot; subplot feels tacked on and doesn&apos;t even provide any enjoyment, nor does it add anything to the film.\n\nThe photography is amazing but this is truly a poor Hollywood movie and one that you will be better off passing on, unless you are a die-hard fan of the genre or one of the main actors featured. All in all, a tremendous waste of talent and resources due to a crappy script.",

The main attraction here is the cast of familiar TV faces, which includes William Shatner and Tom Skerritt as brothers (which along with the presence of Joan Prather, makes this a &apos;Big Bad Mama&apos; reunion!), Ernest Borgnine as a leering Satanic cult leader, &apos;Green Acres&apos; Eddie Albert, veteran Ida Lupino, and a blink and you&apos;ll miss it cameo from a pre-superstar John Travolta. The plot concerns a much sought after book and devil worship, but really who cares? Sit back and enjoy the (unintentional) laughs, some classic emoting from Shatner, and the overly long face-melting scenes, which according to the video box is &quot;absolutely the most incredible ending of any motion picture&quot;! And dig that Borgnine goat face!"

How many of those decisions became regrets? It doesn&apos;t really matter because yesterday happened, but it is interesting to consider the interconnected backstage of existence. And then tremble at the great unknown that is your parent&apos;s past. There&apos;s just so much we&apos;ll never know. And that&apos;s mostly OK. Bride Flight is a film that I admired because its leading characters were not only exquisitely defined, but their stories felt distinct and complete, almost separate within a greater whole. These people kept things from one another, and yet they were all so pivotal to each other. The dramatic irony fires on all cylinders. And the ensemble has absolutely excellent chemistry to pull it off. You never doubt the natural unfolding of events because every glance they give or catch is so engaging. New Zealand serves as a breathtakingly epic backdrop to this romance that jumps back and forth on a timeline much more gracefully than so many other examples. When it does jump back you start to become very happy certain rigid social customs have been left behind, and that&apos;s a testament to how fully yet subtly its realized. This was a pleasant surprise to watch.",

Brian Aherne (as the captain) is the victim of delayed and incorrect information and sails the ship right into the iceberg. We get glimpses of the rich and famous who populated the doomed ship as well as the luscious interiors of the ship.\n\nThe special effects are tremendous without taking over the film. The final scenes of the sinking ship are awesome. But the story of innocent passengers takes center stage here. Stanwyck and Webb are a squabbling couple with two children. The girl (Audrey Dalton) is a snob who is charmed by a college boy (Robert Wagner). Thelma Ritter plays a Molly Brown- like character addicted to loud jewelry and cards. Richard Basehart plays a defrocked priest. Allyn Joslyn plays the infamous coward who dresses like a woman to gain a seat on a lifeboat. Oh, and that&apos;s Mae Marsh the kid gives his seat to.\n\nThe final scenes of Webb and son are superb. An excellent film."

Kurt Cobain was a man who changed music forever and i feel warrants a movie about his life that mirrors the creativity and genius of him instead this movie is boring bland and comes nowhere near having the right to be connected with a musician like Kurt Cobain"

Of course, anyone is entitled to a mistake, but if there was anything wrong with this project it seems to be the Jeffrey Alan Fiskin&apos;s screen treatment of the classic Mario Monicelli film &quot;Big Deal at Madonna Street&quot;.\n\nThe cast Mr. Malle assembled for the film is a first rate one, just by looking at the names in it. Donald Sutherland, Jack Warden, Sean Penn, Christine Baranski and the rest have enough experience to show much better than what comes out on the screen.\n\nLet&apos;s just remember Mr. Malle for his greatness, and not by this misguided effort.",

      "reviewBody": "Marty and doc are back, but in another time. They go to the West in 1885 in order to save Doc&apos;s life and from then on the Western adventure takes place. It&apos;s a pity that so many people disliked the third movie because, in my humble opinion, it&apos;s a great finale to this fantastic trilogy. It is very well written with rich characters and clever dialogues. This third part does differ in the sense that it&apos;s set in the West and has less of the futuristic gadgets and gizmos (obviously, since it&apos;s not set in the distant future but you&apos;ll still see a few including a time-travelling freight train) but it still retains the same energy, a different kind of action and it pays a nice homage to Western classics. Fox and Lloyd continue their roles of the teen hero and the crazy doctor (and it never gets old) but this time there&apos;s a new female lead. Mary Steenburgen delivers a hilariously wonderful performance as the ditsy Clara. She and Lloyd are funny and sweet together. Clara is the perfect lady for Doc and Steenburgen fits the part like a glove. This time, Lea Thompson appears as an Irish settler. Zemeckis has brilliantly picked up from where the second one ended. The film ends on a delightful note and I would have liked to see more &apos;Back to The Future&apos; movies. But, I&apos;m still very pleased with the way it is. There have been only very few trilogies that have impressed me overall. My list includes names like Ray&apos;s &apos;Apu Trilogy&apos; and Coppola&apos;s &apos;Godfather&apos; trilogy and of course Zemeckis&apos;s &apos;Back To The Future&apos; movies."

      "reviewBody": "The Disney cartoon is one of my favorite movies and while looking into other adaptations of the story I stumbled across this.\n\nThe beginning of the movie feels cliche and it drags a little. When she gets to Wonder/Horrorland the movie began to pull me in. The eerie infinite looping Mansion, with freaky characters and bizarre happenstances work well to build an unpredictable world that you alongside Alice get stuck in. Towards the end of the movie, keeping it spoiler free, Alice made a decision that I really don&apos;t understand. And the conclusion is something I had seen before in a Twilight Zone episode.\n\nAs an adaptation of Alice In Wonderland/Looking-Glass it&apos;s a flop. There is no Wonderland. None of the characters are there. The story is original. It&apos;s not complete non-sense. It&apos;s adult oriented. And aside from a couple of vague novel references it has nothing to do with Carrol&apos;s Story.\n\nAs a stand alone I think it&apos;s a hidden gem. With dozens of movie renditions, Alice doesn&apos;t always need to be true to the book. This movie has a great atmosphere, and in its own right a good sense of world building. Sure it&apos;s flawed and is clearly put together with time constraints and a low budget. But I do think it&apos;s worth checking out, and it&apos;s among the better horror movies that I have seen.",

      "reviewBody": "The Vow is a wonderful little movie. At first blush, the movie seemed like it&apos;s another 50 First Dates, but without the comedy. The only similarity to 50 First Dates is that both the female leads suffer from amnesia with their respective significant others trying to win her heart. The Vow actually comes across having a feel more like The Notebook.\n\nIt&apos;s the story of the romance between Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), and who are victims of a car accident. Leo recovers, but Paige emerges with no memories of her whole relationship nor marriage to Leo, and he must now make her fall in love with him again. In her mind, as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie, she&apos;s still engaged to her ex-fiancé.\n\nThe movie manages to avoid cheap Hollywood writing, and gently leads you down its plot. Just when you think you might know where the story is going, it heads in a different direction. Details are revealed to you layer by layer as Paige discovers them. Tatum&apos;s voice-over was somewhat annoying, and unnecessary.\n\nIn trying to remember her memories, Paige manages to gain a new life. Opening in time for Valentine&apos;s Day, this makes for a wonderful date-night movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The Double Hour is a very interesting film. One of those rare pictures in which every scene counts. It&apos;s hard to review it without spoiling anything, since a lot of it&apos;s brilliance lays in a very surreal and terrifying sequence of events. The film is a lot of things; a twisted thriller, a unique and intense romance and a character study of two different individuals who find exactly what they need in each other. It works on every level that it attains towards, thanks primarily to a very intelligent script and superb performances from Filippo Timi and especially Kseniya Rappoport. The film has a lot of twists and a lot of, &quot;what the hell is happening?&quot; scenes, but thanks to the script it never gets too far ahead of the audience. It&apos;s easy to stick with, while still being intellectually stimulating. I wasn&apos;t bored for a second, from the huge shock of the opening scene until the interesting final one. There&apos;s a lot of great aspects that are involved throughout, the film really knows how to give it&apos;s two main characters some very emotional and enlightening arcs. They both go through a world of emotional distress and in the end they are completely changed while remaining in the same basic place that they started off. It asks a lot of questions and leaves the audience to debate them long after the film is over. Can you ever truly trust someone? What is the nature of revenge? How do you move past losing a loved one? There are many more and the film keeps you guessing all the way through. Tons of twists, great characters and interesting moves from a structural standpoint. It&apos;s a very unique film and a very fantastic one.",

      "name": "An awesomely fun and twisted little fantasy",
      "reviewBody": "Despite enjoying other films like it, I was never a fan of James Gunn&apos;s Slither. It just came off as being average to me, and despite multiple tries, I have never ventured back to give it a second chance. Keeping that in mind, I ventured into a screening of Super at the Toronto International Film Festival hoping to be surprised, and not to come away disappointed. Thankfully, it turned out to be quite the awesome surprise.\n\nFrank D&apos;Arbo (Rainn Wilson) lives a pretty miserable existence. He has just two happy memories in his entire life – marrying his wife Sarah (Liv Tyler) and pointing a police officer in the right direction of a suspect. So when Sarah, a stripper and former junkie, leaves him for her boss Jacques (Kevin Bacon), he loses all faith. But during a chance epiphany, he realizes his true calling is to be a superhero – the Crimson Bolt – and fight against those committing any sort of crime, whether it be drug dealing, underage rape or even butting in-line at the movies.\n\nWhile I figured the film would have a hurdle to face making it feel different than any other movie about ordinary people donning costumes and fighting crime (in the past few years alone, see Special, Defendor, Kick-Ass and to a point, even Batman Begins and The Dark Knight), but Super is a much different beast. From the epilogue through the totally ridiculous (in a good way) animated song and dance credit sequence on, you know you are in for something different. This is a film that embraces the absurd and the full-blown psychopathic, and delivers a twistedly hilarious comic gem that lacks the seriousness (mostly) that plagues the other films previously mentioned. And any movie about someone using a pipewrench to wreak havoc on crime is immediately enough to make me forget Defendor even existed.\n\nI think the element that sets Gunn&apos;s twisted fantasy apart from other films is that it is decidedly not mainstream. D&apos;Arbo truly becomes the superhero we all wish we were by taking out anyone who is committing crimes. He has the vendetta against Jacques taking his wife hanging over his head throughout the movie, but in the meantime, he ensures that no crime goes unpunished – in increasingly graphically violent ways. I knew that using a pipewrench could only lead to a bloody mess, but I did not expect the movie to become the nasty bloodbath it quickly does. If you remember being disappointed at how much blood got cut between the conversion of Kick-Ass from a comic to a film, you will be delighted at just how much is spilt here. I knew Gunn was a graduate of the Troma film academy (Lloyd Kaufman makes a cameo late in the film), but I never expected to see just as much violence as I did. Thankfully, every injury and blood spurt is more hilarious and ridiculous than the last.\n\nWilson is amazing from start to finish as D&apos;Arbo. I have never been a fan of his zany humour, but it fits this role perfectly. He jumps from being the pathetic loser to being the invigorated crime fighter with ease. And despite playing the role seriously, you never once think he is descending into parody. The film is a parody, but he never hams it up in the role deliberately looking for laughs. He has a very strong comic presence that he maintains throughout the film, and brings a rather poignant touch to more than a few scenes. If he sticks to more roles like these, and stays away from being the best thing in downright awful movies like The Rocker and My Super Ex-Girlfriend, he might have quite the career ahead of him.\n\nThe supporting cast is all very good and very funny in their smaller roles. Bacon is just as good as he always is, injecting the right amount of style and finesse into his scumbag of a character. Tyler could have done a bit more as the damsel in distress, but she remains quite memorable in her role. Smaller turns by Gregg Henry, Michael Rooker and especially Nathan Fillion all pay off wonderfully within the film. But if anyone can even stand close to Wilson&apos;s performance, it is Ellen Page as the off-the-rails comic nerd Libby. While she has found fame playing Juno and derivatives of the same character in the majority of her roles, she actually is quite different here. She alternates between being anxiety-ridden and being a complete psychopath, often in the same scene, and practically steals the film from Wilson. And when she finally becomes his sidekick Boltie, she truly is able to embrace the absurd.\n\nIf I have any problem with the film (outside of a rather bizarre and horrendous looking CGI sequence early in the film), it is that it never stays consistent with its tones. The humour remains intact throughout, but its absurdity starts to waver as the film goes on. It remains ridiculous, but it becomes a bit too serious in some sections. It feels more like Gunn did not want to truly push the film into the realm of comic fantasy, and still wanted some semblance of realism to stay within the film. He explained his tonal shift choices to the audience, but it still is not enough to make up for the film never knowing which way it wants to go. I loved its unpredictability of what D&apos;Arbo would do next, but loathed never knowing what the next shift would be. It never destroys the film, but it weakens the film cohesively.\n\nSuper is an awesome film, and one whose dark humour never truly overtakes it. Wilson and Page are amazing in their roles, and the rest of the supporting cast does a great job backing them up. I just hope everyone can experience and have as much fun as I did.\n\n9/10.",

I think that Russell was the first really wacko film director I got to know. I hadn&apos;t watched anything of his for a long time. This is one of those things that allows this director to take complete license. You have true historical figures who come together in the house of Lord Byron, a really colorful character. The lives of these people come out of boredom. They are misunderstood and a bit spoiled. So, according to Russell, they sit down one night and begin to tell their best horror story. This leads to a series of debauches, hallucinations, whatever. It is filled with images and sex and masochism and anything that the director could throw in there. Now, because you are producing in an accepting time, you can get away with all that. I guess I would watch this again, knowing what the whole of the thing presents, but when you play by no rules other than to do what you want, the results are like throwing paint on a canvass. We get a lot of paint, a lot of color, but no motif. So, while I thought this was a real head trip, I&apos;m not so sure there is much coherence or even meaning to it.",

Xaver Schwarzenberger directed, famous author Felix Mitterer wrote the script. A dozen renouned actors have slipped in 19th century costumes.\n\nThe result is overwhelming in a way. Nobody disappointed me. But something is missing in the whole project. Maybe it is a little flaw, a little surprise. This biopic is too slick, too perfect. There are even too many stars (maybe casting Ottfried Fischer as Bavarian king Maximilian was the trigger that lead to me disliking the film), there is no space for risks left. Therefore, even the cool Tyrolean accent of the characters becomes boring after a couple of minutes.\n\nThe Andreas Hofer film is a mere commercial project  though, admittedly, very well done. I would like to mention two of the actors specifically: Franz Xaver Kroetz is fascinating as a fundamentalist priest, and Julia Stemberger, who plays Hofer&apos;s wife Anna, shows that she can actually act. I still don&apos;t like her but at least she managed to impress me in this role.\n\nHowever, I don&apos;t think this is going to become anyone&apos;s favourite movie of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film further proves that the assembly-line system of Hollywood studios back then should also be taken seriously in terms of artistry. Just because movies were produced run-of-the-mill doesn&apos;t mean that they weren&apos;t paid critical attention to by their makers. The usual impression on studio-era Hollywood is: take a formulaic narrative style, maybe adapt a stage play for the screen, blend in a handful of stars from the stable and the films rake in the profit at the box office. Not quite, that&apos;s the easy perception. George Cukor, another of those versatile directors, made it apparent with Camille that filmmaking as an art may still flourish despite (and even within) certain parameters. Camille is beautiful, in so many respects. And it&apos;s not just because of Greta Garbo.\n\nSure, the acting is amazing, the casting is perfect. Garbo is luminous, mysterious, cruel, and weak at the same time. Robert Taylor surrenders himself to be the heartbreakingly young and vulnerable Armand. Henry Daniell&apos;s coldness and sadism is utterly human and familiar. The others are just plain wonderful. The writing contains so much wit and humor, devotion and pain - but it never overstates anything. The rapport and tensions between lovers, friends, and enemies are palpable and consistent. The actions flow so naturally, just like every scene, that checking for historical inconsistencies seem far beside the point.\n\nThere is so much that I love about Camille that it&apos;s hard to enumerate them all, but with every little discovery comes the realization that this is &quot;but&quot; a studio production, so it makes the experience more exquisite. Camille is a gentle, poignant romantic movie that, like Garbo, takes its place delicately and self-effacingly in the history of American cinema, but makes itself indelible in the heart and mind of the lovelorn individual viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: // This movie delves into the era of the original (real) Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, led by Captain Paul Watson. Events in 2023 led to an overturn in the organization, resulting in the expulsion of Mr. Paul Watson and transformation of the organization into a miserable collaborationist entity. //\n\n&quot;Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist&quot; offers a captivating portrayal of the multifaceted challenges faced by eco-warriors. It sheds light on their heroic efforts to combat the animal extraction industry, the pervasive corruption within governments, narrow-minded traditional attitudes, and other forms of cruelty associated with global animal hunting. It is a film that I have revisited multiple times and undoubtedly will watch again.\n\nWe live in the midst a planetary mass extinction event, this time driven by human activity. While happening at a mind-blowing rate, it is almost invisible to the most of us. People live in cities, animals die in the wild and sea. Excluding implicit factors, such as urbanization, pollution, and climate change, people literally KILL animals, and sometimes kill just for fun. This movie shows examples of such atrocities and brings attention to the problem.\n\nThe crew of the Sea Shepherd operates under incredibly stressful conditions, confronting aggression from those they oppose, navigating legal hurdles, grappling with resource scarcity, and enduring physically demanding labor. Law enforcement often turns a blind eye to the real culprits, instead targeting the low-hanging fruit - the environmental activists. While the crew occasionally resorts to unconventional methods, those prove highly effective, and the team&apos;s noble objective justifies their actions.\n\nDespite its television format and modest budget, the movie stands as a testament to exceptional storytelling and directorial prowess. The engaging voiceover narration coupled with authentic footage from the ships provides viewers with an immersive experience. The gripping storyline keeps audiences on the edge of their seats throughout the film&apos;s duration. It&apos;s a hidden gem that deserves broader recognition, perhaps even finding a place in educational curricula. I highly recommend it, especially to those with a passion for the sea and sailing.",

      "reviewBody": "I was a fan of Luc Besson since 1997, when I saw &quot;Léon&quot;. And since I saw that movie, I scoured every video store looking for his films. Some were easy to find (The Fifth Element and Nikita were broadcasted), some weren&apos;t (&quot;Subway&quot; and &quot;The Big Blue&quot; had to be imported). Atlantis was the kind of movie I never expected to get my hands on. So you can see what I looked like when a German site had the video on stock. I waited two long months, expecting to see that movie I always wanted to see. When the movie finally arrived, I turned off all the lights, covered the led of the video, covered the little light of the TV and sat in my room with the stereo real loud. And the movie was a child-like dream. I heard many people saying it was a failure, I heard many people saying it was boring... It&apos;s all lies. I can&apos;t describe the movie by writing what I thought of it. It&apos;s difficult to talk about a movie which doesn&apos;t talk to the ears but directly to the heart. Here we have the impression that there is another planet... down there. Like in the snake scene. She moves like the snakes do, but the water is so clear that it seems like she and the others around her are floating in a aetherium. And the impression I got during the movie was that sometimes we just have to open ourselves to the sheer experiences of life and let go. This movie plays in our minds like a beautiful dream, and there are few movies that can do it. The love of the director by the ocean has never been so clear. And by making this movie, he somewhat passes on his message and makes us love the ocean also. Full praise to this work of art! Besson never stopped amazing...",

The movie is very well paced, were thrown straight into the horror in the first 10 Min&apos;s (and this being a film by Darren Lynn Bousman (saw 2,3,4), there is plenty of horror on show)! Were barely introduced to the characters when the blood starts pouring, but i still found myself caring for each of them! With no sense of what was going to happen next or who was going to die, i was permanently on the edge of my seat! The show belongs to De Mornay, her performance as Mother is as chilling as Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, cool and calm on second but deadly the next. With some memorable deaths, each totally unexpected, and a few twists along the way, i found this film a real surprise and one every horror fan especially should check out!",

They catch Masters&apos; delivery boy Carl Cody (John Turturro). Masters&apos; lawyer Bob Grimes (Dean Stockwell) says Cody has to do 3 years. Chance&apos;s C.I. Ruth Lanier (Darlanne Fluegel) directs them to lawyer Max Waxman. Waxman was Cody&apos;s last stop and Masters suspects he set them up. Masters and his girlfriend Bianca Torres (Debra Feuer) go to demand repayment and ends up killing him. Chance steals Waxman&apos;s black book as he becomes more morally corrupt in order to take down Masters.\n\nWilliam Friedkin delivers a slick thriller of amoral cops and immoral everyone else. I love Dafoe&apos;s montage of counterfeiting. Friedkin delivers so many great action scenes. The wrong way car chase is the highlight and probably the height of his action work. It is so slick and so stylized that I accept the avant-garde artsy stuff. It fits into the movie. It also has an early bungee jump on film. This is one of the most fun 80s action thriller filled with relatively unknown actors at the time. I can&apos;t help but think of Michael Mann who was showrunning Miami Vice TV show at the time.",

How the forces of evil are kept at bay by a strong leader who will go any length to preserve the sanctity of his land and fellow men. Though set in modern times, Prajapati can easily be one of those period dramas where a brave warrior is out in the open with whatever he possesses to annihilate the dark forces. Mammootty and Siddique along with the co-actors (particularly, Seema) excelled every way in achieving this.",

      "reviewBody": "The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse represents my first venture into the world of Dr. Mabuse. Pigeon-holing this movie into a single genre is difficult. It&apos;s one part traditional krimi, one part spy movie, and one part thriller. Combined, these elements create, at least for me, a one of a kind experience that I really can&apos;t compare with much of anything I&apos;ve seen before. I refuse to give the normal plot synopsis. Any plot details or other information would ruin the many twists and surprises found in The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. Fortunately for me, I went into the movie completely blind, knowing very little of what to expect. I would suggest not even looking over the IMDb page as vital information is presented on Mabuse&apos;s identity. The acting is good from a cast that, even if I didn&apos;t know all of the names, I recognized from years of watching WWII movies. Actors like Gert Forbe, Werner Peters, and Peter van Eyck give sold performances. Fritz Lang&apos;s direction is as competent as ever. The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse has style to burn. Considering the movie was made more than 45 years ago, it still feels remarkably fresh. The mystery of who Dr. Mabuse is and what his fiendish plan is all about are wonderfully compelling and really pull you into the movie. The jazzy score is impossible to get out of your mind and fits well within the film. In short, it&apos;s movie like this that keeps me excited about exploring &quot;new&quot; cinema. If all of my first time viewings could be this entertaining, I would be very happy indeed.\n\nIf The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse has one weakness, it&apos;s the slow pace of the second act. The pace grinds to a crawl as the police begin their investigation into the events taking place. While it&apos;s fairly interesting and Gert Forbe is a good enough actor, there&apos;s not enough action in this portion of the film when compared with what came before and what comes afterward. A little more pep in the middle third of the film would have made it a real winner with me. It&apos;s a minor issue I have with the film, but it&apos;s an issue nonetheless.\n\nAs I wrote previously, The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse is the first Mabuse movie I&apos;ve seen. After my wonderful experience with the movie, it won&apos;t be the last.",

He plays Philip Knight, a television personality who regularly debunks certain myths on his show. He now is on assignment to do the same for a hotel magnate after one of four explorers of the title island-a Mitchell (Glenn Dixon)-comes back with a fixed stunned look. Coming along are Knight&apos;s secretary-Sarah Adams (Beverly Tyler), Barney Finch (Murvyn Vye), Matthew Gunn (Rhodes Reason), Claire Winter (Jean Engstrom), and Martin Schuyler (Elisha Cook, Jr.). I&apos;ll stop there and just say not much happens until the last 15 minutes. In fact, the most shocking thing that occurs involves a native pre-teen girl and one of the big plants. Of the performers, Karloff and somewhat Cook come off best though many of the others do well with the less-than-stellar material they&apos;re given. Still, like I said, the movie has its moments like this Karloff line that pretty sums up the near-universal appeal of horror films: &quot;The public loves to be scared. Excites the imagination. Makes them believe in the existence of things unreal.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "An isolated village of Mennonites in the Ukraine discovers that the country is now run by Communists. The local commander kills the village&apos;s scouts, and sends troops under Valéry Inkijinoff, who persuades pastor Friedrich Kayßler that it is their Christian duty to send their surplus food to a starving nation When that is done, Inkijinoff returns, he gives orders that everything but barely enough to get through the winter must be sent. He also starts to court Jessie Vihrog, Meanwhile, cynical Fritz Hoopts argues that the communists will destroy the village and must be fought. His position gains support as the troopers&apos; behavior grows more outrageous.\n\nThere were Mennonites in Russia. Catherine the Great,who had been a German princess, offered transportation, land, loans, and autonomy. By 1871, almost 80,000 immigrants had settled near the Black Sea and by the Volga.\n\nThis was tough to get through the first thirty or forty minutes. The communists were so very evil, and the visuals support this, with Inkijinoff leading his cavalrymen to the village, riding in long profile along mountain ridges, like Apaches in a John Ford western. He also offers a nicely textured performance as an officer since Tsarist days, complaining about the lack of beauty and happiness in the worker&apos;s paradise, and suggesting that Miss Vihrog flee the country with him.\n\nBut mostly it&apos;s hateful. Russians are stupid, communists are evil, and good peaceful Germans have no idea how awful they can be. Even the graceful camerawork by Sepp Allgeier can&apos;t overcome this. When the plot must move on, his camera falls still and it&apos;s all annoyance as you wait for the villagers to realize what&apos;s going on, and do something about it.",

The script is from the people who wrote HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, and this is just as intense. While the whole cast delivers fine performances, Kiefer Sutherland is the one who stands out and does a creepy job. It may be hard to watch at times, but I thought it was a rather moving and powerful film."

      "reviewBody": "Really? This made it into the After Dark series? This really strikes me as odd. I won&apos;t go into plot details because it&apos;s already been talked about. I&apos;ll just state my opinion. See below if you wish to compare your taste to mine.\n\nAs a fan of the genre since I was 5 years old (I&apos;m 35 now), and as a fan of the After Dark series, I do have to say that this is probably the worst movie I&apos;ve seen in awhile. And I&apos;ve seen some really bad stuff. I own about 3000 Horror movies and I&apos;ve watched at least 200 in this past year alone. I&apos;ve watched all of the ADH movies since 2006 and IMO it just keeps getting better every year. -Except for this one. Wow. It DRAGS. It&apos;s BORING. And not in the way that a decent psychological horror is slow. Nothing in this movie was done well and it wasn&apos;t even slightly entertaining to me. I found myself twirling my headphone cord and looking at the clock thinking, &quot;What? There&apos;s still almost an hour left?!&quot;. This movie gave me the same feeling as I get sitting in the waiting room at a doctor&apos;s office. And again, not slow in a good way like Rosemary&apos;s Baby (with build up, character development, decent performances, good dialog, and an unraveling plot). This was quite the opposite actually. It tried to be a psychological thriller, but had absolutely no heart. It was very mechanical and redundant. Obviously, I was quite disappointed because I love this series.\n\nPlease do not judge the After Dark series (Especially the third series) by this one. It&apos;s nowhere near as good as the rest of them. All of the others had something to grab a hold of, and many of them went far beyond that. This felt more like a made for TV movie that was rejected or something (and not because of the lack of gore, there are plenty of dead and tortured pigs in it). Very amateur, and again, not in a good way. Not in the way that we B-Movie hounds love so much.\n\nI feel bad writing this because whoever made it at least gave it a shot, but I really recommend skipping over this one and choosing something else from this series. I really hope this one doesn&apos;t turn people off to The After Dark Horrorfest, because most of the other movies in the series are extremely entertaining and fun! Examples of Horror That I Like: Phantasm, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, They Live, 28 Days Later, Night of the Living Dead, Eraserhead, Texas Chainsaw, The Shining, Sleepy Hollow, Alien, The Amittyville Horror, Creepshow, Children Shouldn&apos;t Play With Dead Things, The Ring, MBV3D, and all sorts of other classic, new, and/or low budget horror.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with anime. Quick flashes of artwork reconciled within the plot lines of the larger work have always felt more intrusive than they have integral to the total story, but, as could any reader, there&apos;s always something in there worth appreciating. Whether it&apos;s the personal history of the lovable lead or the angry clutter of a villain bent on destroying life, some element always gels, fueling the vicarious excitement for as long as I&apos;m willing to suspend disbelief.\n\nThen again  when the lead actress is an absolute knockout having the time of her life chewing scenery, slaying bad guys, and decked in spandex, who am I really kidding? The live-action (the term should be used loosely, as the film is full of heavy CGI sequences) adaptation of &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; feels like an idea that originated from anime but desperately desired to rise above the conventions of the literature. In this story, Honey  an ordinary office girl turned super-powerful android by magical uber-genius of her deceased scientist/father  is granted the chance of, well, her second lifetime: she can avenge dear ole dad&apos;s death by bringing an end to the notorious Panther Claw gang  but is she willing to risk the lives of her new-found friend, Detective Natsuko Aki (Mikako Ichikawa), in the process? Of course, androids have never been lovelier than this one embodied by Eriko Sato. As Honey, Eriko bears the weight of the film, delivering a performance of a visual marvel: her features strike an almost perfect balance between doe-eyed-anime-schoolgirl-cuteness and drop-dead-gorgeous-comic-book-heroine-beauty. She&apos;s perfectly cast, and it would appear that she knows it! She uses her feminine wiles and impish lunacy from start to finish with nothing short of total commitment. Such dedication should give even the most impotent Scrooge something to admire, if not a resurrection of male blood flow. Yes  she&apos;s  just  that  stunning. In her capable hands, what could have been a farce becomes a force to be reckoned with.\n\n&quot;Cutie Honey&quot; is not without its flaws. The high-fashion, sparkly camp design works well most of the time, coupled with some terrific special effects work. Anime sequences  largely used for flashbacks and battlefield filler  are impressive, but these scenes don&apos;t offer much to differentiate themselves from straight anime pictures. Despite or to the advantage of the goofy feel-good banter, the actors all seem to enjoy themselves, as it&apos;s clear that no one is taking this stuff too seriously.\n\nAt some points, I couldn&apos;t suppress the &quot;What am I watching?&quot; effect. Normally, a film like &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; is not my cup of tea  but, one scene later, I was drawn up into this goofy world once more, laughing at the campy villains or admiring what little fabric the costume designer refused to waste on Eriko&apos;s ordinary-girl-alter-ego outfits.\n\nDid I mention that Cutie is a real cutie? In the end, there&apos;s something wholesomely redeeming to watch a group of mismatched heroes take time out from saving the world to drink sake, let loose, and sing karaoke."

      "reviewBody": "Italy has long been a country for producing small films about everyday people,and &apos;La Pivellina&apos; is no exception. A middle aged woman,once a dashing figure in the Circus world is out looking for her dog,when she comes upon an abandoned two year old girl,Asia,sitting on the swing. Patty asks where her mother is,and Asia has no answer. Patty decides to look for both her dog,as well as Asia&apos;s (alleged)mother. Patty decides to take little Asia back to the trailer where she &amp; her husband,Walter live. Walter isn&apos;t exactly happy to have the toddler in tow (fearing police intervention),but agrees to let Asia stay,at least until Asia&apos;s mother turns up. When the mother shows no sign of coming back to get her daughter,the couple take care of little Asia (and end up bonding with her). With the help of a next door neighbour,Tairo,a 14 year old boy,they try to make an existence for the little girl. Will Asia&apos;s mother ever show up to reclaim Asia? This is a little film with a big heart that will work it&apos;s way to your heart. Documentary film makers, Tizza Covi &amp; Rainer Frimme co direct this little charmer of a film from a screen play written by Tizza Covi (who also acts as producer &amp; editor),with cinematography by Rainer Frimme (who makes very good use of hand held camera work,as well as co producer,too). The cast includes Patrizia Gerardi as Patty,Walter Saabel as Walter,Tairo Caroli as Tairo,and Asia Crippa as Asia. At long last,a film dealing with children that doesn&apos;t paint children as smart mouthed,snotty little punks that seem to know more than adults (Tairo actually looks up to Patty &amp; Walter with genuine respect &amp; admiration,and not as a couple of farty old fogies one would expect from your typical garden variety situation comedy). A film that is well worth seeking out for thinking persons who are sick to death of all of those predictable made for TV looking (so called)comedies. Spoken in Italian with English subtitles. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains some outbursts of rude language,and an unpleasant scene of animal abuse.",

Only prob is that this dog is out to kill all of aunt&apos;s enemies and does so by accidental car death, electrocution, strangulation and poison.\n\nLike you I was wondering why it didn&apos;t just rip the throats out of folks, but there you go. Maybe it was because the dog involved was such a cutey and no one could believe it could kill someone using it&apos;s teeth. Who knows.\n\nAlso, there&apos;s this sex scene that seems to involve body doubles, and the body double covering for the chick has bweuubs three times the size of the actress she&apos;s covering for so watch out for that.\n\nThis film is great!",

Although I&apos;m almost 21 and I still enjoy that kind of movies.\n\nIf you like De Funes, you&apos;ll surely like Coluche&apos;s movies.\n\nIt&apos;s the story about a cop who&apos;s really clumsy and gets himself into a lot of trouble. It&apos;s got that fabulous &apos;old&apos; French humour in it. What I mean with &apos;old&apos; is like de Funes or Pierre Richard. The new kind would be &apos;Mission Cleopatre&apos;. \n\nPeople has got to know who Coluche is. He&apos;s one of this people that made it by being themselves and who did a lot for the others (just take a look at Les Restos du Coeur - association which organizes once a year a big concert and a tour with a bunch of famous French actors and singers and with the money they collect they buy food for the poorer)\n\nAnyway if you want to spend a nice evening without too much thinking I recommend it.",

I enjoyed the way the small town was depicted; it felt curiously familiar and yet distant at the same time.  The movie holds its own, even 30 years after its initial release.\n\nThe jumping sequences are fantastic...truly the finest jump sequences ever captured on film at that time (1969).  Pay particular attention to the &apos;cape&apos; jumps, particularly the last one (Scott Wilson&apos;s) which gets me bug-eyed every time I see it (yes, I&apos;m a jumper too).\n\nLongish and slow-moving at times but well worth it."

I have searched for information about the original teleplay, but have been unsuccessful. Does anyone out there have any info on the TV broadcast of this story?\n\nSeveral years later, I read Frank M.

      "reviewBody": "Considering Caro&apos;s past work in the movie field, one can really look forward to see his latest film as director : Dante 01.\n\nWell I have to say I was for one really eager to do so and as I watched the movie, even as a full open minded viewer, some scenes were feeling just ... incomplete. The thematic is quite fine, a deep space station used as a psychiatric facility is exiting knowing the visual taste of Caro and the cast is well done too, but in the end every way you look at it the movie never fully unfold his potential.\n\nThe story, as mysterious it can be, fail to be emotional or understandable at any level which is really disappointing considering you can&apos;t connect to any character at all - especially not with the main one - having a feeling of emptiness despite the solid material that could have been used in a much better way.\n\nThe budget isn&apos;t large for this movie, that&apos;s obvious and still the director pulled some extremely good shots and some solid acting while being uneven at times (considering the budget, I can only guess that some takes as to be done only a few times), still, beyond that there is nothing to properly think of. As said, the story was somewhat promising at the beginning ... and sadly looks still promising at the end, it&apos;s a tale with a slow beginning and no real end or ground to rely on - an etheral narration with some pretty visuals and scenes empty of meaning.\n\nIf I were to make a comparison, I&apos;d pick &quot;The fountain&quot;. They look alike in many ways, sharing a radical vision of movie-making and story telling but where the fountain kept me involved in the character development process and opened some thoughts, &quot;Dante 01&quot; just got me lost somewhere loosing the meaning of it&apos;s concept - or maybe I never got it in the first place.\n\nOverall, the movie itself isn&apos;t bad and you can see it without regrets it&apos;s still a nice movie but it&apos;s nothing more and that is probably the most disappointing thing about it : you don&apos;t feel more than looking at an OK film. Now, I do hope Caro will be directing again and with a better budget and more freedom over his uncompromising style, making this one just a trial step for better materials next time."

      "reviewBody": "A master visual allegorist reaches farther and fails. But not for the reasons others claim here. Greenaway has never centered his films in the narrative -- we&apos;d always be frustrated to look for satisfaction there. (`Drowning&apos; which among his works most delivers a story does so incidentally.) And this is a film about women, not sex, which will frustrate others.\n\nHere is his most character-driven film. At last, he works on closeups and some character definition. The primary ordering of the film is by basic archetypes of women, particularly archetypes drawn by men. This is supposed to be his most painterly film: the representative women are to be presented in scenes that reference famous paintings. Greenaway has stated that painting cuts to the basic drivers in cultural revolution, and the representations of women therein are tokens for everything conceived. Women thus are both humans and basic tokens in the redefinition of life.\n\nSuch a rich conception is thoroughly Greenawayan and might have formed the skeleton for another masterpiece. Along the way, we have by now familiar devices. Numbers: random as in pachinko rather than ordered. Contrasts between Eastern (here just Japanese) and Western management of concept and image. Some slight use of layered images, here in the self-reference of displaying the screenplay.\n\nMy complaints are two. I consider them fatal, but still celebrate Greenaway.\n\nThe notion of archetype depends on clarity, a natural orthogonality and completeness of classes. Here we have the nun, whore, Chinadoll, servant, cripple, childbearer, fetishist, butch, and spontaneous addict. Time is invested in defining these. A few are singled out to be something more than props for lush compositions: the geisha chinadoll, the lesbian accountant, the gambler and the opportunistic, openly enthusiastic whore. But in bringing them to life, they escape their categories: two of these are male impersonators, another two financial manipulators, another two vamps. Three are Japanese. Usually, Greenaway&apos;s combination of painting (erudite structure and framing of scenes) and film (narrative, development) reinforce one another. Here, they dissonate.\n\nThe second problem may be more fundamental. You really have to know your stuff to enjoy these films. My knowledge of The Tempest is rather deep, so I saw how rich was `Prospero&apos;s Books.&apos; I read up on restoration comedy for `Draughtsman,&apos; and discovered art in the viewing that I presume no one else in the theater saw. This film is supposed to reference the feminine archetype not as defined by popular culture, but by the history of painting. My knowledge of the art is poor, so I cannot attest to how deep the annotations are here. (Little use is made here of the layered image and narrative comment. Wonder why, since it would have been so natural.\n\nBut I do know Gauguin, who also was a visual allegorist, who also worked with feminine archetypes and also the fascination with Asian differences. His monumental canvas `Where are We Going?&apos; does just what this film purports.\n\nI wonder if there is little there in this film."

Personally, I think the movie is fantastic."

      "reviewBody": "We all know Cujo is a giant St. Bernard that has to kill because he is rabid.  The film works as a horror film because of that concept, but this film and the story writer behind it believe that paybacks are a bitch. Retribution is always around the corner and when it is your time, you don&apos;t know if it is going to from a guy in a hockey mask, a massive great white shark,a 58 red and white Plymouth Fury, some idiot with long finger knives or a lovable Saint Bernard.  Whatever it is though, sin always accounted for.  Cujo subscribes to that theory.\n\nEveryone that dies in this film, with the exception of maybe one, does so because they are not very likable people to begin with.  They are all tainted and when Cujo gets a hold of them, we are almost glad that he wants their blood.  But it is the climax of the film that is the most intriguing. Because here we have a woman who has gotten rid of her sin.  But she now has to face the music not for what she is doing, but for what she has done. And if you read the book, you will see that it sticks to that theory and message much more than the film does.  It is understood that Cujo has to have a happy Hollywood ending, and that is fine, but the book tells a much more clear yet paradoxically convoluted tale of a boy, his dog, and how sin is never really forgiven.\n\nWhat is also great about Cujo is how it shows the dog coming unravelled. We see the transformation from lovable suck of a family dog, to vicious killing machine that has an insatiable need for blood.  We see his nose get more wet, we see how certain noises bother him more and we see how much saliva this dog has stored up in his nasty mouth.\n\nCujo is a good movie.  It is scary, especially the last half hour and it actually has a point.  It also does a fairly good job of bringing King&apos;s vision to life.  It is not easy to do that, after all King has a very vivid imagination.  But Cujo comes close.  Very close",

You simply have to put aside the serious side of your life for an hour and half and join the characters in a charming story of love, life and success!\n\nJennifer Aniston puts in a convincing performance as the independent and determined Kate Mosley, and Jay Mohr plays the sweet and lovable Nick. Both of these stars fit perfectly into this movie and truly bring it to life.\n\nI received this movie as a gift from a friend and after the first time I saw it I was hooked... I have now seen it many, many times and it still captures my imagination and my heart.\n\nContrary to popular belief - you don&apos;t have to be a slushy romantic at heart or even a Jennifer Aniston fan to enjoy this movie. With that in mind I strongly recommend Picture Perfect to anyone and everyone!"

I suspect that the town in this film looked a whole lot like those in the rural northwest at the turn of the last century.\n\nWarren Beatty in one of the title roles as a gambler whose specialty is the bluff arrives in town with the intention of setting up a bordello. But it&apos;s not until Julie Christie arrives, a professional madam with a string of girls hat the operation really takes off.\n\nAs the business grows so grows the town. Note how director Robert Altman has the look of the town spruce up bit by bit as the film progresses. Makes the town look attractive to speculators and as it does the cracks in Beatty&apos;s flawed character show.\n\nA big mining concern wants to buy Beatty and Christie out they&apos;re not squeamish about methods. Beatty&apos;s persona is deflated and the citizens realize he&apos;s all bluff.\n\nJulie Christie got an Oscar nomination for her role as Best Actress as the take life as it comes madam. But it&apos;s Beatty you will remember. His character is both outrageous and vulnerable.\n\nThe west was really like this.",

Her only option is hiring drunken war hero Patrick O&apos;Malley (Tom Selleck) and his mechanic Struts (Jack Weston). Under fire from pursuing gunmen, they fly two biplanes from Turkey to Afghanistan and eventually China where Bradley is leading villagers in a battle against a local ruthless warlord.\n\nIt&apos;s a rather simplistic &apos;road&apos; movie. It&apos;s an action adventure following the successful footsteps of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The characters are simply drawn. Certainly, Selleck has a bit of Indy in him. The romantic chemistry is also drawn from that road map. I do like the flying although action is not always there. At least, that&apos;s what I remember most before watching it again recently. Of course, it&apos;s inferior to Raiders but it still works.",

      "reviewBody": "Cookers was quite a movie. When I made my first attempt to watch it, I was expecting to see a simple story about drug addicts fighting off evil spirits, much like any other low budget haunted house horror flick that we&apos;ve all seen before, but with an interesting twist in that the main characters were speed freaks. After watching about thirty minutes I had to shut it off to take a break. With only three characters and an empty house in the woods, Cookers manages to create such a tense and unsettling atmosphere that I found it to be almost unbearable at times.\n\nThe story could indeed be viewed as a simple one, as we see a young couple, Hector and Dorena, who are on the run with a crystal meth lab in their van and are looking for a place to set up shop for a while to lay low. With the help of Hector&apos;s buddy Merle, they find a secluded house that has been abandoned on the outskirts of town and make it their temporary home. Dorena is a &quot;cooker&quot;, who specializes in actually making the crystal meth so that it can be sold on the street. Hector&apos;s specialty is doing crystal meth, so they are a good couple. Things get spooky and strange very quickly after Hector and Dorena get high, as the house may not be completely empty after all... Are they seeing ghosts or just hallucinating? And will Merle eventually betray them to cash in on the deal himself? Brad Hunt plays Hector, and he deserves much credit for holding this flick together. His acting in Cookers is award worthy. I don&apos;t remember ever seeing a junkie portrayed with such realism. Cyia Batten as Dorena was also impressive. The two of them worked very well together. Even Patrick McGaw was believable as Merle, who provided brief moments of comic relief and added a much-needed element to the film. All three actors delivered the goods and were always interesting to watch.\n\nCookers also succeeds in the writing and directing department. Although it doesn&apos;t have a big budget, the few special effects that we do see are suited to the shooting style of the film, and never distract from the overall sense of &quot;what&apos;s real and what&apos;s not&quot; that keeps you guessing until the end. But this movie is not about building to a big twist or tricking its viewer. It is about drawing you into a bleak world of fear and hopelessness, and director Dan Mintz does an admirable job in capturing these emotions on film. Jack Moore and Jeff Ritchie wrote the script, and it is fresh with gritty realism and excellent dialog. Merle tells a bizarre story one night as the three of them are getting stoned, and it is truly chilling. Dorena also tells a story to Hector about her past, and it was heart wrenching.\n\nCookers is not a film for everyone, nor do I think that I will ever watch it again. It is a movie that I will always remember, and one that I am very glad that I saw. Although the ending is somewhat weak, it is a relentless and riveting story that will appeal to those with an open mind who are in the mood for something different.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;David Watson&quot; (Charlie Schlatter) is an 18-year-old college freshman who is in the process of attempting to pledge to a fraternity. His worst antagonist is a senior in that same fraternity named &quot;Russ&quot; (Anthony Starke) who just so happens to have a girlfriend by the name of &quot;Robin Morrison&quot; (Jennifer Runyon) who David is also quite smitten with. In any case, one night while out with his grandfather, &quot;Jack Watson&quot; (George Burns) an auto accident creates a situation in which the soul of Jack is transplanted into David-and vice versa. So now, rather than being 81 years old, Jack is now 18. And being extremely outgoing, Jack becomes quite determined to make the most of the situation. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was a pretty good comedy all around with both George Burns and Charlie Schlatter performing in a fine manner. Likewise, having an attractive actress like Jennifer Runyon certainly helped to improve the scenery as well. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

As always in Boisset movies, trouble isn&apos;t very far ahead and takes the form of a cold blooded Tòmas Milian who kidnaps the child and Julie and asks for a ransom.\n\nNo one is innocent here, except for little Thomas, and nothing is what it seems.  The major force of the movie being its casting, the co-production allowing Boisset to use Italian as well as French actors.  Jobert is right on spot, Milian refrains from using his usual wide palette of grins (and is given an awful accent in the french dubbed version), and Michael Lonsdale is a decent enough corrupted bourgeois !  Victor Lanoux plays the menacing and simple ex convict, belly pot and sleazy eyes included.\n\nWith an engaging musical score, a simple and effective storyline, and enough plot twists to keep anybody awake, FOLLE À TUER should be released on DVD along with Boisset&apos;s finest, in a perfect world.\n\nI&apos;ve never been disappointed by this amazing director, and I will keep on digging in the slowly fading VHS crates to find more of his masterpieces, that&apos;s for sure."

Well, I cared, in the same sense that I care when I see a pile-up on the freeway.  Still, if you like Travolta&apos;s hairy chest this is a good one watch it in.

The cinematography, the acting, the costuming was of the highest quality. \n\nAs a child I did not really read the Madeline series of books, but I did as an adult, and I found that this screenplay and production bring the book to life. At a time and in a society where there is so much negative entertainment, this was a pleasant offering. It was uplifting. It even had just enough suspense to make it interesting for adults.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a B-grade movie and you should go in expecting one. Certainly, it won&apos;t win over many critics. Still, there are some thrills in this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller. Even though, it leaves a middling aftertaste. Thankfully, it runs at a lean 89 minutes and doesn&apos;t waste too much time in exposition, which are sometimes cringe-worthy. For me, it does throw in a few interesting ideas, which prevent it from being just another cookie-cutter entry in the increasingly stale genre.\n\nFirst, the aliens. Instead of taking on the snarly form we&apos;ve seen in countless films, they are invisible to the human eye and exist in the form of microwave energy. The only way they can be detected is when they pass through an object powered by electricity. And they kill humans by turning them into ashes. Because the aliens can&apos;t be seen, the killings are unpredictable.\n\nSecond, I like the idea of transposing the American protagonists and the apocalypse to a foreign city, Moscow, instead of the trite New York City or Los Angeles. The stereotypes of Russian culture are played for laughs, though most of the jokes come across flat. However, you get to relish the many famous sights and landmarks such as The Red Square, in ruins.\n\nIn terms of characters, most of them are disposable. Even the leads, Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby and Max Minghella come across as likable at best, but not memorable. It doesn&apos;t help that they are given lame one-liners. I wish they had given the eccentric Russian electrician and his cacophony of gadgets more screen time.\n\nThe Darkest Hour has a great setup. Pity the makers didn&apos;t have the balls to strive beyond formula. Even if the ending sets it up for a sequel, I reckon its box office performance will convince the studio they need one.",

Allan Dwan was a master, and an unappreciated one. This is more than likely his finest work, and one that doesn&apos;t seem to get its proper due. It&apos;s a tale of camaraderie, love of country, and . . . well heck, it&apos;s doing the right thing. Today&apos;s cinematic &apos;heroes&apos; just don&apos;t do that any more.\n\nThere are no fiery explosions, four-letter words, car crashes, etc., but the action is wonderful. The humor is magnificent, and the script id done well. If you want to show a silent film to someone who&apos;s never seen one, this is the one to show them. (Then, after they&apos;ve loved it, show them a Lon Chaney or DeMille&apos;s KING OF KINGS.)",

      "reviewBody": "I found this film because I was interested in the script by also- novelist Vladimir Sorokin, and it wasn&apos;t disappointed. It turned out to be an intelligent, subtle, thoughtful screenplay that seems to have been treated with huge respect by the filmmakers. That&apos;s important because in terms of several elements including not just the scenario and dialogue but also the pacing and visual images, this is a very daring and ambitious piece of film. \n\n&quot;Targets&quot; is very atypically structured and paced: it&apos;s long, and its narrative-- which while basically chronological does indulge in flashback scenes -- is not really straightforward. And I think that helps it in delineating and very original treatment of an age old fountain-of-youth theme. \n\nWe focus of several rich Muscovites who discover an area with special properties to stop again. And the central contradiction of their seeking of it is explored powerfully in several ways: these are people for whom life is empty, and they seek to prolong it by extending it. But they are treated very humanly, and so this strong satire on the emptiness of wealth and its centrality to modern life rarely ends up seeming mean-spirited. Instead the lives of the protagonists play out like several individual bleak and touching personal tragedies. \n\nOccasionally, things pill slightly over the top, and often this is in the parodies of sections of TV shows, but become a bit too heavy- handed making the still-good point, but detract little from the whole. \n\nWhile the pace is slow, the film to me never felt dull, but rather fascinating. Sincere and quietly-intense acting from all parties, interesting, significant camera-work, and sometime-shocking but always well-executed set pieces contribute to this. \n\nAnother important theme running parallel to the agonies introduced by eternal you is a pair of glasses that an distinguish good and evil, down to the physical good or evil properties of types of matter. And this invention ends up being of no use, scoffed when introduced to the public. Like eternal youth, the ability to know right from wrong with certainty is a long-sought and implausible goal that when attained reaps no helpful rewards.\n\nAn intelligent film whose ambition pays off. I&apos;m sure that repeated viewings will reveal more nuances, which in itself is a sign of a success.",

      "reviewBody": "Its interesting now that Uwe Boll seems to be pursuing some sort of artistic intentions with his cinema to see this early work and realise that his mainstream offerings were never his first love, that he had some sort of a plan all along. I&apos;ve actually only seen one of his films, the lamentable Seed so I have no comment on his general qualities, but Amoklauf is a successful little film if not an especially entertaining or interesting one. Its a study in a private and dysfunctional personality, in lonely obsession and ultimate bloody breaking point. Our nameless protagonist is a waiter, but mostly he stays at home watching videotapes, a German game show, slaughterhouse and execution footage apparently from Faces of Death and finally a porno. He also fantasies about murder, masturbates and philosophizes that man is a worthless creature who will suffer anything just to survive. Not a pleasant or stable individual in essence, and the film puts us right there with him. We watch his TV through his eyes, sometimes we watch his TV with him, sometimes we watch his face as he watches his TV. We see his apartment as well, sometimes we see him go about mundane rites and sometimes we see him just sit there. Its a fitting mixture of ennui and unpleasantness, as the film goes a cold, twitchy feeling accumulates, and a bleak tension along with nagging boredom, by the final ten minutes its hard not to fair pray for the guy to snap. And snap he does with memorably grim intensity in a skillfully stylised scene that uses changes in film stock, slow motion and grainy close ups to highlight the alienation, granting an almost lyrical mood. A classy cap off in other words and it pretty much makes the whole experience worthwhile. On the whole this is difficult to recommend though. Its a film that cares little for engagement, nor poetry or depth in its subject. It works as an exercise in nihilism, perhaps almost perfectly as unlike something like Angst it lacks visual fascination or genuine fear, it doesn&apos;t transcend its subject matter with much in the way of added aesthetic value until the climax and that&apos;s just a fraction of the overall runtime. But this bare nihilism simply isn&apos;t that fulfilling, it works somewhat as a curio but as cinema is frankly a bit lacking. Not that I actually disliked the experience, I&apos;ve just come to prefer work that has more to offer. A bit hard to rate this one as it does what it sets out to do, isn&apos;t actually bad and may even be pretty worthy to some tastes. 5/10 oughta cover it I think.",

And yet you can&apos;t take your eyes off him when he&apos;s on screen, hoping for a flash of human feeling, which never comes.\n\nFortunately, in this picture he is surrounded by good actors giving great performances, and they pick up the slack for him. Claire Trevor carries the load here as a woman attracted to evil personified, in Tierney. Audrey Long, Walter Slezak and Elisha Cook,Jr. all shine in support.\n\nStarting a new paragraph for Esther Howard whom I can&apos;t recall seeing before but who gives a soulful, heartbreaking performance as a drunken landlady, a performance which should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination. She wasn&apos;t just good - she was perfect.\n\n&quot;Born To Kill&quot; is one of the best of the Film Noir genre and is shamefully neglected in noir seminars and festivals.

The killer was annoying. He wasn&apos;t scary, and every line of his was quoting poetry and speaking with an accent to make him sound snooty. It didn&apos;t really make him seem more deranged and interesting. It was just annoying.\n\nThe first few minutes really had me thinking the movie was going to be worth watching, but I couldn&apos;t believe I actually finished the movie because it really just had very little to offer as far as keeping me interested.

      "reviewBody": "A British army officer is forced to redeem himself after being branded a coward by his Army buddies and the woman he loves. Improbably, he decides to go off to the war in the Sudan to rescue his fallen comrades. That is the gist of this story--but it makes a powerful, absorbing British film in excellent early Technicolor. \n\nJune Duprez is the scornful woman, pretty as a picture in the only feminine role. Uncharismatic British actor John Clements is only adequate as the man who receives the &quot;four feathers&quot; and must redeem himself--but Ralph Richardson has the most memorable scenes as the sun-struck soldier who loses his helmet under the blazing sun and is blinded. Many gripping scenes as the hero undertakes a long journey to the Sudan.\n\nHandsome Alexander Korda production rightfully deserves its ranking as a screen classic of 1939, but I have to say it&apos;s not without its faults as far as the structure of the story goes. \n\nFirst of all, too much time is spent on hundreds of extras in battle scenes that become repetitious after awhile and interrupt the flow of the story and what is happening with our hero. Furthermore, the actor chosen for the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; role of Haversham is John Clements, and much of his performance is too stiff to come alive. A more appealing and charismatic actor from that era would have sufficed and made the story stronger. Thirdly, there&apos;s a hint of incredibility in the tale of a man who would go to such extremes to regain his honor and go on a mission in which he would be reunited with the very men who scorned him. A bit much in the realm of credibility, but it does make a good story.\n\nSumming up: Good adventure tale in which C. Aubrey Smith has one of his most memorable character roles as a stuffy &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; type of career soldier recounting his favorite war tales.",

While the documentary ideology is slanted heavily toward the pro&apos;s rather then the con&apos;s, it does justice to the overall vision of what is being accomplished.\n\nI took in this film in a Cleveland institute and was really caught up in what the filmmaker was trying to capture.  With live footage from the houses to set-up, the whole philsophy was interwoven within the work.  Regardless of if you take altering substances or not, go for the DJ&apos;s or just to let go and be free, raves are as positive as they were presented.\n\nStaying true to form of 1960&apos;s culture documentaries (i.e. Woodstock, Haight Ashbury work), Circuitry shows that people can come together and understand each other through something as easy to understand as music.  But this could just be an illusion due to the fact that we are not suppose to enjoy life and explore each other....B+ Grade"

      "reviewBody": "It seems 1998 was the year Hollywood turned to the idea of the world being decimated by objects from outer space to fuel their disaster films. Both &apos;Deep Impact&apos; and &apos;Armageddon&apos; were released in that year but while I did enjoy the thrill and special effects of the latter film, I find &apos;Deep Impact&apos; the superior of the two.\n\nThe film begins when a teenage amateur astronomer discover a comet on a direct collision course for the Earth. The world is then thrown into turmoil has humanity has to accept their possible extinction. While NASA sends a shuttle up with the intention to try to blow the comet to bits, the US government selects people to be saved in a cave they are building to withstand the event. Focusing on various unrelated characters, the film shows how people react differently to the destruction of all that they know.\n\nThe brilliant cast, including Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert Devall, Elijah Wood, Ron Eldard and many others, all given great depictions of their characters. It is because of their ability to bring their respective characters to life that &apos;Deep Impact&apos; stands up so well as it is a very emotional and character driven story, as opposed to &apos;Armageddon&apos;, which relied much more on humour and special effects to sell it. Téa Leoni is the only one who doesn&apos;t shine through like her co-stars as her performance is quite bland and doesn&apos;t capture her character&apos;s turbulent emotions. However, as the rest of the cast give great performances, it&apos;s easy to overlook her. And even though there is much attention given to establishing the characters doesn&apos;t mean the film skimps when it comes to the special effects. Both the scenes in space and those on Earth when the comet hits the planet are well-handled visually. It features some of the best special effects of planetary annihilation that I&apos;ve ever seen (and I&apos;m a big fan of these disaster flicks).\n\nWhat makes &apos;Deep Impact&apos; rather unique in terms of disaster films is that it gives a very human side to tragedy and devastation by showing how ordinary people cope in times of crisis but it avoids the trap of being trite and overly-sentimental. It&apos;s a shame the film is so underrated then as it is a film that would appeal to sci-fi fans and those seeking an interesting story with strong characters.",

My high school (Great Falls High) was the school used in the beginning of the film, and the locker room the team is in happens to be the girl&apos;s locker room. David Morse&apos;s character lives above a vacuum place downtown. The hospital in the movie used to actually be the old Colombus hospital, but is now a office building.\n\nThe twins in the movie (Matt and Paul Pippinich), I went to school with for 7 years, and that old orange truck is theirs. Matt played clarinet in a dixieland jazz band.\n\nWhen I saw this movie at the Wilma theater in Missoula, MT, one of the directors was there to answer questions. He said that they chose Great Falls (pop. approx. 60,000) for shooting &quot;because it was sort of the town that time forgot.&quot; In some ways, this is true, but the city is not as run down and rural as it appears in the movie.\n\nOverall, I found myself enjoying this movie more for the &quot;hey, I know him!&quot; or &quot;I lived 2 miles from there&quot; situations. While this wasn&apos;t a movie that I would want to watch repeatedly, I still highly suggest it for rental. It&apos;s more than just a &quot;sports&quot; movie.\n\nAlso, a stellar soundtrack that makes the movie that much better."

      "reviewBody": "I can tell why this film was such a big hit in Korea, it has a lot of elements that Asian audiences love to watch especially it&apos;s humor. The Korean humor of it fit right in with the movie, and although Korea really isn&apos;t known for making great comedies, this one really worked. And it&apos;s mix of funny, sad and touching moments kept me entertained throughout the whole film and although there is quite a bit of singing in this, it was well done as well, but wished they took the stuff about the kid in the story being a prodigy at playing cards, playing the piano, and etc in order to be likable. I also though the part of Cha Tae-Hyun singing in order to impress the teacher to be lame and not necessary, maybe it&apos;s cause he just doesn&apos;t have the charisma or cause he is just not a likable character. Anyways, nothing about this movie seemed really forced even the dramatic moments and the comedy worked fine as well. So any one who is into Korean movies, I recommend you check it out even if some of the Korean humor is difficult to understand for some.\n\n7.9/10",

One is, of course, the love story between Lala and Ailín, which was in danger of taking a back seat when this huge event happens — that is always a danger in LGBT and/or women-led films by the way, but in here, it wonderfully does not. Another is race, class, privilege, and the justice system. The issues shown here about Argentina are not anomalies. While all of these and more could&apos;ve been better-crafted, this film is still definitely a gem. I like Director Lucia Puenzo&apos;s choices to tell this specific story about these specific characters, when other directors could&apos;ve chosen easier ways out. I can&apos;t wait to watch more from her."

Mulholland drive gives you a puzzle to solve. Giving the fact that in 2024 I watched a 2001&apos;s film with slow and steady shots and scene development it still had my complete attention. I wish to see more of such genre to be presented in 2024 and in Indian cinema.\n\nNaomi watts!! What a brilliant actor. Once you see the film and try to understand what and why the director showed you, you will understand the depth of Naomi&apos;s character and her amazing skills and understand the character she played.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember seeing a small handbill in a college basement around 1980. One of the films to be screened was THE END OF AUGUST AT THE HOTEL OZONE. The title intrigued, but, being the typical &quot;too busy College Student&quot; I did not attend the showing. So, for about a quarter century the title just lingered in my memory. Unreachable. I&apos;ve NEVER heard of it screening anywhere, playing on TV or available on video or DVD (even in bootleg form). The title itself was so tantalizing, promising perhaps something apocalyptic (END OF &quot;THE WORLD&quot; not &quot;AUGUST&quot; perhaps?) or mysterious (a Hotel in the Ozone Layer?). And, of course, its sheer scarcity could only enhance the mystery, the suspense. Then, there it was in the American Cinematheque schedule. Oh, NO, I wasn&apos;t going to miss it this time! I had been up for work since 4 AM (!) and had worked a full 12 hour day. But, I was NOT to be denied! While the film does not quite live up to its evocative title (there was no reasonable way it could), it&apos;s still a fine Eastern European contribution to the Post-Nuke, End-Of-The-World and Lord of the Flies sub-genre(s).\n\nAfter an oblique reference to the Nuclear calamity that man inflicted upon itself some 15 years earlier, the film proper begins slowly as we come to find a band of young, presumably fertile women, led by a wise old sage. I emphasize the word slowly, because the pace is off-putting at first. Events do happen and we get a picture of the women&apos;s pathetic and lonely existence. I particularly admired the fact that they are not scrubbed clean, shaved, manicured and primped and prettified as they doubtless would have been in an American production - Remember all those &quot;lost women&quot; films where the tribal women look like beauty contestants (indeed a couple of the actresses are very attractive, just unkempt)?! But, the glacial pacing is almost enough to drive most viewer&apos;s patience beyond the brink. Once the group stumbles upon an old man and his &quot;Hotel Ozone&quot;, the film comes into its own. While the viewer is naturally inclined to sympathize with the women (if they had been men would we be so accepting?) despite some cruel, savage and disturbing activities (particularly towards animals), slowly we come to see a fuller and less positive view towards them. This reversal is doubtless intentional and packs a strong visceral punch. The final images of this band of lost ladies wandering a barren landscape is both heart-breaking and depressingly believable.\n\nIt&apos;s to the film&apos;s credit that we are not given a false or tidy ending: Befitting a title as gloriously ambiguous as THE END OF AUGUST AT THE HOTEL OZONE."

The twists and turns in the story surprised and captivated me. Until near the end, I never knew where this very interesting plot would unfold. The writing on this show is A+. Jenna Elfman (who I&apos;d only seen as Dharma) was far more talented (and sexy) than I&apos;d realized. She was totally believable in all aspects of her character(s). Kate Burton as her attorney was superb as was Sam Robards who played her &quot;lover,&quot; Dr. Stillman. This movie was a real surprise treat. Guess I&apos;m a new Lifetime fan, and I may even start tuning into Glee. :-)",

Thus the movie may not mean so much to other nationalities and the rating may lead to wrong impressions/expectations. There seems no solution to this rating problem, but maybe the source of the rating could somehow be noted down somewhere... In this way the visitor will be able to see that (1) it is a masterpiece of Turkish cinema (due to high rating) (2) It has only been watched and rated by mostly Turkish people so far (due to source of rating). In time more people from all over the world might have opportunity to watch and rate this film and we can finally have a &quot;universal&quot; rating for it.",
