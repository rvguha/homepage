        "reviewBody": "I love these shorts! I should preface by saying, I am a female who likes longer shorts but not too long, and needs the bigger pockets. (shorts for females just don&apos;t have adequate pockets these days). These are the perfect length and hit just where I like them above the knee. The pockets are great, I love that the front ones are deep enough to hold my phone and other things like chapstick and keys. I like the zipper on the back right pocket, the only thing I would maybe change there is making those a little deeper to fit a phone better when you do want to zip it up. (I have an iPhone 13 and it&apos;s just tall enough that it doesn&apos;t zip). These shorts breath really well in the heat, dry quick when getting wet/splashed and are the perfect amount of stretch. I have now purchased a pair in almost every color. Would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone, male or female!",

These dry super fast and are pretty casual looking. They&apos;re very functional on the outdoor side of the house. Back pocket has a zipper to keep your treasures secured, and the pockets are mesh, making these pretty water friendly. Aside from functionality they still look good enough to grab a couple beers in. Highly recommend them and will probably be picking up a couple pairs. New go to shorts.",

It&apos;s also a black hole and difficult to find anything in the bucket. I ended up having to unpack everything and repack it every two days. I like my items more organized than what this bag offers.  Also, the clips and some of the buckles are very cheap and flimsy.\n\nWhat I really liked were the load lifters and the solid hip belt.  I have problems with lower back pain and this helped with that and it also kept a lot of weight off my shoulders.",

I love the interior and exterior cinch straps. The zippers and pulls seem very sturdy. It took me a minute to get the straps adjusted properly, but once I did, this was comfortable to wear. It fit in the overhead of the planes I was on. I love that it will sit upright on the floor when you put it down. I hope this pack lasts me many years.",

I docked it one star because of the single use aspect of the product-why not create a silicone insert that is size specific for the most popular ovens and let us reuse. Camp Chef and Lodge are you listening?\n\nI have attached a video of one being used in just the perfect situation.",

Felt secure, good storage, accessible items.\r\n\r\nBut lately the elastic loops that go around the top of the water flasks have stretched out to the point they dont hold the flasks up anymore which makes it really annoying &amp; difficult having to fish out a rubbery soft flask out of the holder mid-run. I havent tried anything else yet so not sure if this is unique to Salomon but definitely annoying.",

        "reviewBody": "I would give it a 3.5 of 5 starts. Love the ‘no slosh’ bladders and overall snug fit and various pockets / compartments to carry things. Bladders hold enough fluid for about a 10m run. Vest is overall a great design and I would recommend it to others. Some improvements: sizing chart is off. I have a 40” chest. Per the dimension guidance (foto #2) I ordered a Medium. However, the actual vest is very tight causing the bladders to be way off to the side (foto #1) making them hard to reach when running - I need to take both hands and pull the bladder towards my mouth to drink. Secondly, it’s pretty hard to get the elastic string inside the clasp. The clasp mouth should either be slightly wider, or have more of an angled bevel to help guide the string to its mouth. It takes about 3-4 tries to get the string inside the claps. Again, I do like the vest, but think these corrections would help.",

        "reviewBody": "Got this shoe after having the previous generation (just titled Trailcross) for several years, which fit me as well as any shoe I&apos;ve owned - snug but really comfortable with a half length, low profile arch support in them.\n\nThis shoe&apos;s design is terrible from a fit perspective: the fit is fine from the heel to the arch, where everything is relatively snug and form fitting, but after that things get pretty weird. The entire toe box feels like it&apos;s been shifted inwards a quarter inch on each shoe, meaning that the outside of my feet (specifically the outermost point of the 5th metatarsal) have a huge pressure point with the shoe while the inside of each foot has plenty of space. On top of that, the toe box is WAY bigger than it needs to be in terms of volume so my forefeet are swimming in these (I can almost lift the ball of my foot off the bottom of the shoe with the laces tied), which is the last thing you want during a rowdy downhill section.\n\nI bought these without trying them on first (my fault) because I assumed they&apos;d fit enough like the previous version to work fine and I liked the styling better, but this is a completely different shoe that is a big miss for me.",

Initially she was worried the leg straps would be too tight but after wearing them for a top/lead session at our local gym she felt they were simply felt &apos;snug&apos;, and not uncomfortable at all. She was also really pleased at how breathable the harness is. One can get pretty sweaty under the Momentum, but that is not the case with the Airnet.

XS would have been best.  Harness is VERY light and is noticeably different than my old one I was used to.  Have taken hard vertical and cave lead falls on it -- I&apos;m still here!

They performed surprisingly well on wet damp muddy trails with lots of rocks and roots exposed.  Climbing on slick roots is not fun but these XC tires did a surprisingly good job.  A pair of these in 2.6 would be a hell of a fun tire!   These are not a mud tire or heavy duty downhill tire but they are great all around tire for a XC hard tail.",

        "reviewBody": "I replaced the stock tires on my Trek when they wore out (500 miles).  So far the Barzo&apos;s seem like a great tire.  They mounted easily, I use tubes so I can not comment on a tubeless setup.   They far surpass the ride, grip and performance of the Bontrager XR2&apos;s I had.   I mostly ride my MTB in dry to semi moist conditions with an occasional mud hole and gravel trails thrown in.   I am not an extreme MTB or XC racer so I can not comment on their performance in that regard.   If you have a general use MTB that your looking for a good all around tire I think these are hard to beat.  If you ride your MTB on pavement mostly these are not the tire for you and if your a mud junkie or into technical downhill then you might be disappointed.",

        "reviewBody": "The search for a second pair of wide road shoes comes to an end. Always a fan of Fizik overall with their saddles over the years, trying their shoes made sense. Double BOA brings a ton of adjustment, the sole stiff were pretty much does not bent but the overall winner is the width! Currently my primary shoes are the Specialized Torch Sworks wide. Fantastic shoes extremely comfortable but they only come in black and they are in the mid 400 dollar range! The Fizik as comfortable, same level of adjustment, amazing color with yhe white and black and easy 100 dollars plus cheaper if you get them during a sale. On another note, interestly I sized down about half a size compared to my Specialized if that helps!",

        "reviewBody": "I was a long-time Sidi fanboy with 3 different pair in my closet…but unfortunately as I aged my feet started to grow wider and I did not like the Sidi Mega options.  So I did my research and eventually gave the Infinitos a try.  They.  Are.  Glorious.  \n\nThe toe box is very appropriately spaced, the soles are as stiff as any other high performance shoe I’ve ridden, and the boa dials couldn’t be easier to adjust on the fly.  I have also come to love the silicone grippers in the heel cup which do an outstanding job of keeping my foot firmly in place, even under the hardest of sprint efforts.  Additionally, the cleat placement is further back on the shoe, which has allowed me to achieve an even more appropriate bike fit and has mitigated some other foot and ankle issues related to having the cleats too far forward previously.\n\nThe one area in which these could use improvement is the tongue.  I was spoiled with the padding in Sidi and never had a hot spot no matter how hard I cinched down.  These, on the other hand, could stand for improvement in the tongue as they can pinch or create hot spots if you overshoot how aggressively you clamp down on the dials (or forget to loosen them back up after that mid-ride sprint).",

I&apos;m not sure what this hole is for because the directions don&apos;t show and there is no English section to explain it. It&apos;s just not as good of a stem as I&apos;d hoped for.

        "reviewBody": "Tried most of the top tier gravel tires, settled on these.  As a racer, puncture resistance is at the top of my list second is low rolling resistance. Other tires do this well but give up shock absorption of grip. The Power Gravels have great shock absorption and grip. The tradeoff is faster wear than some other gravel tires. For me, that&apos;s acceptable. I don&apos;t care how long a tire lasts if I&apos;m constantly getting flats and crashing because of low grip. Raced BWR, Unbound and Crusher in the Tushar as well as weekly training rides on mine. Mostly hardpack or loose over hardpack. My theory as to why they ride and grip sop well is that the puncture belt is stretchy. That allows some suppleness. I&apos;ve ridden other tires with good puncture resistance that rode like rocks unless you ran them with almost no air in them. My 40C Michelins are still supple at 32-34psi.",

I abused them on sharp rocks, singletrack, and rough road and they have held up great. These are definitely not a supple gravel tire, but good for people who want to prioritize durability. \n\nThey are a pain to get the bead set and unset, maybe a little more so than other tires. The tight fit gave me a little more confidence in the tubeless set-up though and I never had any issues once they were on. \n\nTread is good for a little bit of everything.

It took nearly an hour and bent 4 parkside levers getting the last bit of tyre over the rim. Even getting one side on before inserting the tube required 3 tyre levers next to each other. Imagine trying to fit a car tyre by hand and you&apos;ll be close to the experience. There is literally no stretch in the bead, and they feel like they must be 10mm under sized to the rim. Such a shame because once they were on they proved to be fast and resilient to punctures but I cant go too remote incase I do get a puncture and am stranded unable to change the tube.",

I&apos;m an amateur photographer and I use it instead of a puffer jacket when walking trails and pathways because of thorns and snags. In fact it was a snag that finally did in my old jacket. \r\n\r\nBut I love it - it is light and comfortable. The insulation is sufficient to keep you comfortable when you&apos;re very active and allows moisture to dissipate, keeping me drier than other jackets. The fabric has a bit of stretch in it and it has four outer pockets - two hand pockets and one on either side of the zipper on the chest. All in all, I think this is a great jacket for being active outdoors.",

        "reviewBody": "These are ski touring machines disguised as downhill boots.  They walk just as well as they ski, and they honestly do ski like downhill boots.  I struggled with getting a different pair of well-reputed touring boots to fit all season long and was about to throw in the towel until I came across the Zero G Tour Scout.  Can honestly say they have saved my season and allowed me to complete my dream trip (Bugs to Rogers Traverse).  The liners are somewhat thin but surprisingly really warm and comfortable.  Superb out-of-the-box fit - did not heat mold the liners or do any work on the shells, and skied some pretty big days at the end of this season with no blisters.  Lighter weight and better range of motion than some other leading touring boots this season too.  The only &quot;flaw&quot; I&apos;ve been able to find is that the power strap doesn&apos;t stay in place when it is somewhat loosened, i.e. when in walk mode.",

With a lid that fits the dutch oven and the deep sided 10 inch skillet, you&apos;ve got that covered.  Then the trivot sits under the skillet or the dutch oven perfectly, or sits inside the 12 inch skillet to add a cake pan or pizza pan and act as an oven on the bbq/fire.  The two 12 inch skillets nest together perfectly to make a deep skillet with the shallow skillet as a lid a or as shallow skillet more suited for crepe, or pancakes and eggs.  I seasoned these for 3 cycles with flaxseed oil before I used them for the first time.  Non-stick already.    I&apos;ve made a video for my YouTube channel about this set.",

Lightweight, robust, reliable, and simple to light are important features that matter to me. Thus far, I have only used it with white gas and cannot comment on its use with other fuels. The pump is easy to maintain as well. Since I use it in winter, I carry the Standard and Arctic pump on all remote trips. Depending on the temperature, I have to switch them regularly so it would be preferrable if one pump worked well in all temperatures.",

From bicycle 🚴 camping 🏕 trips to Florida hurricanes 🌀 I used it for about three weeks straight when hurricane Charlie took out the power. About the only thing I have done to the stove is clean it maybe 🤔 every year or so and I think 🤔 the only problem I have had was I had to replace one little O-ring! That reminds me I have to replace the O-ring that I removed from the little service kit. I recommend that service kit I replaced that O-ring at night during a hurricane 🌀 power outage and all those O-Rings are special and your not going to find one when you roll into a campground at 02:00 🕑 AM in the rain 🌧 on your bicycle 🚴 and all you want to do is get something to eat and go to sleep 🏕 But if the stove needs an O-ring it is going to be cold Mountain House Chicken 🐔 Teriyaki 🤢 and a cold breakfast 🍳 So you need to get the service kit at least for peace of mind!",

However, once I started going up mountains it began a love/hate relationship, and I&apos;m struggling with blistering on my heels while ascending.  Tried some different insoles, lacing techniques, and tape and am fairing much better.  I have used with hybrid crampons, and boots work well with them thanks to the crampon insert on the heel.  Boots are stupidly warm - I&apos;ve worn them in single digit wind chills and my feet were warm and toasty.  I can&apos;t say these will be my &quot;forever mountaineering boots,&quot; but they are doing well for my first pair.",

They also seem short because they barely reach down my legs - even compared to the product photos. I bet in the right size they would be amazing because these tights feel sturdy like all Catelli products. If I can get it the proper size I would give them a 5 star review.",

I liked the shirt except for one thing:  The &quot;reinforced ripstop&quot; material on the forearms felt grabby and scratchy on my skin.  Not painful, but definitely noticeable and uncomfortable.  That would distract me on the trail, so I returned it before use.  Bummer for such an expensive piece.",

Only complaint is the water bottle pocket- it’s very difficult to get a 1.5 liter Nalgene in and out when the pack is full.",

The pack is also very comfortable. \n\nHowever, the only thing I&apos;m not a fan of is how the day bag is assembled. There used to be snap clips to secure the day bag straps, now you have to loop it through &amp; then weave it through the clip..this wouldn&apos;t be a big deal, however it is EXTREMELY hard to get it through. Having to assemble/disassemble it like this every single time is a pain &amp; takes way more time than it should imo. It&apos;s also really hard to find a &quot;how-to&quot; online as i thought i was doing it wrong the first time because it was a struggle &amp; taking way too long.\n\nOther than this minor thing, the pack is great, and as per usual so is osprey - i just think they should steer back to the clips for the day pack. For now I am going to hand-sew my own on.",

I got clay, and they fit and feel great… but back country and their poor quality control sent a pair of clay but with an entirely different graphic (one not show here). It’s a photo of a helmet and the words “can’t break my vibe.” I would have never ordered something like this. In order to return it, they wanted to make me pay them for another pair and refund after I returned (for their mistake). My trip was the following day so I had no choice but to keep the shorts. Back country has pushed back on providing any sort of discount… so now I’m stuck w $50 shorts that I like but that have a stupid graphic I would never actually wear. Very poor QC and CX. Will be finding a new site to order my gear from, this is the last straw. \n\nBearded Goat is great- the mix up in graphics and failure to remedy the situation was terrible. I put blame on BC",

My main issue with the rack is the child harness, which is a major factor in a product like this. The shoulder straps do not have nearly enough adjustment and are very difficult to adjust. They also don&apos;t seem to properly tighten down on a child in the seat. I consistently lookback and see that the straps have fallen off around my child&apos;s shoulders. It is very disconcerting as this is a critical safety feature of the rack.",

The cupped heal offers good support and security while the generous toe box gives me access to the use of all of my toes; crucial imo to good board feel and progressive riding.If you&apos;re tired of have your toes pinched together look no further. These strike an excellent balance between board feel and foot protection while keeping a low profile. These are so good I have to say I&apos;d be devastated if they ever discontinued the wide width iteration of the 272. I&apos;ve tried other models in the Numeric line in the 2e and they just don&apos;t give my toes the wiggle room needed for my toes.",

It pulls well, slightly noisy while using it. I notice the pannier bags are a bit low, so if riding roads close to curbs, it will rub. And burn a hole in the side or bottom. Also, at fast speeds like going down hills, it gets very sketchy when loaded! Their speed recommendation is encouraged! It will bounce you around a good bit. And make you feel unstable. I would recommend this product, with all that in mind! And, would buy again!",

        "reviewBody": "I used the trailer for packing in and out of a very remote area in Colorado. The trail was 24” wide max. It was canted down hill and very rocky. It was a horse trail. The only failure was the quick release holding the yoke. The securing nut vibrated off and was lost. I used a valve cap to secure it until I could get two nuts to replace the factory nut. I also used lock tight to hold it in place. I suggest a larger diameter rear wheel for more ground clearance. The trailer tracked very well and was really stable. It took a huge beating from the rocks but weathered it well. I also suggest adding rings to connect bungy cords. Connecting to the bottom rail on the trailer resulted in lost cords due to rocks pushing them off. The weight limit is about double what it should be When I had 40lbs in it made bike handling extremely difficult because the front end was light. Very happy with the durability and quality of construction.",

        "reviewBody": "I am not sure how anyone can rate this helmet anything less than 5 stars. I’d say price, but there are more expensive OTG helmets out there—like Giro—and they don’t have merino wool, the adjustability—they better have a contrast adjusting lens to come even close to the Salomon.  This is my second Salomon; I bought the first generation OTG, and the improvements have been excellent. Read the specs—if you’re remotely interested and need an OTG helmet, I’d suggest buying this one. And a CAT 1~3 (seriously three for the price of one) visor that has vlt from about 10% to something like 50%—I feel like my vision is super human. \r\n\r\nChanges? The look-through image on the website isn’t helpful. What you see through these lenses can only be experienced. \r\nAnd yes, there are replacements, I just haven’t seen the adjusting lens, which I feel Salomon should offer, but then again, the clear one is the only visor I would need to add.",

        "reviewBody": "Love the convenience of the visor/ helmet. But I don’t think the photo chromatic lens actually makes the transition in low light or bright light described. I did not notice a change in visibility or tint lightening or darkening in different light ambiance. That being said it would be nice to change out the magnetic lens for different lighting visibility which seems is not actually available to us consumers. Also, my visor/goggles did fog up inside. The foam around the interior is the thinnest/cheapest foam I’ve ever seen on any pair of  visor/ goggles. It’s so thin &amp; delicate I feel I need to be especially careful when putting up the visor. That being said about the foam is also why it feels like the plastic from the goggle/ visor is cutting into the flesh on my cheeks. It’s quite uncomfortable so I’m constantly making adjustments to try and situate the visor correctly on my face. But I think it’s just that the foam is too frail and thin.",

The distributor said it&apos;s only an option as a replacement part, but there are none available, try in August (I will have been trying almost two years by then).  While the standard lens is decent in most conditions, it is not in low light.  What is the point of an easy to switch lens when you cannot get a replacement lens to swap in? I really like the helmet but feel like I was misled on a critical point. I would love for Solomon to tell me I am wrong and how to get lenses, but I would hope retailers and wholesalers would know what they are talking about.",

        "reviewBody": "If you want a pair of pedals that sound like they&apos;re coming apart after 2 hrs of riding by all means go for it.  Used these for two rides totaling 2.5 or so hours, 90-215W on a Stages smart bike.  For reference, pedaling on that bike &quot;feels&quot; very close to pedaling outside.  The bearings in the pedal sound like they&apos;re shot already with the pedal moving around and clicking.  Tried another pair with the same result.  Looks response to an obvious defect was: \n&quot;LOOK designs our pedals to meet and exceed ISO testing requirements. These tests are designed around an outdoor bike, or specifically a bike with a free wheel and the typical worst case conditions of that type of use vs. an indoor/stationary bike with a &quot;flywheel&quot;.&quot;\n\n“our pedals are technically not designed to be ridden on a indoor/stationary bike, which is likely the cause of the issue you are experiencing.”",

        "reviewBody": "These have been my daily shoes for the past couple of months and they&apos;re great! The upper is super breathable which makes it great for walking around town in the super months. The midsole has tons of cushion for long days on your feet. Lastly the outsole is grippy on just about every surface I&apos;ve walked on! While there isn&apos;t much structure to the heel cup, I haven&apos;t had any issues with my heel slipping out. The tongue does tend to slide to the side of my foot throughout the day, but I haven&apos;t had any issues with the laces cutting into my foot. I would recommend staying with your regular shoe size when going with the Vasque Nows. My only dislike with this shoe is how much the heel sticks out. When I first got these I would occasionally catch it on stuff while walking around in tight places, but after a while wearing these I don&apos;t notice it too much.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these about a month ago, to use as &quot;every day&quot; shoes during the tropical summer months. I have worn Vasque Breeze boots for several years and they are awesome! Here are some of the design issues with the RE:Connect Now; the tongue is too flimsy - it does not stay in place and the strings cut into the top of my foot. This is a minor issue and not a deal breaker. The extended and rolled heal is more of an issue. The extended heal gets in the way - I have to be careful walking down stairs, because the heal will grab the stair tread as I am lifting my foot up. Also, the rolled heal, creates an unnatural foot strike for me - certainly different than the Breeze. Lastly, for my weight the foot bead is too spongy and bouncy and the arch is too pronounced. The shoes are light weight and they breathe well, but not something I look forward to wearing much. I really wanted to like these shoes, but I think they could use some design changes or maybe I just need a different style of shoe.",

Not sure she&apos;ll actually be able to climb with it!  It&apos;s very cute though, so I hope she likes it!  I would say it takes up about 50% more capacity than my current bag, which is just the average size of most other chalk bags I have seen.",

Added one of those black pinch adjusters like you would find on a hood, but bigger. Run both ends through and tie an overhand knot holding both. The additional bulk isn?t bad. Inseam feels like 31-32?. I would wash  these with my R1 pullovers to reduce pilling and not with regular pants/sweats.",

They are super comfortable, but are lacking a back pocket and zippers on the side pockets. Can?t say they?re perfect at this price, but they?re pretty good.",

As others have posted, no insoles of any type. Might be the first time that I have boots in the last 30 years that there was no insole. The volume is very large, allowing for full orthotics and heavy socks. Really too much volume for the size. On the plus side, no break in needed at all. The corollary to that is I can’t imagine that these boots will hold up under any East Coast muddy rocky hiking. Sort of the urban equivalent of Zamberlains.",

        "reviewBody": "The Danner Mountain Light Cascade Clovis GTX is indeed an iconic boot, but note this is old technology and other boot manufacturers deliver better out of the box comfort and more predictable sizing. If you’re committed to buying these, this is what worked for me to dial in the fit. I sized down to 10.5 but normally wear an 11-11.5 in Asics and Mizunos and 45 European sizes and normally pair my boots with Smartwool medium weight boot socks. I broke them in without insoles (they do not come with insoles) and was told by the salesperson at the Danner store they are not designed to wear with insoles. However she suggested what worked for others are their proprietary half Airthotic Foam insoles ($18). After some break in (again w/o insoles ) the half insoles worked and significantly reduced heel sleeping. I also switched out the circle laces with the flat ones (comes with both pairs) allowing a more snug fit. If you’re looking for a serious backpacking boot try other brands but these are without a doubt a very handsome boot.",

The style is timeless but the confort and construction have all the benefits that modern materials and craftsmanship can deliver.  I don&apos;t use them for hiking or anything technical, but rather to complete a more rugged look with jeans, a plaid shirt and a puffy down jacket.  I couldn&apos;t be happier.  The shoes fit like a glove and are VERY comfortable even on day one.  I suspect it will take several months to fully break them in and then they will be even more comfortable and stylish given normal wear and tear.  I am so glad that Danner still makes a boot like this!",

The new boots are the quality I expect from Danner,  BUT where are the airthotic inserts that came with the previous 4 Danners I purchased? Am I required to purchase the inserts separately? I have an extra pair of inserts I can use till this matter is resolved. The boots are Danners which makes them the best.  The fit is the same as my other pair of Mountain Lights. I wear a 10.5. I purchased a 10 and the fit is good. Backcountry provided fast shipping with excellent communication.",

        "reviewBody": "I got these shoes after reading some of the reviews here and I do love them. They are one of the best fitting shoes I?ve found for my semi wide asymmetrical foot. Be aware they do run a bit smaller than other models. In the instincts I am around a 41/41.5 and in these I am a 42. If you have instincts, I?d order these at least a half size larger than those. \n\nAs others have mentioned, I?d consider these a moderate/flat shoe. They pretty much immediately lose their downturn after the first time you climb in them. I don?t mind that because I actually prefer flatter shoes, and it makes them pretty good for slab. However the one downside to this is for whatever reason, the stiffness doesn?t really seem to last in the soles. After just a couple months there is barely any support in the sole. Recently on a relatively short Multipitch with hanging belays my feet were absolutely killing me after just a couple pitches. That being said, they are still a great allrounder, but if you?re wanting these for longer climbs I?d look elsewhere. They edge really well, and the xs edge rubber provides a nice balance of stickiness and durability. I mainly use these on granite climbs ranging from slab to vertical, and for that purpose they are wonderful. I like them enough and they fit my foot perfectly that I?ve bought a second pair but I?m considering exploring other options now just because of the sole stiffness durability.",

I wore them in my house enough times and I don&apos;t want to take the risk of using these and not being able to return them.  There&apos;s just too much memory foam or not enough room in the toe box for warm air to circulate.  That can be a killer when snowmobiling.  Sorry but these won&apos;t work for me.  Very comfy everywhere but the toe box.  My fiance bought a pair for snowmobiling, a different model, and loves them.",

But with just a short time, the heel of the sole starts to peel off of the bottom. My first pair did it in less than 2 months, and my 2nd pair lasted maybe 3 months before it started happening. And I am not rough on my shoes by any means. I work a simple cashier job and I make sure I&apos;m using my hands to take them off rather than using my other foot. Absolutely ridiculous for the price of these that the sole starts to peel off so quickly. It&apos;s very disappointing too because I absolutely LOVE these shoes otherwise.

The heal has ripped after a season or two on one side and other side looks like it&apos;ll rips soon. The inner sole go through the rip so they are basically trash at this point. It&apos;s a shame cause the bottom of the shoes looks brand new. Wish they&apos;d make it more durable or allow the shoes to be used even with the rip.",

I&apos;ve tried all of Wahoo&apos;s troubleshooting recommendations, and the trainer still is not transmitting power or cadence data. Waiting for Wahoo to contact me about repair/replacement, but am doubtful given there is only a 1 year warranty. Very disappointing, think most people would have expected a longer lifespan from a product of this price.",

The outer material is classic soft shell-like material, and the inside is super-soft micro fleece. Comfortable to wear with short sleeves underneath.  I?ve done everything from chopping and stacking wood, to skiing in 10-degree weather and it?s been perfect.  Fit is typical norrona - trim.  I am 6-3 175lbs and have a medium, but I would have to size up if I wanted to layer much underneath it besides a heavy base layer.  Norrona makes the best stuff out there - well done!",

Don&apos;t have too big experience in climbing shoes as this is only my second pair but after using Kronos in the beginning, this is a definite step up in terms of possibilities on the wall.\nI&apos;m climbing in the gym only so far and they work perfectly fine no matter if we&apos;re talking about pushing from the small edges or smearing on hi-angle volumes - I haven&apos;t yet found a scenario in which these shoes would limit my ability of completing the climb. Edging, toe- or heel hooking, smearing, everything seems to work just as it should in Shamans.\nI&apos;m wearing size 8.5 US with my street size being 9 US and after a bit painful break in period they fit my foot perfectly and are super comfortable without any loose spots inside.\nThe overall quality is great, the only thing i&apos;m slightly worried about are the velcro straps that look like the weakest spot of the shoe - they already show some signs of usage and small fraying, but I&apos;m using them pretty intensively and so far there&apos;s no serious damage to them. I&apos;ve also used the front part of the rubber way faster than expected but I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s due to my sloppy footwork.\nOverall, the Shamans feel so good for me that I don&apos;t think I&apos;m looking for another model anymore, I plan to resole them as long as possible and probably just buy another pair when the first one is too worn out.",

I have an Egyptian foot shape with narrow to medium width and it is very comfortable for me like the second skin. Shamans are not stiff and not soft, they have a great combination of sensitivity and precision with performance. Good toe hooking and heel hooking ability as well as grabbing and smearing (love bump is a small obstacle here but for my 83kg it is not a problem to smear it).\n\nLong story short, great all-arounders who can help to progress with different routes and angles in any discipline.  One more thing is the edging ability, it is good, not perfect but you need experience and strength in your toe for that.\n\nHighly recommend.",

I will be holding on to my older pair as long as humanly possible because I can barely tolerate a full day in the 2.0s. The new versions are MUCH narrower and less comfortable, especially when sockless. Folks with narrow feet, I cannot recommend these shoes enough! Folks that used to enjoy the roominess of the older Brewess, look elsewhere. (The Loyaks are little less structured, so can still work well for us!)",

Lovely light blue color that is essentially a neutral &amp; goes with everything I own. My only question left is how long will the soles last before going hard…? If it is longer than a year that these will hands-down beat the Big Brand boat shoes.

Shorts ran a tad baggy and big, but I was totally okay with that.",

        "reviewBody": "This Smartwool T-Shirt is made of 50% wool and 50% cotton and is very comfortable. It is more heavyweight than the Sport150 T-Shirts (wool/nylon blend) that Smartwool used to produce. Seems like more of a cold weather shirt/weight. \r\n\r\nSize is in alignment with other Smartwool shirts. I wear an XL so I bought this as an XL as well.  Fit is good, but the torso length is a little bit shorter than the Sport150 T-Shirts. I’ll keep this one but not sure if I’d buy more because the shorter length and heavier weight material. Hope they bring back the Sport150 which I believe is better for warm environments.",

In the winter months I get a bunion flare up on my right foot and I walk around in misery. After going through some other brands and the wrong sizes I got these in 7.5 and they fit great. Truly warm and spacious. A true winter boot to protect my feet. I tested them on a 8 mile hike in 8 inches of snow and some stream crossings and my feet stayed warm and dry. \nMy only ding is they are a little clunky in overall size and the cushioning is a little harder than I&apos;d like. It took a little adjusting to walk in these. Overall a solid purchase :)\n\nI marked these as run wide. For me this is good thing. They fit my 2E feet so not a problem that these aren&apos;t offered in an official wide size like the non polar version of this boot.",

        "reviewBody": "I recently started wearing some SUGOi Evolution bib shorts that I am a fan of, so I thought I&apos;d check our their jersey selection as well.  I really liked this mountain design and decided to pick it up in both Medium and Large to see how their jerseys fit.  In my other go-to brand (PI) I am a M in their more relaxed jerseys and a L in their more semi-fit jerseys.  For this jersey the M is a bit more snug than I&apos;d prefer (but not terrible)- and the L is far too long for me, being a shorter rider.  I&apos;d say if there were a half-size between M and L that would be perfect for me.  But, there isn&apos;t-- so I kept the Medium.  I&apos;m told the ZAP technology *is* very reflective and noticeable, which is great.  The sleeves on this jersey are a big longer than I&apos;m used to, but not terrible.  They fit snug, but not restrictive.  One complaint is that the jersey material seems to snag easily.  I&apos;ve thrown my gloves in my back pockets of my PI jerseys... well, almost every single time I finish a ride... and I&apos;ve never once had my PI jerseys snag from the velcro.  On my first ride doing this, I noticed some snags of the jersey material inside the pocket that held the gloves.  A bit disappointing, but something I&apos;ll be aware of and will have to be more careful that the gloves are fully closed before throwing them in my back pocket.  Anyway, pretty nice jersey, decent quality, good design, little pricey... will probably pick up another style or two as I need to add more jerseys to my collection.",

Wanted stability in the wind.  Wanted well-sealed seams and a rainfly.  Everything I wanted and then some I found in the Halo 4P!  I was apprehensive about the price but I went for it.  I practiced set-up in my backyard and was good to go.  Split door openings are a plus. Needed a couple of extra ground stakes to guy the fly out.  So satisfied with this purchase!  Well worth the time and money invested.  The storage bag could be a bit larger.",

        "reviewBody": "Great new color, soft breathable fabric, stretchy to accommodate many shapes. I chose the &quot;pant&quot; because your ankle pant no longer has the elastic drawstring. While I love the addition of the new zippered pocket I still would have preferred to order the ankle pant with drawstring because that profile is more flattering and versatile. The long pant is great for colder months but the ankle pant can easily be worn year-round. I can pull the elastic tight on the long pant, which is generously in length, but it still pools/poofs at the bottom and is just not as convenient as the ankle pant. Good quality and fit, I just don&apos;t think I will wear it as much for my purposes as the ankle pant. I wear a small in most pants but size-down in the Dynama pants. However, the waist seam design is not as stretchy as other parts so your hip proportions will determine whether this will be true-to-size or you need to size-down.",

The latest design addition of the internal drawstring at the waist ensures a perfect fit. The side zip pocket is great especially for travel. The blackberry color is perfect for fall and winter. Dynama Pants wear well, wash and dry without wrinkles, and they repel water. The regular length is ample length for my 30&quot; inseam.",

I had a couple trips where they jammed up in the ice and were very difficulty to screw in. Intermittently while screwing into the ice this would happen. However, there were two other climbs with different ice conditions and whether where they performed just as well as my other screws. Not sure why this is, maybe it has to do with weather/ice conditions. Not sure yet, still experimenting with them.",

The ice we were testing them in caused them to turn easy and then stop like you were screwing into dirt or rock. They weren’t it was the aluminum and moisture in the ice causing problems. We had regular BD screws also and they didn’t have the issue. In all a great screw and you can’t beat the weight.",

        "reviewBody": "I posted a review after first getting a couple of these last season, and have since replaced most of my steel screws with these. I&apos;ve used other brands aluminum screws, and BD have the best feel. The wire gate extension feels more durable and solid that other &quot;express handles&quot; and the extra leverage makes them easy to place quickly. definitely an improvement from the steel screw express handle. \r\nA few reviews have talked about them getting stuck. This seems to be an issue with aluminum generally rather than these specifically, and I have had the same issues with competitors screws. I do find that in really wet ice they will freeze in place more readily than steel screws, and feel almost like they bottomed out. with a good twist to break the resistance they will usually drive the rest f the way as normal. The longer screws provide meaningful weight savings. For V-threads the larger bore is somewhat helpful, and the green anodization makes seeing the screw path in the ice easier than steel screws. Finally, since these have a larger diameter than almost anything else on the market (petzl UL is slightly larger), the ability to rebore holes is nice, especially in areas that get Swiss-cheesed every weekend. as more people use UL screws this advantage will diminish.",

However in any ice that is wet or has a lot of moisture in it, they will almost certainly have issues getting placed.  In wet ice they will often become literally stuck and you cannot place them fully without really hammering on the hanger.  I know aluminum screws always have more friction, but these are noticeable worse than my petzl aluminum screws.  I&apos;ll take the weight of steel screws, at least they can be fully placed in all ice conditions.",

The teeth are aggressive and dig very fast in the ice. It is almost unbelievable how quickly the screw holds in place.\r\n\r\nBut...for some reason after a few turns, or even midway into insertion, the screw just gets stuck.  It halts a bit less suddenly than if you were to hit rock. But it is quite stuck. It takes a lot of force to get it to turn again, to the point that I sometimes think the handle could break.  Sometimes I was not able to get it unstuck using the knob, I had to wrap my hand around the screw plate and really put a lot of force to get it moving again.  Sometimes it happened 2 or 3 times during the placement of a single screw.  In the same ice I placed BD Express screws without any such problem. \r\n\r\nI am not sure why this is happening. My guess is the type of material allows the water to refreeze on it easily. And the large diameter of the screw (largest I have seen so far) means more surface the ice can grab on.",

Jogger silhouette but the tiniest bit less slim than joggers of yesteryear … and it makes them perfectly mobile but still looking good. Happy to do away with needing a belt to hold up my pants bc that buckle just gets awkward with my backpack waist strap anyhow. I am pretty skinny, 28 in waist and no hips, and smalls fit but felt the tiniest bit loose in the waist … they would stay up I think but voila(!) a good drawstring for security. The pockets actually hold your phone and a wallet too.\n\nThe ferrosi material is amazing. These slay the Pata terrebone joggers - I have both and these are stretchier and more breathable and yet more sturdy and it shows why ferrosi-based jackets and pants have won awards for years.",

It&apos;s got straps on the shoulders that&apos;d bring the backpack closer to my back, no packs I ever had before had this, and I had never been so comfortable. That being said, it could get tighter, but I am simply very small.\n\nDespite its lightness, this thing is strong. I stuffed all I could in the elastics, capacity of 28litres is probably an understatement and the main was also full to the brims. After this first hike, partner is now buying his first RAB backpack for our next one, next month :)",

I bought the Rab soft flask which is very comfortable compared to a hard bottle in the right hand chest harness pocket. The only gripe I have (hence the 4 stars) is the sternum strap attachment clips....they are constantly sliding up and unclipping themselves, slapping me in the chest or stomach. The lower strap in particular suffers with this problem, please Rab...remedy this problem. I have added a webbing daisy chain on the inner edge of the chest harness straps so I can attach my custom omm chest pack, if Rab included these they could use a more secure attachment system similar to what Montane use, which would also make it easier for the user to repair in the field as opposed to the sliding rail system. If Rab sort this problem, I&apos;ll give the pack 5 stars.",

I used to use a running rucksack from another well-known running brand but was looking for something exactly like this - a simple chest rig on the front for essentials, good hip pockets, and a simple back compartment that can hold a decent amount of kit. This has it all. \n\nI use it for running home from work when it can carry a laptop, my clothes and shoes easily. It&apos;s also perfect for days out in the countryside. It&apos;s also perfect for those with children. Mine is usually filled with water bottles, snacks, gloves, hats, all conveniently stashed in the super stretchy side and back pockets - these for me were one of the key draws to this rucksack - loads of space for all those things you just need to quickly stuff somewhere and avoid the faff of constantly opening your main compartment, plus, it keeps the wet stuff outside and the stuff inside dry!\n\nIt has a nice sleek design, even with the stuff pockets in use, and just looks smart, so it&apos;s been suitable for taking to and from work and things aren&apos;t flapping around all over the place. \n\nThe chest rig is good, and very versatile. \n\nMy only comment would be that as smaller man, with a 36&quot; chest and 29&quot; waist, this doesn&apos;t do up as tight as I&apos;d like. When it&apos;s laden down, it&apos;s actually fine, but when it&apos;s quite empty, it&apos;s fine walking, but doesn&apos;t quite feel as snug as I&apos;d like when running.",

I found them to be comfortable on moderately long days (26 miles). They started showing wear on the upper material within the first hundred miles. After finishing 125 miles yesterday in the Wind River High Route, both sides of both shoes were blown out, the heel cups look like they had an ice cream scoop taken out of the padding, and the midsole had compressed where I could feel the rocks more than I would like. It is an excellent show but the lack of durability is disappointing considering the premium price.",

It sounds like I am pumping up an air mattress with one shoe constantly when running on dirt road after any water crossing. Tread is coming off. Maybe have 350 miles on them. 1 star due to disappointment in overall performance. That being said I will buy another pair when they discontinue them and they are on sale.",
