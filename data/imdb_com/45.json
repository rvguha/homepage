      "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan succeeds once again at mastering a suspenseful script into a truly superb film. Nolan (Memento) creates a complex and carefully construed tale that has plenty of intentional misdirection that is quite convincing.\n\nAl Pacino plays another one of his droopy detectives in a role that is quite unoriginal if placed in other films. Yet what separates this role from others is his portrayal of L.A. Detective Will Dormer actually has some &apos;meat&apos; attached to it. Pacino plays a detective with a history of successful apprehensions, yet, he has flaws just like any other person and they come back to haunt him. Relocated from Los Angeles to Alaska, he is sent in hopes of capturing a killer who murdered a local schoolgirl.\n\nJudging from the previews, premature assumptions can be made labeling the film as another simple &apos;cat-and-mouse&apos; thriller. Instead, those conceptions will be lost soon after the haunting opening credits emerge and we are transplanted directly into a deep and complex character study set against the backdrop of a local homicide mystery in a small Alaskan town. The film&apos;s antagonist (For those who have seen the film - is he really the villain or the catalyst for Pacino&apos;s ethical debate?) is a local writer portrayed by Robin Williams. This is Williams&apos; second villainous role in his trilogy of films (Death to Smoochy, One Hour Photo) that aims at diversifying his resume. Williams impresses as he juxtaposes between an innocent victim of a mishap and between a calculating and conniving murderer. \n\nDirector Nolan has assembled a terrific cast as this complex plot unfolds at a frivolous rate. This is a film that a discerning viewer will admire and a viewer with a short attention span will loathe. Nolan tosses us with one set of objectives and midway through the first act, we are sitting in on an entirely different film. Adjectives such as formulaic and conventional should not be associated with a film such as this. Nolan has completely revitalized the tired genre of the murder thriller with his sleek direction and picturesque photography.\n\nNolan first had conceived of the idea upon viewing a Norwegian film of the same name directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. Nolan seems to have taken the flaws of the original and improved upon them in a sleek feat of filmmaking that leaves much to be questioned about its&apos; brilliance. One viewing is not enough to internalize the level of sophistication Nolan has created with this brilliant film.\n\nHillary Seitz&apos;s first attempt at writing a screenplay is solid but must be understood that the conception was not hers. Still, her script contains some juicy scenes that benefit all our characters in this film. Three Oscar winners (Pacino, Williams and Hillary Swank) highlight this film and with good reason. At first glance, the cast seems informingly incongruent, yet with time, all explains itself. Swank&apos;s performance as Detective Burr seems unnecessary right up until the final moments in the film. Yet, this is all of the resolute brilliance Nolan lends to this film. \n\nThis film succeeds on several levels of cinematic bravura. David Julyan&apos;s haunting score coupled with intense subliminal flashes match the films&apos; dark tone and Cinematographer Wally Pfister (Memento) captures the majestic beauty of the Alaskan sea front.\n\nAs aforementioned, a thrilling chase of a murderer can be expected when introduced to the film. But not long after, we are delving into a debate that has a positive fix on morality. A battle between a person&apos;s conscience and his actions are truly at the forefront of this intellectually intriguing and complex thriller. Despite its&apos; disappointing anticlimactic finale, the film still has enough zest and brilliance to make this film a true testament to the skill of Director Nolan.\n\nGiancarlo&apos;s Rating: ***"

A lot of people is disappointed because this movie is not as good as Suspiria...bad news for you: Suspiria is a masterpiece and is very tough to found movies as great as that. The good news is that Mother of Tears is a very good horror movie. The third part of the trilogy is IMHO better than Tenebrae and is one of the best Argento movies in a long, long time. Good scares, a lot of gore (this must be the goriest Argento movie) and very entertaining overall. There are a lot of bloody and great scenes, amputations, decapitations, impaling. If you like ultra gore you will like this, If you like Argento you will like it (if you don&apos;t expect a new Suspiria) and if you are just a horror fan, I&apos;m sure you will like this too."

      "reviewBody": "This film is a documentary in the truest sense of the word, and the film was admitted as evidence at the Nuremberg trials in December 1945. The first part of the film is basically home movies and news reels about what was happening in Germany in the 20s and early 30s, leading up to the Nazi takeover in 1933 and some of their early actions (book burning, boycott of the Jews). After that it is mostly official news reels about Nazi activities from 1935 to 1944, and then curiously stops abruptly. \n\nAs a documentary it has lots of faults, although as a compilation of information about the Nazi movement it is priceless.\n\nThere is no real continuity in the movement from one segment to another, all of them defined chronologically. IOW one has to have a good idea of what you&apos;re looking at for it to be of importance. \n\nA good deal of the film consists of the German language with sporadic translations that are often much shorter than the original German part of the film. There is no attempt to identify the various party leaders.\n\nGeorge Stevens (1904-1975) took time out from a busy career as a director to work for the war department, and made 3 films, of which this was the last. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times and won twice (&quot;Giant&quot; and &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;). 16 of his films generated 69 Oscar nominations and 15 wins. Some of his memorable films prior to his war service include comedies like &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942), and &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (1935). After his war experience, his major films include &quot;Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959), &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), and &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948). Both of his Oscar wins come from the period after the war service. \n\nBudd Schulberg (1914-2009) helped work on the film after he finished his work with director John Ford. Schulberg is known for his novels ‚Äì e.g., &quot;What Makes Sammy Run&quot; (1941), &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (1947) ‚Äì and for his original screenplays ‚Äì &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957). \n\nIf you&apos;re interested in this type of documentary, Hitler&apos;s Death Squad (aka Nazi Death Squads) is a far better film, not merely as a film, but for some of the footage which is truly remarkable. I saw it on National Geographic TV channel. It&apos;s the story of the Nazi Einsatzgruppen, especially the two years surrounding the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy.",

      "reviewBody": "Don Roos&apos;s &apos;Happy Endings&apos; is a splendid comedy drama about complex people and their complicated relationships and pursuit for significance. It tells the story of lost people who are in search of something to feel important. Saying more would be giving out too much but as the viewer travels along with these characters in their search for happiness we learn how they find something to hold on to and that a happy ending need not necessarily be the fairy tale ending that we all know does not exist. In my humble opinion, this movie has one of the best endings. Don Roos comes up with a totally original complex and he tells the story beautifully. The execution is superb and I liked reading the captions. His quirky characters are richly defined and even though they are not always likable, they are sympathetic. The soundtrack is wonderful and it introduces Maggie Gyllenhaal&apos;s singing talents. Clark Mathis&apos;s cinematography is first rate. A cast could not get any better than having Lisa Kudrow, Steve Coogan, Jesse Bradford, Bobby Cannavale, Jason Ritter, Laura Dern, Tom Arnold, Maggie Gyllenhaal, David Sutcliff, Johnny Galecki and Maggie Gyllenhaal in one film. All of them perform excellently. This should be proof enough that Lisa Kudrow can carry a film as lead actress. Coogan too is very convincing as Mamie&apos;s stepbrother. Gyllenhaal and Bradford prove that they are two of the finest actors of the current generation. Laura Dern is very effective in a small role and I like how Tom Arnold plays the incredibly naive do-gooder dad . I have already watched &apos;Happy Endings&apos; a couple of times and it doesn&apos;t get old. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the kind of movie that would appeal to a majority of the general movie watchers but it is one of my all time favourite films and I look forward to anything by Don Roos."

      "reviewBody": "Hong Kong&apos;s extreme Category III rating allows producers and directors to cater to the sickest desires of their audiences by focusing on violence, sex, sexual violence and scenes of depravity normally not found in mainstream cinema. During the 1990s, there was a boom in such productions, with the most popular inevitably starring Anthony Wong as some kind of crazed killer or pervert.\n\nTHE EBOLA SYNDROME is one of the best-known of its kind and that&apos;s no surprise; this is one hell of a ride of a film, chock-full of bad taste scenes in which the writer tries to go out of his way to offend everybody watching. The protagonist, played by Wong, is a guy who goes around raping women and eventually contracting and spreading the Ebola virus, which leads to much unpleasantness.\n\nFrom the opening set-piece you know what you&apos;re in for with this one: tons of bad language, naked women and gross gore effects. The directors throws in animal dissection, autopsies and all kinds of sickening stuff involving food production that&apos;s guaranteed to turn your stomach. Rape and murder are commonplace, and yet at the same time there&apos;s daft comedy to offset the darkness. It&apos;s all portrayed so over the top and ridiculously that none of it is disturbing.\n\nWhat surprised me most about THE EBOLA SYNDROME is that it&apos;s a well made movie comparable with other Hong Kong films of the 1990s. The technical values are strong and the acting isn&apos;t too shabby either; Wong is a commanding actor and you can see why he&apos;s enjoyed mainstream as well as cult success. Yes, this is an unpleasant and sometimes childish film in the way it seeks out one depravity after another, but at the same time it&apos;s undeniably entertaining and it goes down avenues that Hollywood wouldn&apos;t dare. The ending rampage is by far my favourite part of the movie and has to be seen to be believed.",

      "reviewBody": "A family (A teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. However, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don&apos;t take kindly to newcomers on their patch. While having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio&apos;s sister. With the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..\n\nVeering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. At first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. But then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug&apos;s sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they&apos;re pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can&apos;t defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course, there&apos;s the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. Right?!\n\nThe climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn&apos;t been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a Rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. It&apos;s completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can&apos;t accuse it of not being consistent. So, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn&apos;t exist, check out the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie.. etc. Notice a pattern emerging here? Their careers all hit dead ends. Why? Sit through this, and all will become clear. Remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please.. 3/10",

Her son&apos;s wife wants her out of the house, as she is driving her mad. Mam√° Cora tries to help, but unfortunately, everything she does, she does it wrongly.\n\nThe family goes through lots of trouble, trying to solve what to do with Mam√° Cora. While all this happens, a confusion makes the family believe she dies, and that leads to the funniest scenes of the comedy, although the whole movie is hilarious.\n\nIf want to rent a good comedy, I strongly recommend you to go for &quot;Esperando la Carroza&quot;. Not to mention the outstanding performances of actors like China Zorrilla, Betiana Blum and Luis Brandoni, among others.\n\nMy score 10/10. Excellent movie.",

(The other night&apos;s concert has been since released as &apos;Alternate Aloha&apos; and is just as good).\n\nAfter a crash diet, Presley looks good and is in amazing voice, with his usual backing band and singers (the Stamps Quartet and the Sweet Inspirations). This concert contains gem after gem (including I&apos;ll Remember You, a poignant song which fits the moment perfectly).\n\nPerhaps his last great filmed concert (the one in 1977 is simply sad, despite his voice still being in evidence), &apos;Aloha From Hawaii&apos; is a fantastic memento of an unsurpassed artist who could sing in almost every style. This concert proves that.",

      "reviewBody": "Steven Soderbergh is a talented, experimental, sometimes avant-garde filmmaker that doesn&apos;t make jokey movies (the Coen Brothers) or gimmicky ones (Christopher Nolan) or Tarantino ones. In even his more mainstream movies, he&apos;s distinguished. He&apos;s one of the few (relatively) young directors that makes &quot;real&quot; movies (not to knock the &quot;fake&quot; ones) about a wide array of subjects. He doesn&apos;t need to be cool or ambiguous all the time.\n\nSet in St. Louis in 1933, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; is like a light kids version of &quot;The Pianist&quot; (it&apos;s even got Adrien Brody!). The film centers around the 12 year-old Aaron Kurlander, and his family -- his mother, father, and younger brother, Sullivan. The Depression is in full force, and Aaron&apos;s parents have come to the agreement that the only way to save money and be able to continue raising their two sons is to have young Sullivan shipped off on a Greyhound bus to live with his uncle. Soon thereafter, Aaron&apos;s mother is taken out of the picture when she has to go for a stay at a sanitarium. The family lives in a hotel run by a bank, and Aaron&apos;s father isn&apos;t paying the bills; soon he&apos;s out of the picture when he goes off looking for work, leaving Aaron on his own to fend for himself.\n\nHe makes friends with a rich nerdy kid at school when he rescues him from some school marble bullies, and comes up with schemes of how to make money, like having canary&apos;s mate, since a newborn will fetch three dollars. He spins tall tales in order to get by at school, like telling his teacher that his parents work for the government. His hunky, older pal also living in the hotel, Lester (Adrien Brody) helps him about; in one incident they end up stealing Aaron&apos;s father&apos;s car, and with Aaron too small to be able to reach the brake pedal, he ends up going on a scary trip around town.\n\n When one girl from school invites him over for supper, he gets caught in his own web of deceit when the school kids, at an after-graduation party where Aaron wins a special prize, hear different stories about what his parents really are. (Government workers, archaeologists, pilots.) At the same party, he&apos;s exposed for what (they think) he is: a poor kid and a teacher&apos;s pet.\n\nHe befriends a gawky girl in his hotel with a crush on him when she invites him over for hot dogs and dancing, but ends up having some sort of fit on the floor. (Epileptic seizure?)\n\nThe cop out in the street is just looking to bust some young punk kid, and the hotel bellhop is just waiting for Aaron to slip up, so he can lock him out of his room. (Look fast for Lauryn Hill as the hotel elevator operator!)\n\nThe movie looks great, both in the set deco and the juicy, round cinematography. The music is a plus, and nearly all the performances are first-rate. Jesse Bradford, with his big, expressive eyes, is just terrific as Aaron. He&apos;s got an ultra-pleasant face to watch, and his acting is totally fresh, without any hint of affectation. (Unlike his father&apos;s strange accent.)\n\n&quot;King of the Hill&quot; is a lovely, great-looking period piece. A sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking dramedy without any pretensions to be anything other than a good little gem of a movie. And that it is.\n\n****"

Mylene Hoffman is an undercover agent for the Western Block. She is also a cyborg, 009-1. She is good at her job, eliminating many of the West&apos;s enemies. However, while under her protection, her creator, Dr Klein, is kidnapped. Her employer blames 009-1 and suspends her. She doesn&apos;t take this well...\n\nReasonably entertaining sci fi action-drama. Pretty basic storyline, though with enough twists and turns to keep you interested.\n\nMain focus, of course, is on the action scenes, and they come thick and fast. I&apos;m generally not into action movies - they tend to be very formulaic and their action scenes unoriginal - but this seemed different and kept me interested.\n\nOne reason my concentration was maintained was due to Mayuko Iwasa starring as 009-1. She is great on the eyes and definitely makes the movie more watchable than it otherwise would have been.",

      "reviewBody": "Bassae is a poetic study of a temple in Greece. The site was well chosen due to its remote location on a deserted mountainside (much harder to decontextualise a temple in central Athens). It is a fantasy film in that the narrator strips away the majority of the historical context of the site, even perhaps the context of the geographical location itself (&quot;...this sky infused with a faint splash of purple ink trying to convince us that it is Mediterranean&quot;). A couple of light-fingered German aristos impertinently relieved the site of its figurative elements (a frieze and metopes) at the beginning of the nineteenth century, thereby allowing the subjective interpretation of the filmmakers to work. Currently you can see these in the British Museum, which bought them at auction. An historical idea that might remain is that some historians believe that one of the Corinthian columns of the temple is an aniconic representation of the god of the temple, via Pollet&apos;s unusual focus on one particular column, I presume he was aware of this idea. Pollet recasts this temple and its precincts as a zone of awe and dread, broken stones appear as if they were broken bones, mists as if spirits of the sacrificed. There is however no imminent danger, the god is time, is an eternal sloven; slow destruction and mortality are his detritus, his nesting material. \n\nFor this short Jean N√©groni narrated a text written by Alexandre Astruc (auterist-critic-turned-director before the occurrence of that great film-historical movement out of Cahiers du Cinema, the New Wave).\n\nClassicists with no interest in film poesy might enjoy watching the film with the soundtrack off, as the temple has now been under a protective tent for many years and the film offers the chance to view it in its full glory.",

      "reviewBody": "It is a film about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them. The story focuses on a detective (Harrison Ford) protecting a young Amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a brutal murder. Witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers, this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood. The film is powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and devoid of easy moralising, which is good. Ford is Chicago Detective John Book, assigned to investigate a murder that was committed by crooked cop Danny Glover. The only witness is the son of an Amish widow, played by Kelly McGillis. When Book gets too close to the truth, the crooked cops try to kill him, forcing Book to take it on the lamb and hide out in the Amish country. There, he slowly makes a transition into their society, their way of life, and of course, he starts to fall for Kelly McGillis. (who would later star with pretty boy Cruise in &quot;Top Gun&quot;). Alexander Godunov, who later played the murderous Karl in &quot;Die Hard&quot;, makes his debut here as an Amish farmer who is, Ford&apos;s romantic rival for Kelly. Also making his debut here is a much younger Viggo Mortensen as another Amish father. Mortensen&apos;s barely evident in the role out here,although had his eventual success as Aragorn in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; ........ After Star Wars &amp; Indiana Jones,Ford succeeded in a serious role and his multi-layered performance earned him his only Oscar Nomination till date.Well directed Romantic Thriller by Peter Weir (Director of Dead poet&apos;s Society and Truman Show) that earned him his first Academy Award Nomination. Do watch this one for great Cinematography and Artwork\n\nMy Rating - 8/10",

People who say this is one of the worst movies ever must have only seen 5 movies in their whole lives and they all must have been in the top ten here at the imdb.\n\nI do have a couple of problems with it.\n\n1)The CGI monsters are very fake looking in a few scenes, this really detracts from suspense.\n\n2)They show too much of the monsters too early on in the movie. They should have watched The Others where suspense was created by not showing The Others till the very end.\n\nOther then that I thought this was a decent horror movie, what else do people expect out of a horror flick then this? It was kinda creepy and interesting to watch the people die, the plot was decent involving the whole psychology aspect. People who think this is one of the worst movies ever need to watch Fear Dot Com or any of the Freddy/Jason movies after number 3 or so.\n\n7 / 10"

      "reviewBody": "I think this is a good movie that could have been great. It &quot;sits between two stools&quot;. Sometimes it tries to be funny, others &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;dealing with contentious issues&quot; but even then, with a light approach.\n\nWhat is always there is the clich√©, the corny twist. I love whatever is Italian, if you show me whichever of their old buildings I instantly love them. So their people, with the quirks only a fellow &quot;Italian&quot; like me can understand. Nevertheless, I don&apos;t think a film should be granted more score just because you like the topics, language, scenery and characters. \n\nI never felt anything for anybody. And that&apos;s quite bad for an Italian movie... I&apos;m afraid it stays within the surface, never really saying anything we don&apos;t already know. Sometimes one could even know how the &quot;episodes&quot; would end... (they&apos;re quite predictable). \n\nWhat I do like is that many stories are left unfinished, maybe because there&apos;s no easy way out. Like the black man being left out of the bar because of his colour. Others, like the cleaning man clinging to the blue collar&apos;s car is purportedly comic, but grossly so. You can&apos;t have it both ways. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d like to meet this &quot;auteur&quot;, and that&apos;s a very personal way I have to know whether I like a film or not. \n\nItalian women have a way of being beautiful and suggestive that&apos;s also here. I can think of the estranged wife, and even the lesbian love between tables.\n\nActors are fine, they don&apos; seem to be acting at all. The script fails. Like the one at the beginning, with this man who&apos;s supposed to be a reporter. I didn&apos;t get the point of it, were it American one would think it&apos;s TV humour alla &quot;Friends&quot; when they put people in &quot;awkward&quot; situations so we instantly &quot;identify&quot; with them. Which comes by me as bad as their fast food. Or the man in the cemetery, what a botched idea!! It being genial, he waists it by placing the narrator talk (monologue) to the woman driver about his hearings of the dead. Which makes him a freak, like the ghost of &quot;Russian Ark&quot;.\n\nThe whole cinema roared of laughter with the quip the old man who&apos;s going to be sent to a geriatric says to the &quot;woman in her 60s but still attractive&quot;. But putting, again, an old character reciting the many synonyms of &quot;dick&quot; just to &quot;show the youngster what&apos;s right&quot; is demagogue at best. Even if it feigns some &quot;literary patina&quot;, like &quot;Cyrano&quot;. By the way, the director is old, and it shows in all the choices he makes. He gets to be tyring. \n\nAgree with &quot;Kandrap&quot; that you don&apos;t know what to think when you&apos;re out of the cinema. He illuminated me: old people have a preponderance here. Also true that it changes &quot;mood&quot; about halfway. \n\nAll in all, just for &quot;sociologists&quot; and lovers of Italy (like me, both categories). Thanks IMDb for covering unusual films like this one, and letting us voice our quibbles :)",

      "name": "A delayed echo of From Here to Eternity--not half bad, but only half",
      "reviewBody": "The Proud and Profane (1956)\n\nYes, this movie features William Holden and Deborah Kerr, who do their characteristic best in a lower budget echo of the 1953 blockbuster &quot;From Here to Eternity,&quot; also featuring Kerr (but with Lancaster and, for good measure, Montgomery Clift). The comparison is fair, because the similarities are too blatant, and so it&apos;s fair to also say that, as ordinary as this movie is, it had potential. There are qualities to the story line that are too moving (wounded soldiers in the Pacific, a widow tracing the last days of her Marine husband&apos;s life, a love affair against the rules) and the actors are too fine (add Thelma Ritter as an important third) to just dismiss the whole thing as a mess.\n\nThe director, George Seaton, is really a screenwriter, and though he directed a dozen features, none of them are especially memorable. His real fame rests on assisting with several great movies (like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;) and with a single brilliant coup--the screenplay for the original 1947 as well as the later TV version of &quot;Miracle on 34th St.&quot; And it is no surprise that Seaton&apos;s own screen writing in &quot;The Proud and Profane,&quot; though prosaic, is very good. \n\nAh, but filmmaking is about timing, flow, surprise, drama, light, shadow, and sounds of all kinds. This is the director&apos;s blank canvas and Seaton doesn&apos;t go anywhere in any of these areas. The light is bright and flat. The camera-work is functional and bland (cameraman John Warren being a newcomer, moving quickly to television, including many Hitchcock episodes). The score is strong (thanks to veteran master Victor Young) but there is no attempt to insert diegetic music or more interesting internal sounds. Even the supporting cast is pigeonholed into clich√©s (and there is no critical secondary male role, as Clift played in the 1953 movie). Thelma Ritter is at her best, more normalized than in other roles, but believable and superb.\n\nI write all this for a routine movie because of Holden, who is an understated and sometimes brilliant actor, and Kerr, who I never warm up to but who is almost designed to be too cold to like. Kerr in particular is up and down here, at times so perfectly cast and so convincing you start to really watch closely, but other times she has to stretch her role a little (when she is dancing, for example, or in the cheesy beach scene early on) and it&apos;s awkward. Holden is made to be an enigma, and when he warms up (out of uniform) he&apos;s likable, and when he&apos;s cold, he&apos;s cold, but never admirable, which is what a commander needs to be at least.\n\nI enjoyed this movie because I enjoy movies, but also because it has aspects that are terrific. If you really like war films that aren&apos;t about battle (as I do), this is a must see. And if you want perspective on &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; you really will appreciate both films more. For just a fresh, well-made movie, terrific you will need to keep looking.",

I don&apos;t mean like he&apos;ll kill someone crazy, but like this guy does some insane stunts crazy.\n\n&quot;Operation Condor&quot; is one of the earliest displays of Jackie Chan&apos;s innovative fight and stunt coordinating. He was doing things that other actors could only do through the help of movie magic. It&apos;s true that he would have to do more than one take sometimes, but still he was really doing the stunts.\n\nIn &quot;Operation Condor&quot; he was an agent trying to track down some hidden gold. He was accompanied by two women, one German woman who was the granddaughter of the man who hid the gold, and one Asian woman who was assigned to help him. The three of them were hilarious to watch. They fought, shot, and stumbled their way along trying to get to their final destination. Jackie Chan provided the athleticism while the two women played supporting extras. &quot;Operation Condor&quot; was athletic and it was a riot: an athletic riot.",

      "name": "A rambling and pointless film, though pleasant to look at",
      "reviewBody": "This is one of those films the British Lottery Fund wastes its money on. The main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere. The characters are not interesting, the story is conventional and insipid, the only thing of interest is the location: the city of Genoa (Genova in Italian). Having only a superficial acquaintance with Genoa, I had no idea of the intricate alleyways of its Old Town, and that the city was so interesting. I had thought Genoa was dull. I am delighted to say that I have been proved wrong. So from the travelogue point of view, this film has interest. The film contains one splendid performance, by a little girl named Perla Haney-Jardine. She has already made seven films despite being only 12, so she seems determined upon a career as an actress, and judging by her performance in this film, she should go far, as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent. Colin Firth, a reliable and professional actor, was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest, he was earnest, and when asked to be anguished, he was anguished. But somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue. The script is a total shambles. Catherine Keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role, and showing sympathy comes naturally to her, so that everybody would like to have her around (I would like to tell her every time I feel a cold coming on, as I know she would get me a soothing hot drink). So there we have it: Genoa&apos;s fascinating narrow alleys, an interesting little girl, and a sympathetic woman. Forget the rest. The older sister played by Willa Holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being repellent is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear, I suspect. The notion that this family go off to Genoa to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that, all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited. If Michael Winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of Genoa is, why didn&apos;t he just go to the BBC and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity presenter? Why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity?",

      "reviewBody": "As you might know, Baseball is not big in Germany. Hardly anybody knows or understands the rules. People watch soccer here. Basketball gets bigger. But Baseball? No.\n\nSo this movie, which many of my friends watched as well, was my first contact with this interesting sport. Of course, it is a fairy tale. Of course, the underdog won&apos;t get that big that it will beat everybody and win the championship. Or will it? \n\nSports history tells us different. The story is the same in every sport. Just two years ago, a team just promoted from second division won the German soccer championship! \n\nThis movie depicts the glorious story of a bunch of outsiders and underachievers who finally win some games. And it is told in such a wonderful manner that you can&apos;t but root for them on their way out of the slumps. Yes! It is a simple story! But the characters are wonderful, the wisecracking Harry Doyle incredibly funny and the finals... well... no spoilers here.\n\nMy most favorite moment is when oldtimer pitcher Harris is replaced by Charlie Sheens character in the finals. In the first games of the season, some die-hard fans had given Sheen the nickname &quot;Wild thing&quot; and sang the famous song. Now, the whole crowd is chanting this song as Sheen steps onto the field to pitch his largest enemy. This scene always gives me goosebumps. It is splendid.\n\nMany great moments, excellent humor and a fate you would wish for your favorite sports team as well - unless you are one of those boring Yankees, Bulls or Bayern Muenchen fans...",

No time to spy follows the loud family as they welcome myrtle into the family as thier grandmom. But that&apos;s interrupted as an enemy from myrtle&apos;s past. I loved it from start to finish. It was filled with action emotional a mature theme and was overall fun. The animation for the movie was phenomenal (don&apos;t know who did the animation but it was great). Music was fantastic (what got me was loud house family and the redo of the theme song for the show in a orchestra tune those hit me with emotions). It was a great movie. I enjoyed it as much as the first one nearly three years latter (some say the new movie&apos;s better than the first one but my opinion I liked both of them the same). This beats the casagrandes movie (I watched that and I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as everyone else I just felt like a movie for the casagrandes wasn&apos;t necessarily but that&apos;s just my opinion). No time to spy is another fantastic job by the crew members of the loud house. (hope they do a third movie in the future). Probably my favorite movie of the year so far. Highly recommend for the whole family. Definitely a 10.",

We know how it was going to end. \n\nAnd the part about the young boy trying to play matchmaker to his mother and an ex-con was idiotic. Also the part about mother accepting it was more idiotic. The kind of faith that she puts in him was just too naive, especially considering that she is a parole officer.\n\nSigourney Weaver&apos;s role was also very contrived. They could have taken the whole thing out of the movie without taking anything from the whole plot. The whole movie is mess really. There is no narrative coherence. Parts have been stacked on just to get some laughs. Alas, If only there were laughs. This is an old wine in an old bottle.",

      "reviewBody": "The acting is terrible, it&apos;s laughable. The music seems very unfitting at several places, and is cut weirdly. The movie has been color corrected in a way that makes the color seem strange in the scenes in the dark school hallways. Sometime the editing and sound effects are awesome. At other times they are just bad. \n\nBut this film is a lot of fun. Several of the characters are so over-the-top that they come out as hilarious. I love the &quot;final girl&apos;s&quot; boyfriend. He&apos;s a bad-ass. And the fat Shaggy-esque guy is a riot. There are some really cool deaths, like the buzz-saw murder or the with the fire extinguisher-kill. They are great.\n\nAnd the ending was actually unexpected. Good job there.\n\nDespite all the flaws it&apos;s worth a watch. And you know what? I had much better time watching this low budget slasher than Mikael H√•fstr√∂m&apos;s big budget Strandvaskaren/Drowning Ghost. This is way better.",

Emma Thompson can do more with a slightly quirked eyebrow and a quiet &quot;Hm&quot; than most actresses can with an entire Shakespearean soliloquy. The whole cast, children and adults alike, is pretty near perfect, some of the best of the British theater even in the tiniest roles (Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton et al). The kids are tough and tart, without a simper in the lot, unlike most US child stars.\n\nDon&apos;t let the trailers keep you away -- this is well worth seeing, sort of what Lemony Snicket should have been but wasn&apos;t.",

On the other hand, the 10/10s are clearly from the other side of the fence and appear to be OVER defensive of faith, and perhaps of faith films. I have seen it, and whilst not the best film ever, you should watch it, perhaps your opinion of BOTH sets of reviewers will be the same as mine afterwards.

      "reviewBody": "Following disastrous box-office for his ambitious fantasy film LE SEUIL DU VIDE, Jean-Fran√ßois Davy returned to territory he had mined earlier with his commercially successful if critically frowned upon erotic drama LA DEBAUCHE. Lightening the mood considerably, he had five pretty young things roaming the French country side in search of a holiday they can&apos;t afford, due to an economic reality the perpetually penniless director knew all too well. He may very well have been alone in incorporating this aspect into a genre generally focused to an (appropriately) almost obscene degree on lavish luxuries out of reach to the vast majority of its intended audience. BANANES MECANIQUES ¬ñ its title a reference to Kubrick&apos;s A CLOCKWORK ORANGE which was called ORANGE MECANIQUE in France ¬ñ was the first and most financially viable installment in what was to become Davy&apos;s &quot;trilogie paillarde&quot; (which would translate as naughty or ribald trilogy) and remains one of the first seriously sexy movies to play regular theaters in France, outside of the &quot;specialized circuit&quot;. \n\nThe story, hastily penned by Davy over the course of a weekend, may seem like a simple-minded mix of broad comedy routines (the girls distracting a man pushing a wheel-barrow, prompting him to bump into a wall and fall down), cute cinematic references (all five kissing their communal lover goodbye, shot like a western showdown, complete with Morricone type music) and severely dated politics (chairman Mao is paid considerable lip service), but is presented with such a hell bent for leather enthusiasm that it hits more than it misses. As a result, while clearly a product of its time, the movie retains an infectious charm lacking in many of its contemporaries. \n\nSummer&apos;s here and five girlfriends who have trouble making ends meet at their dead end jobs decide to semi-squat at the villa of one of their fathers who&apos;s gone to the coast with his youthful mistress while leaving his daughter Pauline (the exquisite Pauline Larrieu) to her own devices. In tow are a temperamental wannabe starlet, portrayed by skin flick stalwart Anne Libert (who starred in Jess Franco&apos;s cut-rate horror trilogy LES EXPERIENCES EROTIQUES DE FRANKENSTEIN, Dracula CONTRA FRANKENSTEIN and LA FILLE DE Dracula), who was dumped by the roadside with her kid sister (sweet Marie-Georges Pascal from Jean Rollin&apos;s LES RAISINS DE LA MORT, who tragically took her own life in 1985) following a spectacular row with her manager (Davy regular Philippe Gast√©), the sister&apos;s best friend (played by the director&apos;s sister Marie-Claire, stepping in for another actress at the last moment) and the sympathetic salesgirl who allows Pauline to nick stuff until this behavior gets her sacked, a nice turn from seldom seen Elizabeth Drancourt who had appeared in Julien Saint-Clair&apos;s LE DESIR ET LA VOLUPTE with equally alluring lookalike (and ex-Davy acolyte) Denyse Roland. Not an awful lot happens. The girls sit around, talk, dance, get naked (a lot, thankfully) and try to catch the eye of the local menfolk. Contrary to the director&apos;s subsequent endeavors (PRENEZ LA QUEUE COMME TOUT LE MONDE and Q), the sexual content isn&apos;t played for purely laughs here ¬ñ a slapstick styled tale of a burglar satisfying neglected housewives notwithstanding ¬ñ and, as its free-wheeling (largely improvised, as Davy readily admits in the accompanying DVD interview) approach leaves pacing all over the place anyway, nudity is lingered upon to enchanting erotic effect. Highlights include luscious Libert carnally contorting in front of a full length mirror and the ubiquitous fireplace love scene involving good-looking Gast√© and lovely Larrieu, the latter a respected French thespian who graduated from &quot;au naturel&quot; appearances in Daniel Da√´rt&apos;s LE VOYAGEUR and LES FELINES to tons of TV work in some of the country&apos;s best-loved and longest running shows. As an actress, she&apos;s clearly head and shoulders above the others. Like most dedicated amateurs, Libert would either go full throttle, as this part allows her plenty of opportunity for, or remain strictly decorative with little room for nuance between both extremes. She possessed a zesty personality that translated well to the series of the undemanding yet lively sex comedies that called upon her services. \n\nWatch for a cameo by the director as the fledgling communist who tries to bed the delectable Drancourt, whose tearful reaction to this character&apos;s self-inflicted death late in the proceedings plays more like an in-joke rather than honestly attempted drama. The soon to be Mrs. Davy, Dominique Vall√©e, appears at film&apos;s end as the mistress to middle-aged character actor Jacques Robiolles, playing Pauline&apos;s ill-tempered pops, throwing the lot of them out of his house after a drunken orgy. With colorful camera work by Roger Fellous, on the verge of gaining considerable if largely genre-related recognition, the movie holds up as a pleasant and completely unpretentious piece of fluff, presumably best viewed within context for the place it occupies both within Davy&apos;s body of work and erotic cinema history in general.",

      "reviewBody": "THE DEVIL&apos;S ROCK is a little-known but more than effective Kiwi horror flick set during the dark days of WW2. It&apos;s one of those films that links the Nazis with the occult, exploring their penchant for black magic with a very dark storyline, although unlike most it doesn&apos;t go down the obvious route and just real with Nazi zombies. This time things are a lot odder, and dare I say it, more effective.\n\nThe film is oddly set on the Channel Islands, as a couple of soldiers infiltrate a Nazi bunker and discover that a massacre has just taken place. What soon unfolds is a plot involving devil worship, black magic, and the summoning of a powerful demon with a taste for human flesh. For a low budget movie, this is decent: for most of the running time we&apos;re trapped with three actors in a single location, and yet it never feels stale or boring.\n\nI&apos;m not saying that THE DEVIL&apos;S ROCK is a masterpiece, because it isn&apos;t. The acting and script are only average. Matthew Sunderland gives the best performance as the conflicted Nazi colonel, and it&apos;s a shame when his character turns out to be far more ordinary than you expect from the set-up. Still, there&apos;s plenty of flowing gore on offer here, alongside effective demonic scenes that bring to mind the best of the Dennis Wheatley classic, THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. Horror fans should enjoy themselves.",

This film is a standout, though, not because of the story or acting (both charming), but because of a virtuoso bit of directing by the Master, in which the location of the killer is revealed. As I watched the scene unfold for the first time, I remember thinking, &quot;This is what makes Hitchcock Hitchcock.&quot; I wish I had never seen any Hitchcock films so I could watch them all again for the first time. His is a brilliant body of work, and this is an often overlooked example of his mastery of the film art."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Highwaymen&quot; marks the return of director Robert Harmon and composer Mark Isham to the subgenre of road-film terror they all but established in 1986&apos;s landmark horror film, &quot;The Hitcher.&quot; Whereas that film coasted on the ambiguity of Eric Red&apos;s minimalist script and the bizarre chemistry between a psychopath (Rutger Hauer) and his victim (C. Thomas Howell), &quot;Highwaymen&quot; is a much &apos;cleaner&apos; version of that film--cleaner in terms of cinematography, violence, and overall appearance. It&apos;s an extremely glossy production with well-choreographed action and razor-sharp editing that places you in the midst of chaos rather than just assaulting your senses. Jim Caviezel&apos;s jaded victim exudes the right notes of obsession and exhaustion, and Rhona Mitra&apos;s pseudo-Sandra Bullock looks go a long way as she joins up to hunt down Fargo (Colm Feore, looking like a refugee from David Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Crash&quot;), a killer who uses his souped-up 1972 El Dorado as a weapon. As he did in &quot;The Hitcher,&quot; Harmon shows confident skill in photography, editing, and the decision to keep villain Fargo off camera for the first hour, thereby upping the suspense considerably. Isham&apos;s musical score sets a proper mood and is just as effective as his previous work. Where &quot;Highwaymen&quot; comes up short is in its straightforward, bare-bones story (padded out somewhat by the addition of Frankie Faison&apos;s traffic investigator); clocking in at a paltry 81 minutes (including end credits), one gets the impression that characters could have been developed further and more action sequences could have been infused into the film. As it stands, &quot;Highwaymen&quot; is in too much of a hurry, but remains a diverting, fine-tuned thriller all the same.",

      "reviewBody": "Basket Case 2 (1990) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nDuane (Kevin Van Hentenryck) and his deformed brother managed to survive the ending of the previous film. After they escape their hospital room the duo are taken in by a woman (Annie Ross) who gives shelter to the deformed. Once at their new home the two try to settle in with other freaks but a pesky news woman (Judy Grafe) won&apos;t leave them alone.\n\nBASKET CASE wasn&apos;t the greatest movie ever made but it contained a certain atmosphere and a certain look at the sleazy side of New York City that it was impossible to ignore. This sequel had a much bigger budget, is a lot less sleazy and has a completely different look but it&apos;s unique enough to where it&apos;s entertaining in its own way. Director Frank Henenlotter certainly doesn&apos;t like making &quot;normal&quot; movies and this one here has enough strangeness for two films.\n\nAgain, if you&apos;re expecting the look or feel of the original then it&apos;s best that you don&apos;t even bother with this sequel. What I enjoyed most is that they try to make this sequel pick up exactly where the original left off, which isn&apos;t something a lot of films try. I think for the most part it works but, again, it was impossible for them to get the look of the first film simply because times had changed by the time this was made. The deformed creatures here are also a lot different in that each of them has a terrific look, although none of them will be mistaken for humans. The special effects are excellent and you truly get some great imaginations at work with the creature design.\n\nPerformances are actually better than you&apos;d expect with Van Hentenryck doing a very good job in the lead. Fans of DAWN OF THE DEAD will be happy to see David Emge playing Moon Face. BASKET CASE 2 features some pretty tame violence up until the ending, which I won&apos;t spoil but it packs a nice little punch."

      "reviewBody": "Bob Hoskins made two widely popular movies in the 1980s and this was one of them. Having seen the other, &quot;The Long Good Friday,&quot; I wasn&apos;t expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. Hoskins, just out of the slams, is hired to drive a high-end black hooker, Cathy Tyson, from one wealthy client to another. He grows to care for her and when she asks him for a favor, find a strung-out young girl named Kathy, a former roomie of hers, he agrees. He searches the seedier places of London until he finally digs her up. She very young and very hooked. Robbie Coltrane is Hoskins&apos; friend, and Michael Caine is a sort of procurer. The ending is both distressing and violent -- distressing because some of these characters are fully fleshed and we feel we&apos;ve come to know them. \n\nThe film is quite nicely done. The score makes much use of Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole&apos;s ballad, Mona Lisa, evoking mystery, and it&apos;s appropriate. The composer has worked what seem to be endless variations of the first four notes of the theme into the score. We hear it in the background often, in minor key, or played exclusively on double bass, or burnished by horns. Those four notes insinuate themselves into the incidental music so often that a listener loses the sense that they are the introduction to a pop song and they come to have an ominous functional autonomy, disembodied from the simple tune that prompted it. They become their own song.\n\nThe acting is fine. Bob Hoskins is an essentially moral guy, short and unprepossesing, who first shows up on screen wearing an echt-1970s bell-bottomed leisure suit (he&apos;s been in for seven years, remember) and carrying a bouqet of flowers that his wife, berserk with anger, tells him what to do with. His gradual attraction to his passenger is nicely laid out, as are the reasons for his occasional displays of violence. He&apos;s a sensitive guy, but not too thoughtful. A lot of things get by him. But, to be fair, they get by the viewer too.\n\nThere&apos;s an element of humor running through the film, mostly expressed in the relationship between Hoskins and Coltrane, who plays a writer and a sculptor of things made of plastic spaghetti. (&quot;The Japanese have cornered the market.&quot;) The dialogue is pretty funny in a low-key way. Hoskins and Coltrane sit watching TV and Hoskins remarks something like, &quot;Remember that guy who was murdered? Well, I did it.&quot; Coltrane: &quot;You&apos;re not joking?&quot; Hoskins (turning and staring grimly): &quot;I -- never -- joke.&quot; Coltrane: &quot;You used to tell that one about the randy gorilla.&quot; And here is Hoskins describing his passenger, telling Coltrane that she&apos;s not out to exploit him, Hoskins, because &quot;she&apos;s a lady.&quot; Coltrane: &quot;A lady? I thought you said she was a tart.&quot; Hoskins: &quot;Well -- she is, but she&apos;s a f****** lady too.&quot; \n\nAnd Cathy Tyson almost beggars description, tall, slender, lithe, not staggeringly beautiful or sexy, but her appeal extends far beyond mere appearance. She&apos;s gorgeous in the most personal way. She tends to keep her face down and her eyes lowered, almost demurely, and her voice is soft and low, just above a whisper, although you never have to strain to hear what she&apos;s saying because her pronunciation is modulated and precise. It&apos;s soothing, in control and at the same time reassuring, the voice of an announcer on a late-night FM station playing nothing but classical music. You could listen to her for hours. You could look at her for hours too, for that matter. Michael Caine doesn&apos;t have a big or showy part, but he&apos;s so reliable that he&apos;s always a pleasure to see on screen. I can&apos;t think of a single film that has been damaged by his presence, although he&apos;s been in a few bummers. \n\nThe photography is perceptive. We get a good deal of local color not only from the London locations but from &quot;the seaside,&quot; where everything comes to a head. There isn&apos;t a lot of violence. What there is of it is quick and pointed. \n\nSee it if you get the chance.",

What a story!\n\nI loved too how they incorporated not only the typical Christian Christmas story, but also Jesus&apos; Parable of the Lost Sheep from Luke 15:3-7 into the plot-line of his story, which makes it especially special.\n\nIf you can find it (and ABC Family often broadcasts this special during their 25 Days of Christmas every December) I think this is one special to watch."

      "reviewBody": "For like two years Trick R Treat never seemed to come off the &quot;Upcoming Releases&quot; list. I can&apos;t for the life of me see why.\n\nIt might not be an all time great, but it is so much better than 20 odd absolute crapfests that were actually fast-tracked into cinemas over the last year to cash in on the current renaissance that horror has been enjoying lately.\n\nExamples? Orphan / The Last House on the Left / Halloween 2 / The Unborn / The Uninvited / Stepfather / Final Destination / Sorority Row Now re-read that list above and tell me what was a MUST SEE in cinemas.\n\nI&apos;ll wait¬Ö Thought so.\n\nTrick R Treat is hardly a frightening flick, but it is sharp, clever, amusing, inventive and most of all fun. None of those words scream &quot;direct to DVD&quot; to me - but that is what happened anyway.\n\nHalloween has never really taken root in Australia, but over the last decade or so it has become more evident that Aussie kids are aware of the possibilities of free lollies and late nights, and the pressure seems to be going back on parents and homeowners to take it seriously. I know that we never bothered getting a serious stash of lollies ready until around three years ago, but this year our house got door-knocked at least 20 times.\n\nWhat has been true for many years is that horror movies are more popular around this time of year, as many are made for US release to coincide with the holiday.\n\nThe plot of Trick R Treat is actually hard to describe, it is more a series of initially random events involving the same group of characters than a linear storyline. They all take place on Halloween (natch) in a small US town that obviously takes the night seriously.\n\nThe main combatants of the film include: A young couple arriving home from the night&apos;s festivities, with the young woman knocking back a kind offer of intercourse in favour of cleaning up the Halloween decorations in the yard.\n\nThe local school principal and his dealings with a trick or treater (played by the doofy kid from Bad Santa), which is interrupted by his son and a grumpy neighbour.\n\nFour nubile young skanks prepping for a night where they are all hoping to &quot;pull&quot;, including two absolute hotties and a pair of sisters, one of whom is Anna Paquin as a somewhat reluctant trollop dressed as Red Riding Hood.\n\nA group of kids who attempt to pay respect to the victims of a past local tragedy involving a crashed school bus, and who rope in an unpopular young woman for the ceremony.\n\nAnd¬Ö The afore-mentioned grumpy neighbour of the School Principal - obviously not a fan of Halloween - and his dealings with celebrating kids.\n\nEarly on there are a few more fake scares than I would have liked, you know where the camera lingers, the music builds, the character&apos;s hand hovers¬Ö and nothing happens. I started to worry that the release of the film was delayed with cause but thankfully that feeling was short lived.\n\nThe plot interweaves &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; style between the seemingly random events, and we gradually see how all these events are practically related, and often impact other character&apos;s stories later on, (or at times earlier on, there are a few flashbacks).\n\nThere is also a little character in a sack over a pumpkin-head outfit who pops up in the periphery of all stories, he finally has his own scene near the very end in a scene that is worth the wait.\n\nHow this wasn&apos;t released to cinemas is beyond me. It seems to have every key element required to cash in big time, it is funny, has some good scares, sexy teens and a little innuendo without overstepping the gore or bad taste boundaries. I would have thought with a little advertising and some word of mouth this would have seen a huge audience over the Halloween period from the teens that will - if we&apos;re honest - go and see almost anything anyway.\n\nIt most certainly deserved far more than a direct to DVD release, hopefully the inevitable sequel sees a better fate.\n\nFinal Rating ‚Äì 7.5 ‚Äì 10. A little tame to be considered a great horror film, this will find itself on a great many &quot;underrated&quot; lists in coming years, and will no doubt prove a great introduction to the horror genre for many curious teens in years to come. You could do an awful lot worse.\n\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn&apos;t) check out oneguyrambling.com",

      "name": "&quot;Dear Lord Jesus, I really must insist that you help me win the election tomorrow&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dear Lord Jesus,&quot; prays Tracy Flick the night before the election for student body president, &quot;I do not often speak with you and ask for things, but now, I really must insist that you help me win the election tomorrow because I deserve it and Paul Metzler doesn&apos;t, as you well know. I realize that it was your divine hand that disqualified Tammy Metzler and now I&apos;m asking that you go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong so that I may carry out your will on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.&quot; \n\nTracy (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving senior in suburban George Washington Carver High School (where the student body is all white). What Tracy wants, she gets, using a combination of single-minded hard work, bright smiles as phony as a television infomercial, eager volunteering and a ruthlessness that varies between chirpiness and squinted eyes. As Tracy says, quoting her Mom, &quot;The weak are always trying to sabotage the strong.&quot; \n\nThen one of Tracy&apos;s teachers, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) decides the world needs to be saved from Tracy. He talks one of the school&apos;s popular football athlete&apos;s to run against Tracy. From now on Jim has his hands full trying to sabotage Tracy&apos;s relentless campaign, impregnate his wife, convince himself his next door neighbor, a recent divorc√©e, is really going to understand him if they can only check into a motel for a couple of hours...and deal with the consequences of everything he set in motion. \n\nElection, written and directed by Alexander Payne, is one of the funniest, darkest satires of human behavior since Jonathan Swift recommended that the poor should simply sell their children to be eaten by the rich. There are a lot of teenagers in this movie, but it&apos;s not just another teen-age movie. We&apos;re looking at the ludicrous depths to which ambition and good intentions, when mixed with politics, can take us. If that seems ponderous, it&apos;s about as ponderous as Tracy Flick&apos;s mom writing compulsively to people like Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole asking for advice. (Never give up on your dreams is the usual reply.) \n\nThe script moves from the exaggerated to the outlandish with great style. The actors deliver the goods with deadpan sincerity and self-serving honesty. Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick hits the bull&apos;s-eye with unnerving accuracy. She is so sincere in her insincerity, which is, in Tracy Flick&apos;s own way, completely sincere, that Witherspoon makes us smile and shudder at the same time. As outstanding as she is, Matthew Broderick is the heart of the movie. Jim McAllister is part lech, part nebbish, but mostly good guy. It&apos;s a funny, almost poignant performance. Payne&apos;s script and Broderick&apos;s acting give us a perfect ending that&apos;s just as brittle, cool and amusing as the rest of the movie. \n\nI like Election a lot. I hope as time passes the movie isn&apos;t forgotten.",

A rare feat nowadays when you either have an empty formula film or non-commercially viable atmospheric horror classic.\n\nCinematography is superb, the green cast of the hospital int. shots are personal favorite. Although i&apos;ve seen it on countless music videos and other horror films abroad, it worked because it serves the mood of the film well.\n\nOne flaw is the excessive use of familiar faces which took away some of the suspense, but then again, they may be one of the reason why the movie was made in the first place.\n\nOver all - a good film that i would recommend. it raised the bar of Filipino horror-suspense films a notch. Stop reading and get a copy."

      "reviewBody": "To be entirely honest, A GREAT many of these predictably pulpy, Edgar Wallace Krimis can irksomely vacillate between sublimely skewed amusement and leaden tedium; fortuitously, this particularly audacious offering is excitingly directed by the highly skilful German filmmaker, Alfred Vohrer who, as always, keeps the bristling action ticking over at rewardingly delirious speeds! The pleasingly lurid plot is standard Wallace fare: a bizarre, conspicuously homicidal individual is killing nubile young women, and a considerable inheritance is involved. But the real kicker here is the truly astonishing and uber-funky burlesque score by acclaimed music maestro, Peter Thomas. I honestly believe a comprehensive appraisal of his scintillating soundtracks for film &amp; TV is LONG overdue! Brimming over with bravura B-Movie incident, Edgar Wallace&apos;s colourful crime caper, &apos;The Hunchback of Soho&apos; is a kooky-kitsch delight from start to finish, and it might remain my favourite Krimi! Alfred Vohrer I salute you!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Part comedy, part drama, part cultural clash; this is the kind of movie you should go out to see if you fall into the following categories: 1) You&apos;re on a night out, preferably date, with someone whose cultural background is different from your own, 2) You are a Scandinavian who simply love Scandinavian films, despite their frequent array of shortcomings, and will most certainly &apos;go patriotic&apos;, 3) You are desperately trying to prove to yourself that you can be politically correct in all meanings of the term, or 4) You want to see some sort of romantic comedy really, really badly and unfortunately there just isn&apos;t anything better on.\n\nIt&apos;s a quilt, but not very well stitched together. Dangling storyline(s), mostly half-hearted acting, lack of direction, no universal mantra or moral to be grasped. There seems to be no real to the characters or the situations they are in, things just happen and are sort of dealt with. Sometimes in a good ways and most of the times in ways that are quite the opposite.\n\nThe film has its moments and will probably go home well with the lovestory-seeking teen demography and likely also their older and less movie-attending peers. But those of you who have seen quite a few similar kind of movies are most likely to see its shortcomings. The upside to this film is that although not being very good, it is at the same time not very bad. And sometimes &quot;not bad&quot; is good enough. Mainly it serves its purpose, and on the upside Jan Fares and Torkel Petersson act splendidly in some of their scenes. And Nina Zanjani looks stunning, as always. Maybe a little too much on the Young Celine Dion side in this film, but stunning nonetheless. There are some thought-out moments and decent ideas, though too many of them seem cramped within the story and even the good ones rarely lead anywhere. My guess is that they just didn&apos;t find the time to fine-tune the script. Or maybe the didn&apos;t care? The lack of refinedness could very well point towards the latter explanation.\n\nIn total I kind of regretted spending an evening going to the screening of this film. But I still hope most of you won&apos;t feel the same way after having watched it.",

If it were my movie , I would have cut the first scene completely (playground, it added almost nothing, the little it did is a spoiler), and then got more into the &quot;clinic.&quot; But it&apos;s not and so it went from horror to horrible slow and steady.\n\nOne thing I&apos;ll give, the suspense sucks you in.

      "reviewBody": "... so says Tom Hanks in 1993&apos;s &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; to his son in reference to this movie and comparing its outcome to a strange woman who has been writing the widower (Hanks) as a result of him appearing on a radio show. But that&apos;s another movie.\n\nThe point is, its lesson was still easily recognizable in popular culture six years after it was made. What looks like an easy lay with a beautiful single woman can easily turn into an object lesson on Murphy&apos;s law. Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is a successful NYC attorney, and on a weekend when his wife and daughter are away from home at his in-laws&apos; house, he has a work meeting that includes Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), an editor for a publishing company. This leads to a drink at a bar, and that leads to a passionate one night stand that turns into a two night stand when Alex attempts suicide when Dan tries to leave.\n\nDan thinks it&apos;s over. Alex has seemed to come to her senses. But then she tells him she is pregnant, and no she is having this baby because she is 36 and it may be her last chance. When Dan insists he is not leaving his wife for her, that he does not love her - well, let&apos;s just say that the opposite of love is not hate it&apos;s indifference, and Alex at first stalks Dan and gradually turns up the heat until his entire family is at risk. The suspense builds until the harrowing end.\n\nThe thing is, Dan always loved his wife, subtly played by Ann Archer. She is beautiful, supportive, and he still has passion for her. They have a little girl and are a very happy family. But he just could not say no to what looked like a one night adventure that nobody need ever know about that turns into a nightmare.\n\nThere is more to the film than the cautionary &quot;Don&apos;t cheat on your wife&quot; message. I think it&apos;s because Glenn Close does such a fantastic job playing Alex. There&apos;s something about her portrayal that, to me, paints Alex as ultimately powerful, not just outright insane. Until the end she mostly dominates what happens to Michael Douglas&apos; character&apos;s life. I think this one has aged well and would still recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a colorful, enchanting though superficial fictional semi-biography of Ludwig Van Beethoven (Ed Harris) kissed with genius. His last days are brought to life in this entertaining drama musical . This 104 minutes film gives you a splendid idea of the most famous classical music composer .The picture concerns about the tempestuous relationship between a young girl (Diane Kruger) who works as copyist and the excellent musician. A number of factual liberties are taken is this imaginative screen-biography of the history&apos;s great composer but it doesn&apos;t matter because is also based on real events, as his problematic relation submerged by dramatics with his nephew Karl Van Beethoven(Joe Anderson). Not too bad as biopic go, but musical talent and Ed Harris interpretation is definitely the star in this production. Beethoven&apos;s music is the highlight of the film as when he directs the orchestra amid the strains of symphonies 5,7 9,¬®Ode to joy¬® and she helps him .\n\nIt&apos;s a stunning film full of superb music, literate, wit and an immensely dramatic fire. The picture contains some striking visual images ,lavish setting, terrific period piece with realistic scenario for the XIX century filmed on location in Budapest,Hungary, besides nifty brilliant costumes. Ed Harris delivers a convincing portrayal, sometimes a little bit exaggerated, of the popular composer whose music is become immortal. Ed Harris(nominated for Academy Award by ¬®Pollock¬®) acting is magnificent, he expresses musical genius and a first class finger-matching and musical conductor of Beethoven&apos;s music has a glorious sweep. The German actress Diane Kruger(Troy,National treasure) is beautiful and gorgeous, she is resolute but vulnerable in the role as copyist and admirer of the greatest composer she has ever heard. The Academy of Ancient Music Orchestra and soloists contributed to the splendid soundtrack. Atmospheric and glimmer cinematography by Ashley Rowe is simply stunning. The motion picture is well directed by Agnieszka Holland. Devotees of the music will appeal this film which is a fine tribute to the master.",

Boa is a unique film with the same kind of bad graphics like those used in others like it, but it is more entertaining than Python, a film I absolutely hate. Dean Cain leads the cast and he is perhaps the best actor on the screen, although his character&apos;s mood changes constantly and impossibly. First he&apos;s all upset because he thinks his wife has been killed by the snake and next scene, he&apos;s just concentrated on getting out of the prison and not even thinking about her. And the other members of the cast are either so-so or terrible. Overall, Boa is a better film than others of its kind, but not anywhere near a decent motion picture.",

Four years later, he builds a time machine. However when he tries going back to rescue Emma, she is killed in a different way. Disenchanted, he travels forward in time to 2030 to search for a way to change the past. However he finds nothing about time travel. He jumps forward another 7 years to find the world in collapse and chaos after the moon is destroyed. He tries to use his time machine again but an explosion knocks him out. The machine keeps running until 802,701 AD when he regains consciousness.\n\nThe movie works well for awhile, but the future world of Eloi and Morlock is a bit of a letdown. It takes the H. G. Wells world and makes a Planet of the Apes movie out of it. In the end, the well-made movie is let down by this. Also there is an uncompelling action ending. The movie just has nothing profound to say, and is a barely functional action movie.",

I&apos;ve seen some good stuff from Full Moon video, and thought it was worth a shot...  Unfortunately, this was not good stuff.\n\nThe story is about a possessed bed.  A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed, and odd things start happening.  Odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex.  And the man discovers kinky sex.  And the woman draws pictures of kinky sex.  And the man photographs kinky sex.  And they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex.  You&apos;d think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good, right?\n\nWell....  No.  The problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn&apos;t deliver.  There is little tension, no suspense, and no fear.  Aside from some troubling dreams and visions, there really isn&apos;t anything for this couple to be worried about.  The whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed.  Sure, you get a monster fight at the end...and some bloodshed...but nothing spectacular...  There&apos;s only one murder, and one good scare, and that&apos;s it.\n\nAnd the kinky sex?  Don&apos;t get your hopes up (or anything else for that matter).  Their idea of kinky sex is woman on top, fully clothed, trying to strangle her mate with a necktie.  Not exactly my idea of a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "Having lived in North America my entire life, and only seeing the rest of the world through movies, books, and TV, I confess I have no experience of what the world is like when your home is a battlefield, especially in places like the Balkans and the Middle East, which have been sources of strife for several centuries.  For many, of course, it&apos;s a source of tragedy.  But what about those who may live on the edge of conflict, but aren&apos;t directly involved?  For those who the challenge is simply to fit your day to day life around the war?  HOPE AND GLORY was a film like that, though it was also about a little boy who could of course only see school was out, and WEST BEIRUT is like that as well; in fact, it retains the child-like view of HOPE AND GLORY but balances it with the adult viewpoint.\n\nWriter-director Ziad Doueiri isn&apos;t interested in making a tract about the Lebanese Civil War(though he doesn&apos;t slight from its horrors, as in its opening scene of the bus massacre), but rather picking up the details of everyday life there.  If there&apos;s a message, and Doueiri refreshingly doesn&apos;t hammer us over the head with one, it seems to be this; you do what you can. That&apos;s the attitude of the father of the main character Tarak; when both his wife and his son want to leave, he reminds them they really have no place else to go, these things have happened before, but they will stop, and life will go on.  You can even find humor in your existence(as when Tarak escapes a battle by hiding in a car, which then takes him to what he thinks is a group of guerrillas but turns out to be something else entirely).\n\nDoueiri, who was the second-unit cameraman on every film Quentin Tarantino directed, not only shows his visual flair, but also tells a compelling story, although with a few slow spots, and while the main characters are teens coming of age, we see the adult point of view as well; sometimes it&apos;s mocked(when Tarak&apos;s friend Omar complains his father thinks all Western culture is the devil&apos;s work, Tarak replies, puzzled, &quot;How does Paul Anka come from Satan?&quot;), but mostly it&apos;s taken seriously, and that, I think, helps make this a good film.  Doueiri and his brother Rami(who plays Tarak) are ones to watch.",

And they mean so much more and have so much more impact when held back until the last possible moment. Why can&apos;t we allow ourselves to be immersed in the story?

Although the film was marketed as a comedy, it&apos;s above all a heartfelt drama and a truly moving portrayal of old age. \n\nOne of the highlights: when the three seniors are on a little trip to Manhattan and Art Carney starts dancing to the rhythms some Caribbean Street musicians. It&apos;s such a marvel to see 80-year old George Burns clapping and smiling and genuinely having fun at this improvised street scene. It&apos;s a shame this film is practically forgotten. A heartfelt, funny, and ultimately a very moving picture. Don&apos;t miss this one.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 9/10"

In fact, when it began, I cringed wondering how campy it could possibly be.  This first impression quickly transformed as some special effects were artfully used to convey that I was in for fast and thought-provoking ride.\n\nThe violence in the film stops just short of being gratuitious.  In fact, it is quite purposeful and well done.  As a whole, the film has a little of everything that attracts me: the supernatural, special effects, humor, love story and surprise, surprise, an actual heartfelt message that provides the viewer with &apos;the big picture&apos; on life.  I wanted to give the flick an 8.5/10 but opted for the 8 since this system does not take half points.\n\nBy the way, seeing this film is Hong Kong has the added effect of illustrating one of the film&apos;s points: there are many layers to our day-to-day &apos;reality.&apos;  This may not have such a strong effect for the viewer who lives elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "Czech fairy tales are a staple of German TV. Despite low production values, unspectacular cinematography, and often poor / natural lighting, these movies are the highlights of childhood TV - or at least, they were, for me, and many of my generation.\n\nThey cannot compete with the likes of Disney in some arenas. But they&apos;re in a class of their own when it comes to atmosphere.\n\nThe most famous and popular of these fairy tale movies is Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella (a brilliant merger of Allerleihrauh and Cinderella). Its star, Libuse Safrankova, is a recurring face in Czech fairy tale movies - and one that seemed to ensure movie magic was about to take place. (I suppose she was many a German boy&apos;s first movie crush) Usually cast as princess or heroine, this is the only fairy tale where I&apos;ve ever seen her play an ambiguous character.\n\nThen again, it is also the only of the fairy tale movies where, having just watched it, I am not sure what I&apos;ve actually seen. I have seen this movie once before, when I was very young. I remember feeling strangely elated, bedazzled and awed by the film, and liking it more even than Three Hazelnuts. Unfortunately, we&apos;d neglected to record it on VCR, so it&apos;s been twenty years before I&apos;d see it again.\n\nHaving just seen it, I am strangely elated, bedazzled and awed. With a deep sense of magic and fairy tale atmosphere and characters, this movie manages to tell me a story that resonates, but without repeating a story previously told. There are elements from many different tales, but I cannot identify any single one as the primary influence. (According to the credits, it is a story by K J Erben that was adapted - I am now wondering how I could get my hands on a translation of his work) A prince goes out to find a princess, and never returns. His parents slowly descend into morose unhappiness. Then, visiting gypsies perform, a prophecy is made, and the queen has twin sons, who grow seven times faster than normal children. They grow up - and discover the secrets of their unmentioned brother...\n\nThere is a lot of mystery in the plot. Like many written fairy tales, it springs surprises on you that you would not expect. Sometimes, the narrator gives a lot away, and sometimes nothing at all. Sometimes, you know which character is on screen, and sometimes, you wonder. The movie works its way along unexpected and winding paths towards a finale that is almost indecipherable, thanks to editing and direction. And yet, despite the mystery, despite the unexpected plot turns, despite sometimes intrusive narration, the movie is a gem. In a way, it&apos;s almost because of the asymmetries of the plot, the asymmetries of the resolutions and the unexpected ambiguities that the film is so magnificent.\n\nPerhaps it is accidental, and perhaps others watch the film and find it alienating (or even amateurish) - but to me, the film seems as if it takes fairy tale magic and turns it into something truly artful. There are edges, there are distortions of tales we&apos;ve previously seen and heard, there are questions unanswered by the movie, and it feels unlike any fairy tale I&apos;ve ever seen on screen. Characters may not all be three dimensional, but they are ambiguous - and the ambiguity really enriches the movie.\n\nIt is magnificent. It is quite possibly the best fairy tale movie ever made."

After the first attempt fails he climbs on the edge of the balcony and is about to jump, but than, all the sudden, the beaver speaks out and brings him to his senses. The idea, as simple and dull as it may sound, is actually quite good and interesting when you think about it. Unforunatelly, the script lacks a great deal in structure and character development which is ultimately why the movie is not nearly as good as it could&apos;ve and should&apos;ve been.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Anthon Yelchin are both brilliant in the movie and a big talent is really visible in their performances. Unfortunately, while Yelchin is obviously very, very talented, i just can&apos;t see the leading man in him. His charisma is, i think, really not on the same level with his talent. However, that being said, i do not doubt it that both of them are gonna be Academy Award winners one day. Jennifer Lawrence is already almost there. With one nomination behind her, the second one is surely gonna come. And i think that one day, with the right choice of roles, she could even be Hollywood&apos;s best leading lady. She definitely has what it takes for it.\n\nHowever, all the good performances in this movie really fall to water compared to the one of Mel Gibson. I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s acting or is it him self in the movie, and honestly i don&apos;t care. All i know is that he&apos;s brilliant. If only the character had more to offer, i&apos;m sure the role would be remembered for a long, long time. But even though the movie fails at certain levels, Gibson&apos;s performance was definitely worthy of a much larger recognition. If you ask me, the reason he wasn&apos;t at the Oscars this year, if not as a winner than definitely as a nominee, is the fresh new scandal that happened in his life. And that&apos;s, i think, unfair because he is an actor and he should be judged as an actor and not as a human being. In fact, i don&apos;t think anyone can judge him as a human being since none of us knows him like one. The only way we (the audience), and the critics, can know him is as an actor. As Mad Max, William Wallace, Walter Black and so on.... As far as this role goes, at my opinion, he was definitely robbed of all the recognition he well deserved for the portrayal of Walter Black. An amazing performance that was unfairly overlooked by the Academy&apos;s voters.\n\nThe weakest link as far as the acting goes is, and i can&apos;t believe i&apos;m actually saying this, Jodie Foster. It could be because she was busy working as a director on the movie, but her performance, even though good, is really not on the same level as those of Yelchin and Lawrence, and needless to say, as the one of Mel Gibson. Another thing i felt was very weak is the score. Well, it&apos;s not bad, it&apos;s good. It just doesn&apos;t fit this film. It&apos;s too melodic and.... Italian. I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s right for this kind of story. The score that this movie desperately needed should&apos;ve been something like the one from American Beauty. That would fit great! Slow, sad, tragic... It would&apos;ve been great!\n\nI really wish the script was longer. And simply because you can&apos;t build so many complicated characters in ninety pages. Not convincingly anyway. And especially in a movie like this one which was supposed to be a deep story that deals with a very important subject. What i really like about the movie is the feeling of a solution circling around all the time, but staying unreachable to everyone. Like for example, Walter&apos;s wife showing him pictures of their family back when everyone was happy hoping that he&apos;ll see some hope or inspiration in it.... and so on... which he fails at doing. That could&apos;ve been a real good description of the state he, and the depressed people in general, are usually in. But, once again, the script fails terribly in structure and it prevents it&apos;s character&apos;s from going in whatever direction they were supposed to go. Truth be told, i don&apos;t think it&apos;s the writer&apos;s fault so much as it is Hollywood&apos;s. Producer&apos;s rarely allow the movie to be a piece of art these day&apos;s, even when some movies like this one are meant to be just it. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the first draft was way better than the one they made the movie on.\n\nTo conclude my review, i wasn&apos;t bored, but i was definitely not blown away either. The only thing that was great about the movie is acting. Gibson&apos;s especially. Maybe it&apos;s because i had really high hopes for this movie, but i was a bit disappointed. It&apos;s a good movie, but i expected it to be great!!!! It&apos;s definitely worth a watch, but i wouldn&apos;t put my hopes into being left speechless.",

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with a young woman by the name of &quot;Boom&quot; (Supakson Chaimongkol) having an affair with a rich businessman and accidentally getting pregnant during this time. Realizing that he is extremely wealthy, she goes to him and demands a large amount of money--which he immediately pays. Having done that, however, he then has her gang-raped by several associates just for spite. So, after recovering from this horrific event, she subsequently demands more money--but this time she is beaten up for her efforts. Completely enraged, she seeks out a practitioner in black magic who casts an evil spell on all of those who raped her--to include the businessman&apos;s entire family as well. Sure enough, not long afterward, all of these people die in such an extremely gruesome manner that it catches the attention of a journalist named &quot;Danai&quot; (Somchai Satuthum) who immediately begins to investigate these incidences under the suspicion that black magic is somehow involved. Meanwhile, thinking that her unborn child is now the only heir to a fortune, Boom is shocked to learn of a court settlement granting the businessman&apos;s estate to his former common law wife &quot;Kamala&quot; (Krongthong Ratchatawan) and her children instead. Quite livid at this new development, she quickly devises a plan to ingratiate herself with this family while at the same time employing the same black magic specialist to destroy them in the process. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film turned out to be a rather standard Thai horror film which suffered somewhat from a lack of character development and an overabundance of repetitive death scenes. That being said, while this wasn&apos;t necessarily a bad film by any means, it could have used some improvement and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",

Her uncle takes her to the doctor that finds that she keeps a potato inside her vagina to protect her against intercourse. Her uncle tells to the doctor that in accordance with the lore of the locals, she has a disease called &quot;La Teta Assustada&quot; (meaning &quot;The Frightened Teat&quot; in English) transmitted by the milk of an abused pregnant woman. Fausta decides to bury her mother in her home village, but neither she nor her uncle has the necessary amount for the coffin and the transportation. Fausta starts working as housemaid in the manor of a pianist to raise the necessary money; she befriends the gardener that helps her and Fausta finally resolves her issues. \n\n&quot;La Teta Assustada&quot; is an exotic but boring and unpleasant low budget movie. The story is developed in slow-pace and probably will please viewers of the First World that maybe have never seen a slum and poor people like the dweller of Fausta&apos;s community. Magaly Solier has a great performance and her exotic beauty is impressive. The translation of the title of this film to English (&quot;The Milk of Sorrow&quot;) is ridiculous since the correct translation would be &quot;The Frightened Teat&quot;. The summary in IMDb from Pusan International Film Festival is ridiculous and the author has certainly not understood the story; or maybe the translation from Spanish was wrong. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Teta Assustada&quot; (&quot;The Frightened Teat&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "With most movie franchises, the sequels are often inferior to the originals. While this may also be true for the &apos;Planet of The Apes&apos; series, the fourth entry in the franchise surpasses the rest. While it may not have been as much of a ground-breaking success as &apos;Planet of the Apes&apos;, &apos;Conquest&apos; had a social commentary that still resonates today, much like the original. This movie has two different endings, but the best of the two is the Unrated version. &apos;Conquest&apos; has wonderful special effects, the best of the series. With a wonderful performance by Roddy McDowell as Caesar, this movie is fantastic. Don&apos;t ignore the sequels simply because of their bad reputation, give these films a chance.",

When a sophisticated but snooty French Formula One driver encroaches on Bobby&apos;s territory, he goes all out to stay number one.\n\nFerrell has a great chemistry with Reilly, a connection to be visited later in their careers. In general, it is a fairly star-studded cast, Adams thrown in with a fairly minor impact role for most of the film. Cohen is recruited to lean into a daft foreign stereotype, his speciality, but with no need for subtlety on this one, blunt jokes revolving around how the character&apos;s supposed superiority and often his homosexuality is responded to by the world of NASCAR.\n\nMuch like Anchorman and Step Brothers, the film is really ridiculous, loud and brash. Something Ferrell&apos;s fans will love, and that others would hate. Honestly though, the bloopers at the end are probably the funniest part.",

One particular line that had me in stitches was when he was telling a cadet to put his Kevlar helmet back on by 1900 hours &apos;or he wouldn&apos;t have a head to wear it on&apos;-pure class!! I&apos;ve always liked Clint for his tough no-nonsense roles. This one is no exception! As a matter of fact, there were plenty of &apos;laugh-out-loud moments in this film to keep everyone happy-like the smart-ass remarks from the punk cadets.\n\nThe showdown between Highway and &apos;The Swede&apos; was highly enjoyable, too.\n\n&apos;Heartbrake Ridge&apos; is certainly a lot more lighter and easier to swallow than the similarly-themed &apos;Full Metal Jacket&apos;.\n\nThis film certainly passes as perfectly adequate, undemanding popcorn viewing."

      "reviewBody": "Kathy (Harley Jane Kozak) is married to Peter (Pullman) with two kids. However she fantasizes over a college boyfriend. As a favour her friend Emily (Elizabeth McGovern) looks him up on a trip to Denver and comes back with tales of this powerful, beautiful man. This immediately causes a rift between them which is resolved when Emily falls pregnant to steady lover Elliot (Brad Pitt). At this point the plot of college boyfriends takes a sideline to the plot of Emily&apos;s pregnancy.\n\nThis starts off as a curiosity with it being funny to see stars like Brad Pitt and Bill Pullman in a less than starry production. However it is quite amusing for the most. The main problem with this is that it doesn&apos;t seem to want to settle on one plot - there&apos;s the Kathy fantasy, the Emily pregnancy, the Emily/Tom affair, the Kathy/Peter marriage, the Peter/Joe suspecting affair piece. There&apos;s so much going on that it gets a little disjoined and it&apos;s difficult to follow one cohesive story. Sure there&apos;s links between them all but it still makes for a film with no clear direction.\n\nThe story is the main weakness, as everything else is pretty good. The performances are all touched with a sense of fun that adds to the comic atmosphere of the film. However once all the storylines come in it&apos;s difficult to keep that element, especially near the end where the stories begin to come together and a lot of the resolutions begin to come together due to coincidence as much as anything else.\n\nIt&apos;s also difficult to believe that Emily wouldn&apos;t jump at the chance of being with Brad Pitt, or that Pullman would get so confused over the situation, never mind the fact that Kathy&apos;s dream lover looks like Billy Ray Cyrus - who would fall of that?!\n\nWhat starts as an inoffensive comedy becomes overly complicated and relies on the type of solutions that would be more at home in a TV sitcom rather than a film. It&apos;s a shame because the rest is not as bad as you could have been. Oh - and it&apos;s spelt with an &apos;U&apos; by the way."

      "reviewBody": "Rash√¥mon was about the multiple framings of the story.\n\nChungking Express is about how two different stories, or glimpses of stories can share the same emotional and physical space.\n\nBoth were incredibly important films that changed cinema and, necessarily, how we dream and follow a story.\n\nThis film is somewhere in between those two, and it extends its hybrid condition as a story framer to the territory of Woody Allen&apos;s dialogs. Allen, himself a master of narrative frames, has his how different set of quirks and obsessions, superficially expressed in his incredible dialogs. That is borrowed by this screenwriter, also the director.\n\nThe outer frame is us watching a number of photographs documenting two friends meeting in a mountain, something we never actually see, and so emphasizes the artificial nature of the device: we&apos;re seeing someone telling the story of 2 people meeting. In that meeting, those two take turns to tell the other bits of stories that happened to them in previous months. So, we are watching the meeting of 2 friends, who remember several events. 3 frames. Within each story that we are told there are some other minor frames. One character is a filmmaker, the other one a poet. In one of the episodes, there is a performance framed, and for a few moments we are not allowed to see it&apos;s a performance. This is a very tight structure, very competent writing. But the real fun of this is the interior of this framed world.\n\nAll the episodes take place in the same small village. Places are very important. So there are places we get to see repeated over and over again, with different bits of story taking place: the restaurant attended by the 3 men and 2 of the women. The hotel, where every assumed sex happens. The new unfurnished apartment. The coffee with a view over the harbor, and the harbor itself. Everyone of these spaces receives a part of the story, different moments, different characters, different pieces of the puzzle. There is a sense of interlaced lives, which we see by glimpses, by small bits, told from 2 points of view, of 2 people who are protagonists of their own stories. We understand that they pass at each other, those stories are one and the same but in the end they hardly touch each other.\n\nFood is an important element. Food is central to every cultural idiosyncrasy in the world, Korea is not the exception and it is really sensitive how korean specificities in the relation with food are brought to the center of this mosaic. Count the scenes that develop around meals.\n\nThe last important element is the orange hat, given by the film director to his mother, who than gives it to another male character whom she&apos;s fond of, and who has a relationship with one of the women who later ends up involved with the film director. That woman ultimately understands the indirect relation between the two men while the director tries to take her to his mom&apos;s restaurant, where she had already been with the other man. That&apos;s this kind of circular relations, crossed lives that we encounter throughout this film. The hat has the same importance here as the teddy bear had in Chungking Express.\n\nWhat put me out of this film was oddly something that usually never fails in korean movies: the pure qualities of the images and various aspects of the mise-en-sc√®ne. This has the cheap look of a video low-budget production, there are several aspects of light and shape that would certainly have benefited the sensitive relation the writer establishes with the spaces. Chris Doyle understands this, we don&apos;t have that here. And the framing of every scene does not remotely match the clever multiple framings in the story. That&apos;s really bad, this film might have a power that we only sense, as it is.\n\nMy opinion: 4/5\n\nhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

How to begin to describe with any degree of rationality the extraordinary effect of bewildering excitement it has had on a near octogenarian, is a task I find daunting. And yet for a work unlike any other in its helter-skelter delivery of an adolescent&apos;s quest for romantic fulfilment ( which I suppose is what it is all about), I feel I should at least take up the challenge. With such an engagingly innocent central character as schoolboy Yu, it seems completely natural to suspend disbelief and go along with everything he experiences, including his hilarious initiation into the skills of a panty photographer, his role as father-confessor at a perverts&apos; convention and his attack with explosives and much blood letting on the HQ of a brainwashing religious cult. Buried beneath it all there could well be many serious messages (you get a big chunk of Corinthians!) or it could be just a pile of tosh. But in the end, who cares, such is the delirious pleasure that just under four hours of outrageous goings-on have delivered. I suppose I just love the theme of innocent youngsters taking on the wicked world. Gosh! I am still reeling, my critical faculties all but shattered!"

      "reviewBody": "Playing a role that few people thought would ever fit her and shadowed by vultures predicting disaster, Liselotte Pulver delivered the surprise coup of many a cinematic season in the icily directed &apos;La Religieuse&apos;.\n\nMs. Pulver, the beloved eternal comedienne of the German cinema, has taken on that most daunting role: the lesbian Mother Superior, the ultimate debauched nun in the ultimate &apos;Why was the Revolution necessary?&apos; tale, Denis Diderot&apos;s grand tale &apos;La Religieuse&apos;. Working against type and expectation under the direction of Jaques Rivette, Ms. Pulver has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career, and she has done this in ways that deviate radically from her former screen roles.\n\nMs. Pulver&apos;s Mother Superior, emerges in this adaptation with her monumental weakness intact. But something new and affecting is simmering within the character, a damning glimpse of self-awareness. You get the sense that if her frantic movement stops for a second, she&apos;ll deflate into a small and bitter creature. \n\nIn films like &apos;Die Z√ºricher Verlobung&apos; and &apos;Das Wirtshaus I&apos;m Spessart&apos; Ms. Pulver&apos;s persona has always been that of a delectable waif, a vulnerable creature with a heart of gold. Here she was cast against type and rumors went that she did not get along with Mr. Rivette. And then, halfway through the film, there she was, and for the first time in her long career she didn&apos;t look remotely like an ing√©nue.\n\nMs. Pulver&apos;s portrait is so intimate and persuasive that you aren&apos;t allowed to step back and think, &apos;What a monster she is.&apos; That&apos;s because, thanks to this actress&apos;s willingness to turn herself and her character inside out, you&apos;ve been inside her mind. What a sad and fascinating place it is."

He needs the help of a pro gambler-now retired named Charlie Firpo.(Bud Spencer)Charlie won&apos;t help Johnny, so Johnny steals Charlies transfer truck and he then agrees to help him.They both find out that they are half brothers. Johnny convinces Charlie that thier father is &quot;Blind&quot; and need to raise $ 100,000  for an eye operation. So Charlie becomes a gambler again just to raise the money.\n\nI laughed alot at this movie! Especially when it showed Bud Spencer dressed up as a baby! I nearly died when I saw that!\n\nIt was good but not one of Terence and Bud&apos;s best comedies! I suggest you one of these: Crimebusters, All the way boys, Watch out, Were mad! or their most famous film &quot;They Call me Trinity&quot;.",

But make no mistake: it&apos;s the English villain, an industrial spy, who is bad, as are those who work with him! There are some very beautiful actresses and actors, very elegant dresses and a rather lovely little song (in French). It gives a very international feeling, since it&apos;s not only in German, but by bits English and French are spoken. I watched a copy (a very bad one) one stormy night, and it was tremendously entertaining. You&apos;ll be able to find this DVD when you browse the net carefully.",

The film touches upon all of the major issues of England in the 1980s, some would say without covering any of them sufficiently.  The figures of Sammy, Rosie, Anna, and Danny (or Victoria, as he calls himself) do their best to come to grips with the world around them, while Rafi and Alice, members of an older generation, can do little more than observe and mourn.  Rosie&apos;s lesbian friends look at her lifestyle and pronounce:  &quot;This is liberalism gone mad&quot;, not realizing that she is merely living up to the egalitarianism they espouse.  Some would have problems choosing a central character, but I choose Rosie.  She is linchpin and catalyst, and at times utterly unreadable."

Much of the film&apos;s budget must have gone on explosives, cars explode, buildings explode, everything explodes at some point....\n\nThe special effects are pretty well staged for a low-budget,straight to DVD/video but the plot gets a bit lost in all the smoke. And I couldn&apos;t help feeling there was a really good story trying hard to get out along the way. I would have preferred the film to concentrate on the characters a bit more rather than just sketching them as one dimensional stereotypes. The film was at it&apos;s most interesting when it went into &apos;conspiracy theory&apos; territory.\n\nSadly, most action films are judged on their special effects these days and if you want a film with lots of action, albeit it all a bit pointless at times, this will suit you fine.\n\nIf there is ever Dark Breed 2, be nice to have more story and less explosions.",

It&apos;s not for everyone and I&apos;m sure plenty of people will find something to be offended over, but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad movie. I found it quite funny, and there isn&apos;t a bad performance to be seen. Elizabeth Shue is especially good.\n\nThere are so many genuinely bad movies accepted as decent out there.

      "reviewBody": "This could be almost anywhere in Eastern Europe in the late nineties. Any country coming out of the Eastern Block has faced this same issues, no wonder, we share the failure of Communism enforced onto whole countries. Therefore most heavy industries failed under the pressure of the many years of high volumes, huge employees numbers, ineffective technologies and means of production and steeply decreasing demand. So the numbers didn&apos;t make sense across the board. These factories had been producing at a loss for years, also during Communism. The reasons are complex, there was also systemic corruption.\n\nSame in China, which is where the model was exported from, via Russia maybe. Not sure, but all Communist countries had very similar models and they all ended up in the same place. The difference in China is that the CCP remained, only there was clearly a political, social, economic shift that discarded whole generations of low-skilled workers that had benefitted from stable livelihoods for years. They had been raised and educated to be just that, an insignificant cog in the machine, keeping it running. Only the machine became useless and was torn apart and scrapped, along with every single piece.\n\nThis is a very convoluted way of saying that as a Romanian this documentary is not showing me anything new. Apart from the fact that I have never seen this done on such a scale in Romania, everything else is familiar and quite logical. The local colour is what is interesting to me here, the workers&apos; discussions, their concerns, hobbies, beliefs. Some of these snippets of conversation are true gems, but not all. It&apos;s still long, very long, although the latter half of this first part was more dynamic and interesting for me, featuring more conversations and more progression towards the inevitable end of the smelting factory. For instance one worker describes his school days. They didn&apos;t learn anything and weren&apos;t made to. Their teachers were forced to pass all students (same as in Romania under Communism) and consequently he can barely read. In the first half another worker laments that currently their children have to be very good students and get a good education so they can get a good job. There is no good job with just a junior high school education, which is what their generation had. They openly discuss their managers, bosses, management corruption and even the indifference and callousness of the CCP, which is surprising to see on film. These were men that didn&apos;t give a damn anymore. They knew they were on film.\n\nAnd although most of them are family men who are worried about their families, they play cards, mahjong, they visit or talk about visiting prostitutes, steal supplies and whatever they can and generally spend a lot of time in the break rooms. It&apos;s true though that production has decreased to a minimum, as some of them explain. It looks like some of them come to work to socialize more than to work and they are routinely sent home for various periods of time. The public baths look very dirty, the protection equipment looks useless, there is so much dust and fumes and they speak openly about the toxicity in the factory. Lead smelting workers have to spend a month in the hospital, several times a year, to have the lead taken out of their blood, which sounds very gruesome, but also is pretty ineffective in the long run I&apos;m sure. Somebody says even their children have lead in their blood. They are just regular people very much a product of the environment they have been put and kept in for whole decades of carefully curated ideology that ultimately failed. It was time for something new. New industries, new kind of factories, new money, probably the same bosses that had gotten rich on the backs of these people and these outdated factories.\n\nI don&apos;t know if the following two parts are pretty much more of the same. I will see. I will try to watch them in full, as found on YouTube. I understand the value of these docs for the Chinese society, they have evidentiary value, but I don&apos;t think the public needs to watch nine hours of this. It will remain a cult classic probably, but could have reached a wider audience with better editing. There is a lot of amazing dialogue in this, but I see Wang Bing tends to make long documentaries.\n\nThe second part of the documentary is more dynamic and focuses on the private lives of the families affected by the factory closures and bankruptcies and forceful relocation due to state sanctioned redevelopment. And that part is something I am not familiar with in my country, unlike the events of the first part.\n\nFor the most part is zeroes in on the younger generation, the future so to speak, the children of these out of work people, all living up to three generations in very run-down, makeshift houses, that look more like barracks than permanent houses. They&apos;ve been living here for decades clearly, they&apos;re probably made improvements and expansions, but these still look like rural dwellings at best. It&apos;s hard to believe these are vast parts of an industrial town. Some of them are rented out or given to the workers, some are owned by them. They have brick walls, but the insides are pretty rudimentary, there&apos;s no flooring, they heat them by burning wood. The alleys are muddy, dirty and cluttered and difficult to navigate in the winter on which it opens. It&apos;s hard to believe anyone would want to live here, but the sad part is that they don&apos;t want to leave because they don&apos;t know where they will live after that. At the end some say they&apos;re received small flats and it&apos;s not enough space for all family members. They feel duped by the rules of the relocation office, who measured their inside living space instead of the entire structural space. There&apos;s of course intimidation, thugs sent to drive away those who do not want to move, bribes to get a better apartment and so on.\n\nThey destroy their own houses or those abandoned to get wood, scraps of metal to sell, anything. Some guys demolish a roof and you can see how precarious the structure is - timber, mud, plastic foil and a metal pipe here and there. Must be freezing in winter, anyway they always wear their coats inside when they are filmed.\n\nAs for those young people, who knows where they are now and what they&apos;re doing, they&apos;re my age... There&apos;s this guy Bobo, who&apos;s supposed to be 17, but looks like 35, chasing after a girl who won&apos;t give him the time of day, rightfully so, he&apos;s practically harassing the poor girl, but I get the feeling that&apos;s how courtship looks to these people. They hang around, laugh, talk crap, nothing serious, no mention of school or the future, they&apos;re clearly aimless, hopeless and futureless. At some point some of them mention odd jobs, contract jobs, finishing some trade school that didn&apos;t teach them anything.\n\nIt&apos;s a little dystopic, only it&apos;s real. Feels very real and kind of tragic. It&apos;s sad to be living like this and become accustomed to it and even to want it to go on. Even more tragic that they might fall much lower than this now that most of them have no steady income.",

Jo (Chahine) wanted to send a clear message to this people &quot;You can never stop ideas from reaching the people, neither by burning the books (last scene of the movie), nor by forbidding movies, etc....&apos; As usual, Averoes in this movie was Chahine himself. Trying to keep a good balance between what the history says about Averoes and what Chahine wanted to reflect on this character, he chose his characters to include all the contradictions he wanted to show. Politics, philosophy, love, integrism, etc.... they are everywhere. This idea of combining Islam with Terrorism bothers Chahine, that is why he started the movie with the french religious authorities burning a man who &quot;Translated the books of this Averoes&quot;, so don&apos;t you be surprised when Muslims burn &quot;Only&quot; the books of Averoes. This analysis of Chahine is what really makes the movie special. It was expected after what happened to him in his last movie (as I said in the beginning), he could have just make it a good reason for a movie showing Muslims as Terrorists, an easy way to attract a Western spectator. But Jo chose the hard way to do it, showing that among all this terrorism, people are still &quot;Life lovers&quot; as mentioned by the first song. These people who just love their life were those fighting against terrorist - not with weapons - but with love. &quot;We have to know first why they are doing this&apos;, said Averoes. Actors were really good specially Nour Elsherif, Mahmoud Hemeida, Khaled Elnabawi and Ahmed Fouad Selim. Mohamed Mounir is as usual the voice of Chahine singing &quot;Sing out loud, we still can sing&quot;.",

The whole point of this movie must be to get some fast money from the fans of the series without making any effort.\n\nThere is just nothing here for anyone. I you have watched or planed to watch the other movies in the series. Skip this one. I you never seem a Puppet Master movie go see another one.\n\nI would recommend Puppet master or Puppet Master 3 - Toulon&apos;s Revenge as a starting point for this series.",

The film is both time capsule and anthropological document. It is an important record of an integral aspect of an era, and also a record of the intellectual arguments on both sides of the emerging movement divide then occurring. It is also, just solely at the level of its achievements as a film, an important transition point in documentary style between the documentaries of the early to mid-60s, and the later, more narrative-driven documentaries that emerged in the 70s.",

There are some really fine, passionate scenes that make you care about the characters. Three-fourths of the plot is roughly predictable, but this movie has the glow of being a fine, original, boiler plate version for many cop stories to come. Moody jazz trumpet score, including songs by Wynton Marsalis. And wow, what a cast: Andy Garcia, Ian Holm, Lena Olin, Richard Dreyfuss, James Gandolfini, Dominic Chianese. What more can I say? \n\nThis movie introduces you to the complexities of the judicial system. It starts with the idealistic view. It leaves you to make the choice of what is right and what is wrong. You&apos;ll have to decide for yourself what is or would be justice. From the politics, the backroom deals and the downright corruption it&apos;s all there. It certainly isn&apos;t pretty because nobody&apos;s perfect. The acting is great but I&apos;ve always felt Andy Garcia is a fine actor. The entire cast was well chosen and you feel their emotions and believe them as their character. The story moves along well and there are enough twists to keep you interested. This isn&apos;t a movie that leaves you cheering for more. It does however make you think about the complexities of justice. When your outside looking in things always look different than when you are inside looking out.\n\nOverall rating: 8 out of 10.",

A reporter and the detectives get mixed into the plot and they aim to stop this &quot;Teleport Madman&quot; before he continues his killing spree. \n\nThis is one of the more dull and dark stories from writer Shinichi Sekizawa, who was known for his more light-hearted and positive screenplays. Jun Fukuda, known for his crime dramas, did well directing. Sei Ikeno&apos;s music score was eerie and added suspense to this thriller. With some heart-pounding terror, this movie is not short on believable special effects. Featuring veteran Toho actors Akihiko Hirata, Yoshio Tsuchiya, and Yumi Shirakawa, this movie is a good one to scare away the kids.\n\nGrade B",

      "reviewBody": "When going to watch Burlesque you first have to know a few things:\n\n1.) You are watching this movie, knowing the acting isn&apos;t going to be great, but to see great musical numbers and fantastic costumes.\n\n2.) The acting is partially terrible because of the cliche ridden but not mind-numbing storyline, and corny writing.\n\n3.) Cher is great, but understanbly only contributed two songs. Would have loved to see more Cher action, but she hadn&apos;t recorded original songs for 7 years. She is also aging, gracefully, but aging nonetheless. This movie was made for Christina Aguilera.\n\n4.) Christina Aguilera. I have a love/hate relationship with her musical career, but you cannot deny the power of her voice in this film and just in general. Her range, control, vibrato and power are just astounding and really shine in the musical numbers. She also looks fantastic here, and does a great job of playing a believable small-town girl trying to make it big.\n\n4.) Stanley Tucci is a national treasure, and is delightful throughout the film with most of the best lines. The whole cast did a great job as well, but Stanley Tucci is great at playing these types of rolls and you can tell he has total fun with it.\n\nThis movie is great if you like musicals and don&apos;t mind sitting through a cute but predictable storyline. As a seamstress I am in love with the costumes, particularly the green silk dress Christina wears 3/4 of the way through the film. It&apos;s dramatic, got a really beautiful built in corset, and with the minimal makeup, hair and jewelry she is transformed into a goddess.",

      "reviewBody": "Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a divorce attorney whose clientele consists primarily of the rich and powerful in the Los Angeles area. He&apos;s well known for an &quot;ironclad&quot; prenuptial agreement named after him and also known for taking his clients&apos; spouses to the cleaners. But when he works his magic against Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), he may have picked on the wrong person.\n\nI didn&apos;t find Intolerable Cruelty very funny. I might have chuckled a couple times. The dialogue was mostly affected and pretentious to my ears. The story wasn&apos;t very interesting to me. I really couldn&apos;t get myself to care what happened to Miles or Marilyn. I&apos;ve liked most of writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen&apos;s previous films, but Intolerable Cruelty seemed to me to have little of the inventiveness and cleverness of their past efforts. I have also liked most of the past films that George Clooney, Billy Bob Thornton and Geoffrey Rush have been in, but here they seemed to be turning in just okay performances for bad material. Heck, I even loved Clooney&apos;s turn at Batman (1997&apos;s Batman &amp; Robin), Thornton&apos;s portrayal of a rocket scientist in Armageddon (1998), and Geoffrey Rush&apos;s eccentric millionaire in House on Haunted Hill (1999), but Intolerable Cruelty just didn&apos;t work for me.\n\nStill, I can&apos;t say the film was a complete failure. I&apos;m giving it a 6 out of 10, which is equivalent to a &quot;D&quot; in my way of looking at ratings. The performances might have been just okay, but they were okay, not awful. The Coens managed some interesting shots, such as Rush through the windshield of his car, where we mostly see a reflection of trees. That was unusual, and effectively conveyed the heat and brightness of a summer day the way a more traditional shot wouldn&apos;t have. The opening scene had promise to me. The Wheezy Joe subplot was fun. The slight suggestions of surrealism in Miles&apos; boss were very enjoyable, although on the other hand, I found myself lamenting that surrealism wasn&apos;t the focus of the whole film.\n\nGlancing at other reviews, obviously the film worked for some people. Maybe if you&apos;re more in the market for a realist drama cum light farce about divorce lawyers, you&apos;d appreciate it more than I did. But for me, it has me rethinking my desire to collect all of the Coen brothers&apos; films on DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is directed by Christopher Monger and written by Ivor Monger. It stars Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.\n\nSet in 1917, plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales&apos; first mountain. However, it turns out that the &quot;mountain&quot; is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals, who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.\n\nA film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart, Monger&apos;s film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s, Re: Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits, while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size (The Mouse That Roared) watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.\n\nHomespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure, to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger. With Grant doing what he does best, the amiable nervous fop, picture has a lead actor fully comfortable with the tone and texture of the production, while around him there are a number of fine character actors putting delightful meat on the comedy bones of oddball characters with names such as Morgan the Goat, Johny Shellshock, William the Petroleum and Betty from Cardiff! Best of the bunch is Griffith as Reverend Jones, a grumpy, stubborn eccentric who underpins everything so wonderfully skew-whiff about life in Ffynnon Garw.\n\nAs for the writing? The screenplay has a wonderful ear for small village dialogue, while in amongst the value of community spirit theme, sits a near sombre observation of the effects of war on such a community. The production design is appealing, with Layton&apos;s photography around the Powys locations a visual treat, and Endelman&apos;s music has a suitably warming and jaunty feel; even if it starts to get a touch repetitive later in the piece. It doesn&apos;t have widespread appeal, it&apos;s clearly a film aimed at a small portion of film fans that love those films mentioned earlier. But in an era when film is being smothered by CGI and visual gimmickry, revisiting something like The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain offers up a most refreshing and diverting experience. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Bangaram(2006) MY rating: 2/5\n\nGenre: action\n\nLanguage: Telugu\n\nPunch Line: Free make(copy) of previous movies\n\nTheme: a journalist helping 2 lovers to success in seem faction\n\nStory:\n\nThe film is all about a young man risking his life to bring the estranged lovers together. \n\nBangaram (Pawan Kalyan) is a journalist. His ambition in life is to join in BBC. His boss fires him, when he fails to bring the interview of a terrorist leader. Bangaram approaches the chairperson of the channel, Peddireddy (Mukeshi Rishi). By consequence of events, Bangaram is forced to spend some days with Peddireddy&apos;s family consisting of his two daughters ¬ñ\n\nSandhya (Meera Chopra) and Vindhya (Baby). Impressed with local faction leader Bhoomareddy&apos;s (Ashutosh Rana) style of functioning Peddireddy fixes his daughter Sandhya&apos;s marriage with Bhoomareddy&apos;s brother. The story then turns. Sandhya has a lover (Raja) with whom she is planning to get married soon. The rest of the film is how our hero Bangaram brings the two lovers together. \n\nTechnical Stuff\n\nThe much awaited &quot;Bangaram&quot; disappoints as far as the story is concerned. Certainly, it is not the sort the element fit for Pawan Kalyan. Romantic expressions, which form part and parcel of Pawan Kalyan films, is utterly lacking in this movie. Imagine a story where you don&apos;t have a heroine for the main hero!\n\nScreenplay is mired with sporadic stunts and songs. The first half has some appeal while the second half goes totally out of control. Where is the story going?\n\nDirection by Dharani disappoints. Coming to characterization, he relied much on the hero while sidelining the roles of others, thus, killing the entertainment factor. \n\nThe treatment of comedy track would give a feel that it is done just for comedy&apos;s sake, devoid of any interest.\n\nThe insertion of the thread where the villain gets ready to take 10-year old girl as wife to his brother comes as a vulgar development and throws a heavy and deliberate material to the audiences.\n\nHowever, you have some respite through dialogs department, which again is run-off-the-mill kind. \n\nMusic by Vidyasagar is impressive in parts on the screen. The title song &quot;Bangaram&quot; is highlight, while two more numbers are good. \n\nStunts are overstretched and have led to the sidetracking the main story. This way, this wing too springs as a wanted projection. The factions drama in fact is not a necessity here.\n\nFILM VERDICT:\n\nThis movie is opened with astonishing collections due to craze of pa-wan Karlan. Same thing happened to his previous flop movies Johnny, Gautama Sankara and Bale. No doubt anagram is another film like that. \n\nthe movie opened with flop and average talk all over the state. This movies competent Pokri and vibratory are much better than this movie. Pokiri will be this summer&apos;s biggest hit.\n\nPawan Karlan&apos;s image which is bringing huge openings to all his movies will surely going to decrease now. Bangaram is the 4th flop movie in the row for pa-wan Karlan.\n\nLooks like he is going in Jr.Ntr&apos;s path.\n\nPublic talk:\n\nPawan Kalyan fans: Average and flop. Watchable for pa-wan fans for Pawan&apos;s acting.\n\nOthers:\n\nFlop: A mediocre movie to watch with full length boring plot. Waste of money, time and mood.",

But a weak storyline pulls the film down.\n\nThe plot just lingers over the characters most of the time and the story does not move forward. There is a hint of a bank robbery coming but all it does is to set the background for the climax. At the end, it is difficult to understand what the story was about.\n\nInspite of all this, Aar Paar is considered an important film in Guru Dutt&apos;s career. Not only because it is technically right most of the time, like any of his films, but more because in Kaalu he creates one of the most realistic tramp-with-a-golden-heart characters seen in Hindi films. That character is seen in hundreds of Hindi films but hardly any is as real as Kaalu.\n\nThe film has some great songs ever. &apos;Kabhi Aar Kabhi Paar&apos;, &apos;Ye Lo Main Haari Piya&apos; and &apos;Baabuji Dheere Chalna&apos; are timeless. Easily a Hindi film classic.",

Also Joey Lawrence gives an excellent performance as the troubled teenager tommy,everyone who still just see&apos;s him as that kid from Blossom should see this film, so they can see that there is more to him than his looks and his funny role as Joey Russo!!!Despite the bad reviews this film has had i give this film 8/10 and if you have the chance to see this film take the opportunity!",

A mysterious systems failure causes the crew of a spaceship to be stranded on the dark side of the moon...\n\nWhile this is by no means one of the great science fiction films of our generation, it is unfortunately not easily obtained (although it is on Netflix). Some concepts here are rather clever, most notably the idea of bringing together the Bermuda Triangle and space travel... and then, even throwing in Satanic references, and still having it all make some kind of sense.\n\nThe gore was also quite good, though I was confused by the robot (Lesli). I understand she is sort of like the ship&apos;s computer and there to answer questions, and I think that makes sense (it sure seems to be common enough in science fiction). But I was confused why she had to be humanoid rather than just built in to the ship. If all she does is sit and talk, why have legs or arms, or even a face?",

The supple effects of a discussion in an apartment to appearing in the bar - and the song.. excellent.. Very worthy of anyones attention.. In the beginning the forward and back time line is trying, but as the movie plays out all this comes clear. I can see how this started as a play, much of the intake is dialog, but then the creativity with the sound mixing/effects and different types of filming varieties start to set this film apart. This is a movie that does what they set out to do, entertaining and fulfilling. The story has plenty and the production has more than plenty.. I have no idea why the rating isn&apos;t 8.5 here. I&apos;m glad I DVR&apos;ed it, and have watched the bar scene over and over.",

I just saw it today on TCM and I have to say something about this under-appreciated gem. The cast is a terrific ensemble of filmdom&apos;s great character actors such as George Bancroft who appears in countless films, among them Stagecoach. He plays Tom&apos;s father with great heart and finally when he realizes who is son really is, they share a heartwarming thumping of the town&apos;s most obnoxious father, son pairing. Virginia Weidler is very good as Tom&apos;s sister. Another of Hollywood&apos;s most talented children, she appeared frequently with Mickey and Judy and also had a high profile role in The Philadelphia story.\n\nFay Bainter has one of her best roles ever as Tom&apos;s mother, easily worthy of an academy nod. While the story may not resemble reality, it communicates some very important human truths about family. This film is every bit as good as The Yearling and should be considered a must for family viewing.",

I got interested from the cast, uniting Jeffrey Hunter, (at about the same time he would have been filming the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot;), with future &quot;Star Trek&quot; guest, France Nuyen, (&quot;Elaan Of Troyas&quot;). The SF is very low-budget, very typical of its time, but still manages some interesting comments on time-travel, and its ramifications. (similar in some ways to a classic bit of SF, also pretty forgotten nowadays, &quot;Cyborg 2087&quot;). The time-travel belt is astoundingly cheap, yet every kid I knew wanted one! (ah, the old days before marketing took over!) Hunter gives this more than it probably deserved, and his performance brings most of the worth to the proceedings, while Nuyen tries to look Chinese, (and Communist!). The production was obviously quite cheap, and I have my doubts this ever played theatres. Saw it for years on Independent TV stations around the country, but it&apos;s pretty rare anymore. Skiffy ran it once or twice (I think), back when they survived on old movies, and never since they got &quot;respectable&quot;, yet it&apos;s really no worse than much of their low-budget offerings. It&apos;s good cheese, and I wish it would poke its head out now and then."

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say I &quot;liked&quot; this film, yet I can say it was better than I expected. Actress/Director Asia Argento is both the best and worst thing about this film. As director, she presented a story that had flow and made sense, and made a couple of very good choices as to when to use surrealistic and stunt casting tricks in service of the story. She also got excellent performances out of the cast generally. Except...\n\nas an actress, she kept taking me out of the scene. If your reaction is the same as mine, just tune her acting out and let the story unfold.\n\nI would also say that JT Leroy, writer of the prose on which this film is based, was involved in the production. Via letter, he introduced the film at various film festivals. The claim that this is a true story, that this is &quot;my life&quot; that Leroy makes, tends to inoculate the film from a lot of criticism. How can anybody say &quot;the ending wasn&apos;t much of an ending&quot; or &quot;the mom was really over-the-top&quot; if the person who lived the story says the movie is &quot;true&quot;. In other words, a movie has to have its own truth, whether the story it tells is true or not. And I guess I think this is &quot;7&quot; because for all it&apos;s flaws (Argento&apos;s acting, skips in time that leave characters undeveloped, and a general lack of roundness to the characters that really could have been fixed), the movie did seem to find it&apos;s own truth.\n\nFor that I credit director Argento, young actors Jimmy Bennett, Dylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse (who knew the Sprouse twins could act? Very well done), sharp (if stereotypical) cameo turns by Peter Fonda, Winona Ryder, &amp; Ornella Muti (whom I took to be Lena Olin). Also props to John Robinson, who played Jeremiah&apos;s teenaged uncle -- an underused character in the film. Except I can&apos;t say that because this movie is a &quot;true story&quot;. See? That&apos;s frustrating.\n\nOh, the content is strong, this is not for kids, and a LOT of adults will need to quit watching at some point. But it is overall worth the effort, if you have a strong stomach and can control your rage at the awfulness of the life depicted.",

More good and bad news:\n\nBAD - Having a weak lead actor is not the way to have box-office success. Stupid dialog doesn&apos;t help either, along with the Rambo action mentality in which the good guy doesn&apos;t get hit from close range.\n\nGOOD - Some of the action scenes were spectacular, the best swordplay I&apos;ve ever seen. The ones at the beginning and the end of the film were the best, with some incredible stunt work. This is beautifully photographed, too. Tim Roth was a good villain, as usual, and the heroes - even if they couldn&apos;t act - were fun to watch. The language is tame in here and the film should be rated PG, not PG- 13.",

      "reviewBody": "Curious to know that during the WW2 Nazi-German cinema not only produced the standard productions (propaganda, entertainment etc.), but still also children&apos;s films, like this adaptation of the fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. Film-technically poor to say the least (at some moments extremely bad), the film has an innocence that gives it its greatest value and charm. How it could have passed censorship, is not clear to me as it richly indulges in ridiculing authorities, including the Kriegsrat (Counsellor of War); in general Nazi-censorship had little sense of humour. The sets are only so-so, but one can see that the makers did their best.\n\nI hardly can ascertain whether this b&amp;w and slow film still strikes a chord with children up to 6 years. The main interest of this film may be for those interested in all aspects of  German cinema.",

It&apos;s purpose is give entertainment to the kids and adults who doesn&apos;t mind mindless jokes just for the sake of entertaining themselves.\n\nBut for those who don&apos;t want their intelligent&apos;s to be insulted, then please avoid this movie at all cost, even only buying a popcorn will be more worth it. The story didn&apos;t made any sense, the pacing of the jokes are totally random to the point you get tired of it. And there are jokes you can&apos;t even relate to, which is not fitting for it&apos;s target audience.\n\nGay jokes will give you mixed feelings if you just want to laugh at it or be annoyed. The actors felt like being force to their roles and character development was nonexistent except for the main character but it felt pointless in the end.\n\nThe drama scenes didn&apos;t help either because out of nowhere a joke will be executed which is unnecessary. All of it are clich√©&apos;s too so it will only give you an impression of &quot;meh, whatever&quot;.\n\nVice Ganda did a good job as an actor in this film mind you. It felt like his acting was natural like you would say this movie was made just to fit his comedian persona. His presence kept the audience entertained till the end.\n\nOverall this is a bad movie. Vice Ganda pretty much carried the show with his name alone and it&apos;s Christmas season. It is bound to be watched by families who just want to watch a funny movie.",

      "reviewBody": "After directing Clint Eastwood in the western caper &quot;Joe Kidd (1972)&quot; (which I really like), the following year director John Sturges&apos; helm the European western &quot;Chino (1973)&quot; that starred Charles Bronson. However these two films share very little in common. Sturges ably directs, but this one relies heavily on Bronson&apos;s presence and the unusual way things go on to play out in this very fragmented story. Nonetheless I didn&apos;t find it to be like your standard western / spaghetti item. It was broodingly slow, and the action saw very little to no daylight. It had a strange emotional and at times spiritual pull (like a stirring dream sequence) between the characters, that kind of made it unpredictable and primarily dreary. The material never sticks to one story, but moves about quite a bit in a typically mellow and subdued fashion. More often it focused on the convincingly growing relationship between Bronson and Van Patten, and their laboured effort on the ranch. Some of these plots don&apos;t add anything to the central idea, but still manages to compel (while not be completely satisfying) by giving the main characters some personality and weight. Bronson&apos;s performance bares someone who&apos;s genuine, and with a manner that still intimidates, but can show that warm side with not a care in the world to get into any sort of conflict. The unhinged ending beautifully paints that angle. Quite a curious turn on his part. Working alongside him was an exceptional show-in by Vincent Van Patten and his fellow squeeze at the time Jill Ireland provided some fire to the chemistry. Sturges simply knows how get striking location choices in the framing, and cinematographer Armando Nanuzzi formulates it accordingly with the on-screen action. Although the thing that hit me was Guido and Maurizio De Angelis&apos; folksy casual music score of soothing attraction and swing. Creaky, but oddly intriguing little-known western.",

      "reviewBody": "The real story of punk rock will, apparently, never be told. I suppose that&apos;s because most of the surviving participants have too much ego invested; or because, as the years fade, and the original social context disappears, the meaning of Punk - at its inception - becomes harder to decipher and easier to forget.\n\nI was in NYC in &apos;76, when it was first breaking for the national press, and I hung around CBGBs under a number of pseudonyms, trying to write reviews and articles on bands that nobody ever heard of, many of them breaking up before I could dot the last &quot;i&quot; in the last paragraph. And I tried out a couple bands of my own, weird blends of Iggy and the Velvet Underground. But I was really an outsider (coming from upstate); and when the London scene started shipping singles over, I knew that, for whatever reason, my heart was really more into &quot;Anarchy&quot; and &quot;White Riot&quot; than the metal-surf-music of the Ramones or early Blondie. But this disjunction of &apos;right time wrong place&apos; or whatever, allowed me to see the development of Punk in a way others seem content to ignore.\n\nThe fundamental problem that Punk never resolved (and current neo-punks are still struggling with it), is, whether Punk was to be a continuance of the &quot;counter culture&quot; of the &apos;60s in different guise, or just another pop-music for sexually frustrated young people. This sounds like an empty theoretical issue, but it has one all-important concrete aspect to it no one can ignore - money. Did (do) punks make music to make music - or to make money? That question was never answered; or, perhaps, every punk answered (answers) it in his/ her own way. Yet once we begin adding up all the individual answers, most of them sure come out sounding like &quot;money&quot;. Yet the memory of Punk survives largely because it seemed to be about anything other than money; so the dilemma continues.\n\nThat dilemma surfaces again in this film, especially in the discovery of the wretched rip-off Pistols manager Malcom McLaren pulled, not only on the audience, but on the Pistols themselves. The brief moments from the (thankfully unfinished) &quot;Who Shot Bambi?&quot; make it very clear that McLaren had not the slightest clue as to who the Pistols were, or what they represented. Yet he not only continued to guide their career after their break-up, but is warmly mentioned in Griel Marcus&apos; scholarly history of Punk, &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot;, which will probably bear influence on punk histories, long after the last &quot;photo-album&quot; paperback turns to dust. Yet it is clear that from the get-go McLaren&apos;s only interest was the profit.\n\nThe Pistols were right, and are right, to ignore questions concerning their &quot;materialism&quot; or &quot;selling out&quot;, since they were never part of the hippies&apos; &apos;anti-materialism&apos; ideal to begin with, and because they never denied a desire for some paycheck (which they almost never got from McLaren). But also plain is their desire to make the music of the UK working-class slums from whence they came.\n\nAll of this comes to a head in the brief yet unforgettable tragedy of Sid Vicious - for whom music meant freedom, and money meant - heroin. But junky &apos;rockstars&apos; don&apos;t play at commercial venues to make music. He ended up in NYC, which by then had a punk scene swarming with record-co.-exec vermin dealing dope and poseur sycophants trying to score. Eventually all that was left was the heroin, and it killed him.\n\nThis film won&apos;t resolve any of these issues; but it may help raise them, and place them in a proper light. I can&apos;t agree that it is a well-made film - the editing, which is very flashy, is also somewhat vapid, and goes out of control too often. But there&apos;s adequate reminder of the era of the Pistols here, and why it was many of us thought, at the time (and still believe) that the Pistols were the most important rock band in history.\n\nThe segment from the final performance at Winterland is worth the price of the film: same-old same-old music concerts are &quot;no fun&quot; and Jones and Rotten (knowing they&apos;ve been betrayed by McLaren into performing for the corporate music world they hated) rub our noses in it until they&apos;ve had enough and stalk off. If you can see this - and know what it&apos;s about - and still pay $200 to see Mick Jagger pull his wrinkled pud at you at the age of 65, you don&apos;t need a movie review, you need a psychiatrist.",

Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki&apos;s army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon."

      "reviewBody": "What to say about this? Well, it&apos;s kind of like Dusan Maneshevev&apos;s &quot;Sweet Movie&quot;, but more exploitative and a little less arty. It also kind of resembles one of those late 60&apos;s Swedish movies like &quot;I Am Curious--Yellow&quot; where a young woman &quot;explores her sexuality&quot; (i.e, casually screws pretty much everybody), but whereas those movies were serious more or less, this movie has a wry, subversive sense of humor. Being German, it also of course resembles the then-popular &quot;Schulmadchen Report&quot; films, but it is far more bizarre than titillating.\n\nDorothea is a 17-year-old girl, who when we first see her, looks very disheveled, is holding a strange, smoking object, and announces to her parents that she&apos;s just been raped by aliens (but they are only concerned about whether &quot;the pill&quot; would be effective against such a sexual encounter). Next she participates with her friends in strange sex film they are making. Her father owns a novelty factory and she befriends one of his female employees, who has an appointment with a seedy photographer to take some &quot;modeling pictures&quot;. She tries to defend her new friend&apos;s virtue against the photographer, but doesn&apos;t do a very good job--she instead gets gang-banged by him and two of his sweaty, overweight friends. Afterward, she pulls out a film camera and &quot;interviews&quot; the three men. They all sit through the interview, but insist on covering their faces with towels (but unfortunately not the rest of their grotesque naked bodies). Next she finds out that a teacher who was in love with her has committed suicide, so she responds by becoming a prostitute. That doesn&apos;t go too well, so she becomes a dominatrix instead where she runs across masochistic, derelict Christ figure. . .\n\nI&apos;m not sure if this was supposed to be a sexploitation movie, but it doesn&apos;t really work as such. The actress playing &quot;Dorothea&quot; has a nice body, but she&apos;s not exactly a raving beauty. And there is A LOT of very unappealing male nudity. I just can&apos;t imagine ANYONE in any time or place draining their dragons to sex scenes involving all these fat, pale, wrinkly-assed German guys. Also, despite the title, I&apos;m not sure at exactly what point &quot;Dorothea&quot; gets revenge. But, oh well, if you just want to see something different. . ."

Milton Berle helped make television with skits like this on his early 1950s show. It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.\n\nHelping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I&apos;m not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe. \n\nThis was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman, like him or not, is a fabulous, able to play so many diverse roles. He&apos;s an amazing actor.\n\nSometimes overlooked is the big-name supporting cast which includes Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Chares Durning and Geena Davis. The latter was making her screen debut in here!\n\nThis isn&apos;t as &quot;cute&quot; as it was 25 years ago but it sure was a justifiable bit hit back in the early &apos;80s.",

      "reviewBody": "Rome and Jewel is a fine musical that I truly hope gets picked up for theatrical release. I was lucky enough to see it when they showed it at the high school where I teach. \n\nAt first I thought &quot;Oh, not another take on Romeo and Juliet...&quot; but I was really drawn into this story, mainly because of the strong acting and the catchy and memorable songs. And let&apos;s face it, anything that gets our kids to accept Shakespeare is a good thing. I show Baz Luhrmann&apos;s excellent movie when I want to ease them into the nuances and rhythms of Elizabethan language.\n\nBut Rome and Jewel is even more accessible viewing.\n\nSet in Los Angeles (present day -- hence contemporary dialects and language) it tells the story of a young white girl who falls instantly in love with a young black guy who crashes her sweet sixteen party. This causes a clash between the white kids and the black kids at the party that spills out into the streets of LA. Meanwhile there&apos;s an intense political back story (just as in Shakespeare&apos;s play) and the lovers do their best to keep their romance secret...\n\nThe actor playing Mercury was fantastic. I hope he gets discovered soon. Okay, I just looked him up and he will be playing a character named &quot;Goatee&quot; in the fourth Die Hard installment. I hope it&apos;s a substantial role.\n\nThis movie is gorgeously shot and well edited. See it whenever you get the chance. \n\nNow I want to look up and watch everything this director has done, because he really knows what he is doing behind the camera.",

I&apos;ve seen most of the original GODZILLA series and am attempting to fill in a few blanks; one of those is GODZILLA VS. GIGAN, a late-entry instalment that pits Godzilla and his old foe Anguirus against new space-monster Gigan and an old enemy, King Ghidorah.\n\nGODZILLA VS. GIGAN is plenty of fun from beginning to end, and the formula for that success lies in having a human interest story that&apos;s just as entertaining as the monster stuff. This time around, a group of environmentalists and employees investigate the mysterious owners of a new Godzilla theme park, soon uncovering some dark secrets which inevitably throw Japan into peril.\n\nGodzilla is on good form in what is one of the grisliest of the series (who knew you&apos;d end up seeing a Japanese blood spray in a children&apos;s film?). Anguirus is my favourite kaiju monster, purely because he isn&apos;t capable of much and it&apos;s kind of sweet to watch him getting beaten on so much, so seeing him here was a delight. Gigan proves a deadly foe - especially with that saw! - and King Ghidorah is, well, King Ghidorah. You can&apos;t go wrong with that combo, and inevitably GODZILLA VS. GIGAN turns out to be a colourful, action-packed romp.",

I heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest way) and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians. Reminded me a lot of some forms of Indian music (East Indian) but at the same time was very very different.\n\nStarting from the the first track by Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (what a voice) to Siyasiyabend to the jam session (or &apos;Jugalbandhi &apos; as we call it in India) in the small Turkish bar ft. Selim Seslar (Big fan now :) ), I enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldn&apos;t end.\n\nOne of the best music commentaries I have seen and heard in a long time. \n\nI am craving for a CD of the sound-track and hope I can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from Baba Zula.\n\nA day later, the music is still etched in my brain and I don&apos;t want it to go away. Turkey and specifically Istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places - and I am going to start saving today to go take it in.\n\nFaith Akin - this is a gem.",

Nearly all of his movies are examples of low budget filmmaking at its best.  Q (standing for Quetzecoatl, the flying Aztec god) is his giant monster movie in the tradition of King Kong and Godzilla.  It&apos;s an excellent movie and succeeds best because of it&apos;s quirky qualities.\n\nAn excellent B-movie cast combined with Cohen&apos;s wonderfully realistic dialogue makes for some excellent characters.  Micheal Moriarty (from  &quot;Law and Order&quot; and Cohen&apos;s The Stuff) plays a loser who finds the nest of the beast, and Richard Roundtree (Shaft) and David Carradine (Death Race 2000 and Kung Fu: The Legend Continues) have excellent roles as two detectives trying to locate it before it devours more construction workers.\n\nThe plot has some great twists and turns and there&apos;s some great obligatory B -movie gore in this one, too.  The monster plucks heads off of window washers and snatches sunbathers off of rooftops.  Blood and body parts rain down on the unsuspecting citizens beneath. Meanwhile, some lunatic is busy skinning people alive.  Is there a connection?  The special effects are limited and not too spectacular, but effects don&apos;t make a movie (as is apparent in the 1998 remake of Godzilla), and everything else about this movie makes it a winner.  The uneven effects actually add to the fun of this movie if you can appreciate low budget horror.  Q constantly amazes me with its quirky attitude, great sense of humor (maybe the window washer&apos;s head &quot;just fell off&quot; says one of the detectives), creative characters, camp value, and energetic cast.  This 1982 cult classic is further proof that Larry Cohen is nothing less than a god.\n\nFinal Review 98/100 (A+)"

      "reviewBody": "A cast of virtual then-unknowns re-enacts the German takeover of Naples following the Italian Army&apos;s surrender to the Allies, and the peasant uprising which ensued. &quot;The Four Days of Naples&quot; was released in 1962 and is shown occasionally on Turner Classic Movies, in Italian with English subtitles.\n\nWhat&apos;s most interesting about this film is that director Loy follows many characters and subplots, and often fails to resolve them because they become lost in the chaos of the house-to-house battle within the city. Frank Wolff (&quot;Desert Assault&quot;) is Salvatore, who loves Maria (Lea Massari) even though she has married a rich man. The two wind up fighting along side one another; Gian Maria Volonte is the Captain who helps organize a partisan resistance; Aldo Giuffre (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) is one member of an Italian artillery unit which becomes embroiled in the siege; and Enzo Turco (&quot;Anzio&quot;) is a Black-shirt who is taken prisoner despite his Fascist convictions. Every member of the ensemble cast is passionate and utterly convincing. Many were virtually unknown at the time of production, and became big stars in Italy within the next few years.\n\nDirector Loy shoots his film with a documentary style. Some shots are well-crafted, though, and give the audience a new perspective on the action. One long pan from a rooftop from which partisans are firing on the Germans shows how the men move from street to street without any cutting at all. The black-and-white cinematography is utterly fantastic. Close-ups of faces deliver all of the drama that dialog simply cannot convey.\n\nThe film brings the viewer inside what occupation and resistance do the civilian population of a city. At one point, the Germans drive the citizens out of one quarter so that they can occupy it, forcing people to move in with strangers on the other side of the city. Later, they attempt to conscript Italian men into their labor force, which is what sparks the uprising. The camera follows us into individual homes and family situations, which are ripped apart by the affects of war. He then takes us to massive crowds as they riot in the streets. The scope of battle is excellently captured, as are the cramped alleys and rooms from which the citizens must fight.\n\nThere a number of standout vignettes: the Neapolitans throwing furniture from their windows atop the heads of Nazi soldiers in a narrow alleyway; one sequence in which a number of teens escape a reform school to join the fight; a prisoner-negotiation scene in which things go unexpectedly and several Italian civilians are caught in a crossfire; the scene in which the Italian men are taken in trucks to be conscripted, only to have their wives overwhelm the German guards. All of these scenes convey a spirit of freedom, aided by Carlo Rustichelli&apos;s rousing score.\n\n&quot;The Four Days of Naples&quot; is a well-crafted drama, intended to be taken seriously, unlike many Italian war films which would follow a few years later. This is an inspiring drama of courage and determination, definitely a must-see for any fan of war films or the Italian cinema.",

She&apos;s happy that her mother Madame de Volanges (Si√¢n Phillips) has arranged a marriage for her to Gercourt (Jeffrey Jones). Volanges trusts her cousin Marquise de Merteuil (Annette Bening) to guide Cecile but she doesn&apos;t know that Gercourt discarded Merteuil as his lover. For revenge, Merteuil intends to spoil Cecile&apos;s virginity and thereby her pending marriage to Gercourt. She asks her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont (Colin Firth), to do the seducing but he refuses. He is more interested in bedding the married Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly). Merteuil makes an indecent bet with Valmont. Meanwhile Cecile falls for her music teacher Danceny (Henry Thomas).\n\nDirector Milo¬ö Forman brings a lascivious feeling to the material. The romance is drained out of this which is replaced with something darker. Fairuza Balk is shockingly young which only adds to its forbidden realism. Whereas the great Dangerous Liaisons feels luscious and beautiful, this version feels dirtier and uglier. Annette Bening is wonderful. This is an interesting second look at the same story.",

While occasionally amusing, the film isn&apos;t really that good, as it was solely made to contribute to the relief efforts of the Yangtze River flood victims, so you can&apos;t deny the noble intentions of everyone involved as, ultimately, it does everything it&apos;s supposed to.\n\nThe most pressing issue for me however was the clear absences of Chow Yun-fat and Jackie Chan, must have been busy that weekend.",

      "reviewBody": "Stendhal (Henri Beyle, 1783-1842) was a very difficult and debatabla author and extremely controversial as such, which he was all too well aware of himself, as he actually never expected his books to be read much, which they weren&apos;t in his day, while he foresaw, that &quot;In 50 years, people will read me,&quot; which they did. He was fascinated by man&apos;s penchant for irrationality and enjoyed studying bizarre fates of people who threw themselves into trouble just for the thrill of it, especially if they knew how bad it was for them. In &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot; there are constant arguments of suicide, and although there is no actual suicide occurring in the novel, both the ladies are quite suicidal, while Julien Sorel himself proves his own pride by subjecting himself to them and wallowing in their suicidal natures. It is true, he really loves Madame de Renal, and she loves him, and they make a very credible couple, especially as Danielle Darrieux and Gerard Philipe are perfect for the roles, and both honour them perhaps more than they deserve. She is the one who ultimately destroys him, and it&apos;s intentional, and he takes the consequences and simply has to do what he can to destroy her in return in a glorious operatic performance of self-destruction. Stendhal&apos;s characters are no ideals, they are actually rather unsympathetic and highly egoistic, (Stendhal invented the term &apos;egotism&apos;,) but at the same time they are admirable for their consistency, as there never are any compromises. He wrote very few novels, they are among the most bizarre in world literature, but they will always remain fascinating. Claude Autant-Lara succeeds well in rendering, realizing and understanding the Stendhal syndrome, and the film is above all extremely stylish and beautiful, which high aesthetic qualities are greatly augmented by the exquisite music by Ren√© Clo√©rec, a composer hardly known at all, but his music here is enough to make him immortal. In brief, it is a very precious and unique production, for its aestheticism and exquisite beauty, doing honours to both the misanthrope Stendhal and the actors and the director, lifting out this extraordinary study in human destinies from the novel in rendering it alive on the screen.",

The idea of teens making &quot;hip&quot; references to other horror films of the past has been done before (in &quot;Scream&quot;). And so on...Yet, &quot;Cut&quot; is overall an entertaining movie, and if you don&apos;t pay more than a dollar to see it, you&apos;ll get your money&apos;s worth. In the first 20 minutes in particular the filmmakers seem to be onto something different, but then the movie gets increasingly derivative. Still, the special effects are good and Molly Ringwald is perfectly cast as the washed-up ex-B-movie queen.      (**1/2)",

If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.\n\nThe jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (&quot;I am Roger the Shrubber&quot;) to more subtle and intelligent jokes (&quot;I thought we were an autonomous collective&quot; / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there&apos;s something for everyone. No one is left out.\n\nWhat many don&apos;t realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don&apos;t understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn&apos;t have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (&quot;Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!&quot;). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience&apos;s vocabulary.\n\nAnd for those who can&apos;t keep up with historical jokes, there&apos;s the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.\n\nSo if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It&apos;s worth the effort, and you&apos;ll learn a little about history too."

(Con Air is another example for me.) The performances are more than adequate for this type of movie, so it is easy to watch. \n\nBasic premise, Peter Derns (Timothy Hutton) gets a temp, Kris Bolin (Lara Flynn Boyle) that is smart, sexy and ambitious. She seems like a Godsend at first because she actually helps him in his dog-eat-dog world of marketing. His boss, Charlene (Faye Dunaway) is great in her supporting role as both mentor &amp; menace. \n\nOne of the problems is that Peter is under mental supervision (aka: shrink) for supposed paranoia &amp; extreme jealousy. When things start to go wrong as Kris works her way up the ladder, everyone thinks he&apos;s just paranoid. Hmm? \n\nWell, you can probably guess what happens next. But even though this movie is predictable, it doesn&apos;t stop me from watching it whenever it&apos;s on. The actors are fun to watch, and very attractive. The sexual tension between Hutton &amp; Boyle is believable. And there are plenty of deaths to keep it moving right along! \n\nJust a fun movie, nothing major or worthy of the Academy of Dramatic Arts- but then not everything has to be. Just enjoy this for what it is- a guilty pleasure.",

      "reviewBody": "In Germany, the elder Frau Traude Krueger (Monica Bleibtreu) gives piano classes in a prison for a few prisoners and the security guard M√ºtze (Sven Pippig). When she sees the rebel and aggressive Jenny Von Loeben (Hannah Herzsprung) playing piano, she immediately identifies her potential and offers to teach her for a competition. Frau Krueger finds that Jenny was a prodigy when she was a child; abused when she was a teenager and has been imprisoned for murdering and decapitating a man. Along the period they work together preparing for the exhibition, Frau Krueger discloses secrets about her love in World War II while the self-destructive Jenny has four minutes of glory and recognition of her talent.\n\n&quot;Vier Minuten&quot; is another powerful and engaging German movie, disclosing the story of two women having nothing in common but their passion for music and tormented souls. The non-linear beginning is quite confused, but provocative and intriguing (I saw this movie on DVD and I watched the first chapters again to get a better understanding); however, after ten minutes, the story becomes intelligible with the development of the characters, supported by magnificent performances and wonderful cinematography. The story is deep and touching, and viewers that enjoy superficial Hollywoodian fairy tales may not like this dense drama developed in low-pace. Monica Bleibtreu and the lovely Hannah Herzsprung have top-notch performances that deserved nomination to the Oscar. The conclusion is thrilling and heartbreaking, and will probably make the eyes of sensitive viewers wet. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Quatro Minutos&quot; (&quot;Four Minutes&quot;)",

Honestly I went to a couple of sleep away camps in my youth and suffered more hardships than these prisoners. Sure the prison has sexual assault, loss of freedom and death but I am definitely sticking to my analogy.\n\nThis is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn&apos;t typical. This is straight forward human drama with very good dialogue and a surprisingly twisted and adult story.\n\nThe film concerns three prisoners who are scheduled to hang. One is angry and proclaims his innocence, one refuses to accept guilt for his crime and the last is so racked with guilt he cannot wait for the noose to be drawn. Into their lives comes a female filmmaker with some baggage of her own.\n\nThe movie is about the four characters interactions and how justice is eventually done despite long odds and corruption. While you may have some Shawshank Redemption flashbacks during the film the movie really has its own story and feel. The acting is good across the board and the production values are excellent. This would be a well made film in any nation.",

The parallels are obvious.\n\nLike &quot;NeverEnding Story&quot;, it&apos;s a fantasy movie that tells the tale of a boy&apos;s coming of age journey, from picked-on weakling to warrior and savior. On the way friendships are woven, difficulties are overcome, and lessons are learned. Both films cater to children audiences, but will satisfy grown-ups as well. Both bring to the table a good mixture of fantasy, action, comedy blended with a dash of romance and drama - Baked just right and garnished with magnificent special effects and stunning visuals.\n\nThe Kung-Fu battles are dazzling, and having both Jet Li and Jackie Chan sparring in this movie is just the sugar on top of the wholesome family fun.",

Vittoria goes to downtown to meet her mother (Lilla Brignone), who is addicted in Stock Market, and she meets the broker Piero (Alain Delon) in a day of crash in the Stock Market. The materialist Piero and the absent Vittoria begins a monosyllabic relationship.\n\n&quot;L&apos;Eclisse&quot; is a love story in the world of Michelangelo Antoniani, where the lack of communication, emptiness and loneliness in the big city prevails over the human feelings. The first ten or fifteen minutes with Vittoria and Riccardo alone in his apartment, practically without any words (actually very few words are spoken), is amazing, showing a couple whose love and relationship is completely exhausted. The scenes in the Stock Market of Rome are also very impressive. Monica Vitti, the favorite actress of Antonioni, shows a stunning beauty and her alienation of feelings is expressed by her face and few words along the story. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Eclipse&quot; (&quot;The Eclipse&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Tom Stoppard&apos;s adaptation, and Preminger&apos;s direction, seem to have produced a stylish and grown-up filmed interpretation of Greene&apos;s sardonic yet moving condemnation of the cruelty of the Cold-War, during which both the Left and the Right have forgotten &apos;The Human Factor.&apos;\n\nBoth the West and the Soviets are portrayed as they execute a risibly elephantine yet humanly appalling dance of death over the crushed lives of ordinary, decent people. \n\nThis remarkably accomplished and understated politico/moral thriller is a far more effective translation of an immeasurably greater book than is the more recent film of John Le Carre&apos;s original novel of &apos;The Tailor of Panama.&apos; The latter film in particular entirely fudges the politics of Noriega&apos;s Panama, and the United States&apos; role therein. Preminger&apos;s film, by contrast, is amazingly honest and balanced, for its period, about the protagonists of the fraught global struggle of its time. In this it is faithful to Greene&apos;s intentions.\n\nNo doubt the earlier film was critically sunk by its evident contempt for the received political &apos;wisdom&apos; of its age. And by its willingness to entertain the possibility that the &apos;democratic&apos; West could quite easily countenance Nazi-style medical research, both for the removal of inconvenient individuals like the wretched Davis, and for sale to strategic allies like apartheid-era South Africa in the form of a poison gas &apos;cordon sanitaire&apos; between them and black Africa. Certainly, even the best American reviews (which always heavily preponderate on this Website), while they &apos;condemn with faint praise,&apos; studiedly avoid any mention of the political and moral core of the film. This is to circumvent, and to radically subvert, the integrity of a serious work.\n\nHowever, anyone who has actually grown up since then should enjoy and appreciate this rather brilliant - if neglected - film version of a Grahame Greene classic: Script, performances, design and filming are uniformly excellent. It is far, far more than a spy-thriller. Greene&apos;s original is faithfully followed into areas that Le Carre merely touches upon.\n\nSpecial praise and thanks, therefore, to BBC4&apos;s original and brave choice to programme it on their new British channel, recently! Naturally, it is not commercially available in Britain. American capitalism, however - to its partial credit! - is capable of allowing this film to exist at least as a product, relying on dialectical hostility to effectively police the public&apos;s exposure to such an evidently heretical viewpoint! Sufficient numbers of people will always helpfully parrot the &apos;official line&apos; that is peddled by our cultural &apos;commissars&apos; in order to prevent such views spreading in the wildfire manner which a truly free exchange of ideas would permit. Their critical contempt for the viewing public is obviously justified, I regret to say."

Douglas and Adams are also terrific as Kedrova&apos;s husband and estranged daughter respectively, but it is Kedrova who elevates this last-journey-before-I-die soaper far above its roots.  The pacing is a tad slow, but the terrific photography, sensitive score, and magnificent performances more than make up for any shortcomings.\n\n Warning, the first time I saw it, the male friend who was with me hated it, and wanted to walk out.  When I recently re-watched it off cable, a male colleague called it &quot;incredibly boring.&quot;  Since I and every other woman I know who saw it loved it, I conclude that most men I know don&apos;t really get the subtleties of what was truly going on.  Because Lila&apos;s relationships with her husband and daughter are reflected against the prism of her life, the director&apos;s artistic brilliance needs to be absorbed rather than spoon-fed. So my advice to other women is to see this one alone or with another woman.  Otherwise, you may find yourself constantly being nagged to put on something with some action  in it.\n\nThat being said, this is a terrific and sensitive movie.  Enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has its obvious drawbacks. For instance, pretty much all the women/girls in the movie are very attractive. Even the ugly girls aren&apos;t really that ugly. Then we have the quasi/anti-feminism message, which will probably annoy people. And there are lots of stereotypes and clich√©s throughout the movie. In fact, the movie is actually _based_ on stereotypes, mainly those concerning the roles and rules of gender and courtship.\n\nBut all that is sorta the point! (Except the &quot;all girls are pretty&quot;-bit, which annoys me.) So, if you&apos;re not too hung up on the flaws, &quot;100 Girls&quot; is actually rather funny! Laughing out loud isn&apos;t hard at all. The main character, Matthew, is sorta cute, in a completely undate-able sorta way. (Nice guys do finish last. Sorry!) The girls are neurotic and predictable. But the story isn&apos;t _too_ predictable either. (After all, _you_ try making an original High School movie! Iz not that easy I tell you.)\n\nBut this banality is probably the point of the movie, and it works as a whole. Even if you don&apos;t really care whether Matthew ever finds his lost mystery-love or not, it&apos;s still entertaining to watch his quest for love, and to hear the sometimes utterly blunt facts of life and genderhood that are spelled along the way. (Yes, most young men do find it stressful to hit on girls. Really? And yes, men and women may have some difficulties communicating with each other, because they have different experiences and different goals.)\n\nSo, in summary: A round of applause for banality and simple stories, as long as they&apos;re delivered with warm humor and jokes about the human anatomy!\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "In between his suspense masterpieces,Alfred Hitchcock sometimes liked to work on less intense projects,and this is one of them.There isn&apos;t much opportunities for palm-sweating tension or balletically-composed thrills as you&apos;d expect from old Hitch,but in TO CATCH A THIEF this seems quite deliberate.The intention from the very start is partaking in a light comedy-thriller,and on this level it is very enjoyable.And accomplished performers such as Cary Grant,Grace Kelly,Jessie Royce Landis and John Williams further help to give it further resonance and quality.The one disappointment in the film is it&apos;s slow pace.There are some parts in the film that drag and produce lethargy,but the beautiful locations,photography and cast save it,including a witty and sometimes surprisingly risqu√© script which caused some concern from censors at the time.Grant and Kelly rank as one of the best romantic couples ever on screen,and rub genuine sparks off each other.Even at 50 years old,Grant is as handsome,if not more handsome,than he ever was previously,and also looks amazingly lithe,agile and fit,as befits a retired cat burglar,and despite being almost double Grace Kelly&apos;s age,is wholly convincing as her suitor.Grace herself never looked more alluring and ravishing,and Jessie Royce Landis and John Williams provide fine support.Williams himself is barely a year older than Grant,yet you wouldn&apos;t suspect that at all when they&apos;re together on screen,and how ludicrous it is compared to Grant when towards the film&apos;s end Kelly puts a relieved head on his shoulder(even Williams himself seems embarrassed!).Such is Grant&apos;s eternal youthfulness that Miss Landis played his mother in the superior NORTH BY NORTHWEST(1959);the fact is she&apos;s a few months younger than Cary! \n\nThere&apos;s a well-known tragic coda to the film;the later titled Princess Grace of Monaco lost her life in a car accident on the very same stretches of road that Hitchcock filmed a chase sequence,but barring this sad fact TO CATCH A THIEF is still very decent Hitchcock,not great Hitchcock.But very decent Hitchcock is still far better than 95% of other directors,so there&apos;s no problem in watching and enjoying this film.",

      "name": "VAMPYROS LESBOS (Jesus Franco, 1970) ***",
      "reviewBody": "After missing it a couple of times on TV (one of them in the guise of the shorter and &apos;clothed&apos; Spanish version) and thinking about picking up the DVD in either region on several occasions, I finally managed to sit down and watch (via the now-OOP R1 DVD from Synapse) what is perhaps Jess Franco&apos;s best-known film. Not having been particularly bowled over by either of the two Soledad Miranda films I had watched until now ¬ñ EUGENIE DE SADE (1970; though this is one I need to watch again) and SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY (1970) ¬ñ I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed VAMPYROS LESBOS. The reasons for this are many and varied and, all in all, I&apos;d say it is without a doubt one of Franco&apos;s most enduring ¬ñ and impressive ¬ñ works.\n\nAs most of you probably know already, the film is based on nothing less than that vampiric chestnut ¬ñ Bram Stoker&apos;s &apos;Dracula&apos; ¬ñ which Franco had already filmed a year before and in which VAMPYROS&apos; leading lady, Soledad Miranda, had also appeared! Not having watched that particular adaptation, I cannot say which &apos;version&apos; is the more successful ¬ñ but, in the case of VAMPYROS LESBOS, Franco certainly imbues it with an overwhelming visual style (which goes hand in hand with a bizarre and intoxicating soundtrack) that almost encourages one to overlook its deficiencies which, being a Franco film, it could hardly fail to be without!\n\nFrom the very first shot, the film weaves a haunting and dream-like mood (which is, for the most part, effortlessly sustained throughout) that is as indescribable as it is hard to shake off. Frankly, this is what Franco is all about to me: counting Luis Bunuel as my favorite film-maker, I cannot but admire the ingenuity (coupled sometimes with naivete) with which Franco pulls off this surreal &apos;trip&apos; of a film ¬ñmemorable images abound in VAMPYROS LESBOS, many of them allegorical, elliptical, or just plain weird ¬ñ that, in its own way, also manages to be a remarkably effective spin on Stoker&apos;s &apos;old&apos; vampire tale. In fact, the film&apos;s updating/jettisoning of the &apos;established&apos; vampire myths (a modern beach-house replacing the old family castle and decked out with fish-nets rather than cobwebs; instead of sunlight having a deadly effect on the vampire, we get to admire her while sunbathing and skinny-dipping ¬ñ though the method of disposing of her remains through incredibly violent means) is surely one of its most endearing aspects. Apart from this, not only is the vampire herself (like the nymphomaniac in SINNER [1972] driven through rape towards lesbianism) as much taken with her victim as one expects it to be the other way around, but also we have what passes for the traditional &apos;vampire hunter&apos; (Dennis Price&apos;s Dr. Seward) actively wanting to go to &apos;the other side&apos; (the confrontation scene between the two, which takes place in the lobby of his clinic, is masterfully handled ¬ñ except for one embarrassingly amateurish moment when Price is made to slink down the stairs when he should be running for his life!), whereas the vampire&apos;s henchman (named Morpho, no less) is not the expected creepy-looking hulk ¬ñ if still a mute ¬ñ but rather a lanky thug in a suit, sporting cool shades and a pistol (not to mention being secretly enamored of his Mistress)! And then there&apos;s Jess Franco himself, in a quite revealing bit, as a crazed sadist (foreshadowing perhaps his Vogel of EXORCISM [1974])¬Ö\n\nOf course, the film would not have worked quite as well without the beguiling presence of Soledad Miranda who dominates every scene she&apos;s in, be it the various tantalizing night-club acts (surely among the finest set-pieces in a Franco film, and several of them feature this type of scene ¬ñ though we are never told quite why she should be doing them, being a Countess and all!) that we see her perform or the utterly graceful and totally natural manner in which she lures our understandably confused heroine (Ewa Stroemberg) into her particular &apos;way of life&apos;, away from her boyfriend and the routine which governs her &apos;normal&apos; existence. As has been promised by the title, we get to see a lot of female nudity ¬ñ a Franco trademark, if ever there was one ¬ñ but since the plot deals with an obsessive relationship (not only Miranda and Stroemberg&apos;s but also Heidrun Kussin&apos;s Renfield-like &apos;infatuation&apos; with the former), it does not feel over-emphasized here and, in any case, is really quite tame considering the director&apos;s standards of even a few years later.\n\nThe film&apos;s basic plot is wafer-thin (&apos;padded&apos; by numerous repeated actions and images) which, coupled with its necessarily languid pace, induces a sense of drowsiness in the viewer; this, however, is not a detriment to the film at all, as this quality is also to be found in the work of even the major art-house film-makers (I felt entranced in much the same way, for example, while watching Robert Bresson&apos;s A MAN ESCAPED [1956] recently ¬ñ a film possibly admired by Franco himself, seeing that it&apos;s referenced at the start of THE DIABOLICAL DOCTOR Z [1965]).\n\nFor those of you who are interested, I would like to point you in the direction of an excellent analytical study of the film ¬ñ which lies at the heart of a lengthy article about five Jess Franco movies from the 1970s ¬ñ written by Maximilian Le Cain that was published in the &apos;Senses of Cinema&apos; online journal. Here&apos;s the relevant link:\n\nhttp://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/27/jess_franco.html\n\nImmediately after watching the DVD, to my horror I discovered that both VAMPYROS LESBOS and SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY are to be re-issued next year (by a different company, Image) and that these will most probably use the reportedly superior transfers that were available for Second Sight&apos;s impossibly expensive (for my tastes, being blind purchases and all) R2 discs. Well, I&apos;m actually thankful I paid less than $12 (shipping included) for VAMPYROS whereas I managed to acquire ECSTASY in a perfectly acceptable VHS dub. Depending on the extras ¬ñ not that Image has shown itself too generous in this department thus far, at least where Franco is concerned ¬ñ I may eventually upgrade these two fun Franco flicks featuring the lovely, talented (and ultimately tragic) legend that was Soledad Miranda!"

      "reviewBody": "Gojira vs. Supesugojira (Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla) is directed by Kensh√¥ Yamashita and written by Kanji Kashiwa, Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Shinichir√¥ Kobayashi. It stars Megumi Odaka, Jun Hashizume, Zenkichi Yoneyama and Akira Emoto. Music is by Takayuki Hattori and cinematography by Masahiro Kishimoto.\n\nGodzilla faces two new foes, Mogera - a UN built giant robotic machine, and Space Godzilla - a beast spawned from Godzilla&apos;s particles in space...\n\nOh how nutty it is, here we have part of what is known as the Heisei period of &quot;Zilla&quot; movies, and it&apos;s utterly bonkers. Is it meant to be a comedy, serious, thrown together quickly to make some money? Who knows? Who cares? Very divisive in Godzilla fan circles (totally understandable), pic throws a number of action series staples at the piece, slots in Godzilla&apos;s kid (a goofy looking Godzuki monstrosity), and pitches the moody big lizard against two foes that creates ultimate fire and destruction mayhem.\n\nGodzilla stomps the city of course, all while trying to keep out the telekinetic skills of the yummy Miki Saegusa (Odaka). There&apos;s some truly great matte shots in the mix, mad science, a nifty score that the likes of Williams and Barry wouldn&apos;t be ashamed of, and a traditional laser show of a finale smackdown. It&apos;s not great, in fact it&apos;s pretty dumb and maybe even lazy, but there is merit here for entertainment purpose. So strap yourself in, leave the brain at the door and enjoy the colourful carnage, it&apos;s trippy man! 6/10",

However, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is enjoyable because it&apos;s so bad that you have to laugh. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time. Plus, the twist actually impressed me. I did not see it coming. A lot of people like to go on about how Ed Wood is the worst director of all time, but how can this be when he&apos;s made movies that so many people have enjoyed? Sure, they&apos;re awful movies, but he&apos;s done his job and entertained us. That&apos;s all I ask for.",

But you certainly haven&apos;t seen any recent Swiss made movie, that hit the ranks with critics as well as the public. This seems kind of strange, because Switzerland has an outstanding documentary film making tradition and certainly a strong economy, which could finance even expensive features. But in the last decade or two nothing remarkable from Switzerland came in sight on our movie theater screens. Str√§hl could be the first feature to signal a new, very different era of films from &quot;Heidiland&quot;. On one hand, Str√§hl presents a rather traditional story of a breakdown in a Cop&apos;s career - moving from fighting drug dealers to falling in love with a narcotic. But on this basis it derives it&apos;s strengths and high suspense from a witty script, brilliant acting, a dense atmosphere and a very Swiss variety of madness on the streets. So if you don&apos;t want to miss the premiere of a - hopefully - new feature production country in Europe, have a look at this (9 out of 10).",

      "name": "Roy Andersson&apos;s feature debut at the age of 27",
      "reviewBody": "Swedish auteur Roy Andersson&apos;s feature debut at the age of 27, who has only made 5 films so far (mainly due to a 25-year hiatus from 1975-2000 of directing feature film, he has made many shorts though during the spell), his latest work A PIGEON SAT ON A BRANCH REFLECTING ON EXISTENCE (2014), is a prestigious Golden Lion winner.\n\nA Swedish LOVE STORY, centres on the puppy love between two teenagers P√§r (Sohlman) and Annika (Kylin), and broaches tenderly their incipient sexual awakening. Set in the sun-drenched urban and sun-dappled rural Sweden, its colour scheme and raw warmth seem to contradict the typecast impression of Scandinavian landscape, a tinge of unusualness can be sensibly discovered through the non-existent narrative and its time-capsule pop references of the time: transistor radio, leather jackets, moped, smoking cigarettes (to emulate a sophisticated mien of adults), and pop songs aplenty. The intimacy and spontaneity between the two young leads suffice to induce a pleasant if to a certain extent, lackadaisical state of awareness. Ann-Sofie Kylin imbues her naturalistic pizazz potently in her laconic register and feline appearance (her captivating blue eyes in particular), and Rolf Sohlman, not a conventionally handsome boy, but his gauche precociousness scintillates great chemistry with Kylin.\n\nHowever, a tongue-in-cheek savour of Andersson&apos;s shrewd perception of the contemporary society lies in the adulthood, P√§r&apos;s father Lasse (Tellfelt) is a working-class garage owner whereas Annika&apos;s father John (Norstr√∂m), is an ambitious refrigerator salesman, and the relationship between him and Annika&apos;s mother Elsa (Weivers) is constantly under the strain. Another prominent character is Annika&apos;s Auntie, Eva (Lindblom), a single woman, who has just been released from the convalescent hospital in the beginning and forever struck by a lugubrious melancholy since she cannot find any footing in real life.\n\nThe subplots of adults resolve half-heartedly around P√§r and Annika&apos;s growing affections, until the last act, the puppy love has been sidelined to a a dinner party with both families in the countryside house of Lasse, where cone-shaped paper hats and crayfish bibs are taking the centre stage, the frictions of different views of the world inconveniently emerge, between the two patriarchs. A cynical and chagrined John bursts into a hysterical but also dead serious rant in the foggy morning and an impending tragedy seems to be in the offing. After reaching the emotional peak of despair and chaos, Andersson knowingly finishes off his confident debut with apparent levity but leaves behind an acrimonious taste of social critique which elevates the film above its central teenage affair, a sturdy and unique piece of work from an up-and-coming young filmmaker.",

Walley is great as his tomboyish drummer who hides her crush from him but ends up falling convincingly for policeman Hutchins.  Fabares is always a good match for Elvis, and here as a scheming heiress she is virtually his film nemesis.  The songs are generally poor, but there are a few highlights.  \n\nAll in all, your basic Elvis movie, not harmful to the brain cells but certainly providing as little stimulation as possible to the nerves.",

      "reviewBody": "I picked this up on a whim after having only seen a brief trailer for it on another movie. I am SO glad I did. As one of the other commentators pointed out, depersonalization disorder is a real problem for some people. Unlike Perry&apos;s character, I smoked weed everyday for a little over two years before it suddenly flipped a 180 on me and threw me into a panic/anxiety disorder coupled with what I was calling dissociation (not feeling right in your own skin, as they say in the movie, is spot-on). I felt &quot;out of pocket&quot; for over two years after my incident and never really went completely back to normal. I eventually managed to get over the chronic anxiety (after six months on Lexapro and about a year spent seeing a psychologist). Anyway, sorry to go on about myself, but it is just such a relief to see this on film! I&apos;m even a writer as well (fiction not screenplays), but this is uncanny. My doctor also told me there was nothing physically wrong with me, just like in the film. I had an MRI and multiple other tests which all yielded nothing, like in the film. I had read some blog entries of people experiencing this, but my doctor had no idea what was wrong with me and my shrink had never really heard of it either. I felt just as alone and helpless as Perry&apos;s character does.\n\nThis movie did an amazing job of showing the effects of this little-known disorder. That whole part about looking at your hand or an object and not feeling like it&apos;s actually there, even though you can physically feel it -- completely true. I wanted to crawl out of my skin at times, and it is just so cathartic to see this film now, years after the fact. Perry is brilliant in this role and didn&apos;t even slip into Chandler-esquire tropes that have somewhat become his trademark (although, unfortunately, he will always be compared to that character). The dialog is actually quite good and the romanticism in this film isn&apos;t overbearing and contrived like so many other rom-comedies. In fact, I normally avoid rom-comedy for that very reason. Numb avoids the pitfalls and cuts right to the uncontrived truths. It doesn&apos;t rely on cuteness or sentimentality and the wittiness shines. Of course it&apos;s not perfection, but I couldn&apos;t have asked for more. Thank you Harris Goldberg. You did well.",

The late great John Ritter is always good value and likeable as is Pam Dawber, the ultimate fanciable former sitcom star. She is differently attractive and I have always fancied her like many others, particularly from the Mork And Mindy days, you know that sitcom with Robin Williams that you used to find funny but when you look back now it kinda sucks!\n\nThis is good family entertainment. It&apos;s inconsistent and some of the references aren&apos;t that funny but on the most part the referencing of old movies and TV shows is where most of the humour lies. Good fun. ***",

I didn&apos;t like Volkodav very much and i was irritated many times while i watched it. The dialog is so simplistic, the story is...i would say the writers made it along the way while shooting the movie - what ever something happens each of the main characters just calls for the help of some god that we never know the story of their relationship with. Naturally the gods always help our heroes. I haven&apos;t read the book and maybe if i had many of the gaps would&apos;ve been filled, but LOTR did fine filling any gaps for the people who haven&apos;t read the books...Ooops - I compared Volkodav with LOTR...:)\n\nthe movie is not badly made, has some nice effects and thats basically it...",

The movie feels cold, empty and sterile, despite its subject matter. While we are given glimpses of the despicableness of the Nazi regime, the movie pulls its punches. \n\nIn place of genuine emotion, we have overwrought sub-plots, and an excess of sub-plots. This makes the movie overly long, without really adding to the drama. Some of the acting is in line with this overwroughtness, being over-acted, almost camp.\n\nNot all the performances are so bad, though. Max von Sydow is excellent as the captain. Minor roles include a host of big names: Orson Welles, James Mason, Denholm Elliott, Katharine Ross, Jose Ferrer, Ben Gazzara.\n\nWorth watching as a reminder of a dark period in human history, and the lengths of human bigotry.",

      "reviewBody": "George Romero does an excellent job of swapping Zombies for Monkeys. This film may sound ridiculous in the most preposterous way. But then again, we now live in a world of Snakes on a Plane and Burning Bright, so this is a little easier to swallow. In its genre, it is one of the best examples, and I&apos;m not just talking about killer animals. I&apos;m also referring to the stalker/obsessive partner/friend genre. \n\nWhat Romero does brilliantly, is to take a number of characters and the audience on a journey of emotions and self discovery. For example, I started off wanting one of these monkeys. The relationship built up is a genuinely loving one. It&apos;s really cute, and this could easily be one of those lifetime inspirational movies. If the monkey wasn&apos;t a genetically modified, telepathic, homicidal, psycho monkey. The well trained monkey takes us from tragic victim of experiments, to a loving carer. We get a wonderful cleaning montage, as the monkey helps the friendship expands. The monkey&apos;s obsession grows steadily. It starts off with a few temper tantrums and escalates into bananas in the slippers. Soon bananas turn to murder. It&apos;s the evolution of all species.\n\nNone of this would work if it wasn&apos;t for a dramatic human connection. Beghe is a law student/athlete that is paralysed. He goes through acceptance, denial, frustration, which is understandable as his girlfriend leaves him for his doctor (a sleazy Tucci), he gets a patronizing nurse, and then his overbearing mother. It&apos;s great to see how the characters react to Beghe&apos;s quadriplegia, as it enforces Beghe&apos;s later anger. Beghe also does a terrific job of facial acting, which is most important as he can&apos;t use his body. In a single look he can convey the embarrassment of his mother having to wash him. \n\nOn the surface, this is a story of a monkey being a bitch to a cripple. But look deep down, REAAAAAAALLY deep, and you&apos;ll see a social commentary. For a long time, the monkey is the only one that treats Beghe as an equal. It doesn&apos;t throw money at his problem, try and cheer him up, nor can the monkey do everything for him. \n\nRomero fills the film with dread, absurdity, and most of all a serious edge that clearly does the film justice. It&apos;s easy to mock this film. But the truth is, this could actually happen. Monkeys are creepy and untrustworthy.",

I was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least, the bravura performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from Jeremy Irons.\n\nThe film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty, law vs justice, and passion vs reason. Some might protest that the content is inherently anti-semitic, however they should consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation.\n\n9/10",

One day, he receives a different condenser and soon his assistant Joe Wilson (Robert Nichols) receives a manual instruction and several components of a sophisticated machine. Carl and Joe build a communication apparatus and a man called Exeter (Jeff Morrow) contacts Carl. He tells that Carl has passed the test assembling the Interocitor and invites him to join his research. The intrigued Carl decides to travel to meet Exeter that sends an unmanned airplane to bring him to an isolated facility in Georgia. He is welcomed by Dr. Ruth Adams (Faith Domergue) but she mysteriously does not recall their love affair in the past. They team-up with Dr. Steve Carlson (Russell Johnson) and they note that the other scientists in the facility have been transformed, having a weird behavior. They decide to flee in a car, but they are attacked by rays and Steve dies. Carl and Ruth also witness the facility blowing-up and they escape in an airplane. However they are pulled up into a flying saucer and realize that Exeter is an alien. Whal is the objective of the aliens? \n\n&quot;This Island Earth&quot; is an entertaining sci-fi from the 50&apos;s, with a story of aliens that need help from the Earthling scientists in their war against another planet. For a film made sixty years ago, the special effects, the monster, sets and scenarios are great. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Guerra Entre Planetas&quot; (&quot;War Between Planets&quot;)\n\nNote: On 17 November 2017 I saw this film again.",

Bad part about this was that I figured that the French dude would have to stupid forced romantic liaison with the female protagonist from the way these set it up from the get go. Adds nothing to this flick, and as for me, it&apos;s a Big Fat Take-away.\n\nI would have given two more stars had they not injected this Nacho Bell Grande with Extra Cheese at the end. It&apos;s like you can never have a female character who doesn&apos;t cheapen herself. I guess the upside of this Nacho bell Grande with Extra Cheese, is that it didn&apos;t come with the usual gratuitous sex scene.\n\nSo chalk this up to a One and Done Movie, unless you&apos;re into Cheese.",

Or she could produce a certificate to say that her daughter&apos;s father is a war hero, so that her daughter could go to the trip for free.\n\nThe film is down to earth and realistic. There are no grand sets, no expensive costumes and no fancy cars. Instead, we get to see a real side of life in Sarajevo. A bus ride, working in factories, picnic on the hilltop or women trying dresses on: all of these seemingly trivial matters reflect how people live. It brings out the soul of the characters, and we get to care for them.\n\nThe daughter, Sara&apos;s youthful rebellion is direct and raw. Her spectrum of emotions, from sadness to joy, on the final bus ride is remarkable. Esma&apos;s work in the night club is also memorable. Her shock and disgust with things that go on around her, and her self pity that she has to earn money like that is striking.\n\nEsma&apos;s final confession in the group is touching and emotional. It crystallises anger, hate, despair, ambivalence and love into one. From the interaction between Esma and Sara throughout the film, who would have thought that Sara was in fact born in such circumstances?\n\nThis film is touching, not only because it exposes the scars of post war Bosnia, but also the everyday tragedies of the lower class."

One day sassy chick Joan Blondell smashes through the fence and drives off with his heart. Not literally, of course, that wouldn&apos;t play so well to a mainstream audience. The film is episodic and slight, but unapologetically so, with some amusing set pieces that include Flynn&apos;s roadside punch up with hopeless pugilist Allen Jenkins. The ever-likable Jenkins (later the voice of Top Cat&apos;s Officer Dibble) is just one of a heap of well-known character actors turning up here, along with Hugh Herbert, May Robson, Harry Davenport and Edward Everett Horton ‚Äì stealing the film hands down as a pathetically subservient, nervy personal secretary. There&apos;s the odd concession to high culture, with a recurring reference to Cervantes&apos; Don Quixote, but mostly this is standard screwball stuff, utilising the considerable charm of its impressive cast."

      "reviewBody": "There are some pleasant and perceptive touches to this parable of the passing of the old west and the inevitability of the arrival of civilized society. This film mirrors at least two other films from 1969, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and THE WILD BUNCH. All three films try to capture the sunset of their anachronistic characters. Pike Bishop and Frank Patch have much in common. There is no room for them anymore in the West they knew. Bishop and Butch and Sundance light out for sunnier climes only to meet explosive endings. Frank Patch sees himself as a force for stability, a safeguard against primal urges that simmer on the surface and are kept in check only because he is the law. He underestimates the political climate of his town and the passion the town burghers are willing to unleash to remove him from office. Rather then move on, he is compelled to stay. I would especially like to recommend the pastoral scene where the local politicos convoy out to the fishing hole where Patch and young Dan are spending the day. It is a beautiful composition."

This film takes place in Bayou Lacombe, Louisiana and New Orleans, and deals with a woman named Police Lt. Lee Hampton, (Carole Mathews) who is willing to enter a prison of women and obtain information about stolen diamonds. Vera and Josie, (Marie Windsor) are women prisoners and Lee Hampton is in the same jail cell and cons these two criminals into escaping from jail in order to obtain these diamonds and catch them in a very swampy area in which they are hidden. Bob Matthews has the misfortune of being held prisoner by these very sexy and hot young gals and he has to try and out smart these very cruel and dangerous women. Enjoy."

Astaire also has several numbers without Hayworth: most notably, a dance in a guardhouse to the song &quot;Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye,&quot; in which he combines several kinds of dazzling footwork¬Ö\n\n&quot;You&apos;ll Never Get Rich&quot; is lightweight but amiable entertainment, and it kept Astaire dancing",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the early 2k on a dvd which I own.\n\nRevisited it recently.\n\nThis second installment is about S√©rafine (Julie Delpy), daughter of David Kessler and Alex Price from the first part, staying in Paris with her stepfather who is on the verge of developing a cure for stopping the transformation of S√©rafine. The cure has the opposite effect as it forces werewolves to immediately transform into their beast form which made S√©rafine kill her mother n injure her stepfather.\n\nI liked the movie when i first saw but aft revisiting it, i didn&apos;t enjoy it.\n\nThe effects are too cartoonish n the werewolves look more like demons with bad cgi.\n\nMost of the creature mayhem scenes are shot in flickering lights n there ain&apos;t any good transformation scene or gory moment.\n\nNonetheless the beautiful Julie Delpy&apos;s nudity will calm all viewers.\n\nThe dvd which i own has the ending of Andy visiting Serafine at a hospital, where she has given birth to a child, whose eyes shift to look like the werewolves.\n\nThe version i saw recently has another ending where the couple are shown getting married on The Statue of Liberty n they both jump for an adrenaline rush cos the cure is adrenaline, which stops the transformation.",

      "reviewBody": "A mind like Spalding Gray&apos;s was full of inquiry, mostly into himself. This was more than alright as by the looks of And Everything is Going Fine he was a master storyteller and orator. He originally wanted to be an actor and trained in that for many years (eventually getting lackluster parts on off-Broadway and, even at one point, a porno role). But his best role in his life was... himself really, as Steven Soderbergh takes to task with a multitude of video clips, interviews and little asides like one he had with his father in the 90&apos;s. He could be incredibly neurotic, and had a family with a history of suicide and mental illness and depression, but he someone made his sad lemons into bittersweet lemonade. His monologues were full of life and humor, little details and observations like in the best prose. In a sense this makes And Everything&apos;s Going Fine a movie where talk and stories takes us to other places and situations (it may not be an accident that one of Gray&apos;s big influences was Andrew Gregory of My Dinner With Andre).\n\nWe get to see the full nature of the man, of at least as much as could be seen in interview clips (albeit Gray is nothing but candid even with a guy from E! News), stemming from a home life that would have been normal if not for his overbearing and crazy mother who left him all too early from life. And along with the acting bug that hit him we also get told his time spent in India, and his sort of search to &quot;find&quot; himself, leading up to the monologues that he started to do in 1979. It was almost like an experiment in self-expression, and if he wasn&apos;t as funny as a Woody Allen New York style guy he had much more candor. Eventually we also hear about his love life, and the ups and downs of his relationship that led to him leaving her for his wife and son after a revelation eight months into the little guy&apos;s life.\n\nSoderbergh is generous to Gray, his legacy and his attitude towards life and himself which wasn&apos;t always pretty. Maybe he understood how far to go with the footage- apparently he didn&apos;t show his much darker mood after his sudden accident that led to his suicide in 2004. But at the same time that this is a &apos;character&apos; study, and that character being Mr. Spalding Gray, it&apos;s also an epic story of a life (he calls himself a method actor in a way, which caused some problems as the monologues went on and on and Q&amp;A&apos;s had to be done with the audience). Some of Gray&apos;s points may be redundant after a while- we get it, you&apos;re a depressive, you have mother issues, woman issues, are a little crazy but have a good sense of humor about it- but I never got tired of hearing what he would say next, and always with eloquence and intelligence. Gray was the kind of guy whose mind was always moving and it looked like he was thinking as he answered questions even as he talked so fast. He was one of a kind, and this is a fine, personal tribute.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching this was enjoyable. The movie started off somewhat slowly, and took its time picking up the pace. However, the pace quickly picked up speed when Danny Kaye came on screen. This is partly because his partner shows up at the same time. Walter Slezak does a fantastic job of contrasting Kaye throughout the movie, but more of that later.\n\nDanny Kaye&apos;s performance here is not quite as seamless as many. He does not seem to have the same audacity he displays in later movies, such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and The Court Jester. It is also different in that, although it includes the usual confusion, plot twists, and multiplicity of plans going on at once, these elements are not executed as beautifully as in, for example, The Court Jester. Thus these scenes become comedic background, still enjoyable to watch, but not the masterpiece one may have become accustomed to. However, the movie was far from terrible. There were moments which, as I watched them, made me think, &quot;That&apos;s so Danny Kaye.&quot; He has many of the same mannerisms and little twitches that make him so much fun to watch, along with an array of songs that would tie a normal tongue in knots. He looks quite dashing in his military uniform, and his character&apos;s innocence is just so much fun to see in Danny Kaye&apos;s brilliant blue eyes. \n\nHis character (Georgi) is also contrasted masterfully with Slezak&apos;s (Yakov), making this movie a success. Yakov is so mean to poor Georgi (as well as everyone else) that the viewer simply must fall in love with the poor boy. Kaye plays a young man, very nearly a boy, while Yakov is so jaded and immoral. It is Yakov&apos;s cruelty to Georgi that endears Kaye&apos;s character to the viewer.\n\nTo sum up, The Inspector General is a lighthearted movie involving superb writing, excellent juxtaposition, and a wonderful star and supporting villain."

      "reviewBody": "...comes another romantic comedy, almost exactly like it! Having picked up on the blatant similarities between Paul Bettany and Hugh Grant as foppish, witty Englishmen in Wimbledon, it came as no surprise to me to learn that Hugh Grant had originally been considered for the lead role of Peter Colt. If you have ever seen a film starring Hugh Grant as the lead, you know now what Wimbledon is essentially like and how it is acted because Paul Bettany&apos;s tennis-playing character Peter is exactly like a Hugh Grant character--confused, witty and extremely English. While Bettany does not quite have the the charming part down to perfection yet, he is much more attractive than the king of romantic comedies. He is also strangely compatible with Kirsten Dunst and that makes it a nice romance story. \n\nWhile centering the plot around tennis (Wimbledon, in fact) is fairly uncommon, this is only a disguise for a genuinely ordinary and well-milked premise. Man is out of touch and out of luck and meets a wild, free girl who will help him awake from his sedated mental state and make him feel alive again. Conflicts inevitably rise, because the man and girl are two players in Wimbledon and so there is more at stake than just a love affair; they are both competing to win. In the end, this film is really quite cute and often at least a little funny but believe me when I say it&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen before. I mostly enjoyed it because of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, to be honest.",

Occasionally, he was given the lead. The film has great action and Warren Oates bears a striking resemblance to the real life bandit, John Dillinger. Ben Johnson is terrific as the F.B.I agent who is on Dillinger&apos;s trail. A minor classic.",

      "reviewBody": "What kind of college curriculum involves lectures on the occult, the professor muttering Satanic incantations in the dark while projecting details from a gory 15th-century painting of the avenging demon Morak, destroyer of destroyers?\n\nAmazingly, Professor Cantrell&apos;s rather irregular course on demonology seems to be popular with his students, apart from Mason Harrue (Larry Justin), who isn&apos;t happy about being pressured to turn in a term paper on the subject. To teach Cantrell a lesson, Mason and his gang break into the professor&apos;s home and slaughter his family, leaving the teacher in a semi-vegetative state, unable to speak.\n\nMason and his thrill-kill pals think they have gotten away with murder, but they shouldn&apos;t have messed with an expert in the occult: even in his debilitated condition, Cantrell is able to summon Morak and send the demon to seek retribution.\n\nBehind this film&apos;s sensational title lies a tedious piece of amateurish trash that doesn&apos;t even have the good grace to feature a meat cleaver. The opening mean-spirited murders promise something wonderfully gritty and grimy, but the remainder of the film is simply boring, the deaths of the gang members unimaginative and frustratingly lacking in gore. The direction by Keith Burns (going by the pseudonym of Evan Lee) is lifeless, and his actors are, without exception, wooden and unconvincing. According to Wikipedia. Burns was replaced by legendary craptastic director Ed D. Wood Jr, which speaks volumes about Burns&apos; film-making skills.\n\nFor movie masochists who decide to give this one a whirl, there are two versions available: the original cut, which goes by the title Hollywood Meatcleaver Massacre, and a shorter, re-released version with the title Meatcleaver Massacre, which features a prologue and epilogue by Christopher Lee, shot for an entirely different movie! Either way, the film sucks.\n\n1.5/10, rounded up to 2 for the hilarious ending in which Morak, depicted as a three-eyed monster with massive fangs in the painting, turns out to be a hairy man covered in green slime.",

      "reviewBody": "Eugene Le Roy&apos;s book has become a classic .It was transferred to the screen as (very good)TV miniseries by Stellio Lorenzi in the late sixties.\n\nJaquou&apos;s story was told in the first person by a very old man (Jaquou) who remembered all his trials.It was told with a great simplicity .One remembers the first chapter (Christmas night) when the child and his mother attend the service in an icy church ,then watch the food intended for the nobles .&quot;There&apos;s nothing good in here&quot; the mom says ,when they come back home.This scene is completely botched in the film.\n\nBoutonnat butchered &quot;Jaquou Le Croquant&quot;.I dare anyone who has read the book to like it.Taking liberties with Eugene Leroy ,the movie turns the oubliettes scene (one page or two) into a horror sequence where Jaquou escapes without any help (Le Roy never wrote such nonsense).The long conversations between the priest and the freethinker knight are reduced to the minimum,which is a shame for Olivier Gourmet ,Tcheky Karyo and veteran Dora Doll (she was already there in the French forties)as Fantille give the best performances of the movie.\n\nIn the last thirty minutes,Boutonnat turns Jaquou into a French Rambo ,with the crowds ridiculously chanting his name (JA-QUOU!JA-QUOU!JA-QUOU !) as if they were on a stadium ,cheering their favorite football player.Whereas Le Roy&apos;s style came straight from the heart (his hatred for the royalty and the Ancien Regime was real but he did not impose a history lesson upon his readers),Boutonnat uses a showy style,using too many slow motion pictures ,squandering the high budget in video game style battles .\n\nLike in America ,this tendency to remake fine miniseries (&quot;Belphegor&quot;,&quot;Jaquou&quot; )as silver screen movies has become a curse in France.",

No car chases, explosions, killings, drugs or sex nor foul language. No wonder it was a flop at the box office. Tis a pity as this is an exceptionally dramady. Good performances from the entire cast, down to the tiniest bits. Rene Zellweger was at the top of her game here. The boys playing her sons were sensational with the character of Robbie having the best one-liners and delivering them with zest. Very authentic look of the film which makes it even better. An extra scene here and there would have helped with what was going on part of the time. A couple of scenes seem to jump as if there was something missing. The only unreal thing is the taxi driving up to the sound stage at the end. That couldn&apos;t happen in real life. It&apos;s a shame this didn&apos;t have a broader release as no one saw it. Hope the DVD release is seen by many.",

      "reviewBody": "1958 was before Ross Hunter embarked Doris Day on the fabulous career she had in the &apos;60s, in which she would become a top box office draw - in fact, THE box office drawer for years. In &quot;The Tunnel of Love,&quot; she plays a sweet, vivacious woman who is desperate to have a baby and can&apos;t, so she and her husband, played by Richard Widmark, plan to adopt one. When the adopted baby bears a strong resemblance to Widmark, he becomes sure that the child is the result of an evening he can&apos;t remember with the investigative social worker (Gia Scala).\n\nBased on a play, this kind of light, subtly sexual comedy became very popular on the dinner theater circuit in the &apos;60s and &apos;70s, joining the ranks of &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;, &quot;The Marriage Go Round,&quot; &quot;Boeing Boeing,&quot; etc. It is not particularly well directed by Gene Kelly and sports the very strange casting of Richard Widmark as Day&apos;s confused husband. I can&apos;t agree with the comments here. Though an actor known for playing tough roles and cruel men, he does a credible job here mainly because he knows enough not to play for laughs. He creates a full character, that of a caring if foolish man who adores his wife but screws up occasionally. Gig Young plays the philandering husband next door. He&apos;s fine, but the character is very unlikable.\n\nThere&apos;s not really much to recommend here. I suppose at the time it was considered somewhat suggestive, but it doesn&apos;t play well today.",

      "reviewBody": "Two years after Christopher Lee claims he swore off horror, Hammer and, most importantly, his signature role of Count Dracula, we find him donning that very famous cape once again for this largely forgotten but surprisingly agreeable Gallic spoof. Thankfully, the print I came across is an extremely good-looking one emanating from Germany that is, unfortunately, accompanied by frankly awful English subtitles (that often do not even bother to translate the intermittent German title cards!) which soon forced me to rely on my knowledge of the French language acquired in high school all those years ago; ironically, I managed to acquire a corrected set of subtitles soon after I finished this first viewing of the film! \n\nHaving said that, the film occasionally lapses into Romanian (during the early Transylvanian sequences), English (when Dracula is picked up at sea by a British vessel and lands in that country) and Arabic (when Dracula Jr. is taken in by a bunch of them upon first disembarking on French soil) and, while it runs for a slightly overstaying 93 minutes in the PAL-sourced print I watched, it was reportedly much re-edited when cut down to 79 minutes for its Americanized English-language version (the end result got saddled with a *¬Ω rating on the Leonard Maltin movie guide)! Ultimately, the film serves to show that, even at 54 years, Lee owns the role of the Prince of Darkness (essaying it here for the last time even if the name Dracula is never actually uttered) and it was an added pleasure hearing him speak his lines in perfectly fluent French! \n\nIndeed, there are a steady flow of funny lines and situations to be found in the film: Lee to his child, &quot;Ferdinand, finish your blood and go to bed!&quot; and &quot;Ferdinand, don&apos;t play bowling with your mother&apos;s ashes&quot;; Dracula&apos;s son as an adult ‚Äì played by Bernard Menez (who had appeared in TENDER Dracula itself 2 years earlier) is so hesitant in plying his trade that, when he is sent by his father to bite an old gypsy woman in the woods, he ends up helping out with the cart she had been laboriously pushing behind her!; Lee is at a loss for words, when about to be thrown into the sea in a closed casket, as to how they will manage to reach the surface; the elder vampire bumps into the glass door of a modern British building when chasing after a prospective victim; French character actor Raymond Bussieres offering Menez a bite to eat in a train station when the latter&apos;s blood-starved stomach starts to make its hunger heard; the son bites into a frozen corpse during a day job in a mortuary and is later sickened by the sheer overdose of blood available for him to sample in an abattoir; their luggage is amusingly coffin-shaped; Dracula Jr. dumps his father&apos;s coffin out of a hotel window in a fit of rage; Lee is taken into police custody (when daylight is imminent) after being suspected of lewd acts in a car!; humiliatingly, he is also being made to advertise toothpaste on TV commercials; Lee pulls up his sheets in embarrassment when surprised by his young new conquest in his coffin, etc.\n\nIt goes without saying that this was not the first comic treatment of Dracula on celluloid nor would it be the last ‚Äì LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT (1979; with George Hamilton at his suavest), FRACCHIA CONTRO Dracula (1985; starring beloved Italian comedian Paolo Villaggio and Edmund Purdom as Dracula) and Mel Brooks&apos; Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT (1995; starring Leslie Nielsen) ‚Äì and, in fact. Lee himself had already sent the vampiric Count up in a much-earlier Italian spoof starring Renato Rascel, TEMPI DURI PER I VAMPIRI aka UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE (1959) but, what I found surprising here is the fact that, much like Roman Polanski&apos;s own somewhat heavy-handed spoof of the genre, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967), this flawlessly replicates (at least in the scenes set in Transylvania) the Gothic atmosphere of a Hammer Horror, down to a full-blooded (pardon the pun) music score by Vladimir Cosma; notably, the makeshift cross ‚Äì formed by peasants from a hammer and sickle a&apos; la Michael Reeves&apos; THE SHE-BEAST (1966) ‚Äì is not only able to hold vampires at bay here but also set them ablaze! \n\nUnfortunately, the predictably upbeat ending is somewhat rushed with Lee meeting his demise in the way of his comeuppance in Hammer&apos;s first Dracula picture and Menez finding himself cured during a train journey merely by abstaining himself from drinking blood for so long¬Öor perhaps through the power of love since, at the very end of the film we find him, father to a brood of children (one of whom bares his fangs in the closing freeze frame!) with the girl (Marie-Helene Breillat who, rather foolishly, does not believe the vampire lore, even if both father and son keep harping on it) who had been the object of contention between the titular characters throughout the film. The actress was married to director Edouard Molinaro (still a couple of years away from making his cross-dressing international hit, LA CAGE AUX FOLLES) at the time and her younger sister, controversial film-maker Catherine, has her last acting job for 16 years here (prophetically, we think she is being bitten but is actually getting it on with Lee in his coffin in an early scene from the film)!",

Thus, I was quite excited about &apos;Love and Other Impossible Pursuits&apos; despite the negative reviews. Sadly this one does not match up even close to any of Roos&apos;s previous works. The major fault lies in the writing, especially the characterization. Portman&apos;s Emilia is a cardboard of a woman going through the loss of her child and is bitter towards everyone around her. Cohen&apos;s Jack is the typical husband who&apos;s holding it together and Kudrow&apos;s Carolyne is the clich√©d bitchy ex-wife. Because of the lack of dimension in character, it&apos;s hard to judge the acting.\n\nHowever, I&apos;d say the actors did the best with what they&apos;re given. The best acting moment is the final sequence between Kudrow and Portman (that takes place in Carolyne&apos;s office). Here Kudrow, in a wonderfully subtle way, displays layers of emotions and Portman&apos;s reaction is good. The other actors don&apos;t get much scope except Charlie Tahan who is quite alright.\n\nThe movie has a polished look to it. The cinematography is good but the score is very intrusive and adds a feel of melodrama almost like a fluffy TV movie.\n\nI haven&apos;t read the book and so I cannot tell what Roos took from the book. But he is a talented writer and filmmaker so hope his next venture come close to the aforementioned examples."

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised to see the Lionsgate logo at the start, because this has everything you would expect from a The Asylum movie.\n\nI don&apos;t think this movie even try to hide the fact its a Casper ripoff from the name, the poster, the plot, there is not much originality in there. So i knew what i was gonna watch. Now Casper is almost 30 years old, so its not necessarily a bad thing to have something similar that is new. The issue is everything was done better in Casper and hold up to today standards and is a much better movie still on all front.\n\nThe CGI in this is kinda servicable for what its going for. Its clearly not meant to be a realistic movie. But my main issue is there is barely any atmosphere or identity to the movie. For instance when they arrive to the &quot;mansion&quot;, we do see a few rooms to show its big, but we barely ever seen anything again of it. Almost every mansion scenes are filmed in broad daylight so you never get that Halloween/Spooky vibe you had in Casper despite being a family movie.\n\nThe budget must had been very low. The third act do offer a few more interesting stuff, and a TINY bit of originality but it ain&apos;t much.\n\nIf you reading this on Letterboxd, i am giving the movie 2.5 Stars because its barely an average movie at best, but i will make an exeption and give it a yellow heart anyway (wich i usually reserve for 3 stars/6 and up) because i can&apos;t say i disliked it, it was late at night and i was bored and it &quot;entertained&quot; me enough. The young lead actress was also likable. But note i am someone easy to please when it comes to movies and i am a big of an &quot;adult kid&quot;.\n\nBut even for young kids, i doubt they will want to return to this movie like i did myself many times with Casper as a kid. Obviously these days you have much more choice and accessibility, wich we didn&apos;t in the 90s, but even taking that into consideration.",

      "reviewBody": "THE LONG DUEL is a British adventure film about an Indian uprising in the 19th century presided over by a bandit leader played by the inimitable Yul Brynner. Watching it these days, it&apos;s clear that this is a very dated production, and perhaps the film was picked out for merciless spoofing in the excellent CARRY ON UP THE KHYBER.\n\nHowever, it isn&apos;t a bad film, just not one of the best of the genre. It suffers from being overlong and too slow, with long scenes that drag out between the important bits. Still, the viewer is treated to the spectacle of Brynner doing his patented action man routine and Trevor Howard acting against him as the classic stiff-upper-lip Brit with a heart. Supporting actors include Harry Andrews as the idiot in charge, more minor roles for Hammer players including Andrew Keir, George Pastell, and the lovely Imogen Hassall, and the appearance of a surprisingly young Charlotte Rampling.\n\nThe action elements of the film are handled pretty well with the usual excitement. A set-piece attack on a train is a highlight here, as is the fiery ambush on the British barracks, but the film only really kicks into top gear at the excellent large-scale climax. Moments of occasional heart and poignancy make this worth a watch, meanwhile.",

Bogus tourist cop Nazzari and his lieutenant Ferzetti, who Trenker has brought down from a mountain injury, are under cover in the Dolomites trying to catch murderous cocaine smugglers.\n\nGabriele sparks well turned out blonde hotel maid Hold, who the local gropes unsuccessfully, while Amadeo visits the chalet of the motorist city woman, actually an agent of the bald, mustached nasty, given to polishing his cigarette case on his sleeve.\n\nThe leads go on a climb together which is the most interesting element of the film though pallid stuff without the ice axes, avalanches and spiked boots of the earlier films. Their half-hearted bonding, after a climbing accident, doesn&apos;t stop Nazarri using his secret short wave radio, hidden in the hay barn to call in the armed troopers while Mareschale Urzo rounds out the city duo. The pursuit on the mountains develops into a battle between the light machine guns of the forces and the mountaineers&apos; shot guns and side arms with fatal consequences.\n\nThere is a bit of sunny alpine scenery with goats foregrounding the peaks, which is closer to HEIDI than DRAMA on the MATTERHORN. We also get a bit of studio mountain for no particular reason. The work is more like Nazzari&apos;s melodramas than anything we&apos;ve seen from it&apos;s director and Amadeo is top billed and gets most screen time.\n\nProduction values are adequate, with a few attempts at atmosphere as when the mountain men set out at night through the searchlit trees where the (smoke bomb) mist is blowing. The leads register well enough but the support is poor.\n\nTh e presence of members of Pietro Germi&apos;s team emphasise the similarity to his work of the day though this one is inferior to that also."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve read other user comments on this film, and I want to add my own. &quot;The Cat and The Canary&quot; is one of those films that is often spoken about as being one of the classic horror films of the silent era, and after watching this film it is easy to see why.\n\nFrom the opening sequence, of a hand brushing away dust and cobwebs to reveal the films title, to the closing shot, the film is very spooky.  Yes, I will say that at times the film is almost too spooky, and that some of the acting is overdone.\n\nThe plot of the film is simple:  20 years after a wealthy and thought to be insane man has died, his family gathers to read the contents of his will.\n\nThose who see this film will see all types of cliches in the horror movie genre, hidden panels, hands reaching out from behind walls, creepy shadows, but the interesting thing to note is that this film was among the first to use these effects, in other words you are seeing these things occur before they became commonplace.\n\nThis was an early horror film made by Universal Pictures, fresh on the success of other classic Universal horror films like Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nThe director of this film, Paul Leni, was German, and the film directly relates that.  This film is a classic example of how German filmmaking influenced American films.  If you like this film, and especially the camera style, stylish sets, and the general modd and feel of the film, take a look at other German silent films, and you will love them as well.\n\nThis film is now Public Domain, and is available on DVD and VHS from several companies.  IMDB lists its length in the 80 minute range, however the version I saw, with a new score is 101 minutes long.  I highly reccomend this film."

There was enough history, drama, romance and intrigue to make it worthwhile, without going overboard and getting bogged down with unnecessary detail and incidents.\n\nWhat was most interesting about Amber (Linda Darnell at her best) was how you can understand her motives without having to agree with them, like her unwillingness to give up on Bruce, who had more than one opportunity to make an &quot;honest woman&quot; of her but didn&apos;t want to take them. At times, she does what she has to do, at others, she chooses her options. Her ambitions and schemes never get her what she truly wants, despite her rise in social position and material wealth.\n\nCornell Wilde gives a good performance as Bruce Carlton, the love of Amber&apos;s life, who prefers his freedom, at least where she&apos;s concerned.\n\nI also liked George Sanders as King Charles II, who falls for Amber&apos;s charms, yet won&apos;t be anyone&apos;s fool.\n\nVery entertaining!",

I was groaning with glee as the store clerk had it out with his lady friend over how many men she had fellatio with. I liked the way the film was broken up into titled parts, each comprising a small story within the tale. Zany, well worth the price of entry.",

Overall, the story plays like a cross between Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&apos;s idyllic story of criminals (√Ångel the poacher and his girlfriend, Miraglos, a runaway from a boarding school) and Psycho&apos;s freaky mother-son relationship, with a handsome ex-boyfriend renegade and a group of doltish Franquist functionaries thrown in to the mix. Charming and weird and visually riveting."

No other movie really captures that aspect of the disco days so perfectly. it was a time where everyone was looking for love, walking into a disco hoping all eyes were on them but being naive in regards to relationships. So banal, ridiculous conversations happened constantly while trying to impress or create desire. Then you went home with either the person you had the most chemistry with or whoever you were left with at the end of the night. Generally the sex sucked and not in a good way(ah that was a touch of Charlotte I think). This movie perfectly hit on all those things and takes me back many years. The only thing it didn&apos;t have was the absolute joy and abandon many people felt while dancing. There was such a freedom and love of life. Ah well, nothing&apos;s perfect, not even disco.",

      "reviewBody": "There are more dramatic and more philosophical pieces of cinema dealing with this very emotive subject, but few deal with the horror, futility and falsehood of the &quot;final solution&quot; with such clear simplicity. We see the lead characters as both humans and monsters we see internal conflict and how they each come to terms with their conflicts, above all we see how futile their conclusions were.\n\nThere will be the predictable comparisons with Schindler&apos;s List but you might also want to compare this movie to &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; which also deals with the conflicts necessary to survive. Watching this movie I kept being drawn back to Primo Levi&apos;s book &quot;If This is Man&quot; the story of his time as a prisoner suffering from this evil.\n\nThe great success of the film is its simplicity, it does not seek to over analyse but simply allows the development of the characters to tell the story.\n\nOne of the contributers spoke of how he was in screen 9 (if I remember correctly) in Cineworld Dublin - I was in Screen 11 and I can had the same experience, the film ended and no one moved, all were in a state of shock, no, sorrow. This is not a film for young children, but older children and adults familiar with the evil addressed in this movie should go and see it. This movie deserves great success. I rate it 9 out of 10 and would have given it a perfect score except for some small technical questions, but none that take away from this fantastic piece of cinema - All associated with this movie should be rightly proud of there work and if any of you read these comments - Thank You!",

      "reviewBody": "In a struggle between good, represented by the wood elves, and evil, represented by the trolls, the conflict is reduced to a level that, whilst far from banal, is perfect for family entertainment. Unlike, for example, the Lord of the Ring trilogy, the evil creatures, while scary and aggressive, are also cute and amusing. The elves, on the other hand, capture the fascinating beauty portrayed in that famous trilogy without the overtones of aggression. Every scene involving the elves conveys a harmony of which this beauty is a principal feature. They wish to live their lives without having to battle for their freedom to do so. In the context of a fairytale, this seems to me to be perfectly legitimate. Olli Saarela, the director, displays a feeling for the beauty of natural colours almost as good as Franco Zefferelli in the countryside scenes of La Traviata, and contrasts them well with the darkness of evil.\n\nThe film is splendidly supported by the leading actor, Allu Tuppurainen, and actress, Maria J√§rvenhelmi, who nicely capture the nuances of emotion as both the thematic struggle and their personal relationship follow their twisting course.\n\nThere are a few musical interludes, well woven into the storyline, but these do not reach the heights of the visual and narrative aspects of the film.\n\nThe whole film exudes a fairytale atmosphere, and evokes an urge to learn how the story unfolds, right up to the very end. It is very good family entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Second series of sketches released under the title &quot;tempi nostri&quot; (our time) ;half French actors,half Italian ones, all the segments are enjoyable ,some even highly estimable .They are linked by a pantomime featuring Marcel Marceau .\n\nSegment one: &quot;a kiss is just a kiss&quot; :Fran√ßois P√©rier ,Dany Robin ;very short ,half silent , it&apos;s more a taste of the things to come :is a man (a woman) really passionate when he(she) kisses ;or does he think that he needs a haircut ;and does she think that her hose has a run in them?\n\nSegment two: &quot; playing hooky&quot; :Yves Montand, Danielle Delorme . A schoolteacher ,full of joie de vivre ,meets a lost girl down in the dumps :she starts to enjoy life again,thanks to small things: a modest meal in a cafe, an evening in a movie theater showing a Chaplin film ,morning croissants .An exquisite slice of life:romantic but not mawkish.\n\nSegment three : &quot;it&apos;s a wonderful life&quot; :Michel Simon, Sylvie . Two monstres sacr√©s of the French cinema ,for our greatest pleasure. Simon portrays a colorful stubborn vicar ; Sylvie is a washerwoman whose life has been drab and poor:washing ,a frugal meal (bread dipped in olive oil) ,washing again with for sole companion a she-goat .She&apos;s got something sineful to tell her priest,but cannot bring herself to confession .Wonderful story,with a Capraesque denouement at that!\n\nSegment four : &quot;ticket to ride&quot; :Vittorio De Sica,Maria Fiore . First sketch of the batch featuring Italian thespians : De Sica is a bus driver who wants to marry his prot√©g√© to a dull Michele (we never see) ; after a wild ride through the streets of Napoli , with American tourists (all female) ,he discovers what he &apos;s known for a long time ; pleasant, eventful , but a bit conventional .\n\nSegment five : &quot;somebody&apos;s baby&quot; :Marcello Mastroianni,Lea Padovani Another mouth to feed ;one child too many ; the young couple decides to abandon their baby in a church ,but not any church :mamma wants to like it and daddy remains passive; both still love their boy, mom even tries to breast- feed him....in this sacred place, to the local vicar&apos;s displeasure .A good parody of the old melodramas, laughing at their clich√©s, it ends as a farce .\n\nSegment six: &quot;grow old along with me,the best is yet to be&quot; :Vittorio De Sica,Maria Denis,Alberto Sordi,Sophia Loren. By far the best of the two segments in which De Sica appears : two has-beens are hired as extras in a film ,they met when they were young but were never be able to take the plunge :they were never lovers. Now they are getting old (60, 53 going on 54) ,and while the camera films the stars who have to repeat their lines till the director is satisfied,they have to go round and round in a barouche ;their conversation is interrupted by the &quot;cut&quot; yelled by the director.The viewer realizes that the principals are actually the extras , and vice versa ;probably the best segment ,because it deals with the seventh art and is a reductio ad aburdum that it will never be stronger than life.A brilliant finale for what is finally an optimistic series of stories.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Vault of Horror&quot; (1973) is one of seven horror anthology pictures released by Hammer rival Amicus over an eight-year period. It had been preceded by &quot;Dr. Terror&apos;s House of Horrors,&quot; &quot;Torture Garden,&quot; &quot;The House That Dripped Blood,&quot; &quot;Asylum&quot; and &quot;Tales From the Crypt,&quot; and would soon be followed by &quot;From Beyond the Grave.&quot; As in its immediate predecessor, the vignettes here were all inspired by tales that had appeared in the fondly remembered EC Comics of the 1950s. &quot;Vault&quot; wastes little time with its obligatory framing story, as five men, strangers to one another, are shanghaied via elevator to a luxuriously appointed subbasement chamber and, over drinks, discourse on their respective nightmares. In &quot;Midnight Mess,&quot; a brother (Daniel Massey) kills his sister (real-life sister Anna Massey) over an inheritance but must later face the neighborhood&apos;s very unusual nighttime denizens. In &quot;The Neat Job,&quot; a compulsive neatnik (Terry-Thomas) subjects his new wife (Glynis Johns, 50 here and still adorable in this, one of her last theatrical films) to more aggravation than Felix Unger ever dished out to Oscar...until poor Glynis can&apos;t take it anymore, that is. In &quot;This Trick&apos;ll Kill You,&quot; a husband-and-wife team of magicians (Curt Jurgens and Dawn Addams) steals a magic rope in India, only to have things go terribly wrong afterwards. In &quot;Bargain In Death,&quot; two men (Michael Craig and Edward Judd) attempt an insurance scam involving a faked death and premature burial, leading to quite a messy situation indeed. And in &quot;Drawn and Quartered&quot; (great title, that!), future Dr. Who portrayer Tom Baker plays an artist living in Haiti who uses voodoo to take vengeance on his enemies. All five of these stories are compact, occasionally humorous but nonetheless quite grisly affairs, more than competently directed by Amicus veteran Roy Ward Baker. The film&apos;s conclusion will surprise only the most naive viewers, but remains wholly satisfying. In all, a pleasing quintet of shudders. Oh...this is the only film of the seven mentioned above that does NOT feature the talents of the great Peter Cushing. But since he did appear in &quot;The Creeping Flesh,&quot; &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula,&quot; &quot;And Now the Screaming Starts&quot; AND &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; that same year, I suppose all can be forgiven! &quot;All the things that make life worth leaving,&quot; the trailer for &quot;Vault&quot; proclaimed in &apos;73. Indeed, indeed....",

The moment I began watching, I was immediately drawn into the world of this film. Unlike the countless movies that fall short in terms of acting and storytelling, this one exceeded all expectations.

      "reviewBody": "The image of beautiful, not necessarily sexy, women parading through the aisles of a grocery story in picturesque, almost Victorian summer dresses and wide white broad brimmed hats is one of the most lasting of this effective thriller based on the work by Ira Levin. Katherine Ross engagingly plays a women being moved with family in tow from the hustle and bustle of New York City to the serene suburbs of old Connetticut. Ross soon discovers that life for the gentle sex is anything but normal. All the women of Stepford seem to be concerned with is housecleaning and pleasing their husbands. This is a good, high energy film that shocks more from looks and what you do not see rather than what you do see. Helping greatly is a solid acting cast working with a pliable script. Though shot with an almost static effect at times, The Stepford Wives packs a few good punches. The scene in the grocery store and the scene with the empty eyes are just two of the highlights for me. Patrick O&apos; Neal, lovely Tina Louise, and the ever loquacious Paula Prentiss costar. At the heart of the film is human identity and the worth it has/should have. There are aspects of social commentary abounding: the relationship of men and women in marriage, the effects of Suburban living, and the dangers of technology.",

A miscast Klaus Kinski is for the most part wasted.\n\nBeing fairly non-offensive and very short, this seems almost like a cheap, 1970&apos;s TV movie.",

When our pilot (Cuneyt) goes diving with his plane, he just leans forward and down in his cockpit. I first thought if it was some kind of comedy film or not, but no it is a serious science fiction with limited financial resources and a rich imagination. It is very much funny not because it was intended to make you laugh, on the contrary they tried to make a science fiction, and tried hard. You just die laughing at this absurdness."

A lot of effort has been put into the paranoia paraphernalia of Paul, and the way Wenders brings this out. I simply adored the way Wenders slotted the characters into a simple plot. I thought the character of Lana was a touch stale, but since she was meant to be the pacifist missionary I&apos;m not sure how else the part could have been played. The social conditions present in the story did tend to be a bit reductionist and instructive, but far from annoying. I will agree with previous comments that it will appeal to European audiences more than American. However, I would disagree that the characters would have been like that before 9/11. It is precisely this tragedy that launches Paul into his hyper-paranoia, the beginnings of which emerged after his experience in the Vietnam war. I did laugh many times at Paul&apos;s lunacy. While very different characters, I enjoyed following the film through the eyes of both Lana and Paul. This film is ultimately a Wim Wenders comment on the US, pre and post-9/11. He deserves congrats for tackling the subject, and admiration for the way he went about telling some sides of the story. I will prefer this film to any Moore production, any day.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in Sydney in 1976 in the beautiful lost Plaza cinerama-screen theatre LL was crazily blown up to 70mm for release here and suffered horrible cropping to make it a rectangle 2.2 ratio pic when it seemed to be shot 1.66-1. Heads were cut off, or in one famous scene with Liza in a chair with Hackman and Reynolds standing behind her (the famous &quot;fish fart&quot; line) all we saw was her eyes on the stage and the men&apos;s chins at the top. I saw it again in proper ratio and it was far better, so whoever&apos;s idea to blow it up literally only added to the maligned &apos;bomb&apos; status of this very expensive ($13m) 1975 film. Yes, the washed out image also looks weird, and makes you yearn for better access into the antics on screen. We had one of the 3 reported endings: the silly happy one where they all surface in the water after being blown up. The Butch Cassidy ending where the guys die and she is left would have been much better. Amazing that this film cost $4m more than STAR WARS filmed the next year. I saw a terrific &apos;making of&apos; featurette at a nearby cinema at the same time which was in focus and offered a witty and attractive lead to the film, so there is plenty for the DVD if we get it. Reynolds other films of the time AT LONG LAST LOVE and NICKELODEON deserve favourable DVD releases too; all 3 are funny and enjoyable and compared to new multiplex releases from the USA, are masterpieces. LL is almost a musical and Reynolds is a hoot. The John Held artwork on the credits will make you rush to buy a book of his delicious 1920s cartoons."

Old partner Christian Slater is willing to stop Travolta at all costs with the help of ranger Samantha Mathis.  Howie Long makes an impressive film debut as Travolta&apos;s evil henchman.  The screenplay is smart enough to work and the direction is fast and furious.  A film that is about as good as it can be.  4 stars out of 5."

It takes its time, supporting cast is unstarry (best: Scatman Crothers as Dailey&apos;s sidekick, and Carole Matthews as an old flame), and the songbook is strictly public domain. But as these 1950s nostalgia wallows go, it has ample charm, and it does make one wonder why Dailey never quite reached the top ranks.",

The evil stepmother &quot;shines&quot; with the help of Mrs Faina Ranevskaya&apos;s talent. And the interpretation of Cinderella by Ms Yanina Zhejmo is just to the point. The innocence and goodness of Cinderella drives me almost to tears and it speaks a lot, be sure.\n\nIf you want your children to grow up sane and good persons, don&apos;t fail to show them films like this one.\n\n10 out of 10 - it simply must not be given less while it is a timeless classic for all ages and for all millenniums.

Most interestingly, it was originally shot as Tarzan Returns in 1935, but this film was completely remade, largely because it &apos;lacked a central plot menace&apos;.  Paradoxically, what was cut from Tarzan Returns was its biggest &apos;plot menace&apos; - a Giant Vampire Bat sequence, set in a swamp, which would have been great!  Tarzan Escapes retains the swamp sequence but with giant lizards only and no bats. I&apos;ve seen stills and production drawings of the prop bats and they were wonderful creations (as ridiculously large as the crocs were in these movies), with flashing red eyes...  What a shame that we&apos;ll never get to see this version!"

      "reviewBody": "After viewing the film and reflecting on what made the film tick, my kudos do not go to the actors, who appear to be the backbone of the film, but to a solid script and screenplay.\n\nFor the first half hour the movie seems to be making inane statements about bringing up children. But those early conversations become meaningful after the movie is over as the choices the father makes have much to do with the parallels in teaching the son early lessons in life--&quot;stealing&quot; planks from your parents&apos; bed to make a toyhouse is to be viewed in comparison to &quot;stealing&quot; stockholder wealth to regain personal property.\n\nAt another level, the story is a mirror of Job&apos;s dilemma--standing steadfast on principles when all his earthly possessions (including his wife) are being taken away. It is to the credit of the script and the director that the tormentors (the kidnapers) remain unseen and the battle is merely relegated to one man&apos;s internal moral turmoil.\n\nWas Glenn Ford&apos;s performance creditable? Yes and no. At the end of the film you tend to think it was a memorable performance. But think of replacing Ford with any good star of the day and the effect could have been much the same, thanks to the script.    \n\nI feel this was a good film because it did not lapse into trivial confrontation with the kidnapers as most contemporary movies do. It was good because the film avoided pitfalls, while adding color to fringe characters by providing them with short punchy lines such as the lines of the school headmistress, the journalists, the ice-cream vendor, the pedestrian who wonders how speeding police cars don&apos;t get tickets, and last but not least the Afro-american butler.",

Almost mocking you for expecting anything decent, and it&apos;d probably roast you if you suggested it made any real effort at all.\n\nEither dive into the dumpster fire and soak in its complete lack of quality, or pick literally any other movie on your list to escape the relentless trainwreck that is Slashers.\n\nAnd if that&apos;s not enough, on top of the awful writing, acting, editing, and directing, it serves up a nice cesspool of juvenile sexism.

It escapes into the wild - Fort Lauderdale, Florida during Spring Break. Having killed multiple people along the way it is discovered and adopted by flighty young airhead Suzanne (Shattuck) who is headed for a yacht excursion with her friends.\n\nThe yacht is owned by lecherous opportunist and Wall Street crook Walter Graham (Cord). His thug associates - drunken imbecile Albert (Gulager) and crude misanthrope Mike (Kennedy) are with him. As the authorities close in Graham elects to alter the course of the boat away from the coast and toward the Cayman Islands where he has stashed his ill-begotten assets. The college kids go along as crew.\n\nWhile the kitty-cat gets into mischief a distracted Walter puts the moves on each of the younger women on board. The cat very efficiently sabotages the boat and preys on its passengers infecting them with his bites while eating them.\n\nThis howler of a low-budget direct-to-video turkey has some of the worst acting performances in history. By the final third of the film it becomes a highlight of appalling reaction shots and forced line delivery. Before that the audience is witness to the rampage of an obvious hand-puppet portraying the title monster.\n\nThe ponderous editing and other post-production miscues are enough in and of themselves to thoroughly embarrass some pretty gifted and respected actors in the cast (Kennedy, Cord, Gulager and Carey). Likely they also served to thoroughly embarrass some not so gifted or respected actors in the cast (Hudson, Estes and Shattuck)."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Drive&quot; is a mesmerizing film that perfectly blends stylish visuals, a haunting soundtrack, and a gripping narrative to create an experience unlike any other. From the moment the opening credits roll, the film immerses you in a world of neon lights and pulsating energy that evokes a sense of nostalgia while keeping you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe story follows an unnamed protagonist, played brilliantly by Ryan Gosling, who works as a stunt driver by day and a getaway driver by night. His life takes a thrilling turn as he gets involved with his beautiful neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, and her troubled husband. The film masterfully combines elements of romance, action, and noir, captivating audiences with its emotional depth and organic character development.\n\nOne of the standout features of &quot;Drive&quot; is its unique pacing. The film takes its time, allowing tension to simmer before erupting into moments of breathtaking action. The minimalist dialogue further enhances the mood, drawing attention to the protagonist&apos;s internal struggles and emotions. The carefully crafted scenes of silence, punctuated by bursts of violence, create a hauntingly beautiful balance that keeps viewers entranced.\n\n&quot;Drive&quot; is a work of art. Refn&apos;s direction shines through in every frame, presenting a stylized aesthetic that is both gritty and glamorous. The use of color is particularly striking, with neon hues that echo the 1980s while feeling contemporary and fresh. The cinematography captures the allure of Los Angeles, transforming the city into a character of its own.\n\nComplementing the visuals is the film&apos;s unforgettable soundtrack, featuring an eclectic mix of synth-pop and atmospheric scores that elevate the viewing experience. Tracks like &quot;Nightcall&quot; by Kavinsky set the tone, making unforgettable moments even more impactful and memorable.\n\n&quot;Drive&quot; is a cinematic gem that transcends traditional genre boundaries. It&apos;s a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, challenging viewers to reflect on the choices we make and the lives we lead. With its exceptional direction, captivating performances, and a perfect blend of style and substance, &quot;Drive&quot; is undoubtedly a must-see experience for any film lover. This film is not just a ride; it&apos;s a journey into the heart of darkness and a celebration of the art of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Popular historical novelist and biographer Irving Stone wrote the story and screenplay for The Magnificent Doll the story of Dolly Madison and the three men in her life, first husband John Todd, second husband and 4th president James Madison, and 3rd Vice President Aaron Burr. The roles are played by Ginger Rogers, Burgess Meredith and David Niven without his familiar mustache. The charm however is there.\n\nI would rate Magnificent Doll a lot lower but for Niven&apos;s portrayal of Burr. It is one of the few villain roles that Niven ever did in his career. But Aaron Burr had a considerable reservoir of charm which enabled him to rise as he did. \n\nIn real life Burr did stay at the boardinghouse of Dolly Payne and did pay some court to the widow Todd. But there was no romance there and Burr was hardly her lost love. He had a well cultivated reputation as a rake and after the death of his wife many years earlier he was proving on all occasions his sword was mightiest of all.\n\nThere was a wife for Burr and a daughter Theodosia whom he doted on and who was his official hostess and political partner. She&apos;s eliminated and Dolly Madison&apos;s son by her marriage to John Todd did not die in the yellow fever epidemic. Her son Payne Todd was spoiled rotten and was the bane of the existence of his stepfather James Madison who exhausted a great deal of his own money with his stepson&apos;s gambling debts and buying off all the women he consorted with. Children of two of the three leading characters just eliminated from the story.\n\nBut that&apos;s only part of the problem with what Irving Stone wrote. According to Stone, Burr was early on fascist, not a believer in democracy especially when it went against him. That was a good movie selling point in 1946, but in real life Burr never thought in concrete methods to put his vast plans into action.\n\nBut Stone could always spin a good yarn in work like The Agony And The Ecstasy and The President&apos;s Lady which were historical novels that became pretty good films. Many years ago he wrote a book with short biographies of the men who ran and lost for president called They Also Ran. His conclusions about some of these defeated candidates are laughed at today by serious historians.\n\nGinger Rogers and Burgess Meredith are good in their parts. But acting honors go to David Niven in Magnificent Doll for what he does with the man described as the American Catiline, Aaron Burr.",

The story is about how four students are invited on a hunt to find a Yetti only to discover they find themselves the meat d&apos;jour on the menu for some evil cult.  The film has some wonderful moments of really inspiring bad acting as well as some of the corniest dialogue around."

The audience seemed to be evenly divided between the gay lesbian community and German/Austrian old timers.\n\nEveryone seemed to have a really good time, despite the poor quality of the copy and the lack of Hebrew subtitles. And, it was quite delightful to overhear two elderly ladies talking about how &quot;Mama&quot; wouldn&apos;t let them see the movie when it first came out, and here the were seeing it today!"

However, none of the editing Moore does undermines the accuracy of his principal points. Any documentary has a point of view and tries to present it as convincingly as possible.\n\nWilson&apos;s film could have used significantly better editing. It is not organized well and jumps around incoherently. It is far too long and could have been made as a decent 1-hour television program. As a 2-hour movie, it is boring."

Action fans eventually got an opportunity to enjoy a pretty smart conception of heartwarming cliches from the , allegedly dead, MOSSAD - genre that was revived by an intelligent script, above average budget and Glen`s crafty direction of gunfights and car chases where bullets really hit the flesh and real cars get smashed up.  No comment belongs out of this statement. There`s just home cinema for all those action buffs who craved for a good flip of an expensive Mercedes ever since McTiernan`s DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.",

After a slow drive to the video store in which you try to avoid the police from extorting you, you enter a video store with enough security cameras to see parts of you that you&apos;ve never seen. You would rent some porno but today you&apos;ll be paying in credit card and you sure don&apos;t want that census taker knowing you&apos;ve seen all 50 volumes of clamlappers. So instead you rent 1984. The zit face behind the counter scan your card and instantly your personal information and spending history is all over the internet. When you get back home you pop in the tape, you would have a joint, but the government has decided that pot isn&apos;t in your best intrest. Neither is beer, cigarettes, fatty foods, caffine, red meat, abortions, pornography,flag burning, sex in general or any of the other things you use to enjoy. You sit down to watch your movie and relax the rest of the night when storm trooper-like police bust down your door and carry you away. Seems renting 1984 set off an alarm in all local police computers and got you on the thought police&apos;s wanted list. You should know better then to oppose your government in any way, shape, or form. You would fight back but all those gun laws eventually equled up to a ban on the second amendment.     Sound like an impossible world? Sounds fictional? Watch it then take a look at the world around you. Your half way there. Enjoy what freedoms you have left before they&apos;re gone. I&apos;m sure one day this movie will be considered illegal."

      "reviewBody": "I suppose we should be thankful for this. Its as purely cinematic as you will get if you think of narrative separate from vision. That&apos;s the philosophy of this, one I almost violently reject.\n\nBut we do have it. And it is enjoyable, clever, engaging. The notion here is one of granularity. I&apos;ve written elsewhere about the size of the components in a film, that there are wonderful effects that can accrue when these are exploited. By that I meant component in several dimensions. There&apos;s the rhythm of the thing is how long the camera lingers and lines are spoken and effects presented. Mastery of this is rare but when you see it, it matters.\n\nBut there&apos;s granularity in the narrative as well. You might present chunks out of order, in which case the physical life of them is less important than the degree of abstraction in the way they are presented. Moving, shifting levels of abstraction only seems to work when the size of the brick, the steps in levels of abstraction, are constant. When these two bricks: abstraction in several senses and physical heartbeat are modulated together, then you have something that can penetrate your being.\n\nNow to this. Its lovely. Its a slightly interesting puzzle that leaves us with a refreshing and welcome moral. Its offbeat and therefore attractive on that score as well. But I really didn&apos;t like it because there&apos;s no understanding of the bricks, the nature of the units that make up a film. This isn&apos;t me saying I like this tradition or convention, oh no. Its a matter of how our minds actually work.\n\nLook at this seriously. Its difference from what we normally expect is part of its reason to be and presumably is there to increase its effectiveness at what it is. Small things like a bee&apos;s dance, or a bud&apos;s breaking are the same abstract &quot;size&quot; as larger things like planting and marrying, and they are the same &quot;size&quot; as global earthquakes and war. Placed in this is a mass murder of husbands, established also as the same size.\n\nIts a nice idea. Wish it worked.\n\nInteresting as all getout is the nature of the Hungarian mind. This is a small country. Many small countries in Europe, especially in the southeast, suffer an inferiority complex. Hungary is a bit different. They are ethnically different from other Europeans, profoundly so. They are a nation with one city surrounded by farms. So invested are they in this city that it is the most urban and in many ways sophisticated in Europe. Hungary ¬ó given it size ¬ó has produced a phenomenal number of brilliant scientists and mathematicians. Absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAnd if you know these men and their work, you&apos;ll know that they are/were the primary warriors in defining the world geometrically. You don&apos;t want a treatise on warring theories in science in a movie comment, but be aware that there are different views of how things are put together in the world, and it boils down to how you abstract the bricks.\n\nWe owe the bright Hungarians for the notion that the world has symmetries that transcend numbers and probabilities. Mirrors exist before the eye does. If you go to Budapest, you will find great minds. But if you go to the outskirts and talk to the non-urbanites, you get a kindergarten version of geometric existence. \n\nThat&apos;s where this comes from. Its interesting. Its novel. Its ineffective and dumb. But pretty. Blocks, all the same.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "reviewBody": "Director Philippe Mora has made some bizarre movies in his time, and &apos;Communion&apos; is one of the strangest. Christopher Walken plays writer Whitley Strieber who finds his life going in a very odd direction. Strieber isn&apos;t the most grounded guy in the first place - his writing technique seems to consist of putting on funny hats and pretending to be a wolf - but even his broadminded wife Anne (Mamet regular Lindsay Crouse) draws the line at freaking out at Halloween masks, pulling a gun on imaginary owls or intruders or whatever it was, and generally nutso behaviour. She convinces Whit to see a doctor, and then a psychiatrist. Under hypnosis Strieber finds out more than he is prepared for. At least he&apos;s not insane... I think.\n\nThis is one of Walken&apos;s greatest &quot;out there&quot; performances, as memorable as &apos;The Deerhunter&apos;, &apos;The King Of New York&apos; and &apos;Wild Side&apos;. He mumbles, grimaces, laughs, dances, twitches, stares, freaks out, charms, irritates and scares. I don&apos;t think his &quot;Whitley Strieber&quot; has anything to do with the real life one, but it&apos;s a sensational performance nonetheless. Walken has few rivals in screen psychos - only Dennis Hopper during his 70s excesses, or vintage Timothy Carey can rival him. Freakin&apos; weird role in a freakin&apos; weird movie! A must see for lovers of movie strangeness."

      "reviewBody": "I quite enjoyed Chaahat. It is obviously one of Mahesh Bhatt&apos;s worst commercial films, not because it is a very bad film but more because this director was responsible for some films which rank amongst the best of Hindi cinema and this one really pales in comparison, which is inevitable. Anyway, the film is pretty watchable, much more when one does not tend to take it too seriously. For the most part, the film flows very well and has its moments, but it gradually goes down as the writing gets more exaggerated. The film stars Shahrukh Khan as Roop, a guy who becomes the love interest of his cruel employer Ajay&apos;s young sister, named Reshma. She gets completely obsessed with him while he plans to marry Pooja, a simple nurse who looks after his ill father. The main problem is with Ajay, who warns Roop that he will go to any extents to make his sister happy. Yeh, quite a fairytale, but it&apos;s not that bad. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant as Roop as he was in most of his films of that time. Pooja Bhatt is charming and cute, Naseer is excellent as always in this ultra-negative role, and Ramya Krishna is absolutely beautiful and damn too hot to ignore. The music is nice and the title track &quot;Chaahat Na Hoti&quot; is very melodious. Chaahat must have had a wider message to it which for some reason I did not manage to understand (or maybe I just did not try to), but it was pretty engaging nonetheless. The last 15 minutes of the film with Khan going all mad and supernatural are ridiculous and plain embarrassing, but let it be, it is a nice Hindi entertainer and should provide a good time-pass for Shahrukh fans.",

You see animated movies nowadays, and with some exceptions, are usually lacking substance, and clean fun. The Chipmunk Adventure is just plain fun. I, personally, found the chipmunk show boring when I was younger, and I don&apos;t remember how I ended up watching this movie. But I am really glad that I did. Not only is it great to keep and watch to remind you of childhood days past, but it is also a great film to keep in your family, and run through generations. I am keeping mine for me, and when my son gets old enough, we can enjoy it together. An adult who has not seen the movie before might find it boring, but if he/she does, then they are too warped by todays conception of what a &apos;good&apos; animated flick is. There are no REAL celebrity voices, no fancy computer animated effects, just good animation, kick-ass songs, and a really solid, enjoyable storyline. The characters are impossible to forget, and the famous &apos;Boys/Girls of Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll&apos; seen has stuck with me for years. I love this movie, and I honestly can&apos;t think of why anyone would walk away from this movie disappointed. I give it a perfect score, because it is perfect for what it is."

She is the last addition to an ex-convict&apos;s team of misfits lined up for a major breaking-and-entering operation. That about sums up the plot. George Clayton Johnson&apos;s short story &quot;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&quot;, first published in 1960, has spawned half a dozen movies to date, ranging from the Rat Pack classic to Steven Soderbergh&apos;s third installment of his remake, &quot;Ocean&apos;s Thirteen&quot;. Writer-director Oliver Mielke&apos;s script takes the original plot idea of a gang of resourceful oddballs pulling off a big-time casino heist and replays it against the gloomy backdrop of an Eastern German scrap metal plant. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not half quirky as it sounds. The movie has its charms though. The cool soundtrack pays tribute to the story&apos;s 1960s origins. Touching performances by Michael Brandner in the part of a suicidal hot dog vendor, and by Manfred M√∂ck as a glum, yet surprisingly sneaky ex-intelligence operative. Solid, if somewhat shallow TV fare. Brandner&apos;s character might have been developed as the lead in a more substantial story along the lines of &quot;Schultze Gets the Blues&quot;.",

It&apos;s one of a few semi-historical movies to self-reflexively be about the creation of the story, which itself is about creation. &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), &quot;Gothic&quot; (1986), &quot;Haunted Summer&quot; (1988), &quot;Frankenstein Unbound&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mary Shelley&quot; (2017) also feature the author of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot; In this one, the creature of Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein comes to life, or rather to apparition, and haunts her through the deaths of those in her life, which is also what happens in the novel to Victor Frankenstein. None of the aforementioned films I&apos;ve seen managed to accomplish such a feat: of integrating the fictional and historical myths, of the doppelg√§nger of creature and creator, and of placing within the milieu of 19th-century Romanticism.\n\nThis is the second unorthodox Spanish production of a Frankenstein film that I&apos;ve seen, as well--the other being &quot;The Spirit of the Beehive&quot; (1973)--and while they approach the story in different ways and by different media (this one, by writing; the other through the 1931 film), they are both two of the most complexly layered and beautiful films to portray the monster. Even though, like others, I viewed the butchered Miramax cut, which reportedly eliminates a fourth of the film, &quot;Rowing with the Wind&quot; is a far more intelligent conception than the opium-induced madhouse of &quot;Gothic,&quot; which offers only the simplest readings of the book and isn&apos;t even especially gothic itself. It was made at Gaddesden Place, which is of Palladian architecture, whereas the relevant scenes of &quot;Rowing with the Wind&quot; look as though they could&apos;ve been filmed at Lord Byron&apos;s Villa Diodati. And even &quot;Gothic&quot; is better than &quot;Frankenstein Unbound,&quot; which treats the Frankenstein story as an historical event and reduces Mary Shelley&apos;s authorship to that of a reporter taking liberties with the facts. &quot;Gothic&quot; reduced Mary&apos;s inspiration to her dead children, and while &quot;Rowing with the Wind&quot; is more encompassing than that, it even handles that part more poetically. The scenes of the monster approaching Mary&apos;s son William (also the name of Victor&apos;s brother) is one of the more haunting here--especially so for those who&apos;ve read the book and seen the similar scene of the little girl in Universal&apos;s 1931 adaptation.\n\nI also like the beginning shots of a boat in an icy sea, which recalls Captain Walton&apos;s search in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the Northwest Passage, but also through a recitation of Lord Byron&apos;s poem &quot;Darkness&quot; situates this film&apos;s beginning in the Year Without a Summer of 1816--when by Lake Geneva, Byron, Mary, her then-lover-and-would-be-husband Percy Shelley and John Polidori decided to compete in writing ghost stories. From that night, Polidori wrote &quot;The Vampyre&quot; and, more famously, Mary began the creation of what would become the novel &quot;Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus.&quot; Percy Shelley&apos;s &quot;Wake the Serpent Not&quot; is also later recited, and the film is full of allusions to the Romantic era in which Mary wrote her masterpiece, including in the classical and romantic musical score and, most impressively, the cinematography, especially of nature. Such lush photography of natural landscapes is especially appropriate given the volcanic winter of 1816 and later Romantic settings--complete with the sailing motif. Even the interior views, including the giraffe in Lord Byron&apos;s Venetian residence, and the costumes--Elizabeth Hurley in a men&apos;s suit, for instance--contain sumptuous visuals.\n\nAlthough Elsa Lanchester and Gavin Gordon will probably always remain by favorite film Mary and Lord Byron for their one scene in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), Lizzy McInnerny and Hugh Grant do well here. Certainly, this is a much more developed Mary than I&apos;ve seen in the other versions, and Grant affects Lord Byron&apos;s limp well and provides a more refined variation on the caddish roles he&apos;d later become well-known for. This is also the best Percy I&apos;ve seen, although, of all the things Miramax could&apos;ve cut out, they seem to have left in (at least I hope so) all of the many foreshadowing references to Mr. Shelley&apos;s inability to swim. The English Polidori, however, seems out of place as played by a Spaniard. And, one of the least interesting things to me regarding this film is its place at the beginning of Grant and Hurley&apos;s real-life romance.\n\nI don&apos;t care much for the slow speech delivery of the creature, either, and the picture does appear somewhat dull and disjointed at times--likely as a result of the Miramax cuts. Someday, I&apos;d like to see the complete version, but even as it is, this is Romantically gorgeous and an intelligently self-reflexive integration of two stories of creation and horror. In one scene, after facing so much death already throughout her life, Mary states, &quot;I do not want to see a creature born that is destined to die.&quot; In the case of her novel&apos;s creature, this wish has been fulfilled. Like the one in &quot;Rowing with the Wind,&quot; Shelley&apos;s monster has taken on a life of its own. Surpassing its 200th anniversary in 2018, it remains very much alive.",

It&apos;s all the more striking that Bug looks like a young man&apos;s movie, filled with energy, experimentation, absurd humor and a genuine sense of artistic freedom. Bug tries a lot of things, doesn&apos;t always succeed but remains an intense exercise of style. Recommanded for everybody who enjoys a good surprise.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a phenomenal movie, but I am rather peeved at the way it has been marketed.  When I rented the movie, the blurb on the box luridly touted the &quot;forbidden passion between a rugged Scotsman and the most powerful woman in the world.&quot;  Other marketing of the film is similar.  That&apos;s not what the movie is about at all!!  It is a very sad commentary on our society if a moving drama about terrible grief being assuaged through loyal friendship cannot be accepted for what it is.  Is the American public really that shallow?  I don&apos;t know whether to blame movie execs for dumbing down the presentation of their product to titillate the lowest common denominator, or the American public for maybe actually being that way.\n\nDiatribes aside, Dench and Connolly are phenomenal.  Victoria and Brown are complex characters with conflicting emotions, and one almost feels able to look upon their souls in this portrayal.  Antony Sher was delightful as the orator/politician Benjamin Disraeli, at the same time both wise and gently pompous.  The makeup job was so good that I actually recognized him as Disraeli before his name was mentioned.\n\nIf you are disappointed because this is not a puerile romance, shame on you. These are real people with real emotions.  This moving story of grief and friendship is definitely one of the best of the year."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; more or less marked the end of Warner Bros. gangster films popular during the 1930s. For the next few years WWII would form the backdrop of their action films.\n\nThis one is full of action and memorable characters due largely to the presence of legendary director Raoul Walsh and its stellar cast.\n\nThree soldiers meet on the WWI battlefield in 1918. One is the all good lawyer Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), one the thoroughly bad George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and the third, an everyman named Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney). Eddie is smitten with a girl, Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane) who has been corresponding with him from home.\n\nWhen the war ends Eddie returns to New York and hooks up with buddy Danny Green (Frank McHugh) who is a Gabie. Eddie goes to meet Jean but is disappointed to learn that she is just a teenager. Unable to find work, Eddie is forced to share the driving of Danny&apos;s cab. In the meantime, prohibition takes effect and Eddie discovers that bootlegging is the way to get rich. At the onset he meets saloon girl Panama Smith (Gladys George) who turns out to be his only friend.\n\nFast forward to 1924 and Eddie re-discovers Jean in a chorus line and decides to take a hand in her career. Eddie is now hopelessly in love with Jean much to the dismay of Panama. Jean however, is in love with Lloyd who has turned up as Eddie&apos;s lawyer. One night while hijacking a load of booze from rival gangster Nick Brown (Paul Kelly), Eddie meets up with George Hally (what are the chances of that?) who works for Brown. Hally decides to double cross Brown and throw in with Eddie. All the while Eddie is buying up taxis until he has immersed a fleet of 2,000 cabs.\n\nEverything is running smoothly until Hally begins to get his own ambitions and sets up Brown to Murder Eddie. The plot fails. Meanwhile Jean leaves Eddie and runs off with Lloyd and Eddie begins to drink. At the same time come the stock market crash of 1929 and Eddie is ruined. Hally however, didn&apos;t play the stocks and buys out Eddie&apos;s cab business for a small figure and leaves Eddie with but one cab for himself.\n\nEddie hits the skids along with the ever faithful Panama until Hally threatens Jean and Lloyd and.............\n\nCagney as usual dominates the picture. He is his usual cocky Irish tough guy but with character flaws. His love for Jean ultimately is what destroys him. Lane contributes a couple of classic songs (in her own voice) as Jean. Bogart as the thoroughly evil Hally gives us a preview of the Bogart tough guy image to come in the 40s. Gladys George almost steals the picture from Cagney as the tragic Panama and McHugh is sympathetic as Danny.\n\nOddly enough, for a gangster picture, there are no major characters in respect of crusading cops or district attorneys. All of the action is between the gangsters.\n\nCagney would not appear in another gangster film for ten years until &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949).",

Of course they had a couple of hurdles to overcome but at no point do you think &quot;Oh no, they&apos;re not going to get the glowing eyed kid home&quot;. Where previously films of this oeuvre have employed wit, humanity and a sense of wonder to fabulous effect the director of this sullen dross did little other than smash you repeatedly in the face shouting &quot;I AM SERIOUS, I AM IMPORTANT&quot; by making the repetitive turgid soundtrack blare progressively louder and louder. It was bombastic pseudo-intellectual rubbish masquerading as serious cinema.\n\nJust because everyone looks miserable and hardly anyone says anything doesn&apos;t automatically make something good. You have to have talent to pull that off and make people care about your morose protagonists despite themselves. Whereas the only comparable thing this nonsense succeeded in doing was making me like a guy from the NSA, basically because he was the only one who seemed capable of speaking in entire sentences and looking slightly interested in what was going on.\n\nI&apos;d rather be forced to sit and watch E.T over and over again Clockwork Orange style for a week than expose myself to this inane garbage again. And I hate E.T."

Although I see 95% positive, the ones that dislike the movie because of the romance between Dallas and John are particularly distasteful.\n\nThey point out an age discrepancy, and call John &quot;Grandpa Wayne&quot;, good grief! John Wayne was 59 yrs old at the making of this movie, and the actress that played Dallas was 27. In real life those kind of romances happen all the time, why would anyone be surprised when they happen in fiction?\n\nThe animal scenes are exquisite. I doubt there will ever be a movie like this made again. This is how animals get into the zoos, they just don&apos;t walk in there and say &quot;sign me up!&quot;\n\nI like everything about this movie; it is a diversification for Wayne, who was already maybe the most diverse actor in Hollywood history. (consider The Conquerer vs. The Quiet man). It has love, comedy, drama, and animals!\n\nPlus all the actors in the movie were given great character depth. I am sure many people have heard of the baby elephant walk, but did not know it came from this movie.\n\nIts such a fun movie, I have to give it a 10, because there is no way to make it any better. What a great achievement of direction, producing, and animal filming!",

I would love to see it again. \n\nAll I can remember is that it involved time travel, eastern Europe (aka the Communist countries), a balcony, a sequence of going back to the same moment and place in time repeatedly and a cup of tea getting spilled on someones hand (perhaps more than once).\n\nIt was very clever, very funny and had a happy ending.\n\nThat night on BBC2 must have been the only time it was ever shown to a wide audience. I&apos;m amazed that it seems never to have been screened again. Is it because it only appealed to 13 year-olds? There are things I&apos;ve grown tired of since that age but, right now, there is nothing that I recall having completely changed my mind over. So I would probably still love it!\n\nFind it! Watch it! Again!"

It delivers on that premise and has either good actors to support some crazy humor (I forgot her name, but one of the &quot;Golden Girls&quot;) or some crazy idea (a device that ... well you see, if you watch the movie)! \n\nMaybe the voice of reason, should prevent me from a 6/10 rating and rather give it a 4 or 5. But I actually liked the movie and the charm it developed. The fun, that the cast and crew obviously had, while shooting the movie, translates onto the screen. Sometimes you really need something really silly, to enjoy ... this one definitely fits the bill! (and kids will love it ;o) )",

      "reviewBody": "Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) is an abnormally bright child. A kid whose schoolwork comes naturally to him and grades were never something to sweat over. But instead of trying to lead an ambitious life, Shaun chooses to spend his days surfing and hanging out with his pals. But when his best friend Lonny is killed in a surfing accident, Shaun contemplates if this direction is the best one to pursue. He later discovers a novel, written by a man named Marcus Skinner, on the beach one day, reads it cover to cover, and loves every minute of it. Upon reading it a dozen more times, and practicing writing similar stories on his own, he realizes that he has a talent for writing and ultimately that&apos;s what he wants to become.\n\nShaun&apos;s homelife is a rather strange one. His parents are divorced, with his mother (Catherine O&apos;Hara) being a sensitive, needy woman and his father (John Lithgow) a selfish and unruly cad. Shaun&apos;s brother is Lance (Jack Black), a portly stoner who is rarely seen fully clothed. Lance continues to offer advice to Shaun, which he will inherently disregard as rambling with no meaning, yet this isn&apos;t one of those stories where the dopey character may actually be smarter than we believe. He&apos;s just dumb.\n\nOur hero&apos;s dream, however, is to get accepted to Stanford and major in journalism. His girlfriend, the neighborhood activist Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) is all support, but his chances seemingly plummet downward when his guidance counselor sends the wrong transcript to Stanford. Instead of the bright and dedicated student they should receive, the school accepts some ne&apos;er-do-well stoner who applied on a whim.\n\nOrange County follows Shaun as he tries in every which way to get accepted to Stanford and pursue a life of intellect and creativity. One thing that becomes the top priority on his list is escaping the inherently listless and seemingly mundane town of Orange County, where nobody takes anything with an ounce of seriousness and everyone seems to be self-indulgent and careless.\n\nThis is a film with a big agenda, a clear heart, but an often misunderstood soul, mainly because its headliner, Jack Black, doesn&apos;t deliver the laughs you would expect. Orange County is not an energetic, high-octane romp, but a sweet and endearing character study that is equal parts sly comedy and equal parts dramatic and deep. A scene comes early on in the film where Shaun is wasting away in a class and his teacher is asking the students if they know anyone who would be interested in speaking to the school about personal experiences. Shaun proposes a writer who has just received a high honor, but is quickly one-upped by another classmate who has connections to Brittney Spears. This scene illustrates so discretely and subtly how motivated and turned on we get as a society by popularity and publicity rather than true talent and admiration.\n\nColin Hanks, an actor still searching for that breakout role, handles the task here beautifully, even with the challenge and notable burden of carrying a lion&apos;s weight of a film on his back. He&apos;s no idiot. His character rarely misses a beat and is a calming and simple pleasure to endure. So is his brother, despite his slow, uninspiring persona. Orange County has an indescribable beauty and charm to its screenplay, one that offers an experience that is fresh and viable, and definitely unconventional.\n\nStarring: Colin Hanks, Jack Black, Schuyler Fisk, Catherine O&apos;Hara, John Lithgow, and Lily Tomlin. Directed by: Jake Kasdan.",

Warli, adivasi, katkari folk music received its firstever recognition and acceptance from this movie.\n\nAll credit goes to the great Pandit Hridaynath Mangeshkar and his team of singers including none other that Latadidi.\n\nTo sum up, its a movie which you would watch once or twice but the music will not fade away for years.",

      "reviewBody": "Five cameramen were assigned by Charles Urban, who owned Natural Color Kinematograph Company, to film India&apos;s huge pageantry honoring the earlier coronation of England&apos;s King George V and Queen Mary in Delhi on December 12, 1911. The final color footage Urban collected, 22 segments in all, premiered at the Scala Theater in London on February 2, 1912.\n\nThe program with all the combined segments shown back to back clocked over two hours. A 48-piece orchestra with a chorus of 24 singers, a 20-musician fife and drum corps and 3 bagpipers accompanied this extravaganza. The promoters constructed a fake Taj Majal on the stage. Additionally, there was a narrative of each segment read by the theater manager. King George personally attended a May 11, 1912 performance at the Scala Theater, with Empress Maria of Russia at his side. She was so bowled over by the presentation she wrote a letter to her son Nicholas II in excited terms.\n\n&quot;With The King And Queen Through India&quot; is considered the first color blockbuster movie in cinematic history.\n\nDespite the popularity of the series and the long combination of the 22 segments, today there are only two reels that have survived showing the Indian spectacular. But the brief glimpses of the Kinemacolor prints show how audiences could have been moved by such a unique experience captured by Urban&apos;s crew half way around the world.",

      "reviewBody": "It is easy to misread the marketing for this movie and expect it to be very different, mainly because of the name, but the movie actually focuses quite a bit on the French troops. The titular Sarraounia is shown every once in a while, but doesn&apos;t really get that much to do.\n\nMaybe that is as it should be. She is a symbol of the resistance. Just watching her make speeches would definitely get boring, while the inner squabbles of the French have a very different tension than what we usually see in a war movie.\n\nThis does feel a little strange in the sense that the hero of the movie is just living her life while the bad guys fall apart on their own. Captain Voulet, as the commander, does his best to keep his troop together, but that is a huge hill to climb and we have no reason to like him. The other memorable officer is the unit doctor, who is there more or less against his will, but is trying his best under impossible conditions.\n\nBecause of the point of view, this movie is not going to be for everyone. Like Hondo&apos;s movies in general, the movie is about the impact and racism of the colonial projects of the French to the peoples of Northern Africa, so it&apos;s not going to be for everyone. For those more interested in these obscure movies, I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s quite on the level that you should definitely seek it out, but since you should seek out West Indies and the easiest way to find that is probably the box set in which you can find this one as well, you definitely shouldn&apos;t dismiss this.",

Homosexuality is not a usual topic there and I hope this film could move things forward and force people at Balcan to think and talk about tolerance with connection to homosexuals and in connection with other nationalities too. I have seen some documentaries from Belegrad about life of gays there. It was very depressing and the message was the same like in this film - go west, don&apos;t stay at Balcan. I hope that things are going to improve in Balcan countries and gay-rights will be closer to European standards or they will be at least improving that way. Tomas",

      "reviewBody": "This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.\n\nThe message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another&apos;s lives.\n\nCapra&apos;s direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.\n\nLed by Capra&apos;s understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart&apos;s wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.\n\nThis film is number eleven on AFI&apos;s list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives&apos;, a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&apos; an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can&apos;t wait to see it again this Christmas.",

      "reviewBody": "and do a very good job at it. If you&apos;ve always wanted to see Greer Garson scantily clad and singing while being tossed about by acrobats and cheered on by sailors on leave, or if Walter Pidgeon being roughed up by a trained vaudevillian seal appeals to you, this is your movie. Garson and Pidgeon, a very popular MGM screen team of the 40&apos;s, this time are a long-estranged married couple. Pidgeon plays a real scoundrel in this one, but fortunately the scoundrel part is something we&apos;re largely told about, not something that we see much of. Pidgeon&apos;s character, William Sylvester Packett, is to the manor born and meets chorus girl Julia (Greer Garson) while in the service during World War I. They are hastily married, and a daughter Susan (Elizabeth Taylor) is born during the following year. War is often the great equalizer - it makes everyone involved forget their peacetime stations in life. Thus, when the war ends, it only takes a few months in familiar settings for William to decide he doesn&apos;t love Julia anymore and send her packing. However, William never divorces Julia, a symptom of his split feelings towards her. He does keep the baby for himself, though. Once you get familiar with the characters you feel that maybe William&apos;s mom had a hand in the break-up since she obviously thinks Julia is not good enough for her son.\n\nThe two are thrown back into each other&apos;s lives when Julia receives an invitation to her daughter&apos;s wedding. The problem is, nobody seems to know who sent that mysterious invitation. Before anyone can get in touch with her to &quot;disinvite&quot; her, free spirit Julia appears at the Packett estate a few days before the wedding. With estranged hubby and his mother so cool to her presence, the servants so happy to see her after all of these years, and her daughter a perfect stranger, how will this whole thing work out? I know this sounds like it has all the potential for Madame X style melodrama, but believe me it is good fun all the way. I highly recommend it. As an aside, don&apos;t be too confused by the fact that the time factor doesn&apos;t make much sense. This movie was made in 1948 but set in 1938 so the whole issue of World War II doesn&apos;t enter into the plot at all.",

While not the only film to suffer from this problem, the pacing has a tendency to become very pedestrian, and finally the film&apos;s length(100 minutes) may try the viewer&apos;s patience, especially with the slow pacing. But even with its problems, it is a charming film, not as good in my opinion as An Affair to Remember but there are a lot of good things about it. Indiscreet is lovely to look at, Ingrid Bergman looks really elegant in her dresses and her apartment is drop dead gorgeous! The cinematography and scenery is also really lovely. I also really liked the score, it was haunting and beautiful and had the hypnotic power than Rachmaninov has in his piano concertos. Stanley Donen directs efficiently, and the dialogue does sparkle. As does the performances and chemistry of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, who are great together and each of them are believable in their roles. In terms of effective scenes, the party scene was great fun, it was a real joy to see Grant making &quot;a fool of himself&quot; dancing. Overall, charming if very slight, elevated by the two lead performances. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The answer is yes, Stallone did well in this movie, he showed that he isn&apos;t just an action star, he is a great actor.\n\n&quot;Cop Land&quot; had a nice story, but I think it had more potential. The movie could have lasted for 20-30 minutes more. It was a nice movie anyway, I will rate it 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "As a (white) woman who was once involved with an African man, I&apos;m always a bit skeptical of these &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;-like movies. I was very pleased to discover there isn&apos;t a huge emphasis on titillation. The director could&apos;ve easily made it more salacious. Interracial couples are more than just their contrasting skin colours or fodder for the sexual fantasies of others.\n\nI wasn&apos;t surprised by this woman&apos;s difficulties in the small, remote, Kenyan village. One could predict she&apos;d face all those obstacles, and more.\n\nI was surprised by how many of the reviews suggest her problems were her &quot;fault&quot; or that there is ANY &quot;reason&quot; for the husband&apos;s actions. No matter what the nationality of my various, past boyfriends and current husband, none of them would ever conduct themselves like that towards me (and live to tell about it) (wink), nor would they desire to do so. My African boyfriend was a model of civility and respect for women. Indeed, every man I&apos;ve been involved with has been the embodiment of the term &quot;integrity&quot;. Men who behave in insulting, unjust, much less violent, ways towards women (or anyone, really) aren&apos;t worthy of my consideration.\n\nIt&apos;s not that I don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; why the dynamics between the two lead characters causes some conflict within the framework of the society in which they live. It&apos;s just that, at some point, some things are just right or wrong. Making false accusations, especially against someone you profess to love, is unconscionable. There is no excuse for his behaviour. Comparing his outrageous behaviour to her naivet√© is ludicrous! This man, like soooooooooooo many around the world (it seems), is so infantile and weak, he feels he must brutalize a woman to make himself feel better. ...Pathetic.\n\nStill, I generally liked Lemalian (Jacky Ido), until he fell from grace. I was surprised by Carola&apos;s decision not to adopt more of the local customs, as well as her ultimate decision, at which point the movie ends. I could still see ways the two could work beyond their cultural differences, especially since both had so generously tried to understand the other&apos;s point of view.\n\nIn all honesty, I found the couple&apos;s attire differences to be jarring, especially in more urban settings. I fully expected one or the other to start dressing more alike. With the very traditional Masai garb juxtaposed against modern women&apos;s clothing, I surprised myself with how much I noticed this contrast, throughout the film.\n\nIn all, I enjoyed this movie most because it is alleged to be a true story. I think it wouldn&apos;t be either as believable or engaging, if it were fictitious. I would recommend it as a video rental for an easy-going Sunday afternoon.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies where the set pace of events are known to the audience, so that when it reaches it&apos;s conclusion we are aware that what we (the audience) might wish can happen for the two leads is not going to be possible. \n\nIt is 1911, and we are in London for the coronation week of King George V and his wife Queen Mary. If you have read THE GUNS OF AUGUST by Barbara Tuchman, this event was the last great occasion for the appearance of all the crowned heads of Europe prior to the destruction (in seven years) of three leading houses (Hohenzollern, Romanov, and Hapsburg) due to World War II. Despite the survival of several other monarchies in Scandanavia, the Benelux countries, and (in revival) in Spain, the three lost ones of 1918 are now joined by the lost ones of the Balkans. And it is the Balkans that is the spot that Laurence Olivier&apos;s Carpathia is located in.\n\nIn reality Carpathia is part of Hungary and Roumania. Part of it (Transylvania) is well known through the story of Dracula. But for the sake of this story, it is an independent kingdom like Roumania, Bulgaria, and Serbia at that time. Prince Charles, the Regent of Carpathia, is running the country until his son King Nicholas comes of age in 18 months. So sometime in 1913 Nicholas will start ruling in his own name, and he is pro-German. Charles is pro-English. This would be unimportant but Carpathia has the fourth best army in Europe, so if it shifts it&apos;s position it may cause an unbalanced international situation that may lead to a general war.\n\nCharles (Laurence Olivier) and Nicholas (Jeremy Spenser) and Nicholas&apos; grandmother the Queen Dowager (Sybil Thorndike) are attending it. Charles is being monitored by Foreign Office official Northbrook (Richard Wattis), who wants to make sure the Regent is happy on his visit. Charles attends a show, and decides that one of the minor actresses, Elsie Mariner (Marilyn Monroe) should be invited to the Carpathian Embassy for a late supper. Despite misgivings Northbrook arranges for Elsie to show up.\n\nBut Elsie (although welcomed by the amorous Charles) finds she has to watch as he spends time talking about a political problem at home - the capture of one of Nicholas&apos; clique of pro-German friends who has been caught with some compromising documents that would hurt the King. Charles plans to squeeze the arrested man for all the information he can get about Nicholas&apos; schemes, but admits to his telephone informant that he is more likely to have problems about the situation from President Taft and his meddlesome Americans than from anyone else. Elsie, who overhears this, is angered (she is an American). The result is a moment that most fans of Monroe don&apos;t recall. They remember that she sang Happy Birthday to President Kennedy once, but here she toasted President William Howard Taft with champagne.\n\nCharles finds Elsie not like other women he has had one night stands with. First, he never gets to first base with her (she gets drunk and falls asleep, despite his varied attempts to get her into the right mood and position). Second, she does not leave as he hopes, but keeps getting stuck deeper and deeper into the embassy and the Royal Family&apos;s world (even attending the coronation at Westminster Abbey). She is there for the embassy ball, and she even has a second night where she is in control of the trysting. Charles married his late wife and did his duty for her and her country, but he finds he loves Elsie. But he is leaving at the start of the third day for Carpathia with his mother and son, and has another 18 months of duty before he is free. And Elsie has 18 months left to her play contract. They do say &quot;au revoir&quot; at the end, but will they get back together. For they can&apos;t until 1913, the start of the Second Balkan War, and one of the steps that brought World War I to fruition.\n\nThe film was based on a play, THE SLEEPING PRINCE by Terence Rattigan, one of the best dramatists of England in the 20th Century (THE WINSLOW BOY, THE BROWNING VERSION). A practitioner of what Shaw called &quot;the well-made play&quot;, Rattigan made sure his plays were entertaining and intelligent, and his characters were realistic. But in the original play Elsie was not American, but English, and was played by Vivien Leigh. Olivier had thought of filming the play with Leigh, but her illness interfered. Monroe was available, and was big box-office. Olivier was to direct her, his first film direction assignment since RICHARD III. She gave so much difficulty to him, he did not direct another film until 1970 when he did Checkov&apos;s THE THREE SISTERS.\n\nBut the film has it&apos;s period charms and a literate script. It does capture the brittle social and diplomatic world of 1911 quite well. Olivier&apos;s Regent is not as great a part as Richard III or Hamlet or Othello, but he does have a grasp on the man&apos;s pride and sense of self-importance. Monroe does come across as intelligent regarding family matters (i.e. the Regent and his son, the King), as well as an understanding woman. Wattis shoulders the dignity of the foreign office ruffled by the crazy duties he has to shoulder that week. Sybil Thorndike, with her fears of anarchists, and belief that Elsie is a close friend of Sarah Bernhart, is in a peculiar portion of the universe. She carries off an eccentric royal type that is light years away from her aged, vicious crone in BRITTANIA MEWS. It was not a major film - certainly not in the same category as the three Olivier Shakespeare films, but it is a good minor one.",

      "name": "And introducing Alan Ladd",
      "reviewBody": "Both Alan Ladd and Tyrone Power made their film debuts in 1932&apos;s Tom Brown of Culver; by 1936, Power was a star. It took Alan Ladd a long 10 years and something like 40 films to make it, but make it he did as a cat-loving contract killer in &quot;This Gun for Hire,&quot; also starring Veronica Lake, Laird Cregar and Robert Preston. Ladd plays Phillip Raven, a contract killer in San Francisco who is hired to &quot;off&quot; a blackmailer and retrieve a formula from him. What he doesn&apos;t know is that his employers paid him in marked bills and then reported him to the police as the killer of the man, hoping to get him out of the way. Their plan is to sell the formula to the Germans. A Senate committee is suspicious of one of the traitors, a night-club owner named Willard Gates (Cregar) and send in a performer, Ellen Graham (Lake) to work undercover for them, unbeknownst to her LA policeman boyfriend (Preston). Graham and Raven are mistakenly connected by Gates, and soon both are on the run from him.\n\n&quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; is thickly plotted but nevertheless somehow holds the viewer&apos;s interest, most likely because of the characterizations. The diminutive, beautiful Lake is an absolute delight as a singer with a magician routine. As one of the villains, Laird Cregar creates an excellent character - a hugely built fraidy-cat who abhors violence. And Ladd&apos;s Phillip Raven, vicious though he is, is a man who learned in childhood not to trust anyone and not to get too close to anyone. He&apos;s a sad character - and this is as close to acting from Ladd as you&apos;ll get. In future films, he says his lines in a monotone, though his tough guy persona is very effective. Here, he plays a ruthless man given to outbursts as well as depression. His paired with Lake, which perhaps was continued because she was a good height for him, is heaven-sent - these are two noir actors who fit the genre perfectly, if for different reasons.\n\n&quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; makes for compelling drama, but it&apos;s sad to watch as well. Cregar died two years after the film&apos;s release, at the age of 28, with what would have been a great career lost; after a failed suicide attempt (his mother was a suicide), Ladd would die of an alcohol and drug overdose at the age of 51; and the rage with her peek-a-boo hairdo, Lake, by the &apos;50s, would be an alcoholic working as a bartender in a hotel before dying at age 54. You could say this is a &quot;curse&quot; film, but one can say that about so many - the lives of the people who made these classics just weren&apos;t fun. A shame, because they left us with such great work.",

That being said, can I at least have interesting characters to fear for and a good deal of suspense when I&apos;m watching a thriller?\n\nThe two leads are like figures from a Sidney Sheldon potboiler: sexy and sassy, but otherwise little more than blow-up dolls. The love scenes are hilariously cheesy and the suspense is basically nil. The latter is a shock considering this was directed by Alan J. Pakula, who made some of the greatest thrillers of the 1970s: KLUTE, THE PARALLAX VIEW, and ALL THE PRESIDENT&apos;S MEN. Those were phenomenal movies. Most importantly, you could follow them. ROLLOVER is way harder to follow if you aren&apos;t sure what the characters are talking about and to be honest, even after reading a synopsis to digest what was going on, I found I didn&apos;t really care.",

This movie is well shot and acted, but the plot is too predictable. Of course, the old guy is grumpy (and not really a great humanitarian who welcomes the idealistic lad), and the young couple grapples with a bit of anti-German sentiment. That&apos;s what I expected from the opening credits, and that&apos;s what this movie delivers. The fact that the male and female leads are a bit too toothsome detracts from the plausibility of the romance and adds to the predictability of the plot.",

It&apos;s not as bad as I thought, as the matter in fact, it&apos;s not bad at all. It&apos;s unexpectedly good.\n\nThe cross-cut scene, the premise of thriller and good cinematography are already there when you watched it for 15 minutes. The more you watch it, you just follow what will happen and it may surprise you as it&apos;s not like what you expect.\n\nWhat makes me amazed more is that, after I knew this is the first movie of the director, the script writer and the story writer. For their first experience, yes ... it&apos;s amazingly great movies. I hope to see more of their movies in the future. I must congratulate them for this.",

The relationship develops unexpectedly well, the characters seem real. The young man who&apos;s the love interest delivers some surprising twists and it&apos;s all very believable. We actually root for them and their beautiful love story¬Ö But just when the film could&apos;ve built up to some real high class drama (the older woman confronting her fears and other people&apos;s prejudices) it whirls downwards into some really deranged nonsense, &quot;pseudo&quot; tragedy and plain silliness. The so well constructed characters and the very good performances get drawn into a not well chewed mess which is irritating to watch. It&apos;s a shame really, what had started well and could&apos;ve turned into a really neat romantic flick, even a little jewel (with a good look on how these two people connect above all their differences and against all social conventions), gets wasted. It&apos;s almost as if we were watching two different films. Maybe the script was meant for a short film and didn&apos;t add up to the full hour and a half and had to be filled in? Anyway it could&apos;ve been better written to have a coherent development and ending. What a shame."

This -- I am guessing here -- is because the truly great so lead our imagination that we need to heal or grow after the experience and only then assess what has happened. Surely when you are in this film, you know something special is going on: there are some true transcendences of the eye; very dimensional, surprising. Just as you have established the field of vision and registered the one thing you expect to see, the camera moves in an unexpected manner to reveal either a completely extra or contradictory reality.\n\nThose moments thrill, but confuse at the same time because in lesser hands, this would be an excuse for noodling about with the &apos;story&apos; in a superficially artsy-fartsy manner. Only after some time can you evaluate how effectively this might have slipped between the sheets of your minds. It is a matter of some interest to me how this happens when it does. Is it a matter of the artist knowing us better than we do ourselves and slipping into our dreams unawares? Or is a matter of creating an attractive castle that we are drawn to and inhabit?\n\nGenerally, when an artist is called &apos;personal,&apos; it is thought to be the latter. But in this case, I think most of what he has done is find that universal manner of overlapping and merging that underlies the visual memory of us all. What confuses is the Soviet environment: the intensely uncoordinated industrial environment and the once fine but now dilapidated urban residences. They transport us to a different place: the unfamiliar described in a familiar way.\n\nSurely this is not what he intended: he didn&apos;t make this for a comfortable American/European. And if not made just for himself it was for people who shared the same world. So at least as far as the content, we are attracted to an unfamiliar castle. But so far as the &apos;personal&apos; form, I think he has found something strangely cosmic. This may be the best film (with Rublev) of one of the three most important filmmakers in history.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this."

Set in 1848 , New York bank wants to put a railroad across Mexico, so it buys up small banks around Santa Rita, Durango, and evicts country people on the proposed rail line carried out a nasty enforcer against those who owe money . Then two very different sexpot women , the European-educated , daughter of a banker , named Sara (Salma Hayek showing cleavage) and the farmer Maria (Penelop√© Cruz) become a bank-robbing duo in an effort to combat a ruthless killer executioner caller Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam) who runs afoul after them , while terrorizing poor villagers and then the two rebel girls are wanted...alive or dead . As Sara and Maria robbing banks and then riding off with the loot, being accompanied by a bumbling fool (Steve Zahn) and become the new Robin Hoods in the West .No man can come between them! Wanted...alive or dead .Being Bad never looked so Good! .Definitely wanted.\n\nAn European Western Featuring Two Beautiful Actresses as bank robbers , they&apos;re both international sex symbols and buxom beauties .The picture displays crazy characters with silly plot and some amusing moments here and there . It is a muddle but acceptable French/Mexican co-production Western with an appropriately goofy tone , it has has action, fun , brawls , light-weight comedy , crossfire and surprise-filled entertainment . Interesting to note is that plays like a male sex fantasy of female supremacy . The all the men in the movie are idiot , perennially horny and incompetent buffoons . The women are sassy , bossing the men around and outsmarting them at every turn , while they carry out philantropic action to feed the now landless people . Both of whom form a sympathetic and agreeable couple , Mar√≠a, the strong but innocent and uneducated daughter of a farmer , while vixen Salma Hayek as a brave and impulsive girl who&apos;ll stop at nothing to get her purports . Both Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz have the goofy men wrapped around their finger . You can guess the conclusion from sheer arithmetics alone and the movie is pretty good from a technical standpoint, but eurowestern fans will have a ball seeing two of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen. The picture packs an attractive female duo , funny gun-play along with fist-fight very much in the style of two Continental Westerns : ¬®Legend of Frenchie King¬®or ¬®Les Petroleuses¬® by Christian Jaque played by B. B and C. C : Brigitte Bardot , Claudia Cardinale and ¬®Viva Maria¬® by Louis Malle with Jeanne Moreau and Bardot . On the flip side, however, as a Western this film didn&apos;t quite have the same quality as many others in the genre and a major reason could be the fact that it was intended more for European audiences and specifically , the French public . In any case , while it wasn&apos;t a bad movie for the most part , I thought it should have been much better and that&apos;s why I have rated it accordingly . It does eventually outstay its welcome , and there are a surprising amount of ridiculous confrontation , shoot&apos;em up, fights and laughters . It certainly has an enthusiastic cast , as Steve Zahn who steals the show with his gestures , faces and excesses as a bungler , stupid investigator and there appears ordinary secondary actors , such as : Dwight Yoakam as the murdeous pursuer , Denis Arndt as a wealthy banker , Sam Shepard as their experienced instructor and Mexican actors as &apos;East&apos; Carlo , Carlos Cervantes , among others .\n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Joachin R√∏nning and Espen Sandberg , both of whom are friends from childhood , and they began directing professionally shorts . Known for making films about famous Norwegian historical figures, like Thor Heyerdahl and Max Manus. And other films together or separated , such as : Maleficent , Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales , Doomsday , Amundsen , Marco Polo series , among others . Rating : 6/10. Decent , acceptable Western especially appointed to Penelop√© Cruz and Salma Hayek fans .",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s possible that A Man Called Sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a director&apos;s cut one day, but I seriously doubt it.\n\nJames Garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of Americans over to fill the cast out. Folks like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this film.\n\nGarner always gets cast as likable rogues because he&apos;s so darn good at playing them. But he has played serious and done it well in films like The Children&apos;s Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge can&apos;t be counted as one of his successes.\n\nHe&apos;s got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures, he&apos;s followed from the saloon by John Marley.\n\nMarley&apos;s spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his gang together for a heist.\n\nHere&apos;s where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. \n\nThat was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who like the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during that prison break there&apos;s enough there for three movies.\n\nThat&apos;s not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. But by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.\n\nThe great movie singer of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I can&apos;t find him in the film. Maybe a chorus of the Donkey Serenade might have made this better.\n\nCouldn&apos;t have hurt any.",

As usual in the series. Miss Finley&apos;s buttocks are constantly fondled by the old letch, something she squealingly accepts without protest. Karin Baal from Dark Eyes of London plays the heir to the castle. There&apos;s lots of snakes in this entry as there was in The Blue Hand but no super criminal dressed in a cumbersome costume. The ever mysterious Uta Levka contributes her ever mysterious presence. The cinematography is excellent as usual but the plot is so absurd and goofy the entire film is a self-aware parody. A great deal of patience will be needed to watch this in one sitting unless you are trapped in a theater setting.",

      "reviewBody": "The early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even had a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original Lone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski&apos;s movie delivers in spades. \n\nIt&apos;s awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of yore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans pulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to past masters of the Western genre, while in Depp&apos;s Tonto there&apos;s a bona fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. \n\nThis is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became The Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian side-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom Wilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain duties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West in is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for eating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some Grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with sexual energy. \n\nIt&apos;s all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the expense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could have been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes, and Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there&apos;s nary a dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski throw all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging from ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is bookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes from start to end. \n\nThere&apos;s caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the time, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and legends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale. It was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against those damning early critic reviews, it&apos;s not something he does, being as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer, Hammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were written before the film had even been released, the big budget and production problems clearly making this a big stinker¬Ö \n\nNot so, it&apos;s certainly not flawless, and those seriously into anachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven&apos;t seen it yet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a chance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It also looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even show Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10",

Spencer Tracey, in one of his finest performances, essays the role of Father Flanagan who, in spite of mounting pressure from society, champions the cause of juvenile delinquents and gives them a shelter and some much-needed care. But the order in Boys Town is marred by the reluctant entry of Whitey Marsh (played effortlessly by Mickey Rooney), a cocky street-smart urchin who loathes having to adjust his ways to suit the others. However, as the events unwind, Whitey slowly starts loving Boys Town so much so that he stakes his life for it. What impressed me about the movie most was the brilliant performance from Spencer Tracey - a delicate balance of charm, wit, care and enormous willpower."

      "reviewBody": "From the director of The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook &amp; American Hustle, Joy advertises itself to be a biographical comedy-drama but isn&apos;t faithful enough to qualify as a biography, has nothing but disappointment in store if what you are looking for is a compelling drama &amp; forgets midway that it&apos;s supposed to be a comedy as well.\n\nJoy tells the story of its titular character, a divorced mother of three children who attempts to overcome the overwhelming obstacles in her personal &amp; professional life by bringing her invention into the commercial market, which becomes an overnight success and marks the first step in her rise from a nobody to the founder &amp; matriarch of a powerful business dynasty.\n\nWritten &amp; directed by David O. Russell, the first act of Joy has no trouble at all in getting on your nerves for Russell goes horribly smug about his ability to create interesting characters and overburdens the plot with way too many irrelevant people, who never for once allow its titular character to breathe comfortably, plus their contribution amounts to pretty much nothing in the end.\n\nRussell tries too hard in the beginning because of which the supporting cast he introduces us to turn end up being annoying much earlier than expected, thus leaving the responsibility of taking the story past the finish line on its leading lady. Editing also is an issue for the story meanders on moments that are tiresome, Cinematography adds nothing to the experience, and even the soundtrack isn&apos;t effective.\n\nComing to the performances, Joy features quite an ensemble in Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Edgar Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Bradley Cooper &amp; others, amongst whom only Lawrence is able to deliver the goods. The supporting cast is anything but supportive, mostly due to the lack of characterisation in Russell&apos;s script, and while Lawrence tries to do whatever she can, she doesn&apos;t have enough material to work with.\n\nOn an overall scale, Joy could&apos;ve been a highly fascinating biopic for there are tiny glimpses of a hidden gem in its content but instead, it turns out to be an absolute mess that manages to stay afloat only due to Lawrence&apos;s commitment. The first act is annoying, the middle part is its only saviour while the third act arrives too abruptly &amp; ends everything a tad too quickly. Definitely the most underwhelming of all Russell-Lawrence collaborations, sitting through Joy was a joyless experience."

      "reviewBody": "Death Hunt is directed by Peter Hunt and written by Michael Grais and Mark Victor. It stars Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Carl Weathers, Ed Lauter, Andrew Stevens, Scott Hyland, Maury Chaykin and Angie Dickinson. Music is by Jerrold Immel and cinematography by James Devis.\n\nFilm is loosely based on the real &quot;Mad Trapper&quot; man hunt that occurred in the Yukon Territory, Canada, 1931. \n\nDirected by the man who helmed On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service, and starring two of the iconic stars of The Dirty Dozen, it&apos;s no surprise to find Death Hunt full of machismo. What transpires is a two part movie, where time is afforded the set up for the first half, and the second half features the man hunt across the Yukon landscapes. \n\nPlot basically sees Bronson as nomadic loner Albert Johnson (The Mad Trapper of lore), who rescues a severely injured dog from a dog fight held by baying locals, much to their displeasure. Unwisely tracking Johnson down and taking him on, one of their number is shot and killed. So in come the legal guys, the RCMP, led by grizzled old pro Edgar Millen (Marvin), who desperately tries to keep things in order as the situation quickly spirals out of control. As Johnson takes to the snowy terrain, with Millen and co in pursuit, a respect begins to form between the two wise heads, with Millen very much aware that there will be only one winner in this hunt.\n\nSo it goes, framed by lovely location photography, and with Bronson and Marvin doing what they do best, film plays out as a snowy chase and survive adventure. It&apos;s very much fictionalised from the real story, but some instances are real, including the incredible journey that Johnson undertook whilst fleeing his pursuers. Violence slots in and out of proceedings, as does moments of humour, and there&apos;s a nice grey area in the narrative that questions who you should be rooting for. In fact Marvin&apos;s characterisation of Millen is very enjoyable because he is irked by the cretins he finds himself hunting with. \n\nSome of the support players are under written, so therefore underused, while Dickinson pops in only briefly and purely as a bit of sexy relief from the machismo on show. All told it&apos;s a safe and enjoyable movie for fans of the stars and fans of outdoor action/adventure/thrillers. Kind of like First Blood meets The Fugitive who then take Seraphim Falls out for a drink. Only, remember, this was before all those and it has Bronson and Marvin in the locker! 7/10",

At least no more than in, say, LAST TANGO IN Paris, which this movie somewhat resembles-- woman secretly meeting older and uncommunicative man from time to time to cheat on her more suitable partner. However, I kept watching because although I haven&apos;t read the novel, it&apos;s by a respected writer; and the lead actress has a good reputation. Not because there was any character that the audience could sympathize with. Eventually some exposition of the characters&apos; background was produced, basically in the form of sheer monologue rather than being cinematically integrated, but the exposition came too late. A movie that engaged more audience sympathy might have led people to say &quot;Aha, now I understand and I must see this again from the beginning.&quot; But this isn&apos;t a movie that engages the audience in that way (maybe it engages you by the photography, if that&apos;s something you to go the movies for) and those who do watch it till the end may not be eager to do so again. So it&apos;s sort of like hearing a joke and then, just before the punch line, being told &quot;Oh, I should have mentioned that the guy was hunting a bear in the forest.&quot;"

It wasn&apos;t terrible tho.\n\nThis film is set in Jerusalem. When it begins the Boynton family (with Piper Laurie as the martiarch Emily and Carrie Fisher as one of her daughters) is preparing for destroying the patriarch&apos;s will as he died recently. They go in Jerusalem and Poirot casually happens to be there. Along them also Lady Westholme (Lauren Bacall), her secretary Miss Quinton (Hayley Mills) and her lawyer Cope (STARSKY &amp; HUTCH&apos;s David Soul). At a dig, Emily is found dead with pin marks on her wrist, suggesting that she had an injection with a syringe. With the help of Colonel Cadbury (John Gielgud) Poirot investigates. I won&apos;t spoil the ending.\n\nThe scenery is great and the soundtrack was decent. The cast is full of famous stars apart Ustinov: Lauren Bacall, Carrie Fisher, Piper Laurie, David Soul and legendary stage actor John Gielgud are quite an ensemble cast of A-listers. The problems with this movie were that at times it was sloppy and slow paced, and Mrs Boyinton looked a bit too cantankerous than a tyrant. And the plot twist at the end was hard to believe.\n\nNot a complete disaster but with some faults (and the fact that it was produced by Cannon films probably says a lot)."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been getting a little tired of the computer-enhanced extravaganzas that have been flung at viewers over the past few years.  You know what I&apos;m talking about--the movies that are short on plot, acting or both which are bolstered up by loud FX and revolutionary digital animation so that it becomes &quot;special effects in search of a picture&quot;.  I&apos;m delighted to say that CALENDAR GIRLS has nothing of the kind.  It&apos;s all about the plot, all about the women involved, and all about laughing so hard you cry--or maybe about being able to forget tears in deep laughter, if only for a moment.\n\nThe acting is superb.  One hardly needs to mention Helen Mirren.  I read one comment that pans her Yorkshire accent; well, I attended it with an Englishwoman who is very familiar with such an accent and she specifically told me that her accent never slipped, so I&apos;ve no idea where that comment came from.\n\nHaving been involved with the world of cancer treatment recently (fortunately with a happier outcome for my mother, a survivor of breast cancer) this movie strikes close to home.  It&apos;s completely accurate; it&apos;s not pretty and it&apos;s often degrading, no matter how much the oncological staff tries to make it easier.  The movie is also accurate in the kind of sentiments it expresses about cancer.  People who have been touched by that filthy disease will do ANYTHING to fight it.  (I sat on a spin bike for twenty-four consecutive hours in aid of breast cancer less than two weeks ago, so I do know what I&apos;m talking about.)  Yes, a few liberties with the real story have been taken.  So what?  The result is a coherent progression that is more interested in human beings than plot details.  And isn&apos;t that what it should be about?\n\nI&apos;ve heard this dismissed as a movie for &quot;older people&quot;.  I&apos;m proud to be of that number--after all, at the age of thirty-five I&apos;m ten years out of the target demographic at which Hollywood films are aimed.  If by &quot;older people&quot; they mean people who want a movie to be about something important as opposed to the latest spectacular light show, I&apos;m glad to be of that number.  I&apos;d recommend this to anyone who&apos;s interested in a movie that is both hysterically funny and deeply touching.  It has re-inspired me in the battle against cancer, and if it does that to anyone else, it will have made a worthwhile difference.",

He&apos;s actually been horribly disfigured beyond recognition. He doesn&apos;t want to burden her and takes on an alternate identity Erik Kessler. However he doesn&apos;t know that Elizabeth gave birth to their son Drew. Her boss Larry Hamilton (George Brent) takes care of her and they get married. Twenty years later, John/Erik returns with an adopted daughter Margaret Ludwig (Natalie Wood). They&apos;re escaping Europe just as WWII is about to start. He goes to his old house but Elizabeth is long gone. He goes to work for Larry and is surprised to meet her at a dinner party. She doesn&apos;t recognize him and he&apos;s conflicted to reveal his true identity. Drew intends to volunteer for war. \n\nNatalie Wood is so young that I don&apos;t even recognize her. She&apos;s so tiny, adorable and does a great job. This is a very traditional melodrama with a couple of great actors. Welles is quite effective. He doesn&apos;t have much screen time before the war which makes his &apos;transformation&apos; a whole lot easier. Claudette Colbert plays the melodrama with class although she&apos;s asked to stretch a lot. Her character goes from weepy depressed to shocked anger. The story is one big melodrama of lost romance. It&apos;s a real weepy tear jerker manipulating all the heart strings. Well there isn&apos;t that many tears but it&apos;s the kind of movie that never stops trying. The great actors keep the enterprise on track.",

This is a soul stirring movie that is perfect in its simplicity. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best performance Brad Pitt has ever offered, but he was quite good. David Thewlis (an amazing actor who never receives as much praise he deserves) gave a perfect performance. But the real beauty of the film is the Tibetan people and their lifestyle. The cinematography was breathtaking and perfectly matched the mood of the film. I loved this movie so much that I&apos;m going to buy it immediately.

It has its moments of intensity, its greatness in the acting and directing. Its not a classic, but with all of the mediocre works that are out there to take your money, this is one that would NOT be a waste of your time.\n\nI would highly recommend this film if you are into suspense, drama, intrigue of any nature. \n\nThere are certain aspects that are left open, but so minor that it doesn&apos;t distract from the impact of the movie.\n\nAll in all -- a very good watch.\n\n6 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "Dieter Hildebrandt&apos;s documentary is an interesting and overviewed source with plenty of unseen footage, sound clips and propaganda from WWII and before that, which makes this a must-see film for those who want to learn more about the persecution suffered by the Jews between the decades of 1930 and 1940. More experienced viewers, myself included, won&apos;t find this much different from what&apos;s presented in several existing documentaries except one thing or another, so it can be a very repetitive experience but worth watching nonetheless.\n\nIt&apos;s all very briefly presented in nine or ten chapters, that goes from Hitler&apos;s rise to power (1933), the first laws preventing Jews of doing many things; the magnificent and huge campaign built by the government with the 1936&apos;s Olympics and also deceiving the German population into thinking the Jews are part of the nation&apos;s problems; 1938&apos;s Night of the Broken Glass with attacks to synagogues, stores, many people died or were injured; later on it culminates with war, final solution in the concentration camps and gas chambers.\n\nParallel to that, we are presented some of the Nazi propaganda of the period, one of them is a film (never showed to the public even back then) that paints a friendly picture about &quot;the reality&quot; of the Jews in the labor camps, with the victims happily acting before cameras as if they were working in an ordinary factory. Truly appalling.\n\nTechnically speaking the movie is very well put together, consisting mostly of archive footage, narrated by a tiring voice and dubbed in some parts during German speeches (captions would be better) or when presenting reflections of people who escaped the persecution. 99% archive, except for one introduction by Simon Wiesenthal, one of the film&apos;s producers.\n\nGood film, highly informative and historical. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is yet another classic from William Castle, the king of the gimmicks. The gimmick used for this film, often compared with &quot;Psycho&quot;, was the idea of a &quot;Fright Break&quot; during which the viewer has 30 seconds to determine if they want to see the &apos;terrifying&apos; conclusion to the film. When released in theaters initially, there was a separate section that patrons could go to during the &quot;Fright Break&quot;. Gimmicks aside this is a very well crafted, often goofy, and quite effective little thriller. The murders, acting, and storyline are all over the top and everyone in the movie puts on quite an effective performance. Standing out in her role as Emily is Jean Arliss. It seems that Emily is quite disturbed as the movie opens with an alarming murder sequence. The story goes downhill from there and, just when you think you have all of the answers, the film changes the questions! The ending is very shocking for first time viewers and yet this is the kind of film that also gets more and more entertaining with each additional viewing. Highly recommended for horror fans, even though it&apos;s often compared with &quot;Psycho&quot; I feel that the film stands out on it&apos;s own and it&apos;s ending is actually more effective than Hitchcock&apos;s. Watch this movie, you won&apos;t regret it!",

But what a shock to start to explore How that day, and the day after, and the day before\n\nTwenty-four thousand dropped like flies Right before the world&apos;s uncaring eyes. So while you bask in our bounty and wealth Remember September 12th.\n\nThe tragedy that is going on in Darfur today, where 400,000 have been murdered, countless numbers of women have been gang-raped, and 2.5 million people are in virtual prison in refugee camps makes September 11th seem like a traffic accident. Yet, despite the carnage and the real evidence that what happened in Rwanda is occurring in Sudan, we do nothing, just as we did nothing in Rwanda.\n\nDarfur is not a threat to anyone and is of no benefit to anyone, so no one cares what happens to them. Add to that the fact that they are Africans, and you can understand the message of this film very clearly.\n\nGeorge Clooney narrates a compelling story that should be seen by everyone. He is assisted by standout journalist, Nicholas Kristof, and Elie Wiesel, who is there to remind us that we did say at one time, &quot;Never Again.&quot; Well, it is happening again, and we do nothing.\n\nThe Bush administration gives lip service to Darfur, while they are dealing with the government of Sudan to obtain information to aid them on their terror campaign. Sudan has something we want; Darfur doesn&apos;t. The actions this administration is taking against Iran, would have solved this crisis long ago if they were implemented against Sudan, but Iran has something we want; Darfur doesn&apos;t. \n\nAlmost 3,000 Americans died on September 11th, but thousands are dying every day in Darfur. Can we continue to look the other way and call ourselves a &quot;christian&quot; nation?\n\nThe only flaw in this compelling film was the fact that it didn&apos;t seem to flow smoothly. But what is that compared to the message it is sending to the world?\n\nMichael Moore could have done a better job, but we can&apos;t wait any longer.",

      "reviewBody": "A rare Humphrey Bogart comedy, and it works perfectly! \n\nSeeing Bogart in the lead role, and the movie being about a jailbreak, I was expecting an adventure-drama. Instead I got a comedy, and a very good one at that.\n\nIncredibly sharp dialogue and some devilishly clever and funny sub-plots make this an hilarious movie. Add in the fact that it is set at Christmas, and there is a great amount of Christmas sentimentality and fun involved too.\n\nThe other things that carry the movie are the performances of Bogart and, especially, Peter Ustinov. Bogart delivers his lines well and cannot be faulted, but Ustinov has a perfect sense of comedic timing. Plus his Englishness makes him seem so much funnier.\n\nAldo Ray is a bit hit-and-miss as the third non-angel. Sometimes you feel he is just reciting his lines without any sense of timing or tone, but others then hit the mark well.\n\nGood support from Joan Bennett, Basil Rathbone, Leo Carroll and Gloria Talbott.\n\nA must-see, especially at Christmas.",

This movie kept me enthralled the whole way. It was when Affleck still had his charisma from Good Will Hunting. Charlize Theron dazzles us with her smile and charm and Gary Sinise is sinister as the intimidating &quot;older brother&quot;. My only complaint was there were one too many plot twists in the end. Otherwise, settle in for a smooth ride.\n\nMy favorite part of this movie are the prison sequences at the start and the final scenes. The prison sequence was very well done and Affleck is immediately identifiable as the likable car jacker. The final scenes are a great touch after the explosions, a nice touch to an enjoyable film. Sinise&apos;s fellow gang members are excellent as well, their intimidation tactics and craziness well transmitted to the screen.\n\nSee this movie around Christmas time. It may hold some more value.",

The result was a completely daft, but thoroughly entertaining piece of schlock cinema.\n\nWith The Viking Queen, an equally silly and factually inaccurate sword and sandal movie, he once again uses &apos;big breast diversion tactics&apos;¬óonly this time with less successful results. Perhaps Chaffey should have thrown caution to the wind and chucked in a T-rex or two!\n\nBeautiful, pillow-chested model Carina plays Celtic Queen (yes... Celtic!) Salina of the Iceni, who is forced to pick up a sword and fight the Romans, despite the fact that her lover, Justinian, is their leader. Carina sure is gorgeous, but even her breath-taking looks and marvellous physique are not enough to prevent one from noticing her wooden acting, the dreadful script, and plodding direction.\n\nStay the course, and you will be treated to a couple of unintentionally hilarious scenes (of which the lowering of Romans into a fiery pit was my favourite), a smattering of partial nudity (nipple tassles spoil the fun), and a silly battle with Boudicca-style warrior women in chariots (with blades on the wheels) attacking Romans with glee.\n\nBut even these enjoyably dumb moments cannot stop The Viking Queen from being a merely mediocre effort.",

Unfortunately it&apos;s let down by &quot;Hollywood style&quot; over-editing of the action scenes. David Belle &amp; Cyril Raffaelli have *real* skills, and showing them off is the raison de etre of the film - so why chop most of the best moves into 3 separate shots, so we can&apos;t really appreciate them? It&apos;s a tribute to the performers and Raffaelli&apos;s choreography that they&apos;re still amazing to watch! I&apos;d love to see a re-edit that simply removes the unnecessary insert shots and shows the moves in their full glory. Despite this objection, I still rate the film 8/10 :)",

As I was playing the disc, I got hooked. I agree with the consensus of previous reviewers before me. This movie is nothing special, with thin plot, thin characters, and low-budget sets (when they&apos;re not using real locations). But what the movie has going for it is spectacular scenery, compliments of the Holy Land, decent chase scenes and stunts, and a very appealing Van Damme, probably at his most relaxed and confident. If you see it playing anywhere on cable, be sure to check it out. It&apos;s not cerebral, but it&apos;s entertaining and watchable (and short).",

Naturally, she has been possessed by a demon (the sound of buzzing flies signals the event).\n\nFor the remainder of the movie, she alternates between innocent schoolgirl and a superhuman, sex-starved demon who masturbates in public and shouts obscenities. The headmistresses keep telling each other, &quot;Magdelena&apos;s not well,&quot; and, &quot;All she needs is a tranquilizer.&quot; They take her to Sunday service, where she tears a Bible in half and swears at the pastors.\n\nMagdelena is removed to a country cottage where concerned psychologists can keep an eye on her. In her possessed state, she sweats a lot and teases an infatuated young medic, who unctuously professes his love even after she tries to strangle him. Finally, she recites a prayer and vomits the demon in the form of a live snake, which the medic quickly grinds under his boot.\n\nThis German-made schlock fest offers much debate between doctors and clergy, none of it effective or especially dramatic. The sex talk is surprisingly crude and Dagmar Hedrich, who looks closer to 30 years old, is energetic as Magdelena and gets naked a lot.",

      "reviewBody": "The original film version of the coast-to-coast illegal Cannonball Run race is better than 1981&apos;s &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; but lacks the star power of that film. It does have a solid cast with Michael Sarrazin, Tim McIntire (who did the voice of Blood in &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;), Raul Julia, Gary Busey, J. Pat O&apos;Malley, Nicholas Pryor, Vaughn Taylor, and Colleen Camp. Still, that&apos;s nowhere as cool or fun as Burt &amp; Dom and Sammy &amp; Dean (not to mention Jack Elam). This version of the illegal race unfolds pretty much the same as Cannonball, with a quirky group of diverse characters racing from the east to west coast in a series of comedic episodic events. Directed by Chuck Bail, this film features more exciting of chase sequences, with lots of effective low-angle car POV shots and some exciting editing, but the film&apos;s overall tone is just about as light as breezy as Cannonball. There&apos;s fun sequences involving the racers getting past police roadblocks and other obstacles, and Gary Busey doing a rebel yell is pretty irresistible. Overall, &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot; isn&apos;t a classic, but it&apos;s a fun breezy car chase film that you&apos;ll enjoy while watching, but will probably forget about 10 minutes after it&apos;s over.",

The suspense will make you bite down your fingernails for 90 minutes, there is neither violence nor gore, because the true horror comes from the unknown and the unexpected! In 1982 John Carpenter filmed a remake with more action, better F/X and Kurt Russell, but it has not much to do with Howard Hawks original! And also the spirit of the post WW2-era is totally missing, because this film shows very urgently the fear of nuclear armament or the things from outer space! In some moments Christian Nyby¬¥s film even reminded me on Ridley Scott¬¥s &quot;Alien&quot;, the parallels to both stories are more than immense! But as Scott¬¥s movie is nothing but good Sci-Fi/horror, &quot;The Thing from another World&quot; is social criticsm and suspense-packed entertainment in one! It influenced many other classics of the genre like &quot;Tarantula&quot;, &quot;Them!&quot; or &quot;It came from outer Space&quot;, so it¬¥s a very enjoyable and important film, which is a must for lovers of 1950s terror cinema!"

It&apos;s a great spin on the (slowly getting tiresome) Zombie genre that had me laughing and, at times, on the edge of my seat, for the entire movie.\n\nWithout going into too much detail you get to follow along with a news reporter (yes, this means shaky-cam) as he is embedded with an elite group of zombie smashers. The story moves along at a brisk pace and the script, while atrocious at times, is mostly coherent and palatable. The gore is great, albeit overdone in some scenes. Where this movie shines is the FORMAT. Like with Starship Troopers there are cut-ins of commercials that are, at least to me, hilarious! If you can get past the shaky-cam being TOO shaky in some scenes then you just might find a movie that warrants a recommend to your friends.\n\nThe bottom line: If you loved Starship Troopers as I did, you will love this movie. If you like the Zombie genre, as I do, this is a different take on it with a few surprises. The effects aren&apos;t bad and the acting is slightly above average. Red Box it if you are a fan of the genre, you might just love it!",

It starts from Asad&apos;s birth place, Ukraine, where his family is interviewed. The film crew then travels to Austria to witness the naming of a square, located in front of the UN building, in honor of this esteemed scholar. The next stop is the deserted area of Jerusalem, followed by interviews and meetings in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, United States, Morocco and Spain. \n\nFull marks to the producers and directors. Kudos to the music producers for this touching background music.",

So it is a fair estimate that about 90 % of the people who went to see it in a cinema, came from that region. It still was so successful as to spawn its own TV series, which I have not watched yet. But I imagine that it is as funny as this movie.\n\nSeries aside, which should deal with an overall arc that is happening before the events of the movie, we get a movie that is about a church and two villages that are not really liking each other. Apart from a man and woman from each side. Almost like a West Side story, without the singing, but with a larger scale problem. The hate for each other creates quite a few funny moments. Some of the jokes might be hard to get if you&apos;re not familiar with the way people live there, their habits, even more so, if you&apos;re not German. A special movie then, but one that can be fun",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a production that employed actors from various Latin-American countries in order to attract viewers in all Latin America. It&apos;s something that should be tried more often. We should organize distribution &amp; production companies in Latin-America to integrate the whole region and give us more opportunities to see Latin American films, because there&apos;s such an overload of American films that we in Brazil know much more about Hollywood stars than about our Latin-American neighbours. This said, let&apos;s go to the film.\n\nThe film is about a triangle love story but it is in some ways unusual -there&apos;s no moral preaching and no conventional happy ending. The characters belong to the privileged class and live in a conservative background where the Catholic Church is still a power to reckon with, but the modern world is their real world. They may sometimes go to mass and confession but when conflicts between the two worlds arise their own wishes prevail, in spite of conservative dogmas, and the Church and their icons go to the background.\n\nThere was a reviewer that said that the sex scenes were a fill-up and were not necessary at all. I disagree with him. Sex is essential to show the reason why Zoe (gorgeous Barbara Mori) in spite of her conservative upbringing, engages in an affair with her brother-in-law. And the sex scenes are really sensual, showing a woman discovering herself through sexual pleasure. Can someone tell me of any American actress able to do the same in such a sensual way? The acting of the whole cast is excellent, the film has such a good story that manages to keep our interest till the end. I&apos;m not telling you that &quot;La Mujer de mi Hermano&quot; is a masterpiece but certainly it&apos;s a very good film.\n\nOther Latin American films I recommend are: &quot;Pantaleon Y las Visitadoras&quot;, &quot;Maria Full of Grace&quot;, &quot;Nina Santa&quot;, &quot;El mismo amor, La misma lluvia&quot;, &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot;, &quot;Machuca&quot; and so many others!",

He has no friends but finds friendship with the rats in the backyard. Soon, his friends are multitudes willing to do his bidding.\n\nThe idea is there but this is shot in a flat, uninspired manner. The actors are either first rate or on their way. Borgnine is gloriously evil. Davison is a little green around the edges. This should be a lot more compelling. There should be more tension. It&apos;s got some creepiness but I would like more.",

All Christmas movies that I have seen are good like Eloise at Christmastime,Home Alone,Home Alone 2 and Mickeys Christmas movie everyone except Recess:miracle on third street school. I liked Principal Prickly and Mikey in this film because they had the best and main parts in this Recess film.In this film they showed different episodes of Recess and my favourite one is the great can drive in which the recess gang want to beat the Ashleys for collecting more cans for thanksgiving.",

Even by today standards, this is insane and mindblowing. During the first 20-30 minutes, i thought i knew where it goes and the same will everyone think. But make no mistake, you don&apos;t have a clue where it goes. It&apos;s not just cheap twists that made this unpredictable but organically flowing turns of the story. I mean, this is coherent and it doesn&apos;t shock you just for the shake of shock, with dumb twists that come out of nowhere. The person who wrote this knew exactly what he was doing. Because this is not just insane but brilliant too.\n\nI can&apos;t rate it higher because i was not that excited during the first 40-50 minutes. This movie takes its time. I repeat, you think it is just an ordinary story, like a drama romance film noir of this era, with lovers thinking the same old schemes etc. No, it&apos;s not. This is way too original and creative. Of course way better than the mediocre 2010 version. The 2010 HANYO is not good. But this is.\n\nIcing on the cake: The last minute. I couldn&apos;t believe my own eyes, i watched it three times, that indicates how much i loved it.",

Fortunately, Ms. Malone is ineffective at killing herself, and returns to her trailer park home. Also returning is budding gay brother Brad Renfro (as Jay Grubb), fresh from four boring weeks fishing with his uncle. They, and trashy harlot sister Alicia Witt (as Barbie), live with pot-smoking mom Michelle Forbes (as Madge Grubb). Prompted by Malone, the family four decide to attend an annual prison picnic, to see absent father Chris Mulkey (as John Grubb), who is serving time for two murders.\n\nAt the picnic, the reunited Grubbs are joined by Mr. Mulkey&apos;s prison pal Clifton Collins Jr. (as Buddy). Then, skeletons begin falling out of the family closet¬Ö &quot;We crawl on our bellies and eat the dead,&quot; is how Mr. Renfro describes the Grubb family. Jordan Brady&apos;s &quot;American Girl&quot; has some good moments, and is well-acted. But, the &quot;dark comedy&quot; aspect doesn&apos;t really succeed; it might have been better to film Scott Sandoe&apos;s story as a drama.\n\nDirector Brady is at his best when the family begins their picnic. Malone does a great job with her character&apos;s less suicidal, more introspective moments; the growth of her romanticism to rage is very nicely played. Renfro&apos;s character is hardly second rate; and, without the numerous suicide attempts, it&apos;s a more satisfying story. Renfro, and the film, are helped immensely by the appearance of Mr. Collins Jr.&apos;s sex &quot;Buddy&quot;. Clifton Collins Jr. is definitely &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; worthy.\n\n******* American Girl (10/16/02) Jordan Brady ~ Jena Malone, Brad Renfro, Clifton Collins Jr.",

      "reviewBody": "In the law and order 1950&apos;s, crooked cops were not exactly a box office item, especially from a studio that prided itself on wholesome entertainment. But head executive Louis B. Mayer had been forced out of MGM in favor of the more current Dore Schary who promised harder- hitting films on subjects more topical than Andy Hardy.\n\nI guess it&apos;s easier to shift personnel than it is to change tradition, because this crime drama has neither the look nor the feel of the real thing. In short, the movie&apos;s an antiseptic treatment of a seamy subject, and all Robert Taylor&apos;s tedious tough talk or George Raft&apos;s gangster reputation can&apos;t muddy up the sheen. \n\nNote Taylor&apos;s impeccable suits, the glamor girls in high-class outfits, the uncluttered studio sets, and especially the high-key lighting that robs the visuals of any hint of ambiguity. Unfortunately, director Roy Rowland brings next to nothing to the project, filming in the most pedestrian style possible. This is a film that cries out for at least something of a noir approach to bring out the menace and moral conflict implicit in the screenplay. \n\nNote too, how many punches are pulled from the final ambulance scene to the redeemed bad girls to the fist-fight with muscular Vince Edwards-- as a matter of fact, the movie could have used more of Edwards&apos; convincing style. Note in particular, how the killing of the two innocents is done off camera, depriving the drama of the kind of visual impact it so clearly needs. Simply nibbling around the edges of evil with an unsmiling ex-matin√©e idol is not enough.\n\nToo bad a studio like RKO or Warner Bros. of the 40&apos;s didn&apos;t get hold of the property first. They could have done it up right. MGM may have been great for lavish productions like costume drama and musicals, but crime drama simply did not fit their style. And not even Dore Schary could change that."

Olmi&apos;s direction of the non-professional cast is superb and the film is beautifully shot and edited.\n\nDon&apos;t be afraid of this film. It does not actually seem long, nor does it seem aimless or plotless. While one may say that &quot;the whole pesant community&quot; is the real protagonist there are clearly defined characters in the film whose narratives we follow. In fact, the films strategy is one of integration of these narrative strands in a seemingly coherent and logical way. A wonderful, very emotionally moving experience with a clear, sharp, political analysis.",

      "reviewBody": "One of my favourite films of all time, this Broderick Crawford, Judy Holliday, William Holden vehicle was magnificently written by Garson Kanin and superbly directed by George Cukor.  \n\nCukor did something that is seldom done with any film: He decided to rehearse `Born Yesterday&apos; as if it were a play (which it was on Broadway and of which Judy Holliday performed the role of Billie Dawn 1,200 times) and had a complete theater built on one of the studio&apos;s soundstages and filled it with an audience so he could perfectly time the laughs and the pauses so the movie-going public wouldn&apos;t miss a thing.\n\nThis bit of directing genius is part of what is responsible for the remarkable film that is `Born Yesterday.&apos;\n\nThe other part of the equation is the casting of Broderick Crawford as the slimy, junk dealer turned multi-millionaire, Harry Brock.\n\nRita Hayworth was originally slated to star as Billie Dawn but when she married Ally Khan and put her screen career on hold the producers ran through an entire list of potential candidates¬Ö  It was only with great reluctance that they finally decided to use Judy Holliday in the role she created on Broadway ¬ñ not believing she was a big enough `name&apos; to pull in audiences. \n\nLucky break for them:  She went on to win the first Oscar ever awarded to an actress for a comedic role.  \n\nHer every movement, glance and word is a study in brilliance of the not-so-dumb blonde, Billie Dawn.  \n\nUnfortunately Judy Holliday&apos;s career was cut short when she died of breast cancer just a few weeks short of her 44th birthday ¬ñ who knows what kind of work she could have accomplished had she only lived.\n\n`Born Yesterday&apos; went on to receive five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but the only award went to Judy Holliday for Best Actress; she also won the Golden Globe in the same category that year.\n\nThis is a finely crafted tale of greed, corruption and the ultimate price that must be paid by those that believe they can manipulate the law and the government by for and of the people.\n\nIt is a brilliant movie and should not be missed.",

Joan Allen is remarkable as She. Her beauty is second only to her delivery of the some of the most intelligent and profound verse that I have ever heard. Shiela Hancock&apos;s death speech sits on its own as an inspired piece of writing. There are so many great moments in this film, there is no point in trying to list them, but do look out for the wine bar scene!\n\nPotter has reminded me why film is great.\n\nThank you Sally Potter.",

There&apos;s a little more plot structure than usual, and the script is half-decent even if some of the acting is decidedly half-baked.\n\nGood to see former Australian rugby league player Ian Roberts in a minor supporting role as a radiation-infected kingpin of the wasteland (which look like some current public housing districts), and then more prominently, Kadeem Hardison as an LA police officer who along with star Michael Jai White must venture into the quarantine zone where crime is running rampant.\n\nLike many other Asylum pictures, the studio backlots, industrial warehouses and urban alleyways provide unlimited sets depicting &apos;futuristic&apos; scenery (traffic is clearly visible in some shots) and what those ubiquitous locations can&apos;t deliver, amateurish CGI takes care of the rest.\n\nMediocre mockbuster, with reasonable fight choreography and reasonably assured performances by White, Hardison and Dutton (although Wayne as the titular cyborg is comically wooden), &apos;Android Cop&apos; is a passable buddy picture that&apos;s not great , but not as awful as it could&apos;ve been under the circumstances.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fanny&quot;, the second chapter of Marcel Pagnol&apos;s &apos;Marseilles&apos; trilogy, takes us right to the spot the first movie ended. There&apos;s no summary, no flashbacks, no flash forward either, it&apos;s just as if the director, Marc Allegret trusted the good memory of his audience, and I guess in these times, cinema was still such a new thing that an experience like the first &quot;Marius&quot; would have left unforgettable memories.\n\nMarius (Pierre Fresnay), the idealistic and romantic son of colorful barkeeper C√©sar (the one and only Raimu), has just sailed to the seven seas, following both his lifelong dream and the guidance of his beloved Fanny (Orane Demazis). We left C√©sar delighted after hearing that his son and Fanny would marry, and give him grandchildren in the years to come. But &quot;Fanny&quot; starts with Marius&apos; departure. And you can see the light of joy vanish from C√©sar&apos;s face, he welcomes the news like a knife in his heart and sinks into melancholy like an ice cube in a Pastis drink. The first act shows both C√©sar and Fanny trying to deal with Marius&apos; absence, their deep and inconsolable sorrow makes Marius the most present character despite his absence.\n\nBut the worst is yet to come, Fanny is pregnant and Marius is the father. Her mother Honorine throws a tantrum and was about to disown her when she passed out, that&apos;s the kind of blow to their honor they don&apos;t need in the family. The situation seems unsolvable but there&apos;s a gateway: brave old Panisse (Henri Charpin) who&apos;s still maintaining his offer to marry Fanny. What I liked about the film is that you kind of secrecy to run in the narrative, but it doesn&apos;t, for one simple reason, this is a film with fully developed characters. Their personality are not reliant on the plot, they make the plot. Fanny is not a bad woman, when Panisse proposes her, she can&apos;t hide her pregnancy, because lying would be more dishonorable. And I loved Panisse&apos;s response, he&apos;s aware that their age gap will inspire a lot of gossipy talks, but he&apos;s always wanted to be a father, so his marriage with Fanny is benefiting for both, it&apos;s a win-win situation.\n\nAny ounce of guilt or discomfort is dissipated; by marrying Fanny, Panisse keeps her honor and his self-esteem.. It is a marriage of convenience but Panisse makes good points, what&apos;s more, he&apos;s rich, so Fanny doesn&apos;t have much a choice, between a bastard and a rich heir. But here &apos;s how the film teases your expectations again, just when you&apos;re wondering how they&apos;ll keep the secret, C√©sar does his best keeping Fanny&apos;s spirit up confident that Marius will come back, and does his best keeping Panisse away from her, dismissing his idea of marrying her. In a lesser movie, Fanny would have held the truth and C√©sar would have called her as a whore or a venal woman, but Fanny can&apos;t stand the insult and asks Panisse to reveal their secret. It takes a few minutes but C√©sar realizes they do have a point and waiting for Marius would bring dishonor for poor Fanny. But he also looks at the bright side of things, he&apos;ll still have a grandson and a heir, the name doesn&apos;t matter, he&apos;d be twice wealthier.\n\nThere&apos;s a poignant scene where the older man of Panisse family thanks Fanny for the baby and at this point, there&apos;s no way you&apos;d believe they did something wrong. It is a win-win indeed and a fragile equilibrium is reached¬Ö until Marius comes back. And again, Fanny tells him the truth Panisse can let Fanny go back to Marius but he won&apos;t abandon his child and even C√©sar, C√©sar who had always put his son above any other man, who had a nasty quarrel with Panisse, defended him. What a climax! You have plenty of characters with desires and dreams colliding together, Marius&apos; love for Fanny, Fanny&apos;s honor, Panisse needing a child, C√©sar for a grandson to play with, each one is right, but they can&apos;t all be satisfied, even Fanny can&apos;t abandon Panisse despite the fact that she loves Marius. It&apos;s pure Cornelian dilemmas and it works on a very emotional and realistic level, not resorting to the clich√©s or &quot;idiot script&quot; formula where it&apos;s more convenient to keep a mystery, the film doesn&apos;t care for mysteries, it cares about people who&apos;re so passionate, so involved that they end up knowing what the others were about to hide. Like life I guess, you can&apos;t have secrets for too long.\n\nThe film was directed by another director but the continuity with the first film is so well-done you&apos;d think it was made by the same person. Well, the film is based on Marcel Pagnol&apos;s play and he&apos;s the real &quot;director&quot; and the actors are so into their characters that they make any directorial stunt unnecessary, it&apos;s a character-study, a story of people driven to the most extreme compromises by their morals, feelings and duties, to keep the appearances. The film ends with its bleak note, leaving us eager to look forward to a suitable conclusion, this time named &quot;C√©sar&quot; and directed by Marcel Pagnol himself.\n\nNeedless to say, I&apos;m looking forward to discovering it",

More to the point though, it seems to be fairly difficult to convince an American audience to watch animation movies that have that weird British humor in it. Just take the omission of Arthur Christmas as one big example of this. An omission at the Oscars that is, that is just out of my understanding and reach. A wonderful family movie (far better than some of the nominated animated pictures), it didn&apos;t get the credit it deserved.\n\nPirates will have a hard time too. Not only the misfits of the story (they&apos;ll have to overcome quite some obstacles), but also the movie itself. If you don&apos;t mind an animated movie that actually requires you to use your brain while you watch it, then this could be for you.",

I was surprised that this is one of the first movies that I have ever seen that doesn&apos;t give away the ENTIRE plot in the trailer.\n\nI was glad that I got to see the movie, but I came away feeling that the movie was really inconsistent.  It is not up to the standards of some of the other teenage-girl angst flicks (She&apos;s all That and 10 things I hate about you come to mind).  The heroines in those movies could wipe the floor with any of the characters in Never Been Kissed.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Four Daughters&quot; introduced John Garfield to audiences, and that is what is remembered most about this film today. Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels, Garfield established his immediately, with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him.\n\nIt&apos;s actually the story of four girls, their widowed musician father (Claude Rains) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He&apos;s the one they all have a crush on, but he&apos;s in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets ne&apos;er-do-well Mickey Borden, who falls for her as well. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey.\n\nThis is a fairly formulaic story given life (and sequels) by the acting. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting, and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking leading man, and this film got him off on the right foot with Warners. However, true stardom was not to be. Like many others of the era, he went into the service, and when he came out, he had a Bronze Star but not much of a career. He later went into television and real estate. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch.\n\nSo popular was &quot;Four Daughters&quot; that it inspired &quot;Four Wives&quot; and &quot;Four Mothers,&quot; as well as reuniting much of the cast again in &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot; where the actors played different characters.\n\nVery enjoyable, a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times, and a chance to see John Garfield in his first film.",

      "description": "Adam Lemp, the Dean of the Briarwood Music Foundation, has passed on his love of music to his four early adult daughters - Thea, Emma, Kay and Ann - who live with him and his sister, the girls&apos; Aunt Etta, in the long time family home. Of the four, Kay has the greatest promise as a musical performer, specifically as a singer. Theirs is a loving family, however much the girls exasperate their father with their love of popular music, since he loves only the classics, most specifically Beethoven. The girls support each other however they can, but each is an individual with her own distinct personality and wants, including the type of man each wants as a husband. Practical but deep in her heart romantic Emma has long been courted by their next door neighbor, unassuming florist Ernest Talbot, and clever Thea wants to be Mrs. Ben Crowley, he a wealthy up and coming banker with prospects. Only the youngest, the fun loving Ann, states that she doesn&apos;t want to get married. Their collective lives change with the entry into their lives of two men. The first is Adam&apos;s old friend&apos;s son, popular music composer and conductor Felix Deitz, who easily gets a job at the foundation using his natural and sincere charm which he applies to all equally. Many women misconstrue that charm for romantic interest. The second is Felix&apos;s acquaintance, musician Mickey Borden, who he hires to orchestrate his latest composition. Mickey has a chip on his shoulders about what life has dealt him, which he uses in turn as a reason for living a reckless life. The two men make each of the four daughters reexamine what she thinks she wants in life, or more precisely who she wants, which for all may be the same person.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it&apos;s plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don&apos;t mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn&apos;t like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",

      "reviewBody": "In this adept and well-acted little sentimental charmer, a screen adaptation of Muriel Barbery&apos;s bestseller The Elegance of the Hedgehog, a precocious and artistic little rich girl, an intellectual concierge, and a benevolent Japanese gentleman come together in a posh Parisian apartment building for a brief period of understanding, communion, and the beginnings of love. The story is a little like an episode from Kay Thompson&apos;s Eloise, but set in Paris with philosophical and orientalist touches, a girl who is more smug and priggish than cute and an increasingly saccharine trajectory that is only just barely saved by a tart finale.\n\nPaloma (Garance Le Guillemic) is continually filming her annoying family, her Minister father, her mother who is addicted to Freudian analysis, tranquilizers, and champagne and makes more fuss over her plants than her daughter, her non-entity sister, and people in the corridor of the luxury five-unit apartment building. As she films, she describes everyone and everything for us in a whisper into the camera recorder. She has concluded that her life is a fish bowl from which there is no meaningful escape and therefore on her next birthday, her twelfth, she has decided she will commit suicide. Meanwhile she makes her films, stockpiles her mother&apos;s tranquilizers, and does drawings more likely for a professional illustrator than a sub-teen kid.\n\nMeanwhile one of the wealthy residents dies of a heart attack, and the Japanese gentleman, Monsieur Ozu (no relation to the director, we learn later) moves into a flat miraculously and instantly converted into a palace of Zen minimalism with gray walls, black ceramics, and other delights, an oasis of quiet, aesthetic calm, and Japonism. Even the concierge, or building janitor (though the term today is usually &quot;gardien,&quot; concierge being considered outmoded), Madame Michel (Josiane Balasko), has a place that&apos;s rather handsomely decorated; quite lovely wallpaper. Paloma&apos;s room is a throwaway, we get only glimpses of it, but it&apos;s obviously as elaborately crafted.\n\nMadame lets Monsieur Ozu into his new place, and he discovers something: she has read Tolstoy&apos;s Anna Karenina. And judging from the fact that her cat is named L√©o, he correctly concludes she&apos;s a great fan of the Russian writer. He begins wooing her, starting by presenting her with an elegant two-volume edition of the novel. Other gifts and invitations follow, with dinner in Ozu&apos;s flat prepared by him, a private screening of a classic Japanese film on video that Madame Michel has, and finally a date at a posh sushi bar. With the help of a pal who&apos;s a lady dry cleaner, Madame Michel gets a complete makeover, with a fashionable haircut and nice clothes.\n\nPaloma is ridiculously and ultimately unbearably clever, most of the other characters are mere objects, Monsieur Ozu is just an attractive gadget to draw Madame Michel out of her shell. Her place is full of books -- but TV-friendly too, though she probably keeps the set on with the sound off merely to play the role of the classic concierge -- an aging, overweight, ugly, irritable old bag who sits around watching TV all day. Madame Michel sits with a purring L√©o (though Monsieur Ozu has even better cats, by the way) reading good books -- when she is not cleaning up in the courtyard and sidewalk and being wooed by the wealthy, mysterious Japanese gentleman (we never learn where the dough comes from).\n\nPaloma, who partakes of some of the wisdom of novelist Barbery, a teacher of philosophy resident in Japan, announces during one of her monologues that she is sure Madame Michel is a &quot;hedghog&quot; (h√©risson), prickly on the outside but possessed of an interior that&apos;s subtle and kind.\n\nThe Hedgehog/Le h√©risson itself partakes of some of the essential qualities suited to international bestsellers. Its simplifications are satisfying, if you don&apos;t go too deep. Its world is appealing and somewhat exotic. Its truths are self-evident. To do her credit, the excellent Josiane Balasko gives a degree of complexity to her performance one could hardly expect from such material. She is, of course, the film&apos;s most many-layered character. At least she has the outer and inner layers Paloma attributes to the hedgehog. Paloma admires her because she has &quot;found the perfect way to hide.&quot; She can spend hours in her back room with her great books, while appearing on the outside to be a frumpy old creature that people don&apos;t even see and never bother except to have her hold a package for them.\n\nBut the artificiality of ideas and the stereotypical nature of most of the characters make this, whatever its homely message of love and acceptance of life, altogether less humane and alive than a little film like Fran√ßois Dupeyron&apos;s 2003 Monsieur Ibrahim/Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran. That too was simplistic, but it had moments of life in it. Both films fade when compared to that other movie about a precocious girl&apos;s views, Julie Gavras&apos; 2006 Blame It on Fidel/La faute √† Fidel, which works through a child&apos;s sensibility to depict how -- from her viewpoint, anyway -- her family life goes quickly and irrevocably downhill when her parents become communist revolutionaries. Political realities stretch further than life lessons delivered in a completely contrived environment, even one in which a teenage boy can get laid.\n\nThis film received indifferent reviews in Paris after its summer (July 3, 2009) release, particularly from the more sophisticated media, but it looks like it might have good American art-house potential. It was part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema (jointly sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Unifrance) and screened at the Walter Reade Theater and the IFC Center, New York, in March 2010.",

      "reviewBody": "In the plains of the southern Portuguese region of Alentejo the greatest agricultural richness are the cork-oaks since Portugal is the first cork producer in the world. There is a municipality of poor people most of them old who never knew another agricultural wealth and whose communist mayor is a honest man. A big international corporation needs the fields where the cork-oaks are implanted to build there a luxury tourist resort which includes extensive golf-links and courses. But to implement that big project it&apos;s necessary to pull down thousands of oak-trees thus changing completely the economy of the region and the lives of those who live there in the worst sense. The project cannot be put into practice without the mayor&apos;s signature authorizing it and he has always refused to do it, resisting to all corruption and bribery attempts that have been tried to break that resistance. There are in this world nowadays two levers that command power and change many situations: money and sex. Therefore here since the first lever failed the second one must be tried. And it&apos;s now that enters in the scene the element that can do it with success: the so called call girl or the fine and expensive prostitute whose role is splendidly done by Soraia Chaves a beautiful young actress who acts this role as well as any of the best Hollywood stars would do it. She is in fact irresistible and conquers and subdues our man entirely. A call girl when used as a means of corruption can be used in two ways: by corrupting directly the man with her sexual performances or at certain point refusing to go on with them without huge payments which forces the man who fell in love with her to accept the proposal of the bribers or corrupters in order to pay her and not lose her. This is basically the movie story, admirably told and admirably acted by all the performers including the two police inspectors that are trying along the whole movie to detect the corrupting business and arrest its intervenients. The story develops itself in a lot of varied vicissitudes and incidents which rivet our attention all along the movie projection till the end which is somewhat unpredicted. This is one of the recent movies that must indeed be seen not only by cinephiles but also by the the general public.",

      "reviewBody": "In the filmmaker&apos;s want to create a universe, he neglected the plot (ie what happens in said universe). There&apos;s a lot going for the film: some amazing singing, toe-tapping lyrics, some good choreography, dazzling cinematography, set design, editing. You can tell they really tried to make something special and had no limits to get it. That, though is likely the problem. Limits make creatives cunning and conservative with their resources, it leads to re-writes &amp; redesigns &amp; trimming of the fat. Here, you can tell it has no limits and thus an inexperienced filmmaker is let loose, you can hardly blame him for not grounding the idea in originality or complexity. This is obviously a simple child&apos;s tale, there&apos;s no problem there. Nobody expected this to be The King and I or Sound of Music in subtext, but the characters too often stop everything to sing a full song, when that song has little to do with furthering their character or the plot. When it does, the plot inches forward in a very slow, predictable and tired way. There is more fun when the young cast is going on then when we flash forward. At least the young brooding toy maker has a Phantom of the Opera darkness that is fun and matches well against the bright Christmas backdrop. However, as soon as we go to the later times CGI characters, not unlike the plastic ones in the early days of cinema (90&apos;s Flubber or Small Soldiers comes to mind), take over the direction of the scene but aren&apos;t likable enough to care about nor dislikable enough to care about either. They are flat, the whole film falls flat, is hollow, too simple for a mega spectacle. It reminded me of the terrible La La Land, in which everybody in Hollywood thought was brilliant, but my family and I kept waiting for it get started, unable to engage with. I love that they have an all black cast, black filmmakers... totally about time to do so... but this film wasn&apos;t the right one to invest in creatively. The production was up to being the best Christmas movie of the season, but the story and delivery simply didn&apos;t deserve the attention. I hope Netflix and other continue to invest in black cinema, just with better scripts &amp; more interesting deep characters... even in a musical, even for kids, this fell flat.",

      "reviewBody": "When women feel the need for a `good cry&apos; at the movies, they usually seek out some tragic tale of unrequited love to do the trick.   When men feel the same need, they turn to a film about baseball.  And what could be more guaranteed to convert a grown man into a shamelessly blubbering fool than a true-life account of a middle-aged baseball fanatic who gets to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the major leagues?  How many men can fail to identify with that?   Indeed, most men may not want to admit this, but the baseball movie genre has, in many ways, become the male equivalent of that category of film known, derisively by many men, as the `chick flick,&apos; for they both serve roughly the same purpose.  Apparently, even we stoic males have the need to clear out the tear ducts every now and then - for purely medical reasons of course. \n\nBecause baseball has long enjoyed the reputation of being `America&apos;s National Pastime,&apos; moviemakers have often treated it less as a sport than as an iconic institution.  From `Pride of the Yankees&apos; to `Brian&apos;s Song&apos; to `Bang the Drum Slowly&apos; to `The Natural&apos; to `Field of Dreams,&apos; movies about baseball have been so concerned with all the mythic implications of the sport that they have rarely managed to convey the sense of carefree fun that comes along with it (`Bull Durham&apos; has been one of the few obvious exceptions to this rule).  The tone in these films is sometimes so sentimental and so reverential that one begins to view baseball more as a type of pseudo religion - with the stadium functioning as a sort of temple where people gather to participate in a communal spiritual experience - than as a form of entertainment.  \n\n`The Rookie&apos; certainly falls into this category, yet the film itself has such an air of comforting familiarity about it that it manages to override much of the conventionality of the storyline.  Although we always know where the movie is headed, the easy assuredness with which it charts its course keeps us interested and absorbed for most of the duration.  The majority of the credit goes to Dennis Quaid who, as Jim Morris, the high-school-teacher-turned-big-league-ballplayer, does a first rate job portraying a man torn between responsibility to his family and this golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of realizing a childhood dream.  Quaid underplays the role so nicely that we never doubt for a moment the authenticity of all we are seeing on screen.  The screenplay by Mike Rich, though filled with overly familiar scenes and characters, nevertheless manages to avoid many of the potential lapses into overwrought melodrama that could conceivably have robbed it of much of its credibility (the dark hints early on in the film as to Morris&apos; problematic physical condition happily never come to fruition).   Director John Lee Hancock establishes an almost elegiac tone, pacing the film in such a way as to match the unhectic lifestyle of both Morris and the small Texas town in which he lives.\n\n`The Rookie,&apos; like Disney&apos;s previous sports opus `Remember the Titans,&apos; eschews violence, sexuality and bad language completely, thereby garnering the film a `G&apos; rating and making it first class entertainment for the entire family.  There may be nothing much new in it for adults, but `The Rookie&apos; has the skill to make what was old seem somehow new again.  Not unlike what happens to the hero himself in fact."

It was romantic, so much so that if you didn&apos;t believe in destiny before this movie, you will afterwards. Robert Downey Jr and Marisa Tomei&apos;s characters seem so suited to one another, except for the slight problem that he has the wrong name! Any fool could see that they were in love from the moment they met! Love the scene when Downey Jr&apos;s character reads Tomei&apos;s mind about what she is to wear for her date. Audience are practically cursing the screen in hope that Faith and Peter will finally get together. Awesome, magical, glorious!!"

      "reviewBody": "In 1972, writer-director Aldo Lado made two outstanding giallos, THE SHORT NIGHT OF THE GLASS DOLLS (a.k.a. PARALYZED) and this film, which predates Nicholas Roeg&apos;s similar but far more well-known DON&apos;T LOOK NOW (1973).\n\nYoung Roberta (Nicoletta Elmi) arrives in Venice from London to visit her father, celebrated sculptor Franco (George Lazenby). Franco&apos;s estranged wife, Elizabeth (Anita Strindberg), stays in England. After a few days, as Franco is making love to a girlfriend, Roberta is kidnapped. Soon after, her corpse is found floating in a canal.\n\nRacked with guilt, Franco investigates the crime on his own. His chief suspects include a prominent but ruthless businessman, Serafian (Adolfo Celi), and an attorney with a history of pedophilia (Peter Chantel). He suspects both men know more about Roberta&apos;s death than they let on. Meanwhile, though, the killer is always one step ahead of Franco, knocking off everyone who might be inclined to help him.\n\nLado and co-scenarists Massimo D&apos;Avak and Francesco Barilli add many subtle touches to the rather crude story line. For example, Venice itself becomes a character and conspirator, and is photographed as a nearly colorless and malevolent place. Early in the movie, Franco shows his disrespect for the city, offhandedly remarking that &quot;Venice is a dead city,&quot; and wishing it would simply sink into the water. Later, we see that the businessman and attorney, representing the old money and establishment values that run and keep Venice &quot;afloat,&quot; conspire to protect the killer and, indirectly, to &quot;punish&quot; Franco.\n\nNot only is Venice viewed as a deeply evil, it twists -- even in small ways -- the people who live there. In the early minutes of WHO SAW HER DIE?, most of the male characters are shown touching or petting Roberta rather inappropriately. In addition, the local constabulary is extremely lame and inactive. When the bodies start to pile up in the wake of Franco&apos;s investigation, a detective tells him to let the police handle the dangerous work. Of course, they continue to do nothing but in the end take full credit for catching the killer. This conspiracy of silence extends even to the father of a child who was killed in a manner consistent with the way Roberta was killed. When Franco tries to enlist his help, the father acts suspiciously and refuses to get involved.\n\nThe movie&apos;s conspiracy subtext extends to two secondary characters, Phillip and Ginevra, who wish to escape Serafian&apos;s grip but cannot. In the Venetian universe created by Lado and Co., Ginevra is willing to both help Franco find the killer and expose Serafian as indirectly responsible for Roberta&apos;s death. For her trouble, Ginevra is murdered but nonetheless helps Franco get closer to revealing the killer&apos;s identity.\n\nIn and around these rich contextual elements, the giallo aspects of WHO SAW HER DIE seem rather perfunctory. To be fair, however, there are a couple of well done thrill-for-thrill&apos;s-sake stalking sequences, and one creepy moment when Elizabeth, alone in Franco&apos;s apartment, is terrified by bumps in the night that are nothing more than a housekeeper doing some chores. And Ennio Morricone&apos;s excellent score features a purely musical insight into the killer&apos;s tormented mind, a kind of &quot;murderer&apos;s refrain&quot; that is punctuated with calls and cries by a chorus of young female voices.",

      "description": "BEFORE DON&apos;T LOOK NOW CAME WHO SAW HER DIE?\r\nThe mists that wreathe the eerie city of Venice become the hunting ground for a faceless child killer that seemingly cannot be stopped in the taut and brilliant thriller, Who Saw Her Die? directed by Aldo Lado (Night Train Murders).\r\nWhen Franco (in a career-best performance by George Lazenby) loses his daughter to this shadowy elusive murderer he sets off on an unnerving journey of retribution that will bring him to the very edge of his sanity and quite possibly his life too.\r\n\r\nRigid with tense atmospheric style, this film bears an uncanny resemblance in mood to the classic Don&apos;t Look Now but was actually made a year before. Boasting starkly evocative cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo (Il Postino) and a score by Ennio Morricone, Who Say Her Die haunts the mind long after viewing it.\r\n\r\nWho Saw Her Die? (cert. 18) is released uncut (for the first time in the UK) on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment. The film will be presented restored with missing footage and remastered in 2.35:1 with English 2.0 sound. Also included on the disc is a Shameless original trailer gallery.",

      "reviewBody": "For anyone who has either made a grab for the remote control whenever one of those annoying advertisements appear on television,this film may (or may not)interest you. Behind those thirty,or sixty second exercises in video bombast,there are the persons who are responsible (or guilty)for putting them there in the first place. Documentary film maker Doug Pray (Hype,Red Diaper Baby,etc.)directs this informative (and at times,very funny) open window on the talking heads who are behind all of this wretched excess. In a space of 89 minutes,we see the likes of Liz Dolan (a former marketing chief at Nike,who reveals the creepy origins of their catch phrase,&quot;Just Do It&quot;),Dan Wieden,Jeff Goodby,and especially the outspoken George Lois, among others,speak their individual minds on the ins &amp; outs of the advertising business (so now you know who&apos;s photograph to toss darts at). In addition to television &amp; radio ads,we also get to know about other aspects of the advertising game (billboards,which I generally consider,for the most part,an eye sore,not to mention magazines &amp; newspapers,etc.). Don&apos;t get me wrong---I know that products need to get the word out,but they could be done a bit more tactfully (I&apos;ve always considered European advertising&apos;s approach of a whisper gets more attention than a shout--just watch some of the television advertisements that appear on European television the next time you&apos;re over there). This is a documentary that is easy to like, dealing with a subject that some (most?) of us love to hate. Not rated by the MPAA,but contains strong language. Maybe not a good choice for little tykes that are learning to talk (you probably would not want them to blurt out some of the stuff that tumbles out of the mouth of George Lois in mixed company)",

It&apos;s pretty fine for me. I liked this movie because of the ecological sights and also because it&apos;s an innocent movie, good for kids. Kirsten Dunst is great as one of the lost kids in the forest.\n\nThe story is about two kids that have a plane accident. The plane crashes in a forest. After they find out the pilot was dead, they meet a native. This native and his friend bear help them to find the way back to civilization, but some hunters want to ruin their plans because they want to kill the bear. It&apos;s basically this. I give a 6 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "This is interesting sleaze in a lot of ways, mainly because it&apos;s one of those movies that looks like nothing more than cheap, hateful sex trash when there are underlying ideas (even though I will not dare call this an intellectual film by any means). One thing I would like to say is that it is true that some of the things going on here can be viewed as romantic if you view it in a very unconventional way. One of the &quot;rape&quot; scenes definitely seems more like a rough, consensual sex game rather than a brutal, totally forced rape. At the same time, a lot of this can really be viewed more as about a guy (David A. Hess as Alex) who has had some serious female trouble at one point and is so terrified of a woman he loves leaving him that he responds animalistically with hateful, misogynistic acts of rape and abuse so that he can get close to all the women he likes in the only way he knows could work for him, no matter how cruel and damaging it is to anyone else. His companion Ricky is obviously someone who is mentally slow and hated by society, finding friendship only in scum like Alex, who he looks up to like a big brother/mentor type. He is shown to not know any better for the most part, but we know there is good in him when he not only can&apos;t bring himself to violate a woman, but he is also the one who tries to stop the terror from continuing. This leads to a twist ending that I thought was actually surprisingly clever for this type of film. This one&apos;s not quite as good as &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; if you&apos;re going to compare movies with mean David A. Hess characters, but, despite similarities, this film stands up fairly well on its own, in my opinion."

This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. I knew nothing about the movie before renting it. My friends and I just like watching zombie movies some of which are very low budget and we take that into consideration but this was just plain horrible. The mirrored effects sucked to high heaven and they reused them repeatedly. The acting was embarrassing and the plot was not great either. Sheesh this movie set the standard in crappy horror movies. SET THE STANDARD!!! The chunky white trash junkie lead singer in the uber-wannabe band that scored the sad attempt at an action scene at the end was yep you guessed it corny and horrible. My friends and I watch crappy horror movies and laugh but this one was so damn bad we didn&apos;t even laugh because its not funny, its sad. I feel so sorry for the director and any other idiot that got dupped into spending money on this pile of rancid waste..\n\nMark my words people this movie wasn&apos;t even a good attempt to make a low budget movie.

      "reviewBody": "It is an interesting drama/thriller plenty of thrills , taut , intrigue , twists and turns . Jeff Heston (Charles Bronson , though Tony Musante and Jon Voight were considered for the part) is the number one killing people with a bullet whose reputation has caught up with him . After a bloody double-cross leaves him for dead and barely escapes a murder attempt , the professional hit man named Jeff tracks down the shooter and his gorgeous mistress Vanessa Shedon (Jill Ireland , Bronson&apos;s wife , though Sharon Tate was considered and Florinda Bolkan was originally lined up to star) to New Orleans . But when Jeff takes revenge , he finds himself blackmailed by a mobster (Telly Savalas , who does not appear in the movie until about one hour in) wants him to join his organization . Jeff refuses , and is then chased and hunted through an unforgiving city where love is like a serpent or like a loaded gun . \n\nThrilling movie about the very deadly rivalry between two extreme contenders , a double-crossed wealthy murderer , Charles Bronson , betrayed by his girlfriend , Jill Ireland , and a powerful crime boss , Telly Savalas . This crime thriller packs intrigue , suspense , noisy action-packed with exciting racing cars , explosive excitement , thrills and lots of violence . United Artists cut about eight minutes from the Italian version of this film for its American release . The film relies heavily in the complex , inter-relationship between a fiercely independent gunman , a mob boss , and their shared love interest . Bronson is pretty good as a killer sets out to revenge his Femme Fatal woman and the gang boss who put her up to it . He gives his usual stoic acting and displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives , that&apos;s why the debts of vendetta are paid in bullets . It&apos;s certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time , as the spectators were clearly on the Bronson&apos;s side in spite of being a ruthless killer . Bronson as a very professional hit man for a powerful organization offers the sort of monolithic acting , as always . This was one of the first major star teamings of action star Charles Bronson with his actress wife Jill Ireland . Jill Ireland gives a mediocre performance as Jeff&apos;s love interest , but the romance isn&apos;t what this movie is about and director knows his action . Furthermore , it appears a nice secondary cast , such as : Umberto Orsini , Ray Saunders , Michael Constantin , George Savalas , Telly&apos;s brother , and there stands out Telly Savalas who though received second billing , he gives a brief but magnificent acting . It contains atmospheric musical score composed , orchestrated and performed by the great Ennio Morricone , including an unforgettable leitmotif .\n\nThe motion picture was compellingly directed by recently deceased Sergio Sollima , he even choreographed the fight scenes himself because he wanted each character to have a fighting style tailored to their personality . This movie was inspired by Jean-Pierre Melville&apos;s The Samurai (1967). Sergio Sollima&apos;s direction is well crafted, here he&apos;s less cynical and more inclined toward violence and too much action . Sergio wrote and directed all kinds of genres such as Pirate films as ¬®Sandokan ¬® and ¬® Black Corsario¬® ; Peplum : ¬®Rocha¬® , &quot;Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators&quot; , &quot;Triumph of the Ten Gladiators&quot; , ¬®Ursus¬® &quot;Goliath Against the Giants&quot; ; Thriller : ¬®Revolver¬® (1973) ; Euro-spy : &quot;Requiem for a Secret Agent&quot; , &quot;Agent 3S3: Hunter from the Unknown&quot; , ¬®Tanger 67¬® ; being especially known for his ¬®Cuchillo trilogy¬® : ¬®Run Cuchillo run¬®, ¬®Face to Face¬® , ¬®The big Gundown¬®. And this ¬®Violent City¬® is essential and indispensable watching for Charles Bronson fans . This is a satisfyingly violent and thrilling flick that avid fans of the genre will love .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Hunger&quot; opens with the by now familiar Goth anthem &quot;Bela Lugosi&apos;s Dead&quot; by Bauhaus.  Not a bad way to open a vampire film, though nowadays it would seem almost a parody.  &quot;Undead undead undead&quot; indeed.  Enter Cathy and Bowie into a slick, sleek, neon nightclub, filled to the rafters with post-punks &amp; pre-Goths playing dead.  Too bad they weren&apos;t as ready for the real thing as they thought they were.  You see, Cathy and Bowie are vampires.\n\nThis is a visually stunning film, making up for in effects what it sometimes lacks in coherence.  It seems that lovely, immortal Cathy, called Miriam, is a vampire queen who has been around since the Sphinx was built, apparently.  Bowie is her consort, a once mortal man whose two hundred-odd year lifespan is suddenly winding down at a frighteningly rapid rate.  Desperate to find a cure, he seeks out scientist Susan Sarandon, who at first disbelieves Bowie&apos;s claims, but is soon convinced when the young and handsomely androgynous man suddenly ages over the course of a few hours time into a decrepit ruin. Miriam, who has had countless lovers over the centuries, gives Bowie the heave-ho and turns her attention to lovely young Sarandon.   But Sarandon, though initially easy to seduce (in an erotic lesbian scene) proves to have a will stronger than Miriam&apos;s, and Miriam&apos;s habit of keeping her collection of ex-lovers cadavers close at hand, proves to be a mistake.\n\nThis is a strange film, almost as cold and dispassionate as one might well imagine a vampire to be.  It seems to hold the viewer at arms length, not allowing them to experience the emotions of the characters...but the characters, for the most part, are severely lacking in emotion anyway, so the stark emptiness of the film becomes a brilliant mirror.  Some vampire enthusiasts might find this boring and confusing, but it&apos;s a good effort and not a total loss.\n\nThe three main characters are worth watching simply for their amazing beauty and grace.  Tony Scott (brother of Ridley) has made a nice, if somewhat bizarre and chilling, work of art here and, like most works of art, it&apos;s up for interpretation."

The lowbrow laughs don&apos;t last long, however, soon giving way to a much more sober approach, the film focusing instead on Edwin&apos;s confusion and emotional turmoil following his operation.\n\nThis shift to a more ponderous tone serves to make Percy a more respectable movie than it could otherwise have been‚Äîa shame, &apos;cos I&apos;d been looking forward to a huge helping of shameless smut and seriously saucy giggles and what I actually got was that guy from Shelley looking downright miserable (yet again) even when faced with a series of sexy 70s babes desperate for a seeing to.\n\nOne thing&apos;s for sure, Robin Askwith wouldn&apos;t have wasted time deliberating his dilemma when he could&apos;ve been testing out his new todger!",
