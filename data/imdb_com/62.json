Oma travels solo to Rome to get the pope&apos;s blessing for something and finds her granddaughter living with a rocker and working behind a bar in a rather rough café rather than with a nice Catholic family as an au pair (as her mother thinks). (I won&apos;t bore you with the synopsis, as you can read that elsewhere). \n\nThe main ingredients are a few chance encounters and the obvious culture shocks (which may now and then seem a bit contrived) but it&apos;s mainly about human kindness and people trying to get along with each other in varying degrees of success. The over protective Marie is (obviously, again) proved wrong. Oma and her granddaughter are way more laid back and get along just fine. There&apos;s also a nice performance by Giancarlo Giannini who plays a lovable rogue named Lorenzo. \n\nYes, it&apos;s feelgood fluff, but it often made me smile and even laugh out loud a few times. If you are looking for high brow cinema this isn&apos;t it. If you are looking for some good-natured escapism this might just do the trick.",

In fact, Ole Bournedal (writer/director) has recently been tapped to direct Dean Koontz&apos;s novel, &quot;The Husband&quot;. JUST ANOTHER LOVER STORY contains all the elements of classic noir fiction, and incorporates a fresh and modern cinematographic style. The film centers on a man who jettisons his humdrum existence for the love of a mysterious woman. Add amnesia, a murder-suicide, stolen diamonds, The Asian Mafia, and set the action in beautiful Denmark, and you have the essence of JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY. This is not a great film, but it accomplishes every challenge, and is a very positive addition to Danish cinema, and the Film Noir Genre in general.",

      "reviewBody": "When Imitation Of Life came out in 1934, Fannie Hurst was at the height of her literary reputation having had her two best works this one and Back Street, come out back to back as both novels and movies. Both stories are about a women&apos;s sacrifice.\n\nOne day before World War I, Louise Beavers comes looking for domestic work and gets the wrong address and comes knocking on Claudette Colbert&apos;s door. Colbert is a recent widow with a child and Louise has a child the same age. Colbert can&apos;t afford any salary, but Louise is willing to work cheap, just for room and board for herself and her child. \n\nThis starts an unusual partnership both personal and business because Claudette&apos;s late husband was a seller of a cooking syrup and Louise makes a melt in your mouth type of pancake. When passing stranger Ned Sparks tells her one day to package the flour, this makes both Colbert and Beavers millionaires overnight. Beavers can&apos;t see it however and passes up her own household to stay with Claudette.\n\nA lot of people today look at Beavers&apos;s character and say this is a racial stereotype that Hurst was perpetrating. Taking the racial component out of it, I&apos;ve seen several people who are just like Beavers in their own way. Clark Gable had a father who could have lived quite well off his son, but couldn&apos;t deal with the Hollywood lifestyle and actually told his son they ought to resume their previous occupations as oil roughnecks. Stan Musial when he was making big money as a baseball star had a mother who took in washing back in the little steel mill town of Donora, Pennsylvania where he came from and not because he wasn&apos;t willing to provide.\n\nAnd I had an uncle who worked hard at Kodak and also built up a milk delivery business of his own and at an age where he could have just relaxed and taken it easy, he was out working at close to 80 at a tool and die plant. There are folks out there who shy away from the outward trappings of success like Beavers. And there are those stubbornly over-committed to a work ethic when they don&apos;t have to be.\n\nBoth Colbert and Beavers are just moms with problem daughters on their hands. Daughter Rochelle Hudson is crushing out on Warren William who has his eyes on Colbert. But Beavers has bigger problems.\n\nRemember these girls were literally raised together with their mothers in business. Fredi Washington sees the white world, she&apos;s light skinned enough to pass, she wants what&apos;s over in that world. But her denial of heritage hurts Beavers more than my words can describe. But Hurst&apos;s words in the novel and the screenplay betray a rare understanding of racism during her time. \n\nImitation of Life got three Oscar nominations including Best Picture. It&apos;s a dated film, but that fact alone makes it worth watching as a glimpse of the racial picture in America in the Thirties.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Pretentious&quot; seems a popular word amongst reviewers of this thought-provoking film. HOW I wonder would &quot;they&quot; have made it, given the opportunity? I am saved from further contemplation along these lines by the fact that Peter Weir made it.....and rather well, I hasten to add.\n\nA worthy successor to PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK in as much as the viewer is left with his or her own interpretation of what they have just seen. Events occuring in an everyday environment but where the line between fantasy and reality is so blurred, no lens can be found to bring up a sharp focus. It is a disturbing film which highlights and pays homage to the Aboriginal dreamtime.\n\nChamberlain, in one of his best roles (made even better when you reminisce about the celluloid embarrassments BELLS, KING SOLOMON&apos;S MINES and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER) plays a hot-shot Australian attorney (complete with DR KILDARE accent) who is called upon to defend a small group of Tribal Aborigines on what appears to be an &quot;open and shut case&quot; murder charge. Initially he finds his clients anything but co-operative and seemingly disinterested by the threat of the white man&apos;s legal system. Aspects of the case begin to disturb him and he is drawn into a world of ancient beliefs, symbolic half-lives, a very dimension that causes him to question his own comfortable existence and purpose. Central to his dreams is one of the Defendants (brilliantly played by Australian actor David Gulpilil) who appears existentially, perhaps a disembodied spirit (?), holding out to him a sacred stone with ancient cabalistic markings. He learns that the aboriginal man who was killed was the victim of tribal law and that he must not, cannot, intervene.\n\n The nightmare spills over into real-time...black rain, (we have already witnessed hailstones crashing into a tiny outback school from cloudless skies!) water prophetically leaking through his roof and cascading down the stairs. Visions of a great flood. He becomes obssessed with seeking the truth, not only of what is going on around him, but who he is? The scene where he confronts the Head Tribal Elder in his inner city squat is totally chilling. The viewer&apos;s own close and comfortable existence is challenged and put up for re-evaluation here.\n\nEventually and too late of course, he stumbles across the truth. But IS it? Has he been played for a fool?  Has the audience? Much was made at the time of the film&apos;s release, that the final scenes were a total cop-out. I even thought as much myself at the opening night. Amazing what a almost a quarter of a century&apos;s personal development and insight can do for you. Like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, this film needs to be seen at different stages of your life to appreciate what Peter Weir knew and was trying to say in 1977."

This company made some enjoable actioner like Sister of the San-Tung Boxer (1973) and even a Swordplay masterpiece (The Sword, 1971), but this BLIND BOXER is just another in the line of Martial Arts disabled heroes. Actors Jason Pai Piao as the blind fighter and Kao Yuen as the equally blind master, are involved in a ruthless Thai-Boxe contest. Regular Korean martial actor Park Dong Yong (The Korean Connection) plays an henchmen. A very poorly made production filmed in Korea. Average fights can&apos;t help. I rate this a broken 5 just because of Jason Pai Piao and Lou Chun Kou, that starred both in several low-budgeted actioners, including the superior Stranger from Canton (US title Karate killers).",

      "reviewBody": "The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.\n\nFor whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount)decided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was James Stewart&apos;s third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film.\n\nI do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. \n\nDoris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. \n\nDay and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.\n\nFor the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film. Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn&apos;t go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became Doris Day&apos;s theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.\n\nIn fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.\n\nInstead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said it&apos;s not directed, it&apos;s choreographed. You&apos;ll be hanging on your seats during that moment.\n\nThis was remake well worth doing.",

Sissy Spacek gives a terrific performance in the rags-to-riches, true-life story of country music legend Loretta Lynn. Spacek does her own singing in the movie, as does Beverly D&apos;Angelo in the role of Patsy Cline.\n\nBut this lavish, big budget film has more to offer than the great performances of these two actresses. Attention to detail in production design, costumes, and makeup, plus topnotch editing combine to rev up the film&apos;s technical quality. And I loved that soundtrack with all those great country/western songs, including especially &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot; by the wonderful Kitty Wells. All of these cinematic elements render a film that is as entertaining as it is factual.\n\nLoretta Lynn&apos;s story originates in the South; it&apos;s a story rich in emotion and appreciation of simple home values like love, family, and perseverance. Local non-actors are brought into the film in bit parts, and that amplifies the authenticity of her surroundings, especially her Southern roots.\n\nMy only problem with this film is the plot structure. The first fifty minutes could have been condensed. In particular, that part of the film that deals with Loretta&apos;s love affair with Mooney (Tommy Lee Jones), his red jeep, and Loretta&apos;s dad was too long and drawn out.\n\nBut overall, &quot;Coal Miner&apos;s Daughter&quot; is amazing because it presents a true-life success story that was by no means inevitable. All kinds of things could have intervened along the way to stop Loretta&apos;s rise to the top. Her husband was a big help, but she also had talent, and she got some breaks at crucial times. Her journey from rural Kentucky poverty to Nashville mansion thus makes for a gripping story helped along by the nearly perfect performance of Sissy Spacek.",

      "reviewBody": "I spent a good deal of &quot;The Sins of Rachel Cade&quot; confused, wondering whether or not I had already seen it. Or was I mixing it up with &quot;The Nun&apos;s Story&quot; - not hard to do, since Peter Finch, a brilliant, sexy actor apparently was cast in the same part over and over. It seems to me his role in this was similar to his role in &quot;The Nun&apos;s Story.&quot; The story is similar to &quot;The Nun&apos;s Story&quot; and also to &quot;Sister Kenny.&quot; \n\nDuring World War II, Rachel Cade (Angie Dickinson), a beautiful young nurse, goes to the Congo to help in the hospital and to bring Christianity to the people. She meets two men, both of whom are interested in her - Colonel DeRode (Finch) and a downed airman who turns out to be a surgeon, Paul Wilton (Roger Moore). Cade suffers inner conflict as a result, and it changes her life.\n\nI like Angie Dickinson in this - she gives a very simple performance, that of a dedicated spiritual woman with great inner strength, and one who really understands why the people of the Congo love her and respect her. But she&apos;s miscast. To put it bluntly, Dickinson is too hot a number for this role. If she were just beautiful in the Audrey Hepburn sense, she would be believable. But Angie&apos;s always been a sex bomb and how anyone thought she could work in darkest Africa and not spend 99% of her time fighting off men was crazy. Either someone a little older, like Jean Simmons, or with less sex appeal would have been more appropriate.\n\nPeter Finch was very good, very appealing, but I just saw him do this role in &quot;The Nun&apos;s Story.&quot; I&apos;m still confused.\n\nTwo favorites of mine, Woody Strode and Juano Hernandez, are on hand as well and give excellent performances.\n\nThere are certainly interesting aspects to &quot;The Sins of Rachel Cade,&quot; and it has some appeal, but in the end it leaves one feeling a little flat."

By the mid-1950&apos;s, the theater was showing it&apos;s age through years of neglect and declining revenues, i.e. competition from television and general flight of patrons to the suburbs. It was during the late &apos;50&apos;s to the late &apos;80&apos;s that the large picture palaces were vanishing to the wrecker&apos;s ball, and the Roxy fell without a whimper from the public. After showing &quot;The Wind Cannot Read,&quot; in the spring of 1960, the Roxy was closed and demolished in three months. A famous photo exists of silent movie actress Gloria Swanson in an elegant gown posing amid the Roxy&apos;s gloomy ruins; one of her silents opened the Roxy in 1928. A tragic end to a magnificent structure, only 32 years old at the time."

It is a simple visual celebration of the passing of old Lodz (what was left of it from the war) as new building replace the old and new people replace the old. The old are really resentful at being displaced. This expresses itself in the music. The old people, long time workers at the factory, are upset because the factories traditional mandolin band is being, well, disbanded, to be replaced by pop music. Believe me when I tell you that the pop music, taking on all sorts of forms from the kind of euro rock derived from misheard American and British bands to rumba rhythms with corny lyrics. Really the old stuff was great and now its gone. The women of the factory are being pensioned off one by one and they&apos;re all reluctant to leave but leave they must. Of course Lodz is something of an interesting case. A village which was chosen to be the Manchester of the Russian empire it became known as The Promised Land because of the availability of work in the huge textile plants and became the second largest city in Poland. The Polish population was further shaken by the war and virtually no one lives where either their parents or grand parents lived. The turnover has be the one constant of this synthetically created place. Kieslowski is unable to display his nostalgia except reflected from the hard surface of this little gem."

      "reviewBody": "Ever since I saw it on opening day back in 1998, &quot;Bride Of Chucky&quot; has been a personal favorite of mine. I have been a big fan of the &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot; franchise since I was about seven years old, and this movie pretty much sums up everything that makes a Chucky movie great. In this fourth installment, the focus is finally taken off of the saga of Andy Barclay (which was getting a bit played out by the end of &quot;Child&apos;s Play 3&quot;), and instead on Chucky and Tiffany, a previous flame who was with him up until his original death. After Tiffany (played to perfection by the wonderful Jennifer Tilly and her wonderful cleavage) finally gets a hold of Chucky&apos;s remains (basically a trash bag full of Chucky parts [see part 3]) and resurrects him with some strategic sewing, he turns on her and ends up passing her soul into another doll. Together, they hitch a ride with runaway couple Jesse and Jade (Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl) to New Jersey to find a stone that Chucky was wearing around his neck the day he died that will help resurrect them to human form. As you can predict, lots of hectic things happen on this road trip. Blood is spilled, pot is smoked and Chucky does indeed get lucky (in a hilarious and memorable scene that will be burned in your memory forever). Don Mancini, the creator of Chucky, writer of all three previous installments, returns as writer and fleshes out a beautifully demented and imaginative horror comedy. With the flare of director Ronny Yu (who would later go on to direct &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot;), &quot;Bride Of Chucky&quot; is the best installment in the Chucky series thus far. Everything about this movie works. The death scenes are elaborate and somewhat comedic in parts, the music rocks (check out the soundtrack), and the story is so much fun, you just can&apos;t turn away in the 90 minutes this movie spans. Add that to a knock-out ending -- which leads us into the upcoming &quot;Seed Of Chucky&quot; (November 10th) -- and you have yourself the perfect Saturday night horror flick.\n\n10/10"

      "reviewBody": "Crimson Tide is awesome in the way it creates intensity and non-stop adrenaline rushes using scenes full of action, and scenes that aren&apos;t. The torpedo attack with the Russian sub was so fast-paced and packed with energy that it makes you bounce in your seat. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington gave awesome performances, and their growing tension towards each other is enough to keep the excitement at a consistent high through the last half of the film. I don&apos;t appreciate how Hackman&apos;s character is regarded by most moviegoers as a mad man. He is just simply a seasoned, tough-as-nails military officer who must assume that the US is in danger, and he must stick by the orders that require him to go to drastic measures to protect us. The director did a good job at raising the tension, even though the ending was very predictable. The message at the very start of the film set the perfect tone. The entire film is in a way scary by making us wonder if what would happen in a situation like this, and how could the military establish proper operating procedures for it. However, the message at the end of the film re-establishes some hope. 9/10, and I love the creative title.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot; (1998) stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, the daughter of a wealthy commoner in 16th century France. When her father unexpectedly dies, Danielle becomes the servant girl of her arrogant stepmother (Angelica Huston). When she runs into the prince of the kingdom (Dougray Scott), he becomes captivated by her honesty, humility, wisdom and beauty. Meanwhile, her stepmother schemes to have her shallow daughter (Megan Dodds) marry the prince. Melanie Lynskey plays the younger stepsister while Patrick Godfrey plays Leonardo Da Vinci and Lee Ingleby plays Danielle&apos;s guy-friend from her youth.\n\nThis is a quality costume dramedy/romance. Shot entirely in France at no less than four châteaus (castles), as well as some sweet wilderness areas, the film is awe-inspiring just to look at. The story is a little convoluted, so you have to pay attention to keep track of what&apos;s going on. Drew shines as the protagonist and Scott is great as the prince. The movie proves that you don&apos;t have to have overt sex scenes and nudity for a film like this to be effective or successful (which it was at the box office). I also like the message concerning the idiocy of societal classes and how one of the stepsisters is actually a quality soul.\n\nThe film runs 121 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B+",

      "reviewBody": "William Dieterle, like so many of his contemporaries, left Germany in the 1930&apos;s and headed for Tinseltown. He proved himself very adaptable and whilst under contract to Warner Brothers, raised that studio&apos;s prestige by directing a series of well-mounted biopics. Invariably set in foreign climes these studio-bound films were all totally convincing in terms of period and place.\n\nThis biopic of Florence Nightingale is no exception and although considered the weakest of them all, not least by Dieterle himself, it remains a convincing portrait of Victorian England with its squalor and class-ridden complacency regarding the plight of the lower orders and the general view that nursing was little better than prostitution. It is no less effective when switching to the Crimea and the horrendous conditions that prevailed in the soldiers&apos; hospital at Scutari.\n\nHistorically of course it is Hollywood Hokum and full of inaccuracies but it succeeds in its purpose of depicting a truly extraordinary woman and her battle with institutionalised ignorance and prejudice.\n\nDieterle&apos;s customary visual sense is complemented by two stalwarts of Warner Bros, cinematographer Tony Gaudio and the brilliant head of Art Direction, Polish émigré, Anton Grot.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the weak link lies in the casting of Kay Francis as Florence. She was at the time Queen of the Lot at Warner Bros and its highest paid star. This, coupled with her innate classiness would make her the obvious choice. She is certainly not lacking in sincerity and it is not her fault that her part has been written more as a symbol than as flesh and blood which alas makes the character rather one-dimensional. Ian Hunter does his best with another one-dimensional role as a reporter for &apos;The Times&apos; and Donald Crisp excels as the odious Dr. Hunt.\n\nWhatever its shortcomings this version is infinitely more powerful and engaging than that of Herbert Wilcox in 1950 which is little more than a series of tableaux-vivants.\n\nSuffice to say that since her death Miss Nightingale&apos;s achievements and far-reaching influence have been overshadowed by suggestions of misogyny, lesbianism and racism! She remains however a Feminist icon despite her observation that although they might crave sympathy &quot;women have no sympathy and my experience of women is almost as large as Europe.&quot;",

      "name": "sol1218, you&apos;re getting your Labour and Tory leaders thoroughly mixed up!",
      "reviewBody": "Whooaa! Slow down, sol1218 from Brooklyn NY.\n\nThe political scene in the U.K. looked like this: Edward Heath, bachelor leader of the Conservatives, won the election in 1970. He took Britain into the then Common Market in 1973, but called an election in February 1974 when the miners forced him to declare a three-day week.\n\nThe Tory slogan for the election was: Who governs Britain? The result was confused, but the message was fairly clear: Not you, matey. Labour under Harold Wilson took office with a slim majority. Wilson called a second election in October, which he won narrowly, increasing his majority slightly.\n\nHe held a referendum on the Common Market in 1975, which he won by sidelining the extremists of both Left and Right. He ruled until 1976 when he resigned from politics, for reasons which were obscure at the time, but probably because he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&apos;s. It is certainly true that the Right plotted endlessly against him.\n\nJim Callaghan, who had been Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, took over as P.M. and called an election after his full five-year term. (In the U.K. governments normally call elections after four years.) In fact Callaghan was forced to do so because of a move by the Scottish Nationalists. Had he called the election just a year earlier, he stood a good chance of winning, say many pundits.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives had deposed Edward Heath who had lost them two elections, and Maggie Thatcher replaced him as leader. She swept to power in 1979, and as we all know, won the next two elections.\n\nEconomic chaos was the watchword of the day and there were many strikes. The situation in Northern Ireland, which had started simmering with the Civil Rights movement of 1968, gradually deteriorated. The assassinated politician of the film whose name is Nevin, may well represent Airey Neave, a war hero who had escaped from the high-security Colditz Castle, a German-speaking lawyer who had attended the Nuremberg Trials and a hardline Conservative with military and security connections, who was a close adviser of Thatcher. He was blown up outside the House of Commons on March 30, 1979, by the INLA a few weeks before the election.\n\nKen Loach has never made any secret of his sympathies for the Irish cause. His powerful film &quot;Wind that shakes the barley&quot;, which apparently did not make much money in the U.K., had Conservative politicians fulminating about treason and lack of patriotism because of his portrayal of the brutal Black and Tans. The name was given to the ex-British army personnel and (inaccurately) also to the auxiliaries who were sent to Ireland between 1920 and 1921 to crush the IRA and Sinn Fein, but who also attacked and killed civilians. Historians agree, however, that Loach was pretty accurate in his historical recreation. The film also shows the ruthlessness of Irish-on-Irish killings in the Civil War afterwards.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Rogue Assassin",
      "reviewBody": "War undergoes one of those unnecessarily title changes for this part of the world, naming itself after Jet Li&apos;s assassin character Rogue. Billed as &quot;The Ultimately Martial Arts Duel of the Year&quot;, the person who wrote that blurb for Rogue Assassin obviously hasn&apos;t seen many movies, or martial arts ones for that matter, or is plain lying through the teeth. You&apos;d half expect that pitting two action stars against one another will instantly mean box office success by pulling in fans of both Jet Li and Jason Statham, but it&apos;s a downright insult as you don&apos;t see any punches pulled between the two for 99% of the time.\n\nJason Statham actually starred opposite Jet Li in the movie called The One back in 2001, where Li had no decent cinematic opponent to spar with, and had to do so with himself, assisted by CGI. With his movies like Crank and The Transporter doubles becoming guilty pleasures (read: just Statham kicking up a storm without a reasonable story to boot), I&apos;d actually come to enjoy his work choreographed by Corey Yuen (who also does the action choreography here), together with other ensemble movies he starred in, like The Italian Job and Snatch, amongst others. It&apos;s no doubt I&apos;m a fan, but in Rogue Assassin, all he had to show off his fighting chops, was a sequence in a ubiquitous teahouse.\n\nBut Jet Li fared no better too. His Hollywood foray had been more misses than hits, either playing assassins or cops like in Kiss of the Dragon, or be stuck in roles that require little dialogue and only to look bad-ass, like in Lethal Weapon 4, and Cradle 2 the Grave. Or the easiest of all, forget dialogue and kick around like a mad dog - no offense but that&apos;s what he really did in Unleashed (which I thought the notion of it all was rather degrading for an action star). Nonetheless he goes back to a story on warring factions again ala Romeo Must Die, but this time, it&apos;s not between boyz in the hood, but putting Japanese Yakuza and Hong Kong Triads in the streets of San Francisco. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there&apos;s nothing martial arts here. Everything is guns, guns and more guns, with a complimentary sword fight put in, but not between the touted leads. The action sequences, from fights to chases to stunts all looked rather tired and rehashed, with absolutely nothing that will make you go &quot;wow, that&apos;s nothing I&apos;ve seen before&quot;. Statham and Li share no more than 5 minutes together in the same scene, and only at best a minute bashing each other up, in the dark, in a narrow dock warehouse, before launching into more verbal mumbo jumbo.\n\nEverything here is a caricature, and not even a clichéd revelation saved the movie, when it had expected to, except to give some runway to a possible sequel. War/Rogue Assassin reeks of plain laziness, and plays out like a cartoon. In trying to be sophisticated, having to label locales with &quot;The Triad Warehouse&quot;, or &quot;The Yakuza Lair&quot; was just plain hilarious, unintentionally of course. The number of supporting caricatures, some recognizable Asian actors, all fall into the realm of predictability, and the villains are all too smug and too boring. You have HK actor Mark Cheng (from his latest movie Invisible Target) lending his charisma but becoming a laughing stock, John Lone demonstrating he&apos;s still very much being typecast in Hollywood roles, Devon Aoki continuing to be that flower vase who doesn&apos;t look good up close (somehow the cinematic camera dislikes her), and hey, once TV actress from this part of the world, Steph Song, gets a cameo too, spending most of the screen time screaming.\n\nEverything&apos;s pure flash with zero substance. Even in trying to be a little sophisticated in its plot, it decided to allow some plot loopholes to go through an exercise of the implausible, and put in some major character motivation error. But then again, we&apos;re talking about cartoony caricatures here, so that probably won&apos;t matter. It became a victim of its own star casting - you don&apos;t know who you want as the bad guy, and as a result, becomes a below par mediocre, generic action movie that you can stick some other monkeys in and still work.",

Both he and his film deserve high praise. With &quot;Stateside&quot; R. Anselmo brings the audience an intimate story with the ring of universal truth. Jonathan Tucker captures what I would imagine the young Anselmo to be, a young man of honor who grew up to be an honorable adult. I look forward to seeing future films from this talented writer/director, who presents glimpses of his interior with each project and who will meet with continued success telling stories that resonate with audiences."

      "reviewBody": "Say what you will about him, like him or hate him, you gotta admit that Raimi knows the craft. Here, he puts Hitchcock&apos;s methods to good use, decades after the master died, and creates amounts of suspense that honor his memory. The tension is thick and impossible to ignore. This is exciting and engaging, and it&apos;s completely realistic, down to earth and human, to boot. The pace is spot-on, this never outruns the viewer, in spite of being fast and tight, and so much of the relationships and past being told to us through hints, the behaviour and how situations evolve. More thrillers should be like this. This also qualifies as noir and drama. The acting is beyond reproach, there&apos;s not a single performance that is lacking, and I&apos;d say Paxton does pretty good in a lead role. Kudos to Thornton for not turning his part into a caricature. The writing is excellent. I have not read the novel, but I would like to do so. I understand that this isn&apos;t entirely as brutal as the book, though it is disturbing, and, at times, violent. The cinematography and editing are incredible. There is some strong language in this. The story is magnificent, and develops so well throughout. Thank you, Sam, for making an effort, for not just going for the lowest common denominator, and for understanding that it was the build-up - not purely the plot twist at the end - that made Alfred, and his films, such treasure. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director and/or anyone else who helped create it. 8/10",

That&apos;s not my job. I&apos;m here only to give you my impressions on the watchability and impact of this movie. If you love Barbra Streisand (and I do) and you love Jeff Bridges (and I do), you will love this romantic comedy. Both are at their funny, witty, comedic best in this film. Mimi Rogers is gorgeous as Bab&apos;s sister. (Oddly, Netflix has her mistakenly identified as Fran Drescher on its website.) Lauren Bacall is stunningly beautiful - still. Overall, the film has a lot of heart. What I love about Streisand is that she knows her weaknesses and her strengths, and plays both up to much effect in this film, which she directed and, I believe, co-wrote. This is a quintessential &quot;chick flick,&quot; the kind you enjoy on a raining Sunday night with a big bowl of popcorn. If you are in just the right mood for a film that shamelessly exploits your feelings about romance, this one is it. Enjoy."

I can understand sometimes you have to pay the bills (ask Jean Rollin) by making porn, but this could have been made better. What, you ask? Porn? Indeed. This movie seems to have several edits for the domestic and international markets. American releases have had a 77 minute &quot;R&quot; rated cut I believe as well as the 85 minute &quot;unrated&quot; edition. The French version is roughly 85 minutes but will be virtually unrecognizable to most audiences. The first 20 minutes are an extension of Emmanuelle&apos;s &quot;Love Train&quot; movie which we see being screened by Cannes audiences. This 20 minute sequence contains 3 pornographic sequences, which look like they were intended for another film but found their way into Emmanuelle V. (The sex toys on display are those of Borowczyk, I guess to make these scenes &quot;arty&quot;). After these sequences, the film continues in the same way as the American versions except for a porno sequence in the ballet school and a porno lesbian encounter at the sheik&apos;s harem (with more of Borowczyk&apos;s &quot;personal collection&quot;). Monique Gabrielle does not appear in any of the porno sequences, just the softcore ones. The French version has little dialogue, but really, do you care what they&apos;re saying?"

There are the iconic characters (the smart hero and his love/hate girlfriend, the funny hero&apos;s assistant, the divorced hero&apos;s parents, the bad but not so bad guy, the good cop and so on). It&apos;s too much cliché for a single movie for allowing it to be a good one.\n\nThis definitely isn&apos;t a &quot;Top 10&quot; adventure movie.

However, the film never came out. I thought it might have been shelved.\n\nI was glad to see it was indeed playing. In spite of the reviews, I persevered on the strength of the trailer. It seemed to me there was too much talent and pedigree involved for it to actually suck. And you know what? it&apos;s a terrific film with a poignant story. Perhaps lower expectations propped up my perceptions of it, however, it still stands as time well spent.\n\nThe film is based on a true story involving a top columnist at the LA Times, Steve Lopez, played with grace by Robert Downey Jr., who becomes invested in one of his more colourful subjects, Nathaniel Ayers, an accomplished musician overcome by mental illness, now living on the streets of LA portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who rambles his way to a convincing performance.\n\nThe film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn&apos;t lose it&apos;s direction. It doesn&apos;t pander to it&apos;s audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It&apos;s a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.\n\nIt resonates and strikes a chord.",

      "reviewBody": "WAR OF THE SATELLITES is too low budget for it&apos;s subject matter but is still great fun. First of all, you have the great Dick Miller as the lead, a cool score by Walter Greene and pretty good low-budget special effects by Irving Block, Jack Rabin and Louis DeWitt. Basic plot is that aliens take over earthlings in order to sabotage our space program, particularly the satellites. Roger Corman&apos;s strength was making something out of nothing and this film is no exception. He pulls off some neat ideas and manages to make us so interested in the film we forget how silly some of it is. I think it only runs a little over an hour so he gets right down to business. The movie is very fast-paced. I wish someone would take all of Corman&apos;s films for Allied Artists such as ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS and NOT OF THIS EARTH and this one and release them in a big box set with commentary. Are you listening to this Criterion/Voyager? Not likely but I can dream, can&apos;t I? WAR OF THE SATELLITES is hard to find but worth the effort it takes to see it. Recommended for sci-fi fans and Corman/Dick Miller completists.",

With time running out, expert deep sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a visionary Chinese oceanographer (Winston Chao), against the wishes of his daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing), to save the crew -- and the ocean itself -- from this unstoppable threat: a pre-historic 75-foot-long shark known as the Megalodon.  What no one could have imagined is that, years before, Taylor had encountered this same terrifying creature.  Now, teamed with Suyin, he must confront his fears and risk his own life to save everyone trapped below",

      "reviewBody": "This is an attractive and decent entertainment , the tale is inventive as well as epic, and there&apos;s always enough events to keep the spectator interested . Entertaining and funny rendition based on the classic series of the 70s . Amusing movie based on the successful German-Austrian cartoon series , here are correctly adapted on real images . This charming film packs exotic adventures , comedy , noisy action and wonderful outdoors . Long ago, in a small Viking Village called Flake , a little boy , the clever Wickie (Jonas Hammerle) lives a happy life with his parents . The young Viking uses to accompany his father, the chief of their village, and his men on their adventures and often Wickie is the person who uses his wit and instincts to help the men in their times of need . His daddy, Halvar (Waldemar Kobus), is the chief of the Vikings, and would have liked a son a little more valiant and less fearful ; Vickie usually accompanies his dad, and his warriors on their adventures and often is the young who uses his wit and instincts to help the friends in their times of need . Havar orders his underlings to steal a knights convoy . The warriors have to take over but fail to see tiny Wicki being kidnapped with a cargo of Eskimo slaves, who also carry a strange manuscript on the eternal ice palace containing the Norse gods&apos; treasure . Wickie and the Eskimo-slaves are in the slave-carriage but they escape . Yet, chief Halvar is trapped or hopelessly stuck somewhere and kidnapped by the nasty Sven (Gunther Kauffmann) and it&apos;s up to Wickie alone to help them out with his flashes of wit . So, Snorre (Christian Koch) , Tjore , Urobe take Wickie along on their voyages to give him the experience he&apos;ll need to be an actual Viking . Our friends go out to rescue their chief on their ship , the Viking Drakkar, and Vickie aboard as a captain towards the gorge of Odin .\n\nThis fun movie contains adventures , emotion , humor , thrills , fights in Terence Hill-Bud Spencer style and results to be pretty entertaining . The actors are mostly unknown though enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her cartoon counterpart and the performances are adequate . Most actors from first version repeat characters such as the likable Wickie well played by Jonas Hämmerle , Waldemar Kobus as Halvar , Nic Romm as Tjure , Christian Koch as Snorre , Olaf Krätke as Urobe and Günther Kaufmann as Der Schreckliche Sven , among others . Not only did the story convey us to great and funny adventures, it also showed how to solve problems without the use of force . A likable Vickie , he is an ordinary viking boy , he is also not very strong but with his flashes of intelligence saves the day , helping the crew to resolve the numerous problems they suffer . The movie looks and sounds amazing , if it had been a high-budget Hollywood production there probably wouldn&apos;t have been too much of a difference to the product at hand , apart from the addition of some overdone special effects made by computer generator . The music composers Nick Reich and Ralf Wengenmayr composed a magnificent work fitting the original melodies into the soundtrack as well as adding some new ones which really matched the film&apos;s mood. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Christian Rein .\n\nThe motion picture lavishly produced by Christian Becker , Constantine Films and Rat Pack was well and originally directed by Christian Ditter . The flick is as good as the original directed Michael Bully Herbig . Being even more spectacular and thrilling than the first version . Filmmaker Ditter is an expert on children and teen flicks as proved in &quot;French for Beginners&quot; , ¨The Crocodiles ¨and its sequel &quot;The Crocodiles Strike Back&quot; . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable adventure film appointed for children and adolescents and ,of course, for vintage series fonds . Well worth seeing .",

      "reviewBody": "An extremely difficult film to watch, knowing what we know now that the makers of this film did not know then, so many decades ago, about pedophiles / child predators and (if any) treatment. The film&apos;s heart is in the right place - it comes from a place of faith that any mental disease is curable, that every person can be restored to a normal life around vulnerable people with proper treatment, etc. - ideas that we know now, very clearly, aren&apos;t true for child predators, but you have to admire how much the film-makers support mental health services and therapy. But the film&apos;s incredibly outdated ideas and characters committing dangerous actions can make you oh so uncomfortable - like a psychiatrist talking about the seductiveness of prepubescent girls, same psychiatrist condoning his pedophile patient being around a young girl and even giving his patient alcohol, his patient not telling the woman he&apos;s dating, a mother of a young girl, why he was in prison, etc. None of those activities would be tolerable or condoned now - in fact, some would be criminal. On the other hand, the movie remains valid in its accurate portrayal of some pedophiles that know realization of their propensities would incredibly harmful and who are tortured by those inclinations and a lack of cure: Stuart Whitman is remarkable, truly, in the lead role, giving a powerful but, at times, very subtle performance, and is absolutely worthy of his Oscar nomination.",

Sang Hoon meets Yeon-Hue, a high schooler, when he spits on her uniform, Sang Hoon was surprised when Yeon-Hue called him back and stood up for herself, likely due to his experiences with domestic abuse.\n\nSang Hoon and Yeon-Hue spend more and more time with each other, as she gets to know Sang Hoon she grows to think of him as a father, her desire for a father figure likely comes from her own father being mentally ill and you guessed it, violent. \n\nI really don&apos;t want write more about this wonderful film, I really encourage you to watch it for yourselves. If i could compare it to another film it would be American History X as the story lines are very similar, so much so that i got a little deja vu.",

Everything about this movie is just so darn predictable and there wasn&apos;t any funny moments. It&apos;s perverted but fails to get the attention, interest or intrigue the viewers. This movie just didn&apos;t bring any infatuation to the mix or anything really sexy. It just seemed cheesy and weak for the most part. I was bored most of the way through besides the intro that I thought would lead to a fun adult comedy but falters. For a entertaining and funny adult comedy I recommend &quot;Petty Romance&quot; which is a much better adult comedy movie. To be honest besides the cast I don&apos;t know how this movie was a hit and probably did better when it comes to the box office compared to &quot;Petty Romance&quot;.\n\n3.3/10",

      "reviewBody": "Castle of The Walking Dead is the video version of the Constantin Film, Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel, and as such is shortened by approximately 15 minutes from the original. This film, released in 1967, is interesting for several reasons although it is certainly no classic. The careers of Lex (`Tarzan&apos;) Barker and Christopher Lee crossed briefly here and the presence of the lovely Karin Dor (wife of director Harald Reinl), whom readers may recognize from her role in the Fu Manchu films (which also starred Lee) of the same era, added a bit of grace to an otherwise grim story. \tCastle of . . . is an interesting mix of excellent atmosphere hampered by odd editing and sometimes laughable storyline. I was impressed by the sets and grim mood the film projected from beginning to end, and the presence of Lee makes this must see viewing for his many followers. However, this was far from his best work and one wonders if he was not overextending himself during this very busy period in his career. \n\n\tSet in what appears to be 17th or 18th century Germany, Count Regula (Lee) is drawn and quartered for his offenses. 35 years later, his manservant Anatole, (ably portrayed by Carl Lange) initiates a rite to bring him back to life on Good Friday. The good Count requires the blood of 13 virgins for this to be achieved and, you guessed it, Dor as Baroness Lillian Von Brabandt is to be number 13. \tSo the countess, and Barker as Roger Montelise, son of the judge who condemned the count many years before, are duped into visiting Regula&apos;s castle. One of the few scenes in the film which combines outstanding atmosphere with sold story line comes when Montelis and his party are being coached to the castle. A very frightening and disturbing ride it was through a forest of hanging bodies and detached limbs, giving some much needed credibility to a mostly mediocre offering. \tAt the castle, the flow of the story breaks down. Several scripting mistakes are painfully obvious. Two examples: In one scene, Anatole is shot in the chest by Roger&apos;s man and we see a small amount of dark red blood before the bullet hole supernaturally closes. A few minutes later, Anatole cuts his wrist and green blood drips to Regula&apos;s coffin. In another, it is established that the `undead&apos;, Anatole and Regula, cannot bear the presence of a Christian cross in the same room with them. Yet instead of throwing it in his face and escaping, Dor meekly obeys Anatole&apos;s harsh command to remove it from his sight!     \tBut, in the end, the good guys win, vanquishing the risen to life Regula and the evil Anatole. They are taken away by the same coach they came in on and we are led to believe they lived happily ever after. \tCastle of . . . will be of interest to fans of European and/or obscure horror and the previously mentioned Lee cultists. Years ago I viewed the longer version, released under the American title, The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism and the added 15 minutes enhances the story greatly, so find that copy if you can. \tCastle of . . . was another release from InterGlobal Home Video, whom collectors like me owe a huge debt to."

      "reviewBody": "Cheesy, but enjoyable satire is like the poor man&apos;s version of 28 Days Later (2002) with a big chunk of &apos;80&apos;s vibe for flavor!\n\nComet eliminates the worlds population, leaving surviving sisters to fend against a group of demented scientists.\n\nWhile many peg Night of the Comet as a zombie picture, and granted two or three zombies do show up along the way, this film really has much more in common with the old B sci-fi movies of the 1950s. In fact, one could make a good case that the film is meant to be a comical parody of those old schlock films, after all it does have a nice comic book feel! From any view, this is an entertaining film even with its silly moments. It manages to stir up a few chills along with the laughs.\n\nThe films cast is only decent, but their performances do hold their own. The special FX, mostly the zombies, are pretty decent. The music score is composed mainly of electronic tunes that perfect that great &apos;80&apos;s feel!\n\nFor those seeking a bit of fun humor with their horror, Night of the Comet isn&apos;t a bad choice.\n\n*** out of ****",

I&apos;m glad that they brought the first two ninjas back, even though I liked the other ones to. it&apos;s really neat that even though two of them were not in the second one they still can come back in the third one and, again, make it seem like they had been there all along. I love the relationship that they have with each other as brothers, and that they have with their Grandfather. it shows respect and that they care for each other and have fun with each other. All the characters have wonderful qualities and they bring it all together very well, again I thank God for this movie, I think that a lot of familys will enjoy it as I have growing up with it and all the characters:)"

I thought I was getting the definitive account of The Smiths, but as the film began, I began to get a bad feeling right away with the bad morph-dissolve edits in the intro. If there&apos;s any band where there&apos;s little interest in &quot;the other two&quot;, this is it. Most Smiths fans want to see, and hear Morrissey/Marr. (Sorry Andy, and Mike) But Morrissey /Marr aren&apos;t in this film. There&apos;s no archival footage, no interviews, no concert footage. The photos they do show are the ones we&apos;ve seen before, and perhaps the biggest crime of all, NO SMITHS MUSIC! Probably because the filmmakers couldn&apos;t obtain the rights, among many other things. For a die hard SMITH fan, you could probably get all the info you want on the band from YouTube. It&apos;s got all the videos, old live performances, and interviews, making this documentary pointless and a time waster.",

      "reviewBody": "Silly post-apocalypse road movie is amusing enough to give it some sort of cult status, even though it&apos;s really not that good. The actors giving the better performances tend to get less screen time. One can see that the filmmakers, led by director Jack Smight, are clearly working against the limits of special effects technology at the time, rendering this more of a cheese fest than anything else. Those light shows in the stormy skies ARE pretty trippy, though. Pacing is adequate enough; this runs a scant 92 minutes long. But that makes one wish that more could have been done with the source material, a novel by Roger Zelazny (adapted for the big screen by Alan Sharp (&quot;Night Moves&quot; &apos;75) and Lukas Heller (&quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;)). The movie is modestly diverting, but also disappointing.\n\nWWIII causes complete devastation throughout the continental United States. A team of Air Force personnel who have designed ultra cool tanks / vans dubbed &quot;Landmasters&quot; decide to take the safest path possible (which one of them has named &quot;Damnation Alley&quot;) to Albany, the only place from which they&apos;ve ever received a radio signal. The characters include domineering tough guy Denton (George Peppard), cheerful Tanner (Jan-Michael Vincent), leading lady Janice (Dominique Sanda), easygoing Keegan (Paul Winfield) and teenager Billy (Jackie Earle Haley).\n\nThe odd lack of continuity creates some guffaw-inducing WTF moments; watch as switches are made from real people to dummies. The visual effects can charitably be described as negotiable. Still, there&apos;s some fun to be had in seeing giant scorpions super imposed on the desert settings. And if people aren&apos;t squirming from seeing those, there&apos;s an onslaught of killer armour-plated cockroaches that make quick work of one poor guy. Hell, there&apos;s even a bunch of survivalist rednecks (led by Robert Donner, who sports a hilariously ridiculous looking beard) with which to contend.\n\nCo-starring Kip Niven (&quot;New Year&apos;s Evil&quot;) as another of the military guys, this also features Murray Hamilton in a noticeable but non-speaking uncredited role.\n\nAt the very least, this has some decent widescreen photography by Harry Stradling Jr. and a typically excellent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nThis is one of the rare cases where it would be interesting to see somebody attempt another version of the tale.\n\nSix out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Getaway&apos; is Sam Peckinpah in gun for hire mode making a commercial heist-gone-wrong/lovers-on-the-run movie. He tried to do something similar later in the Seventies with &apos;Convoy&apos;, but that one strayed too far into studio compromise and was nowhere near as successful on an artistic level. Even though one gets the feeling that the movie&apos;s star Steve McQueen was calling the shots, Peckinpah still manages to add some of his trademark flamboyant violence and moral ambiguity to what is, let&apos;s face it, essentially an action movie. And I must say it is a very good action movie at that, and one many directors today working in this often tired and lazy genre could learn a thing or two from concerning suspense, drama and genuine excitement. The less you know about Jim Thompson&apos;s original novel the more you will enjoy this movie. Walter Hill (future director of &apos;The Warriors&apos; and &apos;Southern Comfort&apos;) takes most of the basic plot, but leaves out the brilliant final chapter set in the hellish criminal haven El Ray. Apparently this was at the insistence of Steve McQueen who thought it too depressing. I also would guess that McQueen influenced Hill to alter the character of Doc McCoy from the book&apos;s charming sociopath to a more traditional tough-but-still-fairly decent career criminal. Maybe McQueen felt more comfortable pulling that style off, which is odd because he showed a lot more depth in Peckinpah&apos;s low key &apos;Junior Bonner&apos;. In this one respect &apos;The Getaway&apos;s inferior 1990s remake was closer to Thompson&apos;s original spirit by casting Alec Baldwin in the same role. Anyway, if you forget about the book, and accept this movie for what it is, and not what it might have been it is a taut and impressive thriller. McQueen and the beautiful Ali McGraw (then husband and wife) show some real chemistry and are consistently watchable. Peckinpah uses many of his regular dependable character actors (Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor) to support them, including a first rate Ben Johnson (&apos;The Wild Bunch&apos;) in an uncharacteristically nasty role. Al Letteri (&apos;The Godfather&apos;) also impresses as McQueen&apos;s conniving colleague, Slim Pickens (&apos;Dr Strangelove&apos;) as a helpful old geezer, Sally Struthers (&apos;All In The Family&apos;) as a blonde bimbo, and the underrated Richard Bright (&apos;Vigilante&apos;, &apos;Crimewave&apos;, &apos;The Godfather&apos;) has a scene stealing bit as a con-man who bites off more than he can chew. &apos;The Getaway&apos; is by no means Peckinpah&apos;s most interesting or impressive movie but it is solid entertainment that is hard to beat, and should be watched by any self-respecting Seventies movie fan."

      "reviewBody": "This is a really good film, one of the most realistic films about drugs and the criminal underworld I&apos;ve ever seen. The film examines a week in the life of a mid-level drug dealer on the streets of Copenhagen and pulls no punches.  Kim Bodina gives a great, nuanced performance as Frank, the dealer and main character.  He captures perfectly the snaky charisma, emotional detachment and nihilism of a street dealer.  Frank is essentially a sociopath, turning on the charm when it suits him and turning a blind eye on the people in his life when they can&apos;t be of any use to him.  Especially effective is the portrayal of Frank&apos;s relationship with Vic, the high priced call girl he obviously cares about but can&apos;t bring himself to get physical with because of his emotional coldness.  Frank blames this dilemma on her work, suggesting he can&apos;t touch her because she&apos;s a whore.  However it&apos;s Vic he always turns to when things go bad.\n\nAnd things go very bad very quickly for Frank.  Through a series of miscalculations and bad luck, he finds himself indebted to a slimy dealer higher on the food chain who&apos;s patronizing attitude barely conceals a violent streak.  As the week progresses, Frank spirals downward into a desperate attempt to fix his broken life.  Trusts are broken, violence and mayhem ensue, and the film finishes on a surprising but perfect note.\n\nThe director, Nicolas Winding Refn, shows a good command of pacing and camera work.  The real star of the film, however is the script.  There is never a moment of Pusher that doesn&apos;t seem utterly real.  Though many may find this film dark and depressing (I won&apos;t argue), I think it&apos;s strong acting and excellent direction make it well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "House II: The Second Story (no pun intended, I&apos;m sure) is a great example of lighthearted horror. I&apos;ve loved this movie since I was a kid. I applaud Ethan Wiley, who also wrote the original, for making a sequel that is good enough to carry on the House name. A lot of people are blown away by the fact that this movie has nothing to do with Roger Cobb or his house. But what they were trying to do with this series was to inspire an anthology of haunted house movies, and not staying with the same house. Although having nothing to do with the original, House II still manages to continue its inventive legacy. For example, look at the scene where the cupboard pops open to reveal an ironing board. That&apos;s a conventional horror scare tactic and yet, it&apos;s not a cat that popped out. It&apos;s more creative than most genre pictures. Another tradition they seemed to maintain was having a Cheers cast member in the film. This time it&apos;s John Ratzenberger. Did you ever think you&apos;d see Cliff Clavin fighting amazon warriors? House II is a very funny film too. There&apos;s more comedy in this one, but it&apos;s not over the top.\n\nThe cast helps to make the comedy work. Royal Dano gives a great performance as the kindhearted Gramps. He plays the funny parts just right, and has those sad eyes in other scenes that make you feel sorry for his character. The comical tag team of the heroes, Arye Gross (Soul Man) and Jonathon Stark (Fright Night) works well. But what in the hell is Bill Maher doing in this movie? And why wasn&apos;t he killed? The best lines of dialogue are between Jonathon Stark and Bill Maher:\n\nMaher: &quot;Who&apos;s your friend, Bozo the Clown?&quot;\n\nStark: &quot;No, Bozo the Death Machine.&quot;\n\nAnd I can&apos;t forget to mention Harry Manfredini&apos;s score. It holds the movie together no matter what scenario you&apos;ve just been thrown into. House II deserves more respect than it gets because it&apos;s a good horror/comedy (which is rare)...and your kids can enjoy it too.\n\nNote for genre buffs: Kane Hodder was the stunt coordinator for House II and did a cameo as the gorilla guy. Dwier Brown, who plays Clarence, appeared in the first House as the Lieutenant in the Vietnam scenes."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not a film critic, just a 56 year old viewer; call me the common man that&apos;s not too common. I&apos;ll just use words that everyone understands, since I don&apos;t know all the others. What this film did for me is it brought back the feel of the late 50s / early 60s, you know, when there used to be a few morals left. Some of you may remember those days. You could see this throughout the whole movie, the way they talked, dressed and acted toward each other. Even the city and the cars and the mailboxes on the corner (remember those?) in the opening scene, everything was bright, clean and wholesome. The atmosphere at Lake Wakapougie(?) was clear and made you wish you were there too. Even in the lodge: No one had tattoos, no men were wearing earrings. Can you imagine that?! No men with long hair? No Mohawks? Is this legal?! No one weighed 350 pounds and looked like a World War 3 surviving shopper in Walmart. Just a nice, easy to follow, fun and relaxing movie complete with great background music that fit it perfectly, sweet and calm. What a contrast to what we have now. If the film were to be made now, Rock would probably have been a drug smuggler and would have had a long bedroom scene with everyone of the stars in the opening scene, complete with as much swearing as they could possibly have stuck in there just to make sure the movie would go over. I mean, they do have to sell movies, right?! Do I exaggerate? What do you think? This is the main reason I like this film so much. It&apos;s just a nice, sweet and wholesome film about a guy and girl who accidentally fall in love through a great setup. Yet the people aren&apos;t perfect, neither is the film. I haven&apos;t found a perfect one yet. The only semi-negatives I could find, were the obvious tie-attached-to-Easy scene, yet it was funny.(I missed how that happened until I backed up and watched it again...if you recall, people in the movies back then couldn&apos;t do that) also, there is a time sequence I didn&apos;t get. Abigail calls Roger at, I think, 2 in the morning, yet everyone is still up like it&apos;s 10PM at night! ... The guys at the bar who also have to be up in 3 hours for the competition, John Screaming Eagle... everybody except Roger. That&apos;s another thing I thought was a little strange although it added comedy to the film. John Screaming Eagle is always keeping an eye on Roger&apos;s &apos;happenings&apos;. Even at 2AM? and no one is even yawning, they&apos;re raring to go like they all just got up! ha ha. I sure can&apos;t do that. Not at 2 in the morning. All in all though, what a great film. and yeah, I saw the other films the were mentioned, like &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. I&apos;ll take this one over that one, although I liked &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; as well. What made a lot of the older films great was great dialog, great direction, great story lines. grate acting and fresh ideas. This has almost entirely been replaced in today&apos;s movies with massive swearing, constant drugs, rotten personalities, sex, sex, sex. Yes, today&apos;s films are truly designed for today&apos;s people. I guess the studios still know what they&apos;re doing after all!",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no way for me to talk about this film without making it personal. I can recall the age of eight, wandering around the square desert of my parents&apos; backyard, action figures in hand, thinking up stories, doing voices. Tideland plays to that sort of nostalgia, but it balances it with a darkness visible on the horizon that cancels out whatever baser desires such nostalgia plays to. I imagine when I see the film&apos;s landscape (and the house)how wonderful the setting would have been to that sort of play, how much such play could benefit from that setting, and how lost one could get in it all. Permanently lost. The fields transforming into a sea is a great metaphor for that.\n\nTideland is a tragedy. We, the audience, know or suspect that Jeliza-Rose isn&apos;t going to turn out well after this movie&apos;s over, that her imagination may be keeping her alive and marginally sane, but it&apos;s out of desperation (and it&apos;s clear that she understands much more of what&apos;s going on than is explicitly stated - observe her knowing looks, as in the scene where Dickens leaves her alone), that the little girl is going through so much for relatively little. In a way this film is about what many viewers incorrectly believe Gilliam&apos;s Brazil to be about: the triumph of the imagination. But, if anything, in Brazil Sam Lowry&apos;s imagination is what causes the trouble to begin with, and in the end is his last resort. In Tideland, imagination is defeated. In the end it&apos;s like one of those horror films where the heroine survives all, only to be shown walking away with the monster/killer still behind her/in her house/in the backseat of the car/etc. But there&apos;s an emotional resonance here that can&apos;t be found in, say, Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street because Jeliza-Rose has no literal fate, has no death but life. She returns to the real world. And I suppose that&apos;s the tragedy.\n\nThis is Gilliam&apos;s most complete film since Brazil; it has an emotional quality, an imaginative quality, and a GENUINE quality that no other Gilliam film has, and which few other films, period, have these days (cinema as it is now being so choked with irony). With Brazil we may be tempted to cry at the end if we are quick to tears, but with Tideland we may be tempted to develop tears anywhere. It reminds me of Forbidden Games, of Spirit of the Beehive, of Truffaut&apos;s Small Change, of Renoir&apos;s The River, of The Wizard of Oz, of Curse of the Cat People, and in some ways of Ford&apos;s How Green Was My Valley. It has pedigree.\n\nFerland&apos;s performance is nothing short of supernatural. She carries the film when it wanders or when it becomes flat out strange. She is that human voice in the wilderness.\n\nNot that there aren&apos;t some problems. The accents are fairly ridiculous all of the time and all the supporting characters are Gothic caricatures with performances to match, but then this is a child&apos;s world and a child&apos;s field of vision, and so I can accept these. The point is that reality doesn&apos;t much enter into it. There isn&apos;t much plot to speak of and this turns up in a few draggy sections. But this film has an absorbing quality too, and I find that if I turn it on I am compelled to watch all of it.\n\nI keep thinking of Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, which was so critically lauded while Tideland was so despised. PL&apos;s an okay movie, but it&apos;s a cynical adult tale of childhood, detached in its understanding and sort of heartless and cruel. The problem is that there is such an obvious disconnect between reality and the imaginary world. They exist separately. Of course, the Spanish Civil War setting is really no more real that Ofelia&apos;s own world, no less cartoonish than the world of Tideland. But it tries so hard to be harsh and gritty. It is just so difficult for me to *buy* Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, to take it seriously OR to NOT take it seriously. Tideland is a story about a real person living in a believable (or at least buyable)world. And I suspect that this is why Pan&apos;s Labyrinth is so critically lauded while Tideland is so critically despised - because it is unwilling to offend. Also, where PL is unfathomably ugly, Tideland is quite beautiful.\n\nOverall, this may the only film of last year I can honestly say I liked, that made me feel anything for it. So it&apos;s good.",

Obvious in its attempts to tug at the heart-strings of romantics with all the expected Italian stereotypes and cliches, this flick received mixed reviews and will resonate most with more mature sentimentalists.

Villains want to catch Santa and steal Christmas back and stop the elves from making the presents.\n\nA few of the children in the film are not particularly likable, I was not sure if they were a boy or girl, but very clichéd. The boy&apos;s dad was a little odd too and the two main children were about 10 going on 17. The nutcrackers were the most peculiar characters I have seen in a while. \n\nBut all in all it was entertaining enough. Santa&apos;s caravan was magical and beautifully portrayed as were the two elves and Yuleland.\n\n4/10",

      "reviewBody": "Jancso&apos;s movies can be recommended only to people with serious interest in movie-making and especially alternative European cinema. As in &quot;Szerelmem, Elektra&quot; Jancso again uses his favorite images and sounds. Hundreds of extras dance and perform rituals on the vast Hungarian plain surrounded by galloping horses (a traditional Hungarian animal as the Hungarians are heirs of the nomadic Huns). Very often the viewer is confronted by naked women walking around, I am still confused as to what they symbolize...that socialism needs no violence to overtake the old regime? Another typical feature is the solemnity with which the actors converse and act, no real dialog is to be found but a series of monologues. These monologues reveal what Jancso is most interested in - socialism and the equality of people. It is difficult for the viewer to keep up with them as they follow one after the other to bombard him with socialist ideology on the rights of the workers, the rising of the masses, the resistance, etc. Jancso tries to show that socialism can peacefully convert even the officials of the old order as seen by the officer refusing to suppress the mutineers and the soldiers dancing with the crowd towards the end of the movie. Regarding the lengthy monologues on socialism, a resemblance to Godard and his La Chinoise...? \n\nThis movie is difficult to watch due to its complex imagery intertwined with the socialist ideology that Jancso&apos;s characters devour us with. There may appear the question whether this movie can be seen out of the context of a life in a regime glorifying socialism (Hungary between 1945 and 1989). For anyone interested in movie-making by Hungarian directors, I recommend first starting with Szabo&apos;s films such as Mephisto, Oberst Redl and Sunshine, then going through Bela Tarr&apos;s movies, and finally trying Jancso.",

The astronauts become threatened by a weird , vicious life force as well as indiscreet , slimy aliens that embark upon a killing spree in the base and spaceship . They are unexpectedly devoured by hungry , vicious aliens intent on picking off the astronauts one by one . And an ominous monster in the form of a giant worm ; it is , in fact , a carnivorous , ominous maggot and is enormously spooky when the large slug eats a beautiful nude scream girl or when another young woman explodes . The picture contains an interesting twist at the ending.\n\nIt&apos;s a formula terror space film with tension , shocks , grisly horror , including some decent scares , graphic gore abounds and results to be quite entertaining . A lot of the special effects shots involving live actors combined with matte paintings and miniatures were done in camera . At the movie appears known actors with a future long career : The recently deceased Edward Albert (Butterflies are free) , Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger) , Zalman King (a notorious director of erotic films) , Ray Walston (famed comedy actor) and Grace Zabriskie (famous secondary actress) and Sid Haig (usual as baddie and blaxploitation genre) , the latter asked Roger Corman if he could play Quuhod as a near mute instead Corman agreed and let Haig portray Quuhod with almost no dialogue as Haig only says a single line in the whole movie . The visual production design by subsequently successful James Cameron creates a vivid sense of claustrophobic doom , enhanced further by the eerie musical score . \n\nThis disturbing and dark film was produced by Roger Corman with his New Word Pictures and tensely directed by B.Clark who managed to create shocks , generous violence and exciting horror sequences . According to Roger Corman , the film was budgeted at approximately $700,000 . The film went into production in the spring of 1981 at the Hammond Lumber Co. lot in Venice, CA, where New World&apos;s studio facilities were located. Additional sets , including the surface of the planet and the exterior of the pyramid , were built at a soon-to-be demolished Bekins Storage facility . David DeCoteau got his first Hollywood movie job working as a production assistant on this film , he was only 18 years old at the time. And followed by ¨Forbidden world¨ by Allan Holzman with Jesse Vint and Scott Paulin . It&apos;s a standard terror graphically gory, giving a paranoid dimension and turns out to be an ¨Alien¨ exploitation film , being a sloppy attempt to cash on this hit smash.",

It&apos;s also a wellmade film with a fun (yet dated) soundtrack. The infamous UK censors cut over 30 min. of the running time, so get the uncut version!\n\nA must for Francophiles!"

      "reviewBody": "This &quot;tragicomedy&quot; written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet, its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed).\n\nIn an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade, a looming war decides the passengers&apos; behaviour. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who&apos;s plowed the road give a real-life performance).\n\nThe spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into nation&apos;s collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. Using a simple movie language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy.\n\nBrilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan&apos;s feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: &quot;Maratonci trce pocasni krug&quot;, &quot;Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota&quot;, and my other director&apos;s favourite &quot;Davitelj protiv davitelja&quot;).",

      "reviewBody": "BUSTER KEATON, in his silent film comedies, was a forerunner of the type of comedian later embodied by the clumsy antics of WOODY ALLEN or RODNEY DANGERFIELD.\n\nThis is especially true of COLLEGE, in which our hero is a man who wants to impress his sweetheart with his athletic abilities--and seems to fail miserably. It&apos;s a theme that was handled with a bit more finesse years later when Dangerfield went BACK TO SCHOOL (&apos;86) and tried making his own distinct impression.\n\nBut Keaton, of course, has his moments even if they aren&apos;t the most inspired bits of nonsense in his repertoire. The plot is simple enough--he has a girlfriend who prefers brawn over brains and is insulted when he blasts athletics in his graduation speech as the school&apos;s brightest bookworm.\n\nHe follows her to college and intends to prove he can handle athletics as well as books. Most of the gags that follow are not as screamingly funny as they&apos;re meant to be--mildly amusing is what I made of most of the film. And the politically correct will not be wild about his impersonation of &quot;a colored waiter&quot;.\n\nSorry, but there was too little plot to really engage my interest and I was bored long before the rowing crew ending. I definitely enjoyed Buster more in some of his other outings.\n\nNonetheless, we do have Keaton and Chaplin today, as Robert Osborne pointed out--and both of them have their following and cult status among a lot of the younger viewers. It&apos;s just that COLLEGE is not among Keaton&apos;s best work, in my opinion.",

It&apos;s not a lot of fun to watch. The fact I watched it three times tells you it&apos;s pretty darned good.\n\nLiam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. Natasha Richardson also adds to this unique story. \n\nI would definitely recommend this film to first-time viewers but be wary it&apos;s different and not always pleasant to see and hear. I don&apos;t want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort.",

The subject matter is very interesting from the Upton Sinclair days of the early 1900s through the horrible Triangle fire.\n\nThey work through the Great War and into the Depression. Prior to WWII, FDR rallied the NRA, AFL and others.\n\nThe ILGW union was eventually founded. Working conditions improved.\n\nThe film was just boring. I tried to be interested in it, but just could not. The synopsis said that several Broadway stars helped out with this film, but I saw no evidence of any acting, writing or directing skills.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Air Guitar Nation&quot; is probably the best documentary ever made about a non-subject. Air Guitar, for those unfamiliar with the term, is the art of playing heavy metal guitar sans the actual guitar. It&apos;s what every spastic, tone-deaf teenager with dreams of one day becoming the next Jimi Hendrix has done in the privacy of his own bedroom since the late 1960&apos;s. Who could ever have imagined that a whole subculture and cottage industry would one day spring up around an activity that most of us probably never admitted to doing even to our closest buddies?\n\nYet, that is exactly what has happened, and in its rise to semi-&quot;respectability,&quot; Air Guitar has gathered unto itself a bevy of impassioned, hardcore fans who see nothing crazy in cheering on a wannabe guitarist as he mimics the moves of actual music-making immortals like Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton on stage. Indeed, the Air Guitar movement even boasts its own roster of revered icons and pioneers and has established well-attended competitions on the local, national and international level as a means of showcasing its finest talents and garnering itself some much-needed publicity. The movie follows two of the key figures in the field, C-Diddy and Bjorn Turoque - each with his own very different hard rocker persona - as they head to the 2003 Air Guitar championship held in Oulu, Finland.\n\nThe basic charm of &quot;Air Guitar Nation&quot; lies in its ability to acknowledge the silliness of the whole concept while, at the same time, evincing a genuine, heartfelt affection for both the activity and those who participate in it. Indeed, far more time is spent getting to know the &quot;musicians&quot; as people than in watching them actually perform. What is most striking about the young men is just how reserved, shy and self-effacing they are by nature until they take to the stage and simply cut loose with all their wild gesticulations and antics at the behest of the adoring crowd. It is then that they become truly transformed, so much so that even the most cynical scoffer may find himself caught up in the spirit of the moment, sweating out the contest&apos;s ultimate outcome right along with the participants. The men also face their inexplicable status as celebrities with a clear-eyed rationality, not taking themselves or their accomplishments all that seriously (their satirical names alone reflect that playful spirit), a fact that makes the whole thing at least palatable for those who still may not quite &quot;get it&quot; even after the closing credits have rolled on by.",

Things have their place and reason. It may get uncomfortable a couple of times, but it&apos;s  always good to know that images can still affect us, other than just inducing into eating, shopping or masturbating.\n\nThough the greatest part of this film is just how naturally strange it really is, and the great sense of humor that comes along with the whole thing. It&apos;s an extreme comedy, but they don&apos;t waste the poo jokes like the silly American Pies, they actually defecate. And, anyway, the narrative doesn&apos;t lose it&apos;s focus. The thing begins and ends as it&apos;s due.\n\nIn these times of controversial conservatives, where the J-Los gross billions on their buttocks but find it humiliating to bare a nipple on film, it&apos;s good to see that there were once different people doing different things, not really caring if their nipples were to show, if they had to drink a little urine or vomit on screen."

      "name": "Not a sharp or acerbic satire but more of a gently mocking comedy that has laughs and a consistently enjoyably tone",
      "reviewBody": "Nick Naylor is a talented man who is employed as one of the top spokesmen for &quot;Big Tobacco&quot;. Sure he has to keep the alleged &quot;truth&quot; about the health effects, contributing to the death of 1200 people each and every day, but he&apos;s got to pay the mortgage just like the rest of us. He is separated from his wife but still wants to be a role model to his son while also pursuing his chosen career. Summoned to meet with The General (one of the last great tobacco barons), Nick is put in charge of pushing through new ways of promoting smoking while also defeating a push by Senator Finistirre to put a skull and crossbones on the front of every cigarette packet sold in the country.\n\nIf the plot summary sounds like this film has a definite narrative flow to it then I&apos;m sorry for misleading you because, although it moves in a certain direction, it isn&apos;t that tight a story. It probably didn&apos;t help either that I had literally been in a different cinema watching Dr Strangelove an hour before I watched this film because this was never going to be able to compare (no matter what the current IMDb rating says!). The comedy isn&apos;t that sharp and in terms of satire this is about as mean as a poodle. This lack of teeth is evident from the very start where the opening credits are kind of cool, comic and fun; in the same way the comedy is cool, funny, enjoyable but not really something that rips into its subject with an acerbic wit that I expected. Part of me was thinking this at times that this was a problem but then I realised that it actually wasn&apos;t that big a deal.\n\nThe reason is that, sure it ain&apos;t a sharp satire, but it is a fun comedy with a general swagger and a great ear for dialogue. The story wanders and tends to go off in directions that it drops or doesn&apos;t follow through, but by staying with Nick at least we have a focal point that is interesting and engaging. I did have a bit of a problem swallowing Nick&apos;s sudden massive lack of professional judgement and the fact that it is a key part of the plot made the film seem to stall for a while, but such moments were mostly covered by the pace and energy of the majority. The targets are easy but the manner of writing produces a great feel of mocking them from the inside rather than being outside throwing stones. The &quot;gentle mocking&quot; approach takes away the edge but it makes the film easier to enjoy. It has a steadily amusing air to it while also throwing in lines, characters and touches that made me laugh out loud. Reitman may not be the future of satire but he can certainly do comedy and this film is all the better for this work as director and screen writer.\n\nThe cast is deep and everyone gets a piece (albeit mostly small pieces). The film belongs to Eckhart who has proved (Company of Men etc) that he seems to find it easy to play characters whose moral compasses are way off. He is as charming as he is soulless and he is a delight to watch  a major force in the film being as engaging as it was. The support cast includes some real heavyweight names such as Duvall, Bello, Elliott, Holmes, Macy, Simmons, Lowe and others. Generally the quality is high but I found the presence of Holmes to be a distraction and her &quot;fully clothed&quot; sex scenes to be pretty laughable  her lack of genuine sex appeal and chemistry here made her part of the plot much harder to buy.\n\nOverall then this is not the sharp, acerbic satire that some reviewers would have you believe it is  it simply hasn&apos;t got the teeth or the balls for that. But this shouldn&apos;t matter too much because what it does do is produce a consistently fun atmosphere that is cynical without wandering away from being pretty mainstream in delivery. The cast are mostly very good but Eckhart dominates with a great lead role while the material keeps the laughs coming on a fairly regular basis."

Having said all that and even with the director stating that he wasn&apos;t trying to copy or imitate Hollywood movies, you would be excused if you feel a bit differently. Although nudity would be a bit of a no go there (at least in the bigger blockbuster movies).\n\nA lot of action, a lot of characters in the mix, but still makes sense and a story that is easy to follow. I recently watched the Directors cut of the movie. The newly inserted scenes stood out - because of the inferior quality (video). But the scenes overall really fit in. Also since they are so distinguishable, you can understand what the movie looked like in the shorter cut. Most apparent in one scene early on, where the normal cut showed the main character with a band aid and you just didn&apos;t know or got an explanation where he got it from. You will in the longer cut. Movie works either way, but it&apos;s a nice addition and adds to the whole experience.\n\nVery well made and really well played - not just for a German movie.",

      "reviewBody": "A mysterious object enters the airspace of a military base in California going at a tremendous rate of speed. A team is sent out to investigate. It turns out to be one of the Viking landers from that we sent to Mars. How did it get back to Earth? Why is it here? Is there a big nasty alien that&apos;s going to end up popping out of our chests if we touch it? While the last question is a bit of a joke relating to the obvious Alien (1979) influences on Lifeform (aka Invader), it&apos;s no secret that the film involves, well, an alien lifeform. What seems to be more of a secret is the film&apos;s existence and the fact that it&apos;s pretty good.\n\nAn obviously low-budget affair, writer/director Mark H. Baker overcomes this limitation with a smart, well-constructed story, plenty of sci-fi horror tension, and fine performances (including from an amusingly young Ryan Phillippe). A lot of the budget appears to have been spent on building the Viking replica, the costumes/military accoutrements for the human cast, the creature costume and special effects. It was money well spent. The effects are amazing for such a low budget film. The creature costume is as good as most big studio efforts, the Alien-style cocoons and eggs are well done, and there is a great, visceral autopsy scene.\n\nExcept for exterior location, Baker wisely keeps all of the action in a nondescript government facility. &quot;Nondescript&quot; may not sound very attractive visually, but it&apos;s believable. That&apos;s how government facilities look. Besides, Baker is skilled enough to make it interesting visually. The bulk of the plot is divided into two modes: (1) figuring out what the Viking lander and then the alien are doing there, and (2) &quot;monster&quot; chase and attack scenes.\n\nBaker gives us fantastic sci-fi writing for both. We have a team of bright, multi-dimensional scientists examining the lander from a &quot;hard science&quot; angle, with dialogue that&apos;s not gobbledy-gook yet that&apos;s easy enough to understand. They propose intelligent theories and make intelligent moves. As the military becomes more involved and we begin to enter more of an action/horror sci-fi mode, Baker doesn&apos;t have his characters leave their brains at the doors. They develop an Alien-like sulfur detector to find the monster, and they have insights into its behavior that help them.\n\nStill, the material is very suspenseful at times, and it is consistently captivating. There are clever subtexts. One is keyed to an important piece of dialogue--&quot;Why are we exploring space if we&apos;re just going to blow-up every lifeform we come across?&quot; Even though there is little reason to believe that the alien has ill intentions, most of our protagonists assume that it does, and they all assume that it at least poses a great danger to them in the form of unwittingly transmitted viruses, for example. They go so far as to issue a quarantine and consider drastic worst-case-scenarios and options. Baker seems to have a pessimistic view of human tendencies in the face of the unknown, and probably deservedly so.\n\nAlthough there are some flaws with the film (otherwise I wouldn&apos;t have subtracted two points), including strange moves by characters, such as one wearing a face mask to guard against biological contamination and another standing a foot behind and not wearing a face mask, Lifeforce is unusual (such as its strange but refreshing nihilistic endingapparently, fortuitously precipitated by budget limitations) and well worth watching.",

His &quot;bark&quot; in this film is very reminiscent of another famous role of his, that of the &quot;salty&quot; Uncle Charley on the long running TV sitcom, &quot;My 3 Sons&quot;.\n\nThe town is a delight.  It is a typical small town of 50 years ago (or what we expect one to be).  It&apos;s a warm friendly place with people you can count on.  In typical small town American tradition, the truth is triumphant, everyone pulls together, and a tearful, happy ending is assured.  I&apos;m sure that if you close your eyes you&apos;ll be able to picture this place in your mind&apos;s eye.\n\nA sentimental, funny, patriotic movie that would be very much appreciated during the dark days of war, it&apos;s charm still comes through 50 plus years later.  It&apos;s one of my favorites.....",

Also the scenes where The Duke is jesting with his real life son (&quot;we didn&apos;t beat this boy enough when he was growing up&quot;) and where he lovingly takes his real life daughter in his arms (scene at Melinda&apos;s small farm) are first rate.  I give the movie a 9 out of 10."

Since there only is a yes or no to that answer, there are not brownie points if you guessed right before the early on revelation. But you need someone with the charisma of Don Johnson to carry the movie - and a lot of other actors to assist (Rebecca De Morney being the other main character).\n\nAs far as thrillers go this lives off the screen presence of the actors and their ability to convey anything. And maybe even make you root for someone you shouldn&apos;t. You should not root for a bad guy/gal, but since this is a movie, maybe you can at least partially feel that way without being a complete and utter bad person yourself.\n\nHaving said that, the end is quite gruesome and may take some out of the movie (maybe there was even an alternate take or end to this?) ... but it is true to what would happen in a situation like that ... and a nice throwback to what ignited all this ...",

There was no love interest, no real threat (except at the end when the &apos;Nomads&apos; lined up on a horizon in the way I think I have seen in many Westerns). Everyone phoned in a performance on this movie and it should have been scrapped on the runway.\n\nI trust everyone will be tempted to see the original 1965 film."

Almost unbearable harrowing at times the film depicts the first month of 1945 when the Russian Red Army broke into the eastern part of Germany and forced millions of civilians to flee in the coldest of winter. While the Russians invaded Ostpreussen hundred of thousands of civilians were evacuated by ships. Gotenhafen was the last open port and ships left the town almost by the minute, overloaded by refugees. \n\nOne of the last ships to leave Gotenhafen was the &apos;Wilhelm Gustloff&apos;, a former &apos;Kraft durch Freude&apos; pleasure cruiser designed for 1000 passengers. Until today it is unknown how many people were on board but it is said to be around 10.000. The ship sunk without a trace and only a handful of people survived this hellish nightmare. \n\nGermany&apos;s postwar society found it almost impossible to talk about all the suffering of the people (air raids destroyed each and every town and killed over 600.000 inhabitants, over 2.000.000 died during the last month of the war while fleeing from the Russians and countless were deported to Russia).\n\n&apos;Nacht fiel ueber Gotenhafen&apos; is a very brave film, tactful and true to the facts. Sonja Ziemann is very good but the highest of praise must be given to Brigitte Horney."

I loved Paulette Goddard.\n\nIn my personal opinion, she has been overlooked by so many.  She was a wonderful beautiful star. Can&apos;t believe in the re-release they put Susan Hayward ahead of Paulette.  Hayward had a very small part.  Paulette was the star of the movie.  It&apos;s not the first time they have put Goddard last.  Too bad.  I think she&apos;s terrific. She had the ability to do comedy as well as drama.  And she was a very gorgeous woman.

      "reviewBody": "The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he&apos;s gay, so that&apos;s fine.\n\nIt gets worse, though. So many things in the film not only not make sense, but contradict lore from the books. The film is called Fantastic Beasts, but really it&apos;s just one and it doesn&apos;t do much except for the ending. The magical world of wizards is now angry, political, divided and warlike, because that&apos;s what Americans are like, obliterating the elegant traditionalist Britishness of the books. Magic is only used to show off, fight or destroy now.\n\nThe more I think about it, the angrier I become, which is not really what I want or need. My advice is to skip this film completely. Too bad, too, because Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Dan Fogler and Mads Mikkelsen did a great job as actors. Alas, the material they had to work with was utter garbage.",

Most importantly, the script was at least thought out, and didn&apos;t have the gut-wrenching plot holes and improbable logic (or lack there of) I&apos;ve come to expect.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, it certainly isn&apos;t a horror classic by any means but if you&apos;re looking for something in this vein and there&apos;s nothing else to rent (as was my case), it won&apos;t feel like a waste of time.\n\nBack-handed compliments to be sure, but I don&apos;t think the remake of When a Stranger Calls will be a whole lot better.",

      "reviewBody": "Production shut down on ABC&apos;s &quot;Recess&quot; series after it reached 65 episodes, as is mandated by producer Disney. But &quot;Recess&quot; proved to be so popular that an additional 13 episodes were commissioned. For some reason, though, ABC never broadcast the new episodes and they were instead edited into three direct-to-video movies. This entry, comprised of three episodes loosely joined together, finds the &quot;Recess&quot; gang finally being promoted to the fifth grade. But it seems they&apos;ve lost some of their magic with the change in grades. First of all, there are distracting problems with character voices. Courtland Mead (Gus) and Jason Davis (Mikey) don&apos;t quite sound like they usually do, and Myles Jeffrey has replaced Andrew Lawrence as TJ (Lawrence&apos;s voice was sounding pretty deep in the final episodes of the series, so this change is understandable). Jeffrey is OK, although he hasn&apos;t captured TJ&apos;s spunk the same way that Lawrence did. The real problem, though, is that the stories just seem...tired. The first, in which TJ becomes a truant to protest changes at school, is simply boring. The last one, in which Spinelli decides she is too old for Halloween, seems like a rehash of previous stories. Only the middle entry, in which the kids join a secret club, comes close to the series&apos; standards. Fans of the series will understandably want to catch up with their favorite characters, but this movie may make them realize why all good things must come to an end.",

But, the sets are honest to the periods covered, several sequences are very tastefully done and fun, the show excerpts are good, and did I mention the music? As several other commentators have indicated, the music is faithfully recreated in long segments that bring you much or all of the tune.\n\nIf you come to this film to hear some wonderful Gershwin performed by some great artists staged with a lot of character and splash (my favorite set is Hazel Scott&apos;s Paris show), you won&apos;t be disappointed. The story line is simply a convenient string to tie together the thread of music.",

On the other hand the film was supposed to have a Blair Witch Project feel to it. Bigger issues are there being virtually no character build-up and many scenes as well as plot points seem rushed and irritatingly underdeveloped.\n\nBut as a horror movie it achieves what it was set out to do. It is eerie, haunting and I really loved the end. Maybe nothing breakthrough, but decent horror flicks, that actually make you squirm not because of torture scenes, but because they delve into your inner fears... Well those kinds of movies come few and far between.",

      "reviewBody": "Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, &quot;In space no one can hear you scream&quot; Alien&apos;s &quot;In space no one can hear you scream&quot; tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuarón&apos;s latest thriller, Gravity.\n\nStarring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.\n\nTheir struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.\n\nBullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn&apos;t amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.\n\nWith only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.\n\nGravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar&apos;s in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.\n\nCuarón incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character&apos;s success in each new attempt at survival.\n\nWith still a few months left in the year, it&apos;s too early to call a film the year&apos;s best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year&apos;s conclusion. It&apos;s that breathtaking. It&apos;s that good.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

      "reviewBody": "Apparently even Tarkovsky described this film as &apos;tedious&apos;, so you can imagine what it&apos;s like to be on the receiving end. But for some reason I don&apos;t find it so, although there is the occasional longuer. It&apos;s one of the great films of cinema, although certainly rather odd. Once again it has an impossibly glamourous Russian wandering about looking moody, engrossed in the big issues. In fact, the female lead falls for him and is exasperated by his absurd interest in a local derelict. She flashes a tit in erotic frustration which is unusual for Tarkovsky, he seems unwilling to really engage in issues of sexuality, preferring them to be chaste in an almost victorian manner. Certainly there was some accusations of a reactionary attitude to women, for at the start of the film a priest tells the guide that she should sacrifice herself for the sake of raising children. She is made to look rather absurd in the film, but in truth, so do the male characters. Perhaps it was due to cultural traditions in Tarkovsky&apos;s background rather than deliberate misogyny.\n\nThe Italians didn&apos;t take to this film as it did not film Italy in a vibrant manner, preferring to evocate the alienation and melancholia of it&apos;s Russian lead. Tarkovsky&apos;s brilliance as a director is well illustrated in the film where the Russian and the old man talk in a room. The camera seems to turn a full 360 degrees although you don&apos;t notice it. The way his characters and objects seem to float in and out of frame is amazing. It&apos;s strange, but nature seems to perform for Tarkovsky. Even the animals seem willing to be directed, a dog staring straight into the camera with an almost unearthly and uncanny presence and stillness. The scene where the Russian lies on his hotel bed and his nostalgia conjurs up his dog in a dream like but also tangibly real manner is powerful and haunting.\n\nThe problem with this film is that the lead character was not really in exile and could go home anytime, unlike Tarkovsky himself, so why was he in so much pain? Is it mere homesickness as opposed to the real longing for one&apos;s homeland rightly belonging to the truly disenfranchised? But perhaps that is not the issue, more that when man finds himself and true wisdom, is it too late in the day for him to use what he has learned? The self sacrifice of the old man is a return to an old theme of Tarkovsky&apos;s that perhaps only shame can save mankind.\n\nThere are many eccentric aspects to this film, for instance the Russian wandering around up to his waist in water. Also there is a brief and bizarre shot of an angel stomping around outside a house. As it&apos;s Tarkovsky you don&apos;t burst out laughing. Perhaps he reaches the parts other directors cannot reach.\n\nBut there are also some vividly beautiful moments. The doves being released in the church, and the light filtering through a stream of water in a gutted house. Towards the end of his career, Tarkovsky began to question the rigid criteria he used in shooting a film in a way he felt won purity and aschewed the vulgar and trivial, but I think he got it right here. A marvelous film."

I think as a writer he is amazing and he has a long way to go. He has mentioned his love for short stories unknowingly in the TV show many times and I must say his endeavour has never gone unnoticed. Josh Radnor has a real potential. He just brought it together and the rest was obvious. The writing was superb(I&apos;m a writer myself so bro Respect!) and not to forget the brilliant direction done by Josh himself.\n\nA wonderful debut, by the way, as a director for him and all the very best wishes to him for his future ventures. Awesome acting and some great performances by the cast that included Malin Akerman (as usual she is brilliant in this flick too), Kate Mara (I&apos;m beginning to like her already)and Zoe Kazan(with her sweet role which she generally plays quite naturally).\n\nThe story was wonderful. Gotta watch it to know it. I&apos;d give it a 7 on 10 and I think the flick deserved it. I&apos;d recommend everyone to go and watch this one because it certainly is worth all the accolades.",

      "name": "That the movie is painfully slow moving just one of countless fatal flaws",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s likely that the writer/director of &apos;Beyond the Stars&apos; had good intentions to begin with, the messy, incoherent finished product leaves much to be desired. Even at eighty-seven minutes the movie feels excruciatingly long, only made worse by the mediocre production values. Excuse my bluntness, by whoever edited this movie ought to be shot in the arm repeatedly until they perish due to lead poisoning. It&apos;s that bad. The editor absolutely ruined what could have been a passable drama with their extremely unconventional (and incredibly unsuccessful) editing style. Because of this there is no sense of fluency, and one scene jerks roughly into the next. If there were a Golden Raspberry award for worst film editing, &apos;Beyond the Stars&apos; would sweep it, then years from now when they did a worst in the history of film, this movie would win it hands down.\n\n\tDespite the relatively weak script, Martin Sheen still manages put forth a good performance, likely the brightest spot in a dim movie. In likely the biggest casting mistake of the 20th century (besides Tom Selleck in &apos;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery), Christian Slater plays the lead, an 18? year old boy. Though he obviously tries hard, and it even shows through at times, Slater is one of the worst actors imaginable for this emotionally demanding role, and Slater looks much too old for the part. In a seemingly tacked on supporting role, Sharon Stone is under used, as are many of the other cast members. Even worse though, is the completely flat and uncharismatic Olivia d&apos;Abo as the chief love interest for Slater. The two have absolutely no chemistry, and the scenes with the two together are among the film&apos;s worst.\n\n\tThe description on the back of the box, even in the tagline, hints at a cross between &apos;October Sky&apos; and &apos;The Man Without a Face&apos;, two infinately better films. It succeeds at emulating neither of them, and comes off as a third rate imitator. In the last few sentences in the description, there is mention of a secret on the moon. Normally in descriptions, the writers describe the movie up to about the half way point. The secret is only mentioned at the tail end of the movie, and seems only in passing, like something used to create a good last impression (which it fails deeply at).\n\n\tThough the writer/director also wrote the book Cocoon (which can be seen on Christian Slater&apos;s shelf near the end), the script here is terrible, the dialog astonishingly ridiculous, and it&apos;s no wonder at all why he hasn&apos;t worked on a film since this. As for the music, there seem to be three themes of a minute each, one for when the characters are building a greenhouse (which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, yet seems to occupy most of it), one for whenever the moon is shown or talked about, and the third for the artificial &apos;sad&apos; scenes towards the end. Though the moon theme is actually half decent, the other two are unoriginal and forgettable, much like the movie itself.\n\n\tThe movies end (without giving anything away) seems manufactured and contrived. It also appears that the producers ran out of money at the end of the shoot, as this reflects it. Stay far away from it, if you see the movie on the shelf in your video store, don&apos;t even think about picking the box off the rack, think of it as a small plastic case carrying the bubonic plague, just waiting to trick your VCR into playing it, then latching onto you. Martin Sheen&apos;s performance is hardly enough to make this disorganized mess worth sitting through, avoid at all costs.\n\n1.5/10"

However, the comic relief is sometimes too pervasive and not very funny either. Way too often, it kills the tension and takes away from Steffen&apos;s hard-edged character.\n\nSpeaking of Django, as a justice/vengeance seeker, he sure is morally dubious here, gunning down a lot of people not responsible for his wife&apos;s death, including some men attempting to hang a condemned criminal (What a hypocrite!) and Mexican soldiers that just happen to be around when he kills one of the men that is responsible!\n\nThe &quot;surprise&quot; ending is fun, though you can see it coming a mile away.",

Alan (Jonathan Jackson) is a college student who learns that his mother (Barbara Hershey) has been hospitalized after a stroke. He must hitchhike across the state over the course of one night to be with her. Along the way he confronts his past, his future, his demons and fears - and a terrifying personification of death. \n\nThis film is brilliantly shot and the cast is fantastic!!! This film works so well because it has everything a TRUE Stephen King fan would be proud of. Excellent character development with thorough storyline added with a dash of fear and terror.\n\nThe movie is 100 min.",

Some outstanding performers (most notably Shelley Winters, Charles Napier, Tia Carrere and Stanley Tucci) somehow found their way on this downer. 2 stars out of 5."

I have never been more dumbfounded watching a move rated so highly. We got about 20 mins in and then even the notion of &quot;it must finish strong&quot; was so diminished that we turned it off. The acting is terrible and contrived, the characters are a joke and how is it that a Christmas tree farm, around Christmas has nothing christmassy about it. Its hard to say whether the lead actress is trying to play a 20 year old or they just want us to think she likes bad make up. As for Ashley Judds mom, That&apos;s all I have to say as it is not worth wasting time on further.",

When someone is good at something they will always be and that is perfectly visible in people like Whitaker, De Niro or Pedro Armendáriz Jr. Who had his swan song in this film. With tense and well-directed moments, the film&apos;s tone tends to fade at the end, where the entire weight of the film falls on Jackson, who is very limited to carry out a script that he could and should have been better. If it weren&apos;t for the secondaries it would be a bad movie.",

As one of the very few Delon-Deneuve pairings, it&apos;s nothing much: the only surprising thing about their love scene is how early into the film it comes. Delon has played this kind of role a million times before, but he does give a convincing performance, and easily (at least on this occasion) outclasses Deneuve. They both go for a rather &quot;inexpressive&quot; style of acting, but you can read a lot more on his face that you can on hers. For those who might care, he also has a full-frontal nude scene in this film BUT it&apos;s shot from a long distance and he&apos;s behind a glass wall. (**)",

I&apos;m ready to go on a tour, but problematic writing starts infiltrating the movie. As soon as the group gets confronted by the thugs, any sane person would leave the tour. Instead of thugs, the group should be trapped somehow underground. They should definitely stay together. That is probably the movie&apos;s biggest sin. It tries to build up some chemistry within the group and promptly breaks it apart. Maybe if they&apos;re not strangers, the separation would mean something.

      "reviewBody": "Director/writer Cate Shortland has created something truly remarkable, forcing us to find within ourselves sympathy for a young Nazi. The story is grim and dense, but features one hell of a lead performance. Shortland combines wonderful visuals with a brutal story of survival, involving family and patriotism, and a running commentary on the state of Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. \n\nAs the German army collapses in the spring of 1945, the breakdown of a family serves as a microcosm of a country in despair in the closing days of World War II. Lore (Saskia Rosendahl) and her four younger siblings are abandoned as their Nazi- supporting parents are forced to flee the Allied forces. As they travel on foot to their grandmother&apos;s house in Hamburg, the children encounter a young Jewish refuge, Thomas, on whom they are forced to rely for both food and safe passage through Ally-occupied lands. As she is exposed to the lies of their parents, and begins to develop feelings for one whom she has been taught to hate, Lore is forced to come to terms with a belief system that is quickly unraveling.\n\nIt&apos;s the children that have to do all the heavy lifting in the film dramatically, and they carry their weight, and then some. The film is anchored by a remarkable lead performance from Rosendahl, who comes across as a seasoned veteran, despite this being her debut performance. Her character goes from obnoxious adolescent to young adult, via a series of confronting moments where her morals and beliefs are challenged. Her vibrant youthful spirit is replaced with a burning rage with a war torn Europe as the backdrop. \n\nA new perspective on an event often forces an audience to confront disturbing realities they may wish to avoid. Although &quot;Lore&quot; relates a story from the second world war, it reveals the point of view of those we do not often consider: children of a high-ranking Nazi official. This story may not be pleasant, but it is certainly fascinating.",

Heston, Peck, Ives, Bickford, Connor, Baker, and Jean Simmons ( one of my favorite actors ). Throw in the scenery, the incredible musical score, and a plot with romance, and minimal violence, and you have a classic. On a home widescreen with the volume high, I am sure even compared to todays movies it is entertaining and ageless. As a footnote, I saw this movie years ago and it stuck in my mind. One day while listening to CBC radio on a call in request segment someone called in and asked for the theme from Big Country. It stirred me to track down a copy of the movie. I also like the story about Heston thinking of turning it down ( An Actor&apos;s Life ) since his part was secondary. His agent said are you nuts to turn down Willy Wyler. This movie led Wyler to cast him in Ben Hur.",

In terms of Mehmet Ali Erbil case I believe it added value to the movie since he was seen only for a minute or so. COnsidering the cab driver played for just couple of minutes these kind important people playing in the movie makes the cast stronger. Recently I watched another movie by Mehmet Ali Erbil and Ozcan Deniz I hated it but this one was perfect",

The exquisitely ribald film includes a scintillating series of palpably erotic interludes, wherein the viewer enjoys Joëlle&apos;s nascent sensual experimentations, exposing colourful recollections of her far from innocent formative years! &apos;Pussy Talk&apos; aka &apos;Le sexe qui parle&apos; will give Euro-Exotica fans plenty to talk about, being an uncommonly imaginative, deliciously erotic skin flick, including some sensationally bizarre sequences culminating in a demonstratively &apos;gripping&apos; finale!",

      "reviewBody": "Hemingway was terrified of being boring. Compared to Hemingway, Kerouac was completely &amp; utterly fearless.\n\nSo let&apos;s take a page out one of Kerouac&apos;s best books, start at the beginning, &amp; let the truth seep out.\n\nI first encountered &quot;On the Road&quot; in the public library when I was in 6th grade. It spawned a fascination, an obsession, an addiction. Between the age of 12 &amp; 18, outside of school, the Beat writers were all that I read. I devoured them. And in the years since my youth Kerouac has morphed from an obsession to a comfort author, I read him to help cushion the blows life brings. &quot;Maggie Cassidy,&quot; is still my favorite.\n\nThat being said, I walked into this flick with extremely low expectations. I&apos;m more than familiar with the source material &amp; couldn&apos;t see how it could translate into anything but a dull film. I expected the film to stagnate. I wasn&apos;t really disappointed in this. Anyone that has read &quot;On the Road&quot; has to question the wisdom of attempting to translate that into a decent movie.\n\nLike the novel, there are parts of this film you just have to fight through in the hopes that he&apos;ll move off his love for grape picking &amp; into something interesting again.\n\nThe plus side is, once you make it past the stagnation, the plot picks up again &amp; you feel the sense of freedom having overcome the monotony of Kerouac. But on the other-hand, I&apos;m fairly certain that&apos;s the point.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you are familiar with Travelin&apos; Jack you know what to expect before you walk into the film &amp; you walk out with an experience far better than you would have thought it&apos;s be. It&apos;s an enjoyable film.\n\nHowever, if you&apos;re like most of the world &amp; for some reason do not read, you&apos;ll be expecting the legend without understanding the reality &amp; you will hate it, for no other reason than the lack of background necessary to expect Kerouac to be, well, Kerouac.",

Old Graves wants to get rid of the squatters, but his son Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) falls in love with Tess. This is a story of greed, passion and jealousy: another squatter with an eye on Tess frames her father for a murder he himself has committed, Frederick&apos;s sister gets pregnant by her boyfriend and gives birth to a child, without her father knowing etc. Etc. There is really a lot going on, but then, with about two hours &apos;Tess of the Storm Country&apos; is quite a long film. Director John S. Robertson (and Mary Pickford herself, who was a strong influence) therefore had time enough to focus on character development. That pays off: All the persons appearing are in one way or the other interesting, Tess of course first of all. Pickford got into that role with an increadible vigour. She is not just a tomboy (like in many of her other films); she is a wildcat - but at the same time vulnerable and sympathetic (at heart maybe even a bit too good to be true). The plot is complex but due to the excellent direction easy to follow. There are no plot holes whatever, and the whole thing is very well-paced, exciting and suspenseful. The film is also beautifully photographed, though some scenes have unfortunately become quite severely degraded. I watched a copy without any sound; it would be interesting to know what the original music was like (if there was any). All in all a very good film, well-worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "US release: fall 2005. Shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, October 2005 \n\nAfter Park Chunghee became President of South Korea by military coup in 1961 he made major contributions to the country&apos;s industrialization and economic development  but became a dictator by altering the constitution and declaring martial law. He must have had many enemies, and there had already been other assassination attempts by 1979, the moment depicted in the film, when Kim Jaegyu, his KCIA chief, shot him and several of those closest to him at a private bacchanal held at a palatial KCIA safe house. The events are depicted from Kim&apos;s point of view. &quot;The President&apos;s Last Bang,&quot; which is brutal in its unreflective, intense, present energy, is half political film and half violent actioner. It amply shows how corrupt and cynical Park was; how much Koreans at this point enjoyed kicking, punching, and slapping their subordinates in front of others; their abusive and demeaning treatment of women; and their penchants for smoking and chewing gum. After the killings  which went on to include military guards and even cooks  there was a brief period of chaos, also well covered in the film. Kim expected to get away with it, but he and his closest accomplices are soon apprehended. Director I&apos;m includes humor amid the horror, showing the clumsiness and confusion and sheer incompetence of some of the participants. It&apos;s interesting to observe how impulsive and improvised the shootings were, and how often the ruling class shifts in their conversation to the Japanese language to be more elegant or avoid being understood by underlings. The film is effective technically and illustrates South Korean cinema&apos;s growing sophistication, but it may leave non-Korean viewers cold; the film-making style feels as hard and brutal as the events.",

If it were set in today&apos;s times instead of the Seventies, Eastwood&apos;s Philo Beddoe would be on the extreme fighting channel.\n\nSeeing Clint&apos;s living quarters reminded me of John Wayne&apos;s similar arrangements in True Grit with Chin Lee and General Sterling Price the cat. Clyde&apos;s quite a bit more the handful than a cat. He lives with Geoffrey Lewis who is his second and corner man in the bare knuckle fighting business and handles all the wagers and Lewis&apos;s mother a &apos;helpless&apos; little old lady with a shotgun, deliciously played by Ruth Gordon.\n\nMaking his living as a bare knuckle fighter, Clint just seems to run into people determined to take him down. That includes an involvement with aspiring country singer Sondra Locke whom he spends a good deal of money on and who then takes a powder on him. She&apos;s heading east so Clint, Lewis, and Clyde are as well. Along the way they pick up sharp shooting Beverly D&apos;Angelo who saves them on one occasion.\n\nThe legendary bare knuckle champion is Denver Tank Murdoch and as that 20th century philosopher Ric Flair opined, to be the best you have to beat the best. So Clint is heading to Denver to find both Locke and Walter Barnes who plays Tank Murdoch with his three amigos.\n\nHe also manages to arouse the anger of John McQuade and his Black Widow Biker gang. These people are the sorriest biker gang ever depicted on the big screen. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE manages to best this crowd of losers. But they never give up.\n\nBest in the film are Ruth Gordon and Clyde, not necessarily in that order. I&apos;ve often thought that the Academy Awards should have a best animal performance in a given year. That year the Oscar gold would have been taken by the orangutan. I wish the film had elaborated a little more on when Eastwood and Lewis break into a zoo to get Clyde&apos;s male needs satisfied.\n\nFor a lighter and brighter side of Clint Eastwood, don&apos;t miss Every Which Way But Loose.",

      "reviewBody": "There is a generation divide, as always with cinema, and it is obvious with regards the Visconti&apos;s film and the earliest Käutner&apos;s version. In the modern times, when it is commercially fashionable to insist on the more prurient aspects of one&apos;s biography and when crude obscenity has replaced suggestiveness, it is quite understandable that younger generations should far prefer the eroticism and nauseating aestheticism of Visconti. As a man in his seventies, I must say I was deeply moved by the Ludwig portrayed by Käutner. The camera-work is excellent, the Wagnerian musical background sublime and the rendering of the end of the King quite gripping. It is a great injustice to compare this film with the Sissi series."

      "reviewBody": "Like Norma Shearer&apos;s MARIE ANTOINETTE almost twenty years later, this is an attempt to tell a rags to riches tale set in the last years of the French aristocracy.  We see Jeanne rise from milliner to mistress of all who would have her, finally married to her protector&apos;s brother so she could become the king&apos;s favorite.  Negri and Jannings do well as Du Barry and Louis XV but this is no intimate drama so it lacks character development and depth. Jeanne, it seems, is ever faithful to her first love, the student, Armand, and looks out for him unbeknownst of course, only to be shamed when he learns who his benefactress really is.  So like a man!\n\n Negri is early in her career and far from the subtle actress she would later become.  She is so heavily made up that she is often rather grotesque. Jannings always pulls off a characterization with professional aplomb but here he has little to do until his death scene, where he pulls out the stops.  There is a lot of posturing and it tries quite well to give us a history lesson - although it succeeds, it is dullsville along the way.\n\nThe lavish and elaborate art direction is worthy of award consideration. Don&apos;t seek this out unless you are a fan of the two leads, the director or the subject matter.\n\nNote: that same year Lubitsch would &quot;go mad&quot; and find his niche with the delightfully funnny OYSTER PRINCESS.  While that film is also worthy of art direction honors, it is Lubitsch&apos;s marvelous directorial touches that deserve as high a consideration.",

Granted, it&apos;s in the Big Chill vain, but it features a fabulous cast in top-notch form, real attitudes, compact characters, and quite a few memorable scenes, even if it doesn&apos;t do justice to JL Curtis. Yes, it&apos;s more verbal than visual, but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad point, considering it leads to comments like &quot;wounded animal convention&quot; or Eliot&apos;s rationale for not going&apos; out. All in all, I find it quite entertaining; a gem of a story about everyday people in everyday situations. And yes, again,it&apos;s not Bergman. But if you&apos;re sick of films that blackmail your interest in a once-in-a-million character in a once-in-a-trillion-situation, then you could definitely give this one a try.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary offers a rare chance to get a close view inside a not very well known society within our society. I thought the content was very honest, and - although this is not the kind of movie people watch for entertainment value - I would like to point out that this is also a very well made film, and certainly never dull or boring. \n\nReligious communities are not often very open towards journalists or filmmakers; they fear - probably with good reason - that their portrayal by the secular media is biased and that their believes are depicted in the wrong light. However, in this documentary the filmmakers were granted full access, and the evangelical community whose portrayal you get to see in the film got the chance to see it first before it was released to the general public. They thought it was an accurate depiction of their lifestyle and their believes. \n\nWhat you see in this film is not staged - this is real, 21th century footage. Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

The material contained in this film is shocking, the fact that this information has not brought more media attention is just plain mind numbing.\n\nThe events that took place are tragic enough as they were, that so very many questions have gone unanswered and blatantly ignored compounds the situation exponentially. See the movie, listen to the information and decide for yourself, then most importantly...SPREAD THE WORD.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is indeed an incoherent mess, but it&apos;s so weird in its very concept that I can&apos;t believe it is merely an exercise in incompetence (despite the bad reviews and the &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; directorial credit). But neither is it one of those annoying, would-be &quot;cult&quot; films that tries very self-consciously to be &quot;weird&quot;. It is UNIQUELY weird, which is the mark of a TRUE cult film, even if it obviously doesn&apos;t have any kind of a cult following.\n\nIt starts with a strange detective following an escaped mental patient who is driving a white van (shades of producer Mustapha Akkad&apos;s most famous movie). The mental patient stops to bloodlessly stab his ex-wife to death while she&apos;s sitting on someone&apos;s porch with their infant son. The dying women gives the infant to a ditsy teenager, who has just been performing a mime routine at the birthday party of a cranky old man next door. The ditsy teen gets a ride home with her very cute friend (Michelle Little), who doesn&apos;t seem to notice she is now carrying an infant. The friend is pretty weird herself--she constantly eavesdrops on people with a directional microphone and she has a pet hobo named &quot;Norman&quot; sleeping in the back of her flat-bed pickup truck (a &quot;Crazy Ralph&quot; type given to strange, philosophical soliloquies). Rounding out the cast is the cute girl&apos;s would-be boyfriend, who rides around on a motorcycle with a female mannequin in the sidecar, and a couple--a guy named &quot;Cowboy&quot; and a blonde girl--who are frequently playing cards and having sex, sometimes doing both at the same time. Eventually this kinda turns into a slasher movie as the killer comes after his newborn son, but a very bizarre one featuring astral projection and the Egyptian god of nature. . .\n\nThe most recognizable actor here might be the busty Debbisue Vorhees who played &quot;Jason&apos;s&quot; most gratuitously naked murder victim in &quot;Friday the 13th Part V&quot;. She has a similarly perfunctory role in this as a casual friend of lead, who, while waiting for her friend to come home, strips down to her panties for a quick dip in the pool for no apparent reason, and is subsequently murdered. (It&apos;s not a much of a part, but I doubt anyone will complain). It&apos;s also nice to see Brioni Ferrell, who was memorable in Roger Corman&apos;s &quot;Student Nurses&quot;, but never did much after that. She plays the mother of the ditsy girl, and is usually clad in a skimpy bikini for reasons that have nothing really to do with the plot. There are more boobs than blood in this one (but not really enough of either), and the action comes to a dead halt several times for a synchronized New Wave dance routine or some other weirdness. It probably won&apos;t appeal much to hardcore slasher fans, but I actually kinda liked it for some reason. . ."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Men and women are all humans. It&apos;s only hard when we categorize ourselves  Maybe we don&apos;t need to define ourselves as man or woman. Maybe the determination of our sex at conception is as arbitrary as whether the zoo was open or not. What we do know is that in the beginning all humans start out being women.&quot;\n\nKakera: A Piece of our Life is an emotionally-charged independent film about the budding relationship between two women. Haru (Mitsushima Hikari, of Love Exposure fame) is a quiet, odd-ball college student dealing with a boyfriend who is with another woman and only uses Haru for sex. Riko (Nakamura Eriko) is an enthusiastic, excitable prostheticist who prefers women &quot;because they are soft and cuddly,&quot; as she states in one scene. They meet quite randomly–in a coffee shop; Haru is drinking her mocha and ends up with a cute chocolate mustache. Riko is immediately smitten.\n\nI must begin with the performances. Both actresses are absolutely phenomenal. Mitsushima Hikari is great, as usual, playing an off-beat yet quiet character. This is a departure for her, as she is usually the loud one. As director Ando Momoko has stated, Mitsushima was willing to do anything she asked, even excitedly growing out her facial and underarm hair. Mitsushima&apos;s character, Haru, is portrayed as the opposite of attractive–shown going the bathroom, wearing strange clothes, with facial and armpit hair, etc. This obviously upset her fan club, as the heads of it attended the first screening and, according to Ando, came up to her furious about how Mitsushima was portrayed (she used to be of the pure, cute, cuddly, idol-type). I give major props to Mitsushima for courageously committing to her characters and her acting career.\n\nNakamura Eriko is impressive as well. I had previously seen her in the film Shikyu no Kioku (2007), where she played a quiet, cute young college student in a small role. She, like Mitsushima, reversed her typical character-type in Kakera, playing the tough, loud, enthusiastic Riko. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve ever seen a performance quite like Nakamura&apos;s; she makes you feel her happiness, her excitement along with her. There is also a haunting, brilliant short performance by Katase Rino as a depressed, lonely older woman in need of a prosthetic breast.\n\nKakera is Ando Momoko&apos;s first film, and she is definitely a young talent to watch out for. The daughter of Okuda Eiji and sister of Ando Sakura, cinema is definitely a family affair–though she prefers to do things her own way. Her camera is varied, delivering many important still shots, slow tracking shots, extreme close ups of faces, and an intimate styling when needed. It ends up as a refreshing experience. The visuals are deliberately dull and monotone, with certain colors popping out for special effect. James Iha of Smashing Pumpkins contributes to the score and delivers fitting, quiet, atmospheric, and progressive music that highlights the light, bouncy, and uplifting yet sometimes sad, though never dark, quality of the film.\n\nThere are both some extremely powerful and totally irrelevant scenes included in the film. One scene in particular is striking in its use of background imagery to deliver an emotionally tied message. Haru had decided to tell her boyfriend that they were over, but after delivering the message falls over and lands face-first on the floor. She rolls over and says &quot;I&apos;m done,&quot; then lays there and allows the guy to have his way with her as she hums mindlessly to herself. Meanwhile, a war documentary is playing in the background, guns firing and bombs exploding. This emphasizes the turmoil and chaos both in Haru&apos;s mind and in the scene as a whole. Another scene, where a thrown bottle transforms into a two-headed pigeon, is completely irrelevant and removes the viewer from the reality of the film–especially with the cheap CG used.\n\nKakera is a deeply engrossing and thought-provoking film that seeks to show that gender doesn&apos;t matter when it comes to love, it&apos;s about finding yourself and looking at the person inside. Haru and Riko&apos;s relationship is a normal one, they experience things that any &quot;normal&quot; couple would experience. Just as Riko fills up prosthetic pieces, she also fills up Haru&apos;s heart and helps her move through her rocky relationship with her boyfriend; however, they are not immune to typical relationship woes. The actresses had fun making this movie–you can tell because they infect you as well, causing wide smiles to magically appear on your face.\n\nI&apos;ll leave you with a little quote of wisdom from the film: &quot;Favorite foods are better eaten a little at a time.&quot; Remember it.",

      "name": "Ambitious but halfway failed attempt to let us think about richness and poverty, and about crime and punishment",
      "reviewBody": "The first ¾ of the film shows students attending lectures with a teacher who advocates the principal of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in the economic world, hence defending a segregation of rich and poor people, this being the only way to eventually provide for the goods that all of us need. These insights are apparently very new to the post-Sovjet students attending the lecture. They struggle on a philosophic level with the consequences, however without much bearing to their daily lives, where richness is something on a far distance.\n\nWhen our main character sees that one of his friends is beaten up by the body guards of a rich banker, after having spilled coffee over the daughter, he wants to bring aforementioned &quot;survival&quot; principle into practice, rather than talking and writing about it. He decides to rob a local supermarket. His misdeed is known to us, but he succeeds in remaining undiscovered by killing not only the shopkeeper but also the only witness.\n\nThe anti-communistic philosophy is only halfway put through, however. In spite of having barely enough money to support his own life, the robbery is not for his own benefit but he gives it away to help a poor poet and his family. Some time later on the poet is found dead under the proverbial bridge. He attends the death rites and maintains further contacts with the poet&apos;s family.\n\nIn the last ¼ of the film we see a different teacher, who is very outspoken about &quot;social&quot; behavior in the economic sense. He sees it as the main guideline to separate humans from animal life. Our main character shows that he sees a definite dilemma here. Firstly, he tries to discuss this with a fellow student, but cannot get to the point and leaves before he gets the chance to talk about his crime. Secondly, he confesses the robbery and the related double murder to one of the family members of the dead poet.\n\nAll this happens without obvious consequences. His life continues without any noticeable change. In my opinion, several opportunities are wasted here to augment the story. Particularly this is the part where the film fails to exploit the potential that the story certainly has. For instance, his own family appears suddenly. They observe his depressed demeanor but think nothing of it, they eat and drink while he stays in bed all the time, and they leave without even asking about his moody behavior.\n\nStill not discovered by the police as the robber who shot the local shopkeeper and a customer who witnessed his crime, he wrestles with the dilemma&apos;s at hand but finds no redemption in the lack of punishment he experiences. His life drags on and on, this is something that definitely shows in this film. I experienced several dull and hollow moments, not compensated by convincing casting and acting, and I sincerely missed some interesting side roles. Pity, since it wastes a good theme for a movie that could let us start pondering over such life&amp;death questions.\n\nOccasionally we drive through a city that looks very modern from the outside, thereby possibly ignoring that Kazachstan was a communist country in the past, about which we always learned that building gray apartment blocks for the working class had the highest priority. No doubt, such gray and depressing areas still exist, but are conveniently not shown in a film that is to be exported and to be shown in much more developed countries. From the exteriors of the buildings in the parts of the city we see in this film, we could easily think these to be located in any modern Western country.\n\nNear the end of the film we see our main character entering a police station, with the obvious intent to report his crime and accept his punishment. A few moments later we see him leave again, but we are left in the dark about this sudden change of heart. Finally, he gets the punishment he thinks he deserves (for spoilers sake, I omit details). But again, I missed everything we want to know about his feelings and considerations, and the reasons for his actions we observe from a safe distance.\n\nI wrongly scored a 4 (out of 5) for the audience award when leaving the theater, but in retrospect I think it would have deserved only a 3 (not good, not bad). The story line supported a lot of good ingredients, illustrating the basic themes and related dilemma&apos;s. But the casting/acting and the spurious dull moments wasted some good opportunities to let us start thinking about our policies in life. And the absence of logic in the movements of our main character does not help either. Maybe I can wrap up with some defense for the slowness that manifested itself at times, since it can be caused by a different (passive) pace these people live in, in other words can be intended to showcase their way of life (possibly an inheritance from their Sovjet past??).",

      "name": "Ridley Scott back in form",
      "reviewBody": "The poster for Ridley Scott&apos;s 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien told us that in space, no-one can hear you scream. 36 years later, and it would seem that no-one can hear you colonising a planet in a desperate effort to stay alive either. Scott&apos;s latest, which has recently invited controversy due to its ridiculous Golden Globe victory in the &apos;Musical or Comedy&apos; category, takes a refreshingly optimistic view of one man&apos;s struggle when left stranded on Mars with only his wits and a never-ending list of obstacles to overcome to keep him from losing his sanity. After the let-down of Scott&apos;s recent return to the sci-fi genre with Prometheus, The Martian has the director firmly back in form.\n\nIn 2035, the crew of the Ares III, commanded by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), are exploring the surface of Mars when a violent dust storm forces them to flee. Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and when his space suit reports a breach and no sign of life, the remaining crew reluctantly escape presuming Mark to be dead. When he awakes hours later with an antenna protruding from his stomach and his oxygen levels dangerously low, he makes his way back to the living quarters and quickly sets about calculating how long he can survive on what he has. Discovering he only has about a month left, he &quot;sciences the s**t&quot; out of whatever he can salvage and successfully starts growing food.\n\nAs ludicrous as The Martian&apos;s inclusion in the Musical or Comedy category was, the film is still very funny. In one of many efforts to hold on to his sanity, Mark talks to himself while recording a log of his actions, revealing a laid-back and sardonic sense of humour which seems to come naturally to the actor. With little in the way of explosive set-pieces, The Martian opts to be subtly engaging as opposed to outright exciting. Mark&apos;s can-do attitude gives a stubborn optimism to the movie&apos;s outlook, and with comments such as &quot;f**k you, Mars&quot; following one particularly hard-earned achievement, it&apos;s hard not to cheer him along. \n\nAlso absent are any suggestions of puffy-chested patriotism or evil- doing among the people back on Earth trying to bring Mark home. The only person resembling a &apos;baddie&apos; who mission director Vincent Karpoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) clashes heads with is NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), but even he retains his humanity throughout. If there is a criticism to be had, it&apos;s that Mark never feels truly in danger in such an inhospitable landscape. But The Martian takes care to lay out and explain all the science-y stuff going on with clarity and without heavy exposition, and although I wouldn&apos;t have a clue if what they were saying was nonsense or mathematically correct, you have to marvel at the detail.

      "reviewBody": "Bring out the popcorn, grab a cola and get ready for 2 and a half hours of laughs, songs, color, emotions, and spoofs. If you&apos;re a fan of the Indian film industry and have kept up with the news, Om Shanti Om is for you. If you love entertainment to the max, OSO is definitely for you! Farah Khan&apos;s Om Shanti Om spares nobody, not even its makers when it comes to poking fun. OSO is a film about films, it&apos;s a film in a film and above all, it&apos;s made to celebrate the biggest film producing industry - The Indian Film Industry.\n\nOm Prakash is a junior artist who thrives to become a lead hero one day. He is a horrible actor and has a mother who hams more than him. Om has another dream: To win over a star, Shanti-Priya. One circumstance leads to another which leads to Om being a witness to the death of Shanti by producer Mukesh Mehra. Om also gets killed in the incident. That same night, Om is reborn as Om Kapoor. Will Om realize his past-life? Will he avenge Shanti&apos;s death? As the tagline suggests: For some dreams, one life-time is not enough.\n\nOSO has a done-to-death story. But that&apos;s not the point. The film is a parody of films and the ones working in it. Notice the spoofs on the yesteryear stars such as Manoj Kumar. A controversial scene but one can&apos;t deny it&apos;s hilarious. Not to forget spoofs on Govinda, Keshtu Mukherjee, and Suraj Bharjateeyaa. Of course the most memorable comic scene has to be SRK pretending to be a south Indian actor. &quot;Mind It&quot; OSO&apos;s first half is gripping and keeps the viewer alert. The drama folds the right way. The second half loses steam at times. It&apos;s not bad, but unlike Farah&apos;s first film where the second half competed well with the first, it stars to slow down a bit. It picks back up, fortunately.\n\nThe spoofs aren&apos;t less hilarious in the second half. The film pokes fun of a lot of celebs and Indian film industry issues. To start, SRK being late is a spoof on himself being late to sets in real life. Not to forget the whole dard-e-disco song is a spoof on item numbers. The high point of the second half has to be the award ceremony. The spoof on Abhishek Bachchan is subtle yet funny. SRK doing the same roles and being nominated is remarkably funny. Not to forget Akshay KUmar&apos;s outburst at the awards is aplaudworthy and rib-tickling. Subash Ghai-Rishi Kapoor spoof is funny too.\n\nFlaws? As mentioned, the second half falters in some parts. Also, SRK remembering his past so quickly seems rushed and unconvincing.\n\nThe climax, however, is a pleasant surprise.\n\nSpecial Mention - The Deewangee song is a treat to the eyes. 31 stars in one song is no joke and they all look nothing short of spectacular. Special mention to the ones that caught my eye with their appearance. Dharmendra, Jatendra, Kajol, Salman, Saif, Sanju, Rekha etc all do well alongside Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nFarah Khan and her team of writers have put some genius into parts of the movie. The writing is witty, smart, and quite innovative. Dilague is first rate.\n\nVishal-Shekar&apos;s music is amazing. With a variety of songs in one film, they do a wonderful job.\n\nFarah&apos;s direction is first rate. She handles all the moments with ease. It&apos;s not a better film than Main Hoon Na, but still a good job.\n\nIn 2007, 3 months before OSO released; SRK unleashed the actor in him and kept the star away in a movie called Chak De India. In OSO, it&apos;s the opposite. OSO is a film where SRK can chill and not worry about the criticism. His performance is explosive and energetic. In this, it&apos;s SRK the superstar unleashed. And kudos to him for also poking fun at himself despite being the producer of this one.\n\nDeepika makes a grand debut and I&apos;m sure she couldn&apos;t have asked for anything else. She looks gorgeous and makes a good debut. Arjun Rampal is spectacular as the villain here. Brilliant.\n\nThe supporting cast does well too which includes the lovable Shreyas Talpade, the scene-stealing Kirron Kher and Javed Sheikh.\n\nOverall, A grand film which has one objective - Entertainment!",

I would say that the movie was a lot like the American film &quot;Return to Me&quot; with Minnie Driver and David Doucovity(Spelling???). The only thing that I would say needed to be taken care of is the fact that Bhoomika should have had a scar because some of her clothing was low enough that a scar from the heart transplant would be visible. Otherwise decent movie and worth watching.\n\nI also feel that the second ask could have been better developed. I feel that there needed to be a greater change in Salman when he realizes he loves Bhoomika. It almost seems that he falls in love with her just because she has his wife&apos;s heart. Their relationship could have been better developed to create a more complex and better second half.",

It is not a regular sci-fi movie. There are some crazy ideas going on here. Time travel is not enough. There is also telekinesis, post collapse apocalypse, mob killings, and pre-planned suicide for hire (yeah figure that one out). Does it all make logical sense? I can&apos;t tell. But it sure was fun trying to follow it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt is refreshingly new. Also staring is Paul Dano and Piper Perabo.",

      "reviewBody": "Together with that documentary, which talks about how much the British suffered during WWI, losing a generation of young men, this newsreel and the indifference it brought from the American government and business interests makes more sense.\n\nThe documentary talks about how Hitler did take Germany from the starvation that the rest of the world was suffering during the Great Depression and in five short years every worker has a job and hunger is gone. But at what cost? Wages are kept low so that industry has money to churn out as many arms as needed, food prices are kept high as the Nazis need farmers to be able to produce large amounts of food for the troops, every farmer must grow what he is told to grow, and no worker is allowed to strike. The German newspapers are full of stories of people freezing, starving, and rebelling in the streets in the U.S., and some of these stories may have been true in the depths of the Great Depression as the U.S. only could go as far as our democracy would let us, and even then Roosevelt was labeled a Communist for what he did do.\n\nThe short talks about how visitors will be surprised at how cheerful and relaxed the German people are, but then the narrator credits that not only to the recovery of the economy, but to the Nazi propaganda machine, and the &quot;group think&quot; that the Third Reich encouraged and actually exercised in German youth who were taught much about acting together, but whose school lessons kept critical thought to a minimum.\n\nPrecisely because Germany was so prosperous, the American captains of industry did not want to upset the apple cart - Hitler could have cut them off from trading in their economy with just a word. And because there had been so much seemingly pointless loss in WWI, politicians were afraid to once again point to Germany as the boogeyman. Note the large number of anti war films made from 1925 until up to 1939, including the ironically named &quot;Idiot&apos;s Delight&quot; from that latter year for examples of that.\n\nI&apos;d recommend this one. It is probably the best explanation you are going to get of life in Hitler&apos;s Germany before war actually broke out.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;What the Peeper Saw&quot; is much more of a psychological drama than a horror film, or even a thriller. It focuses heavily on the antagonistic relationship between Elise (Britt Ekland), the new wife of an older man, successful author Paul (Hardy Kruger), and her stepson Marcus (Mark Lester of &quot;Oliver!&quot; fame). They initially seem to get along all right, but Elise becomes increasingly frustrated by this enigmatic, aloof kid, who acts much older than his actual age. She comes to suspect that he had murdered his biological mother Sarah (Colette Giacobine), and now has similar designs on her.\n\nAs directed by James Kelley (&quot;The Beast in the Cellar&quot;), you can&apos;t ever expect a lot of tension in this film. That doesn&apos;t seem to be its primary concern. It DOES have a sexual charge about it, however. Hell, the uncut version opens with a scene of nudity. The evolving relationship between our heroine and bratty antagonist does play up this quality. (Still, it must be noted that you don&apos;t ever see the kid indulge in the act of peeping on screen.) The single most memorable sequence involves the two main characters exchanging clothes for information, as Elise strips in front of Marcus in order to get some truths out of him.\n\nAnd this kid is one truly cagey character. One thing you can expect is that the scenario turns into one of &quot;he said, she said&quot;, and Elise is understandably flustered that she can get almost nobody to believe her about this bad seed.\n\nEkland is no great shakes as a dramatic actress, but she just looks so damn fine that some viewers probably won&apos;t mind very much. (She DOES give the proceedings an earnest effort.) Kruger is fine as the dad, but the film belongs to young Lester, who&apos;s quite amusing throughout. Lilli Palmer and Harry Andrews are excellent in special guest appearances as a psychiatrist and school headmaster.\n\nThe out of nowhere violent ending is downright hilarious, even if it&apos;s probably not intended to be that way.\n\nThe Italian version is credited to Andrea Bianchi (&quot;Strip Nude for Your Killer&quot;, &quot;Burial Ground&quot;).\n\nSix out of 10.",

If you add that the director of the movie gets murdered himself, soon after finishing this film,it all gets even more convoluted. Pim Fortuyn was labeled with the extremist labels, racism, intolerance, but he was much more complex person. An open homosexual, asking hard but not unfair questions. Without any answers or useful suggestions, he was smeared and easily dismissed. And shortly after killed. The movie is powerful, but little disjointed , as if the director wasn&apos;t sure himself of his intentions.",

The unnatural progeny, Alraune (German for mandrake), is played by temptress extraordinaire Brigitte Helm, best known for playing the saintly Maria and her evil Maschinenmensch avatar in Fritz Lang&apos;s &apos;Metropolis&apos; (1927). Although the film is sometimes classified as horror/science fiction, it is more of a romantic melodrama, as the doctor slowly becomes infatuated with his creation, who is beginning to aspire to human feelings. Human artificial insemination had been around since the late 1700s, so other than the choice of sperm donor, there is nothing particularly novel about the premise, which is essentially a test of the frequently overly-simplified &apos;nature/nurture&apos; dichotomy (in reality, it is nature &apos;plus&apos; nurture, not nature &apos;or&apos; nurture). The eponymous 1911 novel by Hanns Heinz Ewers had been films twice before this version and several times afterwards but the 1928 silent is considered to be truest to the original story. The film has not aged well - not a lot happens and the silent acting comes off as a bit theatrical. There are several versions on-line, with and without music. The image quality in the one I watched was not great but the score, a mix of recognisable &apos;classics&apos;, helped pass the time spent watching the relatively boring film.",

There are many different emotions and ways of thinking being portrayed and this is all done really well. In many ways this film reminds me of &apos;A time to kill&apos;, but it is shocking to think that the events portrayed really happened, and not that far into the past either. The racism and segregation that existed in the southern states of the USA are in many ways worse than apartheid in South Africa. To think that otherwise intelligent, moral and well mannered people can have such idiotic views regarding people of a different colour is astounding and America should be deeply ashamed of this. I wonder what some of the real people as portrayed in this film now think of their Black President? I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed &apos;A time to kill&apos; or &apos;To kill a mocking bird&apos;.",

I can&apos;t say that I think you&apos;d be surprised. In any way that is.

      "reviewBody": "Stop Making Sense is the kind of concert film that gets you pumped up for the Talking Heads even if you&apos;re not that huge a fan. I love a few of their songs- Take Me to the River, Burning Down the House, Psycho Killer most of all- but I never really &quot;got in&quot; to them at a younger age, mostly because I knew them from classic rock radio. What Jonathan Demme as director presents with his film of their concert in 1984 is to energize fans and casual listeners to their presence and power and just plain f***ing fun. The main force behind the group, singer/guitarist David Byrne wears suits 10 times too big, runs laps around the stage (while also having back-up singers jogging in place as well), and creates crazy pop-culture and avant-garde imagery on behind them on a screen. It&apos;s madness, but it&apos;s also alive in performance and song all the way.\n\nMaybe one or two songs might not totally click or may sound a little, well, dated (it was the 80s after all, no longer the folks from CBGB&apos;s), but there&apos;s constantly memorable moments, including the opening take on Psycho Killer, the building-block form from song to song as band members join one by one until it&apos;s a good dozen players and singers all in the mix, and with the imagery that Demme and DP Jordan Crenowith create. For the most part it&apos;s (perfectly) straightforward film-making... but here and there we see real artistry break through, shadows cascading the figures playing, the juxtaposition of Byrne in that suit flopping around, moving around seamlessly between musicians. It&apos;s the kind of craftsmanship that looks like it should be easy enough with a good few cameras, yet probably took as much prep work as Scorsese had on the Last Waltz.\n\nSo, take in all of the 80&apos;s New-Wave mood (and, make no mistake, it&apos;s VERY 80&apos;s New Wave, but probably in the best and most experimental sense imaginable), take in pretty much all of the classic Talking Heads numbers (there&apos;s one I forget the name of that&apos;s especially chilling with the chorus a series of &apos;ya-hay-hay-hay-hay-hay&apos;s&apos; from Byrne in marching formation). It&apos;s probably one of the best modern concert films.",

Another role is Rathnavel Pandian, A Strong Police Officer, an unusual character. Rocket Raja and Kaattu Poochi(Santhaanam), his partner in robbery are the funny pick pocketers. The film starts with a song &quot;Naan romba romba&quot; which is a &quot;Kuthu&quot; song has become SuperHit! Santhaanam&apos;s comedy is as usual hilarious! The way the heroine(Tamannah) falls in love with Rocket Raja seems to be funny. The song &quot;Chellam Indha Chellam&quot; is melodious. Karthi has concentrated more on the serious role. Rocket Raja&apos;s life will have a meaning when Pandian&apos;s daughter enter his life. The Father-daughter affection is shown so beautifully that it melts everyone&apos;s heart. The short song &quot;Aareeraaro&quot; is so sweet. The crime has been shown as very dirty, but the revenge taken by Pandian is ROCKING!!! Finally how the two characters meet up, how they face the villain, what happens to them is the remaining story! The climax stunt has not come so well. Totally an average and a serious Karthi Movie!",

The casting (Clifton Webb is perfect in the lead role) was top notch, and the impeccable attention to even minor details was extraordinary.  A fan of &apos;blood and guts&apos; movies would be well advised to look elsewhere...this well-crafted little gem is for the connoisseur.\n\nStephen Boyd gave a very good performance as an Irish secret agent working for the Nazis.  In several scenes, he could barely contain his contempt for the English people he encountered during his mission in London.  At one point, after setting himself up for capture by counter-intelligence agents, he awaits their arrival with his Luger pistol, obviously hoping for a bloody showdown, and when the agents fail to appear, he is both relaxed and also angry at not getting to kill anyone.  Subtle, yet amazing.\n\n 9 out of 10."

I still have the stereo vinyl recording of the music, and the program book. The film was beautifully photographed and the Cinemiracle process and stereo sound provided a cinematic experience that has never been matched since. There seems to be some question as to whether the original negatives are still intact, who has or controls them, and what condition they might be in as far as a possible restoration and re-release of the film, perhaps in IMAX or 70 mm Panavision to maintain the 3-film aspect ratio, and perhaps in HD/DVD for home viewing. If one of the major film restoration organizations such as TCM were to adopt this project, they would be contributing to the preservation of one of the finest film classics ever produced. I certainly hope that someone will take on this challenge before the negatives deteriorate beyond use, if they have not already. It is difficult to understand why something has not been done already, although it is probable that cost-benefit analysis is involved. Anyone who has not seen Windjammer would be absolutely captivated by the beauty, majesty and adventurous challenge depicted in this exceptional production.",

      "reviewBody": "Amos Kollek clearly had a premise for a movie: an abused woman must find enough money to settle an old debt and buy her estranged son from custody. But he didn&apos;t really have a plot to go with it. Bridget lurches from one relationship to another, and Kollek hopes that the idiosyncrasies and perversions of her acquaintances - a closet-lesbian spinster, a psychotic Vietnam veteran, a mentally disabled stalker and his terminally ill father - will patch over the tenuous, if non-existent links between them. No event is too improbable to work its way into the storyline, and Kollek keeps a straight face throughout, as if this is a portentous work demanding intense structural analysis.\n\nThe performances are generally sub-standard. Anna Levine, as Bridget, is alone able to communicate something of her character&apos;s desperation. That much of the plot depends on Bridget&apos;s supposed beauty, though, sits at odds with Levine&apos;s gaunt, pallid face and bony frame. Throughout the film Bridget looks unwell and disturbed. David Wike is laughable as the retarded Pete. Lance Reddick is on the wrong side of melodrama as hit-man Black. Julie Hagerty and a sinister Mark Margolis are well cast in their respective roles, but the threadbare narrative jumps beyond their characters before we are able to gain a greater insight into them.\n\nBarely a scene rings true throughout the film, and the consistently hollow dialogue immediately suggests an imperfect grasp of English on the director&apos;s part. The delivery and intonation in many conversational scenes is uneven, and none of the characters convincingly relate to one another. Technically, too, the film disappoints. The lighting is off (particularly in external shots) and the sound is tinny - all testament to a meagre budget. The editing is just as careless - a shot near the end of the film shows Bridget&apos;s son as an infant, despite that fact that he should be well into adolescence by that point.\n\nKollek certainly had a couple of interesting if unoriginal ideas for this movie, but at every turn he is undermined by a preposterous story.",

However, the movie is clever, enjoyable and the Sanderson sisters return is lots of fun.\n\nSimilar to the original, expect some camp witchcraft, spells through music and dance, and Winnie, Mary and Sarah once again on the hunt to be young, beautiful and to survive past dawn.\n\nI watched the original earlier to refresh myself, but the movie does a great job of standing alone whilst also referencing key scenes in the 1993 film which have impact on the 2022 storyline.\n\nOverall, a lot of fun for what it is and sure to be popular amongst those of us that grew up loving the original. A shame the kids from the first film didn&apos;t make a cameo!",

      "reviewBody": "Moore knew he was living on borrowed time so far as Bond was concerned. Way too old, too slow moving and paunchy to be carrying a Walther PPK for much longer. His Bond contract allowed him to make two other films during this period - post OCTOPUSSY and pre A VIEW TO A KILL (that was to be his last JB outing)\n\nWisely perhaps, he chose this role as mild-mannered but wholly professional Chicago psychiatrist Dr Judd Stevens, whose life hits a major rut after one of his patients is stabbed to death - wearing HIS coat. Having no idea what is going on for pretty much the entire movie Moore conveys Judd&apos;s plight rather well I thought. As unlike anything Moore has ever done, he must deal with finding himself simply in the wrong place for seemingly no reason.\n\nSeveral things to like about this flick - IF you care to look. Art Carney&apos;s turn as burnt-out but still cluey PI Morgens is a real gem of a performance. When Moore admits he doesn&apos;t believe in guns, Carney counters, &quot;Yeah, well I don&apos;t believe in Santa Claus, but each Christmas he still comes round.&quot; The brief scenes in his ramshackle office are really worth looking at closely.\n\nCop Steiger is a tad over the top as is his wont - give him any opportunity to rave - he&apos;s in actor&apos;s heaven. Ron Paradi as mob boss Cortini puts across one of the nastiest and inherently evil men you would ever wish to not meet and Anne Archer is well....Anne Archer.\n\nTotally unexpected last 20 seconds really lifts the film I thought.",

      "reviewBody": "Of course he was never the best actor, but somehow the American CINECITTA Divo Brad HARRIS (1933-2017) was often unlucky in the selection of his film productions. With THREE STARS FILM he was supposed to make three spaghetti westerns, two of which were made. He played with the Greek actor Vassili KARIS in WANTED SABATA (1970) and with his Venezuelan colleague Jose TORRES in DURANGO IS COMING, PAY OR DIE! (1971). After these two films, the production company went bankrupt. What now? The clever low-budget film director Roberto MAURI combined scenes from both films into a third film, under the responsibility of the quickly founded production company VIRGINIA. It&apos;s somehow understandable that everything doesn&apos;t always fit together. But that&apos;s not how a good film is made!\n\nDurango (Brad HARRIS) ends up in prison unjustly because he is accused of murder and robbery. He manages to escape through fellow prisoner Spirito Santo (Jose TORRES). Now Durango wants to prove his innocence while Spirito Santo is after the money. At the same time, Durango also wants revenge on Scott (Vassili KARIS), whom he holds responsible for the murder of his family. All of this makes for a bit of plausible back and forth, which isn&apos;t made any more entertaining by the numerous fights and shootings.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame about the missed opportunity! So this film is only recommended for die-hard Brad HARRIS fans or completists when it comes to spaghetti westerns!",

To read his work and then wait in high anticipation of the cinematic interpretation, only to be disappointed after viewing, can cause one to remain biased with screen adaptations. Though I was disappointed with the overall production of this movie, there are a few strong points I&apos;d like to mention.  I was thoroughly impressed with Drew Barrymore&apos;s acting ability at eight years of age.  She was a natural and carried this movie.  Because of the depth in which she played her character, I will give this movie a six- I give her acting a ten.  A weaker actress would have made this movie more difficult to watch.  Charlie Sheen and George C. Scott helped the movie along too.  Otherwise the movie lacked the direction and mood that Stephen King usually generates in his books.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s love at first sight for Peter (James Stewart) when he spots Francey (Ginger Rogers) in a dance hall in &quot;Vivacious Lady,&quot; a 1938 comedy also starring Charles Coburn, Beulah Bondi and James Ellison. Stewart is a college professor, and the son of the university president. He&apos;s engaged to a drab young woman from a very good family. When he goes to a dance hall to get his cousin Keith (Ellison) so they make their train, he sees Ginger, whom his cousin is also attracted to. By the next day, Stewart and Rogers are married and on their way back to the college town to face the family.\n\nHowever, facing the family isn&apos;t too easy. Peter&apos;s domineering father keeps ordering him around, his mother keeps getting faint from a weak heart whenever there&apos;s a conflict...and somehow, no one knows that Francey and Peter are married and think she&apos;s dating Keith. Then, in order to get her into the prom, they have to say she&apos;s a botany student. One of the best scenes occurs at the prom, when Francey and Peter&apos;s fiancé get into a horrific catfight outside of the dance just as Peter brings his father out in another attempt to announce he&apos;s married.\n\nBut the best scene takes place in the room Francey has rented. She has a temperamental Murphy bed, and Stewart does everything he can to bring it down - banging doors, drawers, stomping, hoping it will fall.\n\nStewart is delightful as a young man who has to decide on priorities, and Rogers is a great match for him. She is incredibly beautiful in this movie. Handsome James Ellison gives a wonderful performance as cousin Keith, and Coburn and Bondi are perfect as the parents.\n\nA light movie, some great scenes, fantastic stars glowing with youth - you can&apos;t ask for more.",

      "reviewBody": "War of the Colossal Beast is a sequel to Gordon&apos;s earlier The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), and it picks up where that one left off. However, the film features a different cast. It was distributed theatrically by American International Pictures as the top half of a double feature with Attack of the Puppet People.\n\nThis sequel has competent acting performances, fair direction and ordinary special effects. It is also an obvious attempt at milking dry an already successful formula.\n\nUnlike the first film, the character of Manning virtually has no dialogue which makes it far more difficult to feel empathy for the character.\n\nThe special effects are pretty ordinary by any standards with great reliance made on double exposure shots. However, quite a good job was made with Manning&apos;s facial make-up and the audio of his character&apos;s grunts and groans which effectively contribute to the &quot;horror&quot; aspect of the film.\n\nThe film is short enough as it is but unfortunately much of it consists of flashback footage from the first film which merely serves to pad the movie.\n\nDespite the film&apos;s title, the Colossal Beast does not really engage in much of a &quot;war&quot; with anyone. For much of the time we see Manning being captured, him lying on his back and some military vehicles being maneuvered into position.\n\nThe War of the Colossal Beast does serve to highlight one theme that threads itself through many aspects of life in any era. Namely, how we choose to deal with big and seemingly intractable problems which are often of our own making.",

He lives with his parents and sister in Liegnitz (today it is named Legnica as part of Poland) about 100 miles east of Dresden.\n\nLiving conditions are rapidly deteriorating, although the Singer family is trying hard not to give the oppressors any reason to treat them badly. Cut off from all escape routes in the midst of war, they must hide and eventually separate to seek survival on their own.\n\nDirector Peter Lilienthal&apos;s decent 1979 artwork, whose strength is its realism, shows fatalistic people, whether German or Jewish, in a downward spiral with no escape, without zooming or panning. He just changed the focus! In short, worth seeing, despite the slow start.",

First of all, viewers unfamiliar with this geographical area will be introduced, through stunning cinematography, to the magical landscape of this part of northern Sweden. If you thought you could not love a bog, you will start searching, like me, for a coffee table book on &quot;Bogs, Fens, and Marshes,&quot; (I made that up -someone publish this book, please!) The story is compelling, thoughtfully and superbly rendered by cast, writer, director, and all involved. A little girl struggles with grief over the loss of her father, &quot;talking&quot; to him in the bogs she is forbidden to visit (they are very dangerous if you don&apos;t know how to navigate them), but knows he loved. Life is made especially hard for her in school by a female teacher totally lacking in compassion and understanding of the loss she is dealing with, and who seems fixated on her students speaking Swedish ONLY, rather than Finnish, which many of them speak as their native language. The relationship between the little girl and her teacher comes to an extremely gripping, moving, touching climax which will undoubtedly surprise the audience. Humanity pours out of this film, especially this &quot;stand-off&quot; between teacher and pupil which washes the audience in awe of what film can do. I did not even realize this film was for children. I am 42, a movie connoisseur, especially foreign films, and this is on my top ten list. It is a gem, and why it has not come out on DVD is a total mystery to me. If anyone knows how to obtain a copy of this film, please post this information! A movie of similar caliber that I would suggest is &quot;The Color of Milk,&quot; (Norway/Sweden) (2002).",

I was so mesmerized with this tale, when it was over I spent 30 minutes long distance on the phone with my wife explaining the plot. When I got back to the States I some how found an old DVD of the movie on the internet and bought it immediately. My wife and I watched this wonderful movie again recently (Jan 2017) and ended up crying together all over again! A Summer Story is so well cast (Imogen Stubbs in the lead female role and James Wilby as the lead male) and with a story that is so beautifully written. The production values are extremely well done that you feel transported to the 1904 Dartmoor countryside and the lovely coastal town of Torquay. Beware to be supplied with a box of tissues for the plot climax at the end!\n\nTechnical Note: The DVD this viewer watched had high contrast, with narrow dynamic range, resulting in poor image detail in the shadows and highlights, and loss of screen resolution. Film chain transfer is of low quality and accomplished on a non-CCD device, with no digital post-transfer correction, and displayed reverse screen vignetting.",

The copy I had made it hard to read the subtitles sometimes, but it was usually pretty obvious what was going on, because at that point Okuzaki Kenzo was usually beating somebody up for not telling him the truth.\n\nIt is sometimes hard to believe that this film is a documentary, because you want it to be fiction. It is not easy to watch, but whole-heartedly worth it, because even though it forces you to think about a lot of uncomfortable things, WWII was a very uncomfortable time, so it&apos;s rather appropriate, that way.",

The first film is obviously the best, vicious and exciting in its simplicity, while the third, CUBE ZERO, is an interesting idea that takes the form of a prequel. CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE is a straightforward sequel to the first film, with significant changes that make a difference.\n\nAlthough a number of characters are once again trapped inside a cube, the emphasis this time around isn&apos;t on solving puzzles and avoiding traps. Instead the characters must figure out a way to escape from their prison and to avoid the impending death which follows them at all times. There&apos;s lots of tension and interplay between the various characters, as before, and I liked the acting from the unknown cast which carries the story along.\n\nThere are some good twists here, especially with the climax that heads into the fourth dimension, although with a little blood and death for people who like that kind of thing. The special effects are very average on a low budget but as usual it&apos;s the ideas which make this film work. It&apos;s not on the level of CUBE but I do appreciate the fact that they did something different instead of just doing a slavish copy for a sequel.",

I AM HONEST! \n\nMatilda Reid (Ann Harding) is in danger of being declared senile at the urging of her nephew, Phillip (Reginald Denny). To keep him from controlling her estate, Matilda must find her three adopted sons, who left home long ago. One of them, Michael (George Brent), lives in New York, where he&apos;s incurred a $75,000 debt. Another, fugitive Mario (George Raft), is hiding in South America. The last, Jonathan (Randolph Scott), is a small-time cowboy. All three must come home to save Matilda&apos;s fortune.\n\nNow this film is nice change of pace from &quot;HALLMARK MOVIES&quot;. The cast brings the most out of a screenplay that is most confusing. I have to admit that I watch this in over 3 evenings so I will have to re- watch it again. The film is enjoyable.

Great job! The only thing is that I felt that the movie lacks a little bit action through the turmoil of urban life. The director focuses on littler girl more than necessary I guess. We hear some external voices (like the people on the bus) but the camera is always on the girl so this feels a little bit passive. Other than that it&apos;s really great!"

We saw her for the last time in a concert in AUSTRALIA we never forget.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1985 after a Times Square screening.\n\n&quot;Night Train to Terror&quot; is a hodge-podge of at least three separate horror films, crudely edited together as an omnibus picture.\n\nWraparound footage has God (Ferdy Mayne sporting an arresting white beard) and the Devil (Lu Sickler) quarreling on a train over which human souls they will get, giving rise to three case histories. (An inept rock group is also on the train with its souls up for grabs, and irritating musical numbers interrupt the action at random.)\n\nFirst two cases were filmed circa 1982 by director John Carr and play like excerpts from unfinished features, both presented here with the entire story carried by voiceover narration. John Phillip Law toplines in &quot;Harry&quot;, sent to a sanitarium after his car crashes, where mad doctors and a crazed orderly (Charles Moll, of tv&apos;s &quot;Night Court&quot; series) use him to pick up pretty girls who are then killed, their organs sold to medical schools. Segment includes lots of nudity, gore and many shots filmed out-of-focus. Next, Meridith Haze portrays &quot;Gretta&quot;, an aspiring pianist, duped into joining The Death Club, where jaded folks play fatal, sadistic games.\n\nFinale, apparently shot in 1979 as a feature title &quot;Cataclysm&quot; (which received an R rating in 1981 from the MPAA on its own), is a religious tract in which veteran screenwriter Philip Yordan gets on a soapbox. James Hansen (Charles Moll, again) is a Nobel prize winner who has written a book &quot;God Is Dead&quot; and goes on tv preaching his anti-religion party line. He gets his comeuppance from an ageless Nazi named Olivier who in fact is the devil&apos;s emissary. Cameron Mitchell appears as a cop hunting Olivier.\n\nMishmash features stock footage, including widescreen shots hilariously &quot;squeezed&quot; in an attempt to match the other scenes, plus several stop motion animation monsters that comically battle tiny puppet versions of the cast members."

In the 80&apos;ties there were a lot of movies in the &quot;atomic wasteland Mad Max&quot; category, this one will fit nicely in the row of movies that failed to get past the firing ramp. I watched the movie in 1080p and it didn&apos;t help much, so if you love Sci-Fi B movies you can give it a try on day, if nothing else come to your mind.\n\nThe scenery was great, and the fighting scenes were &quot;sort of&quot; OK, but everything else didn&apos;t deliver the silver screen magic at all.

The story is subtle, dark and well crafted with an imaginative flair. More of a character study, we are shown the mind of a little girl trying to find her place.\n\nCinematically, I thought the camera work was beautiful. I loved the dark lighting, filled with shadows and muted tones (an ostensible parallel to the life of young Cayetana). Not to mention, there were also many lovely shot compositions. I thought the music worked well, and I thought it was edited well. The direction was strong, and I thought the acting was great as well. A dark film, but it has its moments of surreality.",

One day, Thomas witnesses a masked man killing Cathy and he calls the police, but he does not know her name or where she lives. Detective Claire Bligh (Emilia Fox), who is an specialist in Internet crimes, comes from Paris to investigate the case and the discloses that Cathy lived in Amsterdam. Further, several women has been murdered in the last years in a similar way that Cathy did. She teams up with Thomas and they discover that the murder are related and are part of snuff movies made for millionaires.\n\n&quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; is a very disappointing movie with confused story and screenplay. The plot is such a mess that it is only possible to understand the storyline. The characters and situations are awfully developed and in the end I did not understand many subplots and the motives of many characters. Edward Furlong is awful and watching this movie is a waste of time and money. To make it worst, the DVD has problems with the audio after chapter 7. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

We both enjoyed those race scenes that involved Secretariat that showcased both his struggles and triumphs. On the drama front, while there are some compellingly played scenes of quiet desperation and of occasional conflict, it&apos;s the uplifting parts that really gets to the heart of the matter. Only thing I really have a quibble with is some of the lines betray the time period like that character played by Fred Dalton Thompson wouldn&apos;t compare something to Super Fly since that movie came out in 1972 and his scene takes place in 1969. And how about the kids not noticeably aging during the four-year setting. Otherwise, Secretariat is a quality feel-good movie that one always expects from The Disney Company and is recommended.",

She owed Dudley Nichols a favor for adapting and directing the story of Sister Kenny, a dream project for her and this was his but could only get it made with her participation, she even admitted that she was wrong for it but felt a sense of loyalty and went forward. Katina Paxinou gives an overblown operatic performance in a part that would have fit Garbo perfectly. The play is really too complex for a standard film version, the extended PBS production in the late 70s with Joan Hackett and Roberta Maxwell got it right but that one clocks in at just under five hours.",

It&apos;s a movie for people who are willing to risk a certain amount of emotional discomfort to gain the benefits of experiencing the world through unaccustomed perspectives. It&apos;s for those who want to learn about human beings on the margins of society, the forgotten, the pathological, the lost.\n\nIt&apos;s the sort of film that can&apos;t be appreciated without a high tolerance for unsympathetic protagonists, unreliable narrators, unintelligible motivations, and morally ambiguous conclusions. \n\nIn short, Butterfly Kiss demands an intellectual curiosity and nimbleness of mind that&apos;s not always characteristic of American audiences.\n\nThis is not to argue that it&apos;s necessarily a good film, or successful at achieving its ambitions. More than once, while watching it, I found myself wondering how much relation to real people this story might actually have. Unlike Monster, with which it has obvious parallels, Butterfly Kiss doesn&apos;t appear to be based on factual events.\n\nThe film&apos;s ability to cause me to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; suffered from a touch too much Grand Guignol excess and, perhaps more damningly, writerly artifice. (For no clear reason, the protagonists are named &quot;You&quot;(Eunice) &amp; &quot;Me&quot; (Miriam).) \n\nBut the characters kept on surprising me, which indicates, if nothing else, that there&apos;s something vital and alive about this story. By the end, I was moved to pity for these two deeply damaged women, and, perhaps more importantly, I was moved to compassion.\n\nFor that, I&apos;d sit through an unpleasant movie any day of the week.",

      "reviewBody": "How much the `Hebrew Israelites&apos; depicted in this film have in common with &apos;real&apos; Jews is a mystery that is never revealed in this film.  In fact, nothing about this religious community is explained.  `The Kingdom&apos;, as this community is referred to, is comprised of several hundred black people, most of whom -if not all - emigrated from the United States to Israel.  The film explains nothing of the religion, how this exodus of sorts began, how these `Israelites&apos; interact with the other (real) Jews outside of their community, and how they manage to support themselves financially.  There is some talk about their disenchantment with the U.S., what with its racism and cycle of drugs and crime in the black community, but it would be interesting to know how these folks took such a dramatic step in this direction.  This documentary instead chooses to look solely at an element of their society that makes the Hassidic community seem progressive in comparison.  In `The Kingdom&apos;, polygamy is quite acceptable.  We don&apos;t learn how many of these Israelite families practice polygamy but given the fact that 52% of the general population of the Earth is female, well statistically, there just wouldn&apos;t be enough wives to go around for every man (especially since in the law of The Kingdom, a man CAN have up to six wives)!  So, we don&apos;t know if the family that this film focuses on is extremely unique, somewhat common, if The Kingdom is just lucky enough to breed more females than males, or if there&apos;s some kind of recruiting program for women going on back in the States (WHITE slavery anyone?).  Who knows?  I sure would like to!\n\nThe documentary is cinema verite- i.e. no narrative, just bits of facts that will very likely give people all sorts of impressions that may or may not have much to do with the reality of this community.  Most of the eye-view we get is from the two wives of one particular man.  They don&apos;t seem very happy except when they suddenly become aware that the camera is focusing on them. One can&apos;t help but cringe to hear one of the `Israelites&apos; in the film talk of past slavery, and then see how it is still propagated against women in this community. In The Kingdom, the man is king.  The husband featured refers to his wives as queens, but I&apos;ve never heard of any queen who had no choice but to live as a servant to her husband.  It would be interesting to know how a man who has a job as a laborer (machinist) can support himself, ten kids and two wives.  It would seem that the community might have taken a page or two out of the Kibbutz world; -everyone chips in- but in a Kibbutz, each community is mostly self-sufficient by growing crops that bring in income for the community.  Your guess is as good as mine where the shekels ARE coming from, but I could imagine that it&apos;s part of the overall income from selling books and paraphernalia throughout the U.S. and other countries.  Again, who knows?  One also wonders if this cult -er, religion- enjoys non-profit status, since Israel does not recognize them in a religious context, let alone as citizens.  Overall, this documentary brings up far more questions than it answers.  I&apos;ll try to give the filmmakers some slack because I see that IMDb has registered this film as having a 60 minute running time, and I saw it on the Trio channel, which means that about fifteen minutes were cut out to make way for commercials.  Still, a documentary of such a controversial subject needs to have a variety of angles and as much in depth coverage as possible."

      "reviewBody": "A young man is a psychologically mess... his girlfriend leaves him, he doesn&apos;t mesh well with his friends, he loses his volunteer job. He turns to the strangest place for help: a Canadian therapist who moves in with him.\n\nThis is director Oliver Irving&apos;s first and only film, as of this writing. And it&apos;s a good one. It is an IFC film, and there&apos;s no denying it fits in that category alongside Wes Anderson films and perhaps &quot;Garden State&quot;. This won&apos;t be as big, and with good reason, but thanks to Robert Pattinson&apos;s popularity, it will get more viewings from people who would otherwise never have heard of it.\n\nI really enjoyed the therapist (who sadly appears to have passed during the making of this film). And Pattinson does a fine job as a whiny nerd. His character is incredibly annoying, but such a different one from &quot;Twilight&quot; or &quot;Remember Me&quot; that it gives me the sense that he just might have a bit of range inside of him and may someday break free of the Edward Cullen trap.",

      "reviewBody": "Jet Lag is a romantic comedy. It follows all the usual routes, but offers great acting and good humour all the way.\n\nJuliette Binoche is Rose, a thirtysomething who is finally taking control of her life and leaving her abusive boyfriend Sergio (Sergi Lopez).\n\nJean Reno is Felix. A frazzled businessman on his way to re-kindle his romance with an old flame.\n\nHowever when a strike and fog halt all flights in Charles de Gaulle the two meet cute and end up spending the evening together. Of course we know they are made for each other, but thats not the point. Its not where they end up its how they get there.\n\nJet Lag opens with huge energy and a real sense of airport chaos. It then focuses in on the duo in on a hotel room as they spend time together trading insults and exchanging banter. The dialogue is sparkling and the performances spot on.\n\nThen ineveitably their planes take off and they go their seperate ways... or do they?\n\nThompsons film is a breath of fresh air with Juliette Binoche a revelation in a totally &quot;un-binoche&quot; role. She is cheap and common with a heart of gold. Reno is very much her comic foil, and glerefully allows her the lime light.\n\nJet Lag is a refreshing take on an old format. It will not suffer on the small screen either so catch it on DVD!",

The actors are horrible, unable to even hold a basic conversation in a human fashion. The camera is horrible, capturing willingly minutes of exposition dialog while being unable to show what&apos;s happening during action sequences. And the script is horrible as i am still not sure what was actually happening here.\n\nThe general plot is very genereric. There is lots and lots of boring exposition dialog as filler. And yet it&apos;s so incomprehensive, i i still have no idea how this world functions. Then there are the attempts at drama and conflict, which are all way above what the actors are able to deliver. And the story twists are laughable and predictable.\n\nThis movie isn&apos;t even bad enough to be hillarous, it&apos;s just simply boring. The worst kind.",

It started out ordinary enough with young cadets in a military school introducing themselves and stating why they joined. Much to my surprise, the wide swath of kids (teens really) had varying reasons for joining that extended beyond blood lust or just seeing how cool it would be to kill. That, in itself, was a big notch of respectability in my eyes. I expected a lot of HOO RAH type speech and antics and I didn&apos;t see that.\n\nFurthermore, I looked for the typical teen movie clichés, because these were teens after all. Although it wasn&apos;t a high school setting, I was looking for the ultra popular beauty queen, the muscle-headed jock, the dweeb and the supporting cast. Fortunately, those characters never appeared. Halo proved to be a deeper, layered, better thought out film than I expected. It could be considered slow, but I thought it was right on point. Very nicely done.",

      "reviewBody": "Roman Polanski&apos;s first full length feature is a simple, minimalist piece filled with male posturing, dead end situations, claustrophobic environments and eerie calm. This is part of Polanski&apos;s art house beginnings, but many of its themes and much of its style would be carried through to his later, more accessible work.\n\nLike many a Polanski picture, Knife in the Water shows us men competing over a woman. Typically however this is to the end of making the men look ridiculous rather than objectifying the woman. Here the competition is the central theme, and the bulk of the film is basically a series of set pieces in which the middle-aged husband and the young hitchhiker attempt to outdo each other or show the other up. This drama is concentrated and focused by having only the three characters, and confining the action almost entirely to one location. This kind of minimalism is a safe, simple way to make a straightforward, uncluttered story  a good strategy for an up and coming director  but it&apos;s a lot harder to make a really great picture out of such simple elements, and the young Polanski does fall somewhat short here.\n\nWhat Polanski does have is his natural talent and feel for cinematic form. His sense of rhythm was evident from his earliest shorts, and by this point he had clearly settled upon a style of slow, even paces, letting scenes take as much time as they needed and never being afraid to hold a shot into so-called &quot;dead time&quot; if he felt it was necessary. Often, the stillness of Polanski&apos;s pictures could build up a greater feeling of dread or tension than speed and shocks. Here, the pace is leisurely, in tune with Komeda&apos;s breezy jazz score, a sound synonymous with early Polanski. It may be slow but Knife in the Water has great atmosphere.\n\nAnother of Polanski&apos;s strengths was in his feel for space, particularly confined space. In Knife in the Water we have a kind of contradiction on this level, because a small boat in the middle of a lake is both a very wide open space and a small confined one. You kind of get half the effect of a later Polanski picture such as The Tenant  you do get the sense that the characters and the camera itself are incredibly restricted in their environment, but of course you don&apos;t get that feeling of all the walls pressing in on you. Nevertheless, Polanski was a master at creating this sense, and he does tend to surround the camera with bits of boat or actor. There are numerous close-ups  typical of the early Polanski although it&apos;s something he would drop later in his career  which give a slightly surreal look to some of the shots. A particularly effective moment is the first shot of the boat drifting out across the lake with trees dotted in the background, which then cuts to a close-up of Krystyna, the wife, lying on her back filling the lower half of the frame, with the exact same background as the previous shot.\n\nKnife in the Water is a fairly good film with some good ideas. It suffers a bit from style over substance but is well acted and well directed and is not long enough to get overly tedious. Better things were to come from Polanski once he moved out of Poland and began his English-language film career.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie plot concerns the lives of Spanish immigrants and hilariously showing us how was the existence of that time . At a village called Paralejos Arriba arrives Angelino (José Sacristán) from Munich , he drives a luxurious car , a ¨Mercedes¨ , and tells extraordinary feats about the German miracle and their wealthy lives . It excites to Pepe (Alfredo Landa) who decides to go Germany to seek fortune , in spite of the opposition his girlfriend Pilar (Tina Sainz) . One time in Múnich , Pepe gets lousy works and part-time jobs , as cleaning crystals (accomppanied by a German colleague nicely played by Manuel Summers) , and pasting posters . Pepe resides at a boarding house where is also Angelino , along with a exiled Republican doctor called Emilio (Antonio Ferrandis) and the loving couple formed by Maria (Gemma Cuervo) and Miguel (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) . Both of whom wish yearning to save enough money to return Spain to buy a gas station . One day , Pilar arrives in Múnich and surprising discovers Pepe working almost naked as an advertisement man and things go wrong .\n\nThe flick packs silly incidents , funny comical sketches , tongue-in-cheek , grotesque situations and above all , it especially contains catching touches of humor and irony . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylishly agreeable . There are some nice jokes in the film and the cast , playing eccentric characters , make a cosy fit . Being well set by that time , during the sixties when the Spanish people emigrated at European countries to survive . This hilarious as well as interesting film is full of humor , brief drama , touching scenes , good feeling and narrating the conflict between the traditional Spanish society and modernity . It is a simple , and humorous portrait of a time when the Spanish had to go other countries in order to encounter jobs . ¨Vente a Alemania Pepe¨ was a success among spectators , considered to be an acceptable , commercial and funny Spanish comedy . Its nostalgic look has some great moments that reflect a Spain of the sixties and seventies : a poor country during the years when the action takes place . It is full of typical Spanish topics , a simple plot and including atmospheric sets of a boarding house that seems more a Spanish Pension than a German place . The flick is a comical as well briefly dramatic homage to those people from the sixties and seventies that went to make a new life , leaving family and relatives as well as friends behind . As they find it almost impossible to adapt themselves to habits , language and an atmosphere in the modern country that seems alien to them now . There takes place the problems to adapt into Germany . Alfredo Landa gives a very nice acting as the dreamer Pepe who decides to attempt his luck traveling to Germany , to carry out the &quot;German Dream¨ . The screenplay by notorious writers Vicente Coello and Vicente Escribá pays a loving tribute to those men who emigrated to seek fortune and sacrificed it all in order to help their impoverished families . The players are simply perfect, the tale flows at the alright pace , and you enjoy the picture from beginning to end . \n\nColorful cinematography by Raúl Pérez Cubero who shows splendidly the ambient by that time . Evocative as well as atmospheric soundtrack by Antón Garcia Abril . The motion picture was professionally directed by Pedro Lazaga , though it has some flaws and gaps . Lazaga was a Spanish craftsman who directed various film with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria . Pedro was a prolific director and writer, known for Los Chicos Del Preu (1967), Cuerda De Presos (1956) and María Morena (1951). He directed all kind of genres such as Peplum : Siete Espartanos , Wartime : Cuerda De Presos , Posicion Avanzada , Torrepartida , La Patrulla ; Drama : Rostro De Asesino , Otro Arbol De Guernica , but especially known for comedies in low budget . Director Pedro Lazaga made , during the fifties and early sixties , eight films , mostly comedies : ¨Muchachas De Azul¨, Ana Dice Si¨. ¨Luna De Verano¨, ¨Económicamente Debiles¨ , ¨Trio Damas¨ for screenwriter and producer Jose Luis Dibildos and his ¨Agata Films Productions¨. The best of all them results to be ¨Los Tramposos¨. He continued making comedies such as Patrulla De Los Once , Los Tramposos , Sabian Demasiado , El Vikingo , ¡No Firmes Más Letras, Cielo! , Vente a Ligar Al Oeste , Hasta El Matrimonio Nos Separe , La Amante Perfecta , Fulanita y Sus Menganos , among others . His most known films were with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria such as : Abuelo Made in Spain , Padre De La Criatura , Alegre Divorciado , Estoy Hecho Un Chaval , Vaya Par Gemelos , among others . As well as others produced by Vicente Escriba and starred by Alfredo Landa, such as : Vente a Alemania Pepe , Vente a Ligar a Oeste and No Firmes Mas Letras Cielo .",

      "name": "A masterpiece of Gothic horror!",
      "reviewBody": "After the enormous success of 1995&apos;s classic mix of horror and science-fiction, &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, the relatively small studio named Hammer Film Productions decided to dedicate most of their productions to the fantastic genres. A sequel to &quot;Quatermass&quot; quickly entered into the studio&apos;s plans, but it would be another movie what would become a success even bigger than &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; and the birth of what is now known as &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;: Terence Fisher&apos;s &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;. Thanks to its use of vibrant colors and daring (for the time) sexual undertones, Fisher&apos;s reinterpretation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; renewed the interest in horror films and set the basis for a new style of Gothic horror. A style that would be perfected in Fisher&apos;s next movie for Hammer, another reinterpretation of a classic of Gothic literature, Bram Stoker&apos;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.\n\nIn this version of the famous novel, Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) is a librarian who arrives to Count Dracula&apos;s (Christopher Lee) castle to work. At the castle, Jonathan finds a strange woman (Valerie Gaunt) who asks him to help her escape from Dracula&apos;s enslavement. Jonathan agrees, but she is not a normal woman, she&apos;s a vampire, an undead creature who preys on humans to feed on their blood. This doesn&apos;t surprise Jonathan, as he is actually a vampire hunter determined to kill Dracula, who is an ancient and powerful vampire. Unfortunately, his plan goes wrong and ends up bitten by Dracula, transforming him in the very thing he was going to kill. Days later, Harker&apos;s friend, Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) arrives looking for his friend, but finds him as a vampire and is forced to kill him. However, this is only the beginning, as now Dracula has Jonathan&apos;s fianceé Lucy (Carol Marsh) as his next target.\n\nLike &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;, the screenplay for this movie (titled &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; in the U.S. to avoid copyright infringement with Universal&apos;s film) was written by Jimmy Sangster, who makes a considerably different story than the one done in Tod Browning&apos;s movie. For starters, this time Van Helsing is not only the one with the necessary knowledge to hunt the monster, but also a proficient fighter and overall a more active character than before. Count Dracula has also been reinterpreted, as Sangster takes the sensuality of the vampire one step beyond, and enhances his aggressive brutality without diminishing the Count&apos;s classy elegance. A notable trait in Sangster&apos;s script is the considerable amount of development he gives to his characters, as while the plot a bit simplistic, he makes us really care about the protagonists while at the same time making Dracula a fascinating creature.\n\nOnce again, Terence Fisher&apos;s directing is what elevates this work from a good story to a great movie, as in &quot;Dracula&quot; he seems to take everything that made &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; a hit to the next level, resulting in the definitive example of Hammer Horror. With Bernard Robinson&apos;s beautiful art direction and Jack Asher&apos;s excellent cinematography, Fisher creates an atmospheric Gothic nightmare in bright colors that even today remains as fresh and influential as it was the day it came out. Fisher&apos;s use of color in horror here is even more calculated, as also uses them to shock and terrify as exemplified by his fixation with the bright red of blood. This time Dracula is a real monster, and Fisher makes sure to make him the ultimate predator, however, his seductive image is kept intact as Fisher plays on the Victorian sexual repression with subversive subtlety.\n\nOne of the best elements in this version of Stoker&apos;s novel is definitely the acting of the cast, which is for the most part of an excellent quality. The stars of &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, appear here in the roles that made them legends. As Dracula, Christopher Lee shows his very powerful presence, making a terrifying portrayal of the undead monster that almost equals Lugosi&apos;s classic performance. On the other hand, Cushing truly is the star of the film with the magnificent display of talent he gives as Dr. Van Helsing. Personally I think that nobody has given a better performance as Van Helsing than the one Cushing does in this movie. However, the movie is not only about Cushing and Lee, as Michael Gough truly shines in his role as Arthur Holmwood, Lucy&apos;s brother forced to join Van Helsing&apos;s battle against Dracula in order to save his family.\n\nThe rest of the cast is also excellent, with great performances by Melissa Stribling as Arthur&apos;s wife Mina, and the aforementioned Carol Marsh and John Van Eyssen, who make the best out of their certainly small roles. Credit must go to Fisher&apos;s directing of his cast as well, as he really seems to get the best out of each one of the actors, making &quot;Dracula&quot; one of the best acted movies of the ones Hammer produced. In fact, if there&apos;s a flaw in this Gothic masterpiece, that would be that sadly there isn&apos;t enough time to fully enjoy each one of the diverse characters that Sangster, Fisher and the cast have created in this movie. Just like any other story with multiple film versions, it&apos;s hard to resist the temptation to pick a &quot;best version&quot; of &quot;Dracula&quot;, specially when two highly celebrated films (this one and Browning&apos;s) are among those adaptations. \n\nPersonally, I prefer Browning&apos;s 1931 version over this one, however, Terence Fisher&apos;s &quot;Dracula&quot; is a masterpiece of Gothic horror as good as the one by Universal, and my choice is based more on personal preferences than on any superiority in terms of quality. Thanks to Fisher&apos;s masterful directing and the amazing performances of its cast, &quot;Dracula&quot;, or &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; as it&apos;s known in America, easily ranks among the best movies that came out of the legendary Hammer Film Productions, and simply one of the best horror movies ever made. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Mahesh Babu is simply amazing in the role of Surya. His dialog delivery and expressions will send a tingle down your spine. He exudes pure menace when giving a &apos;dhamki&apos; to his opponents. He has shown nice variations in his performance. And he looks stunningly handsome as usual. Mahesh Babu shoulders this movie on his own. The swagger, the attitude and his panache will be a big draw.\n\nKajal Aggarwal looks gorgeous as Chitra and she has some interesting moments with Mahesh Babu. She does not have much scope for performance however.\n\nPuri Jagan is the other invisible hero of the movie. Take a bow sir, for some of the best dialog&apos;s seen in recent times. Each dialog explodes like a bullet and when delivered by Mahesh Babu, the result is devastatingly effective. The movie is high on entertainment factor and there is hardly a boring moment in the film. The sequences where Mahesh Babu sets about establishing his dominance are highly innovative.\n\nAll the songs have been picturized well but &apos;Sir Osthara&apos; song and &apos;Chandamama&apos; stand out for their sheer beauty.\n\nDialogues..Dialogues and Dialogues...They are an incredible asset to the movie. The timing is perfect and the punch is incredible. Cinematography is good. Editing is neat. Fights and songs have been composed well.\n\nScreenplay is highly entertaining and narration is fast paced. I enjoyed this flick a lot go and grab your tickets friends...",

      "name": "Polish classic World War II comedy",
      "reviewBody": "The film is one of classic Polish comedies, often aired in Polish TV, and I like it quite much. The main hero is Polish soldier Private Franek Dolas, a charming wangler, who is convinced, that he had started World War Two with his accidental shot (it is a bravura life role of Marian Kociniak). He escapes from a POW camp, and then desperately tries to join the Polish Army, being organized in Great Britain. The film is quite long three-part trilogy, but we follow adventures of Private Dolas from 1 September 1939 towards the end of the war, across Nazi occupied Europe, Middle East and North Africa. And there is also a romance plot in last part.\n\nThe whole story is inspired by fates and stories of many Polish soldiers, who escaped from occupied country and got to French or British allies to continue fighting. It was truly a difficult task during the war, because they had to travel illegally through neutral or Nazi-allied countries, avoiding imprisonment or internment. Many of them found themselves eventually in North Africa, where Polish units fought on British side in 1941-1942 against Germans and Italians. One patrol even captured Italian military bordello indeed...\n\nSince Franek Dolas travels through different countries, a humour mainly explores national stereotypes and cultural clashes, but in rather gentle and non-derogatory way. So, the Germans are unable to write down an overcomplicated fake Polish name (Brzeczyszczykiewicz), the Yugoslavians are hospitable, while the British are stiff and care about nothing during a tea time (it also was an experience of Polish soldiers, raised in different culture). On the other hand, the Poles, personalized by the main hero, are reckless and always get into trouble. In fact, Private Dolas succeeds in many things only by accident. French captain is always drunk on wine and wants to fight for Marshall Petain - but on the other hand, his soldiers join the Free French to continue fighting. The Italians try to surrender, or they fight only for their women - but we also see brave Italian commandos. A great and remarkable thing in this film is, that all characters speak their own languages, what makes language barriers obvious, and increases reality feeling.\n\nThe film was made as black and white, but gained much thanks to a digital colorization.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Sea Beast&apos; features incredible animation, and some of the most realistic animated characters (humans) I&apos;ve ever seen - with regards to appearance and proportion. Jacob is also a rather sexy animated creation, mind you!\n\nSpeaking of Jacob, he is one of the film&apos;s protagonists. As a youngster, he was rescued by Captain Crow and has been living with him ever since. They are monster hunters. Fresh on the trail of the elusive Red Bluster, Captain Crow abandons the mission (against his will) to save a ship under attack by a sea monster.\n\nThe Royals pay Captain Crow to hunt sea monsters, but when he fails to capture the Red Bluster on his latest mission, they inform him they will no longer pay for hunters. Instead, they built their own ship, and the King challenges Captain Crow to see who would be the first to capture the Red Bluster.\n\nAn orphan, Maisie, who&apos;s parents were killed by a sea monster, stows away on Captain Crow&apos;s ship and join them on their adventure. The film&apos;s first half was mature, with action, adventure and even suspense all the way. It had an incredible sense of realism until that defining moment (almost exactly at the halfway mark) when it suddenly reduced the film to a &apos;cute&apos; kid&apos;s adventure.\n\nAfter that &apos;Pinocchio&apos; moment (yeah, you&apos;ll recognize it when you see it!), the characters suddenly resorted to silly actions typical of animated films aimed at a younger demographic, and the suspense made way for humour (even slapstick). The believability was completely gone with the feared Red Bluster now being &apos;adorable&apos;. The film even had a &apos;How to train your Dragon&apos; character, Blue, acting almost exactly as Toothless.\n\nThe film nevertheless remained exciting (although not as much as the first half), and it certainly was entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 1970s, Denmark produces a number of sex comedies that somehow managed to combine slapstick humour with hardcore sex. In particular, this applied to the &quot;tegn&quot; series which started with this film.\n\nIn many ways &quot;I jomfruens tegn&quot; was less accomplished than the later films. The comedy was given too little room to gather any momentum, and as a result this film is not quite as playful and carefree as the others in the series. Its biggest weakness is that its young female characters appear without any signs of individuality, they are just fresh meat.  This leaves the film without a focal point for the viewer.  I would not be surprised if the filmmakers simply hired a bunch of whores from nearby Hamburg who did not speak a word of Danish - consequently they weren&apos;t given any lines which makes character development somewhat difficult.\n\nStill, despite all these flaws the film still compares favourably with 1990s pornography (which is admittedly not a tough benchmark), due to higher production values and a less cynical atmosphere, and the unusual genre combination gives it genuine curiosity value.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m sure everyone has to mention the most obvious thing about this movie, that nearly all the characters are Chinese played by non-chinese actors. But this is no Charlie Chan with silly accents. None of the actors engage in cheap stereotypes. There&apos;s nothing here that&apos;s anywhere near as embarrassing as Mickey Rooney&apos;s Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s... or, much more recently, Johnny Depp&apos;s version of Tonto in The Lone Ranger. The story itself depicts the Chinese American community in a generally favorable light... despite its focus being on the Tongs of San Francisco&apos;s Chinatown.  Robinson&apos;s Tong assassin is an honorable and admirable man, despite his profession.\n\nSo with that out of the way, this was a pretty great story and Robinson&apos;s character is complex. He wants to be free of his violent past as an assassin for the Tong, he wants to acclimate to life in the U.S. and be a good citizen... but he&apos;s also tied to tradition and sworn oaths. It&apos;s was less formulaic than I&apos;d expect, I wasn&apos;t quite sure where it was leading till I was 3/4 through it. Seeing as it&apos;s pre-code it&apos;s not as overtly moralistic as later films.  It looks great too. There are some nice sets and costumes and Ms. Young was particularly elegant.  It&apos;s not a happy story, but it&apos;s entertaining and unusual. I&apos;m kind of surprised someone hasn&apos;t remade it, with a less controversial cast.",

All in all I thought this was a good film and I will watch it over and over again for a few scenes.  It does have some horrible language in this movie so do not let you kids see it unless you don&apos;t care if they repeat what they see.  Check the movie out if you are of age.

From the beginning of TFI , demi gods like NTR and ANR became popular by picking this same backdrop and molding the proceedings in their own way and mesmerizing the audience. Unfortunately , the director was stuck in the same era and wanted to make a cheap copy of films that came before this. Although Sumanth tried his best to involve the audience , there was not much he could have done to fix damn screen-play , the songs were good but not too catchy. But I give this film 4 points due its involving climax fight and emotions . They made this film a film , if not this movie can easily be another spoof of how typical a south movies can be .",

      "reviewBody": "Although I can&apos;t speak German, alas, I had no trouble following the gist of this big, fabulous, fun musical. Marika Rokk was 46 when she filmed it and makes teen-aged Debbie Reynolds look like Whistler&apos;s mother. The gist of the story (I think) is that Rokk (sorry, Amazon doesn&apos;t let me to make umlauts without disconnecting me) is the owner and/or star of a South American nightclub. Unbenownst to her, the managers/bosses are gangsters and drug runners. Her daughter arrives in a school uniform (ndicating innocent sexiness), bringing along the boy she hopes to marry. However, the boy&apos;s stern papa back in German objects strongly. Marika discovers through a photo that she knows the man -- a former lover? Are the young couple brother and sister? This is skipped over, so perhaps not. Marika decides to fly with the youngsters to Germany and get papa&apos;s approval. The gangsters decide to include a shipment of heroin in her luggage. In Germany, Marika assumes various identities and disguises, most involving huge dance numbers in wildly colorful costumes. Her astute comic timing and ability to mug while being gorgeous gets full play. All ends well for the good guys, of course. This is basically a Twentieth-Century Fox musical in German, and totally enjoyable even for us non-German speakers.",

      "reviewBody": "Now that this film is at last available on DVD (having never been issued on tape or laserdisc), more people will get a chance to see it and hopefully it will be better appreciated. Until now, the only way to see it was to wait for it to show up on TCM, which happened once or twice.\n\nWhile this is Sergio Leone&apos;s first credited film as a director, you won&apos;t see the hallmarks of the distinctive Leone style. He&apos;s working here more as a director for hire, just as Stanley Kubrick had done the year before with &quot;Spartacus.&quot; Rory Calhoun is woefully out of place, his hairstyle wildly anachronistic (full of that greasy kid stuff), he grins idiotically at inappropriate moments and gives his inane dialogue all the gusto it deserves. The story is fairly straightforward, although refreshingly free of the ersatz piety that infects so many epic Hollywood films of the era. There&apos;s a lip-smacking taste for brutality, as some of the heroes are fiendishly tortured; this appears to have been a hallmark of Italian epics of the time.\n\nWhere this movie works --- and it does --- is in the spectacle itself. You might not think that set decoration, production design, costumes, and cinematography can carry a picture, but in this case these elements are so well done it more than offsets Calhoun&apos;s dorky performance and the weaknesses of the plot. Bear in mind when you watch this that Leone did not have a computer to work with. Everything that you see had to be built or painted, and it&apos;s remarkably effective.\n\nThe film is perhaps a bit overlong, but the story has enough energy to carry the action sequences and bring all those incredible sets to life. The supporting cast is good enough to make up for Calhoun, although the dubbing is poorly done.\n\nIt&apos;s not as sophisticated as &quot;Spartacus&quot;, but it&apos;s certainly more effective than, say, &quot;Clash of the Titans.&quot; If you like sword-and-sandal films, this one is well worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Who wants to make an old fashioned musical in style that was said to be out of time three or four decades ago?\n\nThere&apos;s nothing wrong with the idea: why should everything follow modern styles? This movie, looking something between &quot;Annie&quot; and &quot;American in Paris&quot; could be a homage to classic musicals. And homages are always welcome, especially for old fans.\n\nThe trouble is that this one is meant for (very) young kids, whose parents haven&apos;t been born when Gene Kelly and Vincent Minelli made their masterpieces. Maybe this could be recommended to grandparents to watch together with their grandchildren, who would probably be the first to give up a watching.\n\nThe movie often tries to look more American then average north European movie, and the ambiance is undetermined (although Reykjavik is mentioned a few times). Also most of the character&apos;s names are non-Icelandic, so the movie could be happening anywhere - obviously in hope to be accepted worldwide. But the movie therefore loses that spirit so typical for Scandinavian (especially children/family) movies.\n\nThe plot is suitable for all ages, maybe too predictable for older. Some scenes however are lovely and the idea of using music to control other people&apos;s actions and behaving is just enough surreal for such a film still not letting it become a fairy tale - but sometimes it would be better if omitted. Actors are better then the movie itself, but very uneven. Some are too caricatured and really annoying (mostly stunts, like customers in Atli&apos;s shop), the others caricatured adequately what makes them funny (like Cynthia). Both kids are great, not too sweet and irritating, not pathetic, among the best child actors I&apos;ve ever seen. But I&apos;d really like to see Regina in a movie without singing.\n\nNot a waste of time if you can handle watching a story for kids packed in Minelli-Kelly style musicals."

I also remember it was sad, very sad, that is why it stuck with me for years. Silly thing was, I thought it was an Italian film so that is where I&apos;ve been trying to find it! I am a big horror film fan because at 4 years old, my older brothers watched these Saturday night New York Shows on Channel 5 (Creature Double Feature) and 11 (Thriller). This was during a time when there was not that many remotes so what they looked at, as the little sister, I had to look at too. Which is why I remember this film and haven&apos;t seen it since I was seven years old. (By that time we got cable, my brothers were older and I got the tv!) And let me add one more thing, many IMDb poster have written about films ripe for &quot;remakes&quot; for Hollywood Directors and Producers other than the ones they are doing. If I was one of those folks, I&apos;d put this on my list to consider. This is a Speilberg-esque family sci-fi film just waiting to be remade. Then again, I like it just fine the way it is."

Two of the greatest performances of the time capture the menace deployed by the Barrow Gang as they carve, shoot and slaughter their way into cult stardom, both on and off screen - the super antiheroes of their day.\n\nIt can be a challenge accepting interpretation over fact but if fact is a cornerstone of your experience then perhaps documentaries are more to your taste. Once you take the lives of others and throw them on the big screen it&apos;s done for entertainment not education, so you have to be prepared to take things with varying sized pinches of salt. You can always follow up the facts later if the fancy takes you. Cult heroes to some, raging psychopaths to others - either way, characters that appear in various guises over the course of cinematic history and more likely will continue to do so for some time to come - always a fiction but occasionally grounded in fact.",

      "reviewBody": "After his fourth traumatic year at Hogwarts that ended with a showdown with the franchise&apos;s very own Mr Bad, Lord Voldemort, it doesn&apos;t seem too much for Harry Potter to be asking for a peaceful Summer. However, he doesn&apos;t get such a wish  from the opening scene in which Harry and his despised cousin Dudley have close encounters of the life-threatening kind with two dementors in an underground passage, it is clear that Voldemort has unfinished business with the scarred lad, and that he has every intention of finishing it. Plus, nearly everyone in Harry&apos;s school believe him to be a liar, Professor Dumbledore refuses to look him in the eye, his friends don&apos;t understand him, and, on top of that, Harry must grapple with the skills required in mastering his first kiss. My, my, aren&apos;t teenage lives complicated?!\n\nA word of warning. This is not a film for the uninitiated. If &quot;patronum&quot;, &quot;Avada Kedavra&quot; and &quot;ministry of Magic&quot; sound like code to you, then best avoid watching this. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix makes no attempt to guide the newbies along the story (and rightly so, because any attempt at that would detract from the film and patronize its viewers). To fully comprehend the plot, you must have seen the four previous films as well as read the book from which this film is based.\n\nThe film itself is a wonderful jumble of goods, bads, and uglies. There is plenty to enjoy here, starting with the flawless turn from Imelda Staunton as the sadistic Dolores Umbridge. The woman who we are so used to seeing in roles as the sweet old lady, whether it be in Shakespeare in Love, or her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake, her performance here is a shock and a half. Kitted out from head to toe in pink and sporting a sugary air, we soon find that Umbridge, whose methods of punishment include using quills that protract blood on her students, is anything but sweet. Staunton captures Umbridge&apos;s ruthless oiliness perfectly; never before has evil been such fun to watch.\n\nRupert Grint is also a joy. His ginger hair, large blue eyes, bumbling demeanour and spot-on comedy timing make him the true star of the show, and every scene that he features in benefits as a result of his appearance. Simply put, he is Godly. Sadly, the other two teen stars are nowhere near as good as Grint; Radcliffe, who gave an adequate performance in the West End&apos;s Equus, is back to his shoddy self here with an array of overreaching facial expressions and laughable deliveries of his lines. He is most embarrassing of all in the lead-up to kissing Cho Chang, in which everyone in my cinema was collapsing with laughter at his &quot;performance.&quot; But it gets even worst, for Emma Watson, aspiring Cambridge student, World Peace Representative (probably) and general object of annoyance to average, frumpy teenage girls such as myself, gave a performance that was so awful, it damn near lost me the will to live. She just couldn&apos;t portray any of her emotions convincingly, and just settled for saying the lines that were written for her. Whereas Hermione was one of my favourite characters in the book due to her kindness, knowledge and appreciation for others&apos; feelings, Emma&apos;s presentation of Hermione makes her insufferable and punch-worthy. It ain&apos;t good.\n\nThe two &quot;actors&quot; aside, my main other foible with this film was how it cut/altered some very important details of the book. For example, in the book, it is Kreacher who betrays Sirius and puts him in danger. The appearance of Snape&apos;s past as a hated and bullied student is also poorly put together and left to linger rather than properly dealt with. The Cho Chang storyline is pitiful, whereas in the book, we had been led to see that she wasn&apos;t all that she had cracked up to be as a person, in the film, she is the sketchiest of sketches and written off practically before she has begun. In terms of 2007 releases, only Pirates of the Caribbean III had more plot holes than this.\n\nThat said, I had a huge amount of fun in the 2 and a half hours that this film played, with three newcomers to this movie, Yates (director), Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter) and Hooper (composer). The direction was apt, not perfect, but acceptable. The score was acceptable. The visual effects were stunning, especially in the climactic finale between Dumbeldore&apos;s Army and Voldemort&apos;s Deatheaters, led by Jason Isaacs, where an entire storeroom containing shelved globes containing prophecies, one of which concerns Harry. It is here that Helena Bonham Carter emerges as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of the final and greatest joys of the film. Laughing manically and sporting long hair greasier than a Professor Snape-Cristiano Ronaldo mixup, she makes the most of her limited screen time to deliver one of the best performances in all the Harry Potter movies. Utterly haunting.\n\nThus, verily I say, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a worthwhile outing. If you can put up with the abomination commonly known as &quot;Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson trying to act&quot;, as well as the slightly pretentious over-editing of Harry&apos;s dream sequences, not to mention the ten thousand odd plot holes, then you should venture out to the cinema to see this. Not capital film-making, but, as I&apos;m yet to see Ratatouille and The Simpsons movie, about as good as you&apos;ll get this Summer from the cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "There have not been many English-language movies made about the Spanish Civil War, and those that have been made (with the exception of Land and Freedom) tend to shy away from both politics and action, often slow-moving, contemplative affairs. In that vein Behold a Pale Horse, based on a novel by Hungarian screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, is a meditation on loyalty, trust and faith, not in religion but in religious institutions and individuals. The Spanish Civil War, or rather its aftermath, are the backdrop for these themes. But despite this ruminating premise the picture just about manages to save itself from terminal dullness.\n\nA lot of this has to do with director Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann was not exactly a dynamic director but he had a certain way of drawing us into a story and holding our interest. During the opening credits his camera tracks along a line of nameless faces, encouraging us to look over every line and notice every blink, introducing a quietly human picture. And yet he is also placing people within their context, showing young Paco dwarfed amid the houses of Pau, mirroring the mountains from which he has descended, or panning down from the figure of Christ to a reverent Anthony Quinn (shades here of Zinnemann&apos;s other Christian-themed pictures A Nun&apos;s Story and A Man for All Seasons). Above all Zinnemann is a master of tension without over-manipulation. Events seem to unfold in real-time, with a sprinkling of point-of-view shots to draw us into the unfolding action.\n\nIt is interesting to see Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn playing the hero and villain. Both men are possessed of dark hair and sharp, stony features. Both have a stern bearing and charismatic presence. One can imagine them playing brothers; a good twin and a bad twin perhaps. They are both very good here, but the best performance I feel belongs to Omar Shariff, grappling with some kind of a conscience, refusing to make the meek priest into a stereotype. Italian character actor Paolo Stoppa, familiar from a lot of European co-productions, is very good too. Finally, watch out for a brief but typically mesmerising bit part by Rosalie Crutchley as Quinn&apos;s wife.\n\nA strong cast and thoughtful direction are enough to keep this picture moving. Also of note is the Maurice Jarre score. This was by now an era in which you didn&apos;t have to have a blaring orchestral score (and thankfully those irritating free jazz scores of the late 50s were going out of style). Behold a Pale Horse features sparse and staccato Spanish guitar, fitting for both the location and the nervous and somewhat melancholic story. This is far from being a war movie, but it is a picture of great solemnity, atmosphere and touching humanity.",

I know the title Is BloodRayne 2 or BloodRaybe deliverance, but seriously, does this movie have anything to do with BloodRayne 1???\n\nIt doesn&apos;t matter in what kind of situation you are mentally or physically, there is on point of viewing this one.\n\nI state out much more, but I don&apos;t think profanity would be welcome as a comment by whoever is in charge of maintaining the comments section. My vote -666 (not worth mentioning unless warning people who are going to be subjected to viewing this movie).",

The fact that these two inspiring and very real characters have Asperger&apos;s Syndrome is not really important, but the fact like so many of us they struggle to connect with a soul mate and maintain a relationship, is. From what Aspies tell me, the performances of both leads, Hartnett and Mitchell, are spot on... a real credit to both actors and it&apos;s obvious they researched their roles thoroughly. Both entertaining and thought provoking, it&apos;s a romance without being gushing, but one where you genuinely care for the people involved. \n\nWatch this film if you have or know someone with autism or if you just happen to have tried and failed to find love and happiness in this weird world we live in.",

      "reviewBody": "I love the first SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE partially for nostalgia value but mostly because it&apos;s a genuinely fun movie, so I figured I&apos;d give a go at this one, ignoring warnings such as the 4 Star Joe Bob review on the front of the video box. I watched it with several friends, and I&apos;ll tell you what, we never had such a good time making fun of a brain-dead exploitation movie before. This one really does reach new depths of stupidity, and for that reason alone I adore it!\n\nThe plot is basically summed up in the title - Jackie (Keely Christian, whoever she is) throws one last sleepover party for her giggly high-school friends (who look no younger than 25), some dumb guys sneak over and try to scare them and a psycho killer shows up with his portable electric drill and starts laying into these idiots. Apparently the ladies in the house don&apos;t know how to open a door or window to escape, which becomes almost a running gag after awhile. They also hilariously fail to subdue the killer despite being given half a dozen chances to do some serious damage. The list of possible suspects is pretty ridiculous, especially the peeping tom next-door-neighbor, who spies on the girls dancing topless with his telescope, and &quot;The Weirdo,&quot; a mute voyeuristic albino who earlier in the day was caught staring at the girls during their beach volleyball game.\n\nThere&apos;s one moment of sheer hilarity when the psycho surprises a guy at the door with his large, high-powered drill, sending a half-dozen lingerie-clad babes shuffling back and forth in front of the camera in a panic. Another highlight is Maria Ford&apos;s gratuitous bare-ass shot as she tries to escape up through the basement window but keeps falling. And we&apos;ve all seen the standard electrocuted-in-bathtub death scene countless times before, scene, though instead of the usual hair dryer or radio being tossed in the tub, this time it&apos;s caused by a vibrator that one character plugs in and leaves sitting on the sink while she&apos;s taking a bath. A guy who gets his feet cut off with a chainsaw manages to crawl all the way back across town to the house in a matter of minutes. The acting (aside from the guy who plays the killer, who&apos;s awful) really isn&apos;t too bad for this type of film, some of the songs on the soundtrack are pretty good and if you like your movies trashy, bloody and silly, you&apos;ll find a lot to enjoy here. For sheer entertainment it gets a 7 out of 10 but playing by the rules of movie reviewing (i.e. quality), it&apos;s about a 3. I&apos;ll go ahead and give it a 4.",

Bank employee Elliott Gould dupes bank robber Christopher Plummer out of a small fortune, leading to a head-spinning game of cat-and-mouse. Gould and Plummer both do career-peak work, with Plummer never more riveting (violence turns him on, making him a dangerous, bloodthirsty cat). The film&apos;s R-rated mayhem may be over-the-top, but the movie is never off-putting and director Daryl Duke, working from Curtis Hanson&apos;s screenplay, nearly keeps it on track the entire way. Duke mounts the proceedings with flair, accentuating the coal-black humor inherent in the tension for a terrifically lively effect. Engrossing picture was unjustly swept under the carpet in 1978, but has more excitement than most big-budget films in this genre. Watch out! ***1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this at the 13th Bradford Film Festival in Yorkshire, England. Due to a serious lack of proper publicity (on the festival&apos;s behalf), only six or seven people showed up to the screening. This is a crying shame, because the film is great on so many levels.\n\nFor a debut, Gaag has made an amazing piece on a subject sparsely covered in cinema. The characters are complex, well-written human beings and not just there as a backdrop to the graffiti writing. The whole cast give truly natural and intense performances; the main four writers (a crew of ethnic and native backgrounds) showing a deep passion for their art. The film could also be seen as an exposé on the ridiculous stance the German government (and governments world-wide) take on this subject. We gain real sympathy for these characters as their lives are torn apart, mainly because the authorities choose to make life so hard for them.\n\nThe cinematography was spot on: a gritty yet delicate portrayal of life on the under-ground. Yet through the grey, dusky palette we get bursts of colour that literally &quot;burn&quot; off the writers&apos; canvases. The train sequences really are joy to behold.\n\nThe subject matter of the film should not be seen as a deterrent to spectators unfamiliar with the world of graffiti writing. I for one am no aficionado on the subject, but was drawn in and captivated through-out. The sound-track, also composed by Gaag, really is the icing on the cake and is a glorious testament to the 6/7 years of work he has put in to this film. I implore you to give it a chance - you will not be disappointed.",

She was accused guilty in 1982 but returned to England.\n\nThe film shows basically the same plot with stunning Sienna Guillory as the au-pair girl Julie with supernatural powers. Mark Strong plays her lawyer Antonio who has to fight mainly against prejudices and the fundamental superstition of the people and the media. Director Kenneth Hope hasn&apos;t produced a copy of the doomy &quot;Exorcist&quot; and &quot;Omen&quot; horror movies, but rather a silent psycho drama with great actings by Guillory, Strong, Charlotte Rampling, Alice Kringe and David Warner. There is no happy end, a thrilling court room drama sequence and there are also some very surreal and disturbing dream sequences.\n\nIf you relate &quot;Superstition&quot; to the horror movie genre, it&apos;s one of the best contemporary European genre productions apart from the boring popcorn horror movie remakes and teenie slasher trash of the current Hollywood productions.",

      "reviewBody": "Dr. Grood, a mad scientist, plans to conquer the Earth using his scientific inventions directed from a lost, but nearby planet Ergro. While investigating a flying saucer crash near Grood&apos;s earth hideout in the hills, Rex Barrow (news writer) and Tim Johnson (staff photographer) are kidnapped and sent to Ergro by Grood, along with Ella Dorn, whose father is on Ergro, used by Grood to develop his gadgets. For 15 chapters, Rex, Ella, Tim, and Prof. Dorn must overcome the hypnotic effects of Grood&apos;s mind control devices to prevent Grood from taking over the world. A very imaginative serial with new gadgets and inventions popping up in every chapter make this late Columbia chapterplay fun to watch. The serial is repetitive and probably has the least amount of fistfights of any serial (I think they all happened when Rex was invisible &quot;fighting&quot; Grood&apos;s planet guards.) The addition of the racketeer character, Wolper, doesn&apos;t help the serial like the character should have. The bad characters should have been meaner, IMO. Rating, based on serials, 4.",

The characters are definitely amusing (though a bit off), and all of the hang-ups they face along the way just add to the humour. Yes, there are parts of the film which can be quite sad, especially if one can relate in any way to them, but by and large, this is a very funny film that is definitely worth the DVD rental. The violence is comical, the struggles are comical, even the arguments are comical. They really did a good job with the casting and the writer did an excellent job with the script. I am usually not a fan of Danish films (even though I live in Denmark), but this film is the exception. It&apos;s a definite must see, no matter where in the world one happens to live.",

Seeing this film, I can see why Coonskin won&apos;t appeal to all, due to its very gritty subject matter(racism) and the fact it is stereotypical. However, I loved this movie surprisingly and consider it one of Bakshi&apos;s better films alongside American Pop and Heavy Traffic. The visuals are wonderful, the blend of animation and live action is very clever, and some of the images are brutal but often fascinating. The music is equally great, especially the opening title sequence. The satire really does bite and hit you hard, while the story is rich and multi-layered with lots of insight(correct me if I&apos;m wrong but I don&apos;t think Bakshi has done anything as ambitious as Coonskin before). The voice acting adds a lot, in particular from Scatman Brothers and the resonant, deep voice of Barry White. All in all, Coonskin is not for all tastes, but I loved it, and appreciate it for its biting satire and its take on a very gritty and perhaps controversial subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Although not the best film of Chabrol, it is one of the most competent (and disconcerting) films to deal with the subject of sick and obsessive jealousy. Merit also for the end of the film and for the fact that we will never be shown if the woman is unfaithful or not.\n\nOriginally written by screenwriter and director Henri Georges Clouzot, &quot;l&apos;enfer&quot;, years later he had his rights sold by his widow to a producer who offered him to Claude Chabrol. His plot revolves around Paul Prieur, a man possessed by a sick jealousy of his wife.\n\nNo doubt this is a fascinating study that shows how one&apos;s insecurities can affect, in addition to his own life, those of all who find themselves around him.\n\nAlthough considered as one of the great filmmakers of French cinema, this film is not considered among the best achievements of Chabrol, such as &quot;le beau serge&quot;, &quot;les cousins&quot;, &quot;une affaire de femmes&quot;, &quot;la ceremonie&quot; , among others.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the better of Lubitsch&apos;s rough mountain comedies, with Pola Negri as the wild daughter of the bandit chief (all of the the bandits&apos; possessions are festooned with skulls, to show how dangerous they are) who falls in love with the handsome lieutenant brought in to marry the daughter of the corpulent and ineffectual colonel of the fort. Like his other mountain comedies -- MEYER FROM BERLIN, ROMEO AND JULIET IN THE SNOW and KOHLHEISEL&apos;S DAUGHTER -- it is a very broad comedy, with much falling down in the snow.\n\nIn those days, Lubitsch would shoot half a dozen films a year for UFA, and one would always be a mountain comedy shot on site in Bavaria, where he liked to take a working vacation every winter. They were not polished and witty pieces like The Oyster Princess and The Doll, but they were very popular.",

      "reviewBody": "A film like Jean Becker&apos;s My Afternoons with Margueritte spoils me with a lyricism found not just in a small French provincial town filled with eccentric, lovable characters but also in sentiment propelled by exquisite words found in Camus and Romain Gary. And an odd couple who find love that is sometimes not named.\n\nIn perhaps a nod to Harold and Maude, Germain (Gerard Depardieu), a 50 year old non reader, meets in the park with 90 year old Margueritte (Gisele Casadesus), who initially reads to him from Camus&apos; The Plague. As she awakens his interest in reading, his life changes, not the least of which is finding a loving mother figure for the abusive real one. Or maybe discovering Leonard Cohen&apos;s Suzanne.\n\nSo much more is layered in this romantic story: a Cheers-like café where love and disrespect, the two poles of sentiment in the film, play out in a way that exalts the affection even in the hardest of relationships; a traditional love affair for Germain with the younger Francine (Maurane) that may turn around the story&apos;s primary January-May motif but parallels it in the deeply loving relationship that seeks to perpetuate itself.\n\nSo much of My Afternoons is about renewal and rebirth, and so little is about death that the formula for too old to be young no longer applies. Nor does my expectation to be grossed out by Depardieu&apos;s enormous girth, a sad counterpoint to his dashing younger days. But wait, his weight is perfect for the role, his lines read with such understated beauty as to shout, &quot;Where have you been, Gerard?&quot; The bear-like man revealing a daisy-like affect is poetically perfect for the story.\n\nIf you expect the film to follow a formula, you will be correct, except maybe for the ending which confirms the motif of unnamed love conquering all. Actually, the film makes you cry for more of the odd-couple romantic formula.\n\nAs for the transforming power of books, Abe Lincoln had a witty take on the subject: &quot;The things I want to know are in books; my best friend is the man who&apos;ll get me a book I ain&apos;t read.&quot; Change that to &quot;woman&quot; and you have My Afternoons with Margueritte."

Yep,in terms of 2004&apos;s most major cinematic disaster,Catwoman was,well,not to put too fine a pun on it,the cat that got the cream.Opening to abominable reviews,from everyone from Empire to Zoo magazine,it was ushered out of cinemas during the &apos;summer blockbuster&apos; period almost as quickly as it was released.It then placed it&apos;s lead star in the embarrassing position of accepting a razzie award having earned an Oscar for her devastating turn in Monster&apos;s Ball only a few years earlier.\n\nIt is a pretty dreadful film,but there are arguably a lot worse.It&apos;s main problem is the story,which is so uninteresting,but the same could be said of the action on display.Also,this is a film that&apos;s managed a pretty notorious achievement.It makes Halle Berry look unsexy.The first suit we see her strutting around in is okay and fairly pleasing to the eye,but the main one (the one she&apos;s in on the poster) is really unsexy and unflattering.\n\nIf you want to engage your curiosity value,go right ahead,but I hope you know what you&apos;re letting yourself in for.**",

      "name": "Ravioli and Fagioli Western from Giuseppe Colizzi trilogy  with Terence Hill as  Cat Stevens and Spencer as  Hutch",
      "reviewBody": "I Quattro dell&apos;Ave Maria (original title) is an entertaining and amusing Macaroni Western starred by the notorious Italian couple , Hill and Spencer , pre-Trinity and Bambino . Likable Terence Hill and stocky Bud Spencer team up again as the valiant and enjoyable duo . The agreeable crew makes a new adventure movie plenty of fist-play , action , shootouts and entertainment . This fun Pipperone Western deals with our intimate friends in Far West , they&apos;re two bank-robbers , the blue-eyes and sympathetic Terence Hill as Cat Stevens and a grumpy and goofy Bud Spencer as Hutch . Then appears Cacopoulos (Eli Wallach) , a cunning thief who arranges to save himself from being hung on a fake charge , as he breaks out and steals Cat Stevens (Mario Girotti or Terence Hill , Massimo Giroti&apos;son ) and Hutch Bessy (Carlo Perdesoli or Bud Spencer) a lot of cash and he also robs their horses . This results in a merry pursuit and Stevens and Bessy turn into unwilling allies in Cacopoulus&apos; vendetta against the people who double-crossed him and accused him to get their loot back . Cat Stevens and Hutch unite Cacopoulus , after that , the trio joins forces with a circus artist (Brock Peters) taking on nasties . Nevertheless , the cruel baddie is still alive and seeks avenge , he is a relentless saloon owner (Kevin MacCarthy of Invasion of the body snatchers) and supported by ominous hoodlums .\n\nThis funny story contains crossfire , the usual slight fights and a little bit of action , pursuits and circus spectacle . The humor is based on physical and personality differences of the starring , as Terence Hill is the sympathetic and brave hero and Bud Spencer is the corpulent and hunk man . The movie contains gun-play , action Western , bloody spectacle and fist-fights . The film isn&apos;t always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions , it&apos;s frankly delicious . Terence Hill as a two-fisted gunslinger and Spencer as a bouncing hunk are good but still not personified the Trinity hero characters . Later on , the &apos;big time&apos; duo of Spaghetti Western with humor such as ¨They call me Trinity¨, ¨ Trinity is still my name ¨ and sequels as ¨Troublemakers¨ were run out and for that reason were transfered in modern era film , playing the police/action genre and adventures as ¨All the way boys¨ also titled ¨Plane crazy¨ ; after that , they starred the successful ¨ Miami police series ¨, which belong the followings : ¨Crime Busters¨ , ¨Superfuzz¨ and ¨Supercops in Miami¨. However , being the great American actor Eli Wallach from ¨Actor&apos;s Studio¨ who steals the show as Cacopoulus , a similar role to Tucco he performed in ¨The good , the bad and the ugly¨ . At the picture appears customary Spaghetti secondaries who played ordinary characters as villains in numerous Spanish/Italian Western as Livio Lorenzon as Paco Rosa , Steffen Zacharias as Harold , Rick Boyd as Drake&apos;s blond henchman , Bruno Corazzari as Charlie , Frank Braña and Riccardo Pizzuti ,habitual secondary in Hill-Spencer films . The movie is finely photographed by director of photography Marcello Masciocchi , and of course is shot in Almeria , Spain, location where were filmed hundreds of Western in the 60s and 70s . Evocative as well as atmospheric musical score by the usual Carlo Rustichelli , conducted by Bruno Nicolai , ordinary collaborator to Ennio Morricone . \n\nThe motion picture was regularly directed and produced by Giuseppe Colizzi . Giuseppe directed a trilogy starred by Hill and Spencer as Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy respectively . The first , superior and the best outing was ¨Dio Perdona..¨ with Frank Wolf and Jose Luis Martin ; this second installment also titled ¨Four gunmen of Ave Maria¨ or ¨Ace high¨ with the great Eli Wallach and more camp tendencies ; and the third is ¨Boot Hill¨ with Woody Strode , Eduardo Ciannelli , George Eastman , Alberto DellÁcqua and Romano Puppo . A bit later on , Colizzi again directed Hill and Spencer at an adventure movie titled ¨Più Forte, Ragazzi!&quot; or ¨All the Way Boys&quot; or &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; , USA title . Giuseppe subsequently realized another buddy movie ¨Joe and Margherito¨ with Keith Carradine and Tom Skerrit , being his last movie a real flop titled ¨Switch¨ , starred by Annie Belle , until his early death at fifty years old . The flick will appeal to famous pair fans , in fact , this was the second teaming of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer .",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is a great movie for all those who have been in a situation that you thought you would have no control of. This movie goes with the whole parent trap idea of getting two parents back together. Through a series of events they attempt to. This movie gives hope to all young children who&apos;s parents have split. For those children who&apos;s parents haven&apos;t it&apos;s good family fun.\n\nThora Birch ( Monkey Trouble, Now and Then) is young in this movie, she&apos;s very cute though. Ethan Embry ( Can&apos;t Hardly Wait, Empire Records) is also very good in this movie, his performance is fairly powerful for a kids movie, you really understand how much he wants his parents together. Leslie Nielsen plays a good Santa Clause, it&apos;s a small part but he plays it well. Lauren Bacall plays a very impressive role, her character is very down to earth and a very likable person. She plays a veteran actress in this movie who knows what&apos;s going on around her.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen this movie I suggest renting it. It&apos;s worth a rent, you just have to adapt to the fact that it&apos;s a movie for younger kids, but it&apos;s a movie we can all relate to."

      "reviewBody": "The title of this charming film by Eric Rohmer is perhaps too  provocative. It really gives the wrong impression, yet Claire&apos;s knee is  exactly the central point of the film, although in a way that will  surprise you.  This is the story about a thirty-something year old diplomat, Jerome  Montcharvin, who encounters two pretty girls, sixteen and eighteen  years old, while on vacation at Lake Annecy in France (near Lake  Geneva, Switzerland) a month before his wedding and finds that they  affect him more strongly than he might have expected. It is especially  Claire who brings out a side of his personality that is seldom exposed,  much to the merry interest of his friend, Aurora, a writer, who has  guided his interest in the girls, ostensibly as material for a story  she is writing. Claire&apos;s Knee, it need be said immediately has not so  much to do with the pretty girl&apos;s knee as it has to do with the  protagonist&apos;s self-perception.   Jean-Claude Brialy, who plays Jerome Montcharvin, brings a veracious  mix of smug confidence and little guy vulnerability to the part spiked  with a clear case of self-delusion that illuminates his character very  well. And the girls are indeed very pretty, with Laura, played with  coquettish innocence by Béatrice Romand, also being clever and slyly  sophisticated, vulnerable and honest. In contrast Claire, played by  Laurence de Monaghan, whose fawn-like beauty is perfect for the part,  seems superficial and ordinary and a bit distant. I found myself more  attracted to Aurora, played with a gentle and understated irony by  Aurora Cornu. She provides the objectifying point of view for us to  realize that while Jerome imagines he is a man in touch with his  feelings and has an objective understanding of himself, he is really a  man who fools himself about his motivation, a man who can be ugly when  frustrated, as he is by Claire&apos;s lack of interest in him.  The dialogue, written by director Eric Rohmer, which some have found  excessive is anything but. It is instead clever and witty and at times  profound as Rohmer relentlessly explores the nature of love, sex,  sensuality and self-delusion. The cinematography of the lake and the  French alps in the summer time is luscious, and the privileged, softly  indulgent life style of the characters living around the lake provoked  a twinge of jealousy in my soul. This is a beautiful film, worldly  wise, warm, sensual and subtle as a dinner by candlelight.",

      "reviewBody": "Spectacular hokey Bible epic produced by by San Paolo Films formed by two episodes from Bible , the first filmed in Almeria (Spain) by Spanish director Francisco Perez Dolz and second in Cinecitta , Rome , Italy , by Italian filmmaker Marcello Baldi . It deals with Gedeon (Ivo Garrani) , a humble farmer who is assigned by an Angel (Fernando Rey) to a holy mission to defeat Amalekites . The second part concerns Samson (Anton Geesink) and Delilah (Rosalba Neri , Francesca Neri&apos;s mother) who robs Samson his incredible strength .\n\n&quot;I Grandi Condottieri&quot; or &quot;Great Leaders of the Bible&quot; remains an enjoyable and entertaining picture with great camp performances that still looks fine today . This dumb but fun film contains breathtaking outdoors , a lot of extras and with glorious paper-Maché sets on the temple of Dagon . Ivo Garrani is surprisingly nice as Gedeon along with a sympathetic Angel well incarnated by Fernando Rey . Anton Geesink as Sansone or Samson is acceptable though his famous fight against a philistine army is hopelessly phony . Rosalba Neri supplies biggest surprise by playing a tempter and beautiful vixen Delilah . Being a Italian/Spanish co-production here appears several actors usual from Peplum and Spaghetti Western such as Barta Barri , Luz Marquez , Beni Deus , Jose Jaspe , Paolo Gozlino , Mirko Ellis , among others . \n\nThe stories of Gideon and Samson from chapters 6-8 and 13-16 of The Book of Judges . As is the pattern throughout the book of Judges, the Israelites again turned away from God after 40 years of peace brought by Deborah&apos;s victory over Canaan and were allowed to be oppressed by the neighboring Midianites and Amalekites and the children of the east. God chose Gideon, a young man from the tribe of Manasseh, to free the people of Israel and to condemn their worship of idols. Very unsure of both himself and God&apos;s command, he requested proof of God&apos;s will by three miracles: firstly a sign from an angel in Judges 6:16, and then two signs involving a fleece, performed on consecutive nights and the exact opposite of each other . On God&apos;s instruction, Gideon destroyed the town&apos;s altar to the foreign god Baal and the symbol of the goddess .However, God informed Gideon that the men he had gathered were too many – with so many men, there would be reason for the Israelites to claim the victory as their own instead of acknowledging that God had saved them. God first instructed Gideon to send home those men who were afraid. Then the Lord said to Gideon, &quot;You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.&quot; During the night God instructed Gideon to approach the Midianite camp. Gideon overheard a Midianite man tell a friend of a dream in which God had given the Midianites over to Gideon. Gideon worshiped God for His encouragement and revelation. Gideon returned to the Israelite camp and gave each of his men a trumpet and a clay jar with a torch hidden inside. Divided into three companies, Gideon and the three hundred marched on the enemy camp and they cried, &quot;A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!&quot; and the enemy army fled .\n\nAccording to the biblical account, Samson was given supernatural strength by God in order to combat his enemies and perform heroic feats such as killing a lion, slaying an entire army with only the jawbone of an ass, and destroying a pagan temple. Samson had two vulnerabilities, however: his attraction to untrustworthy women such as Delilah and his hair, without which he was powerless. These vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him. One day the Philistine leaders assembled in a temple for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, one of their most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can gather on the roof to watch. Once inside the temple, Samson, his hair having grown long again, asks the servant who is leading him to the temple&apos;s central pillars if he may lean against them . He pulled the two pillars together , and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people . Thus he killed many more as he died than while he lived",

      "reviewBody": "Black Sabbath is one visually stylish flick, courtesy of one of Italy&apos;s finest; Mario Bava.\n\nThe first story, The Telephone, is light on suspense but heavy on looks. The first Giallo in color, I believe, to some extent, with sexual overtones featured very prominently. Although it only takes place in one apartment Bava&apos;s crazy color schemes work beautifully and thanks to the two stunning ladies this episode goes down very well.\n\nThe Wurdulak scores heavy because of it&apos;s visuals and it&apos;s magnificent Gothic atmosphere. This should give a good example of how Black Sunday might have looked in color. However, this episode feels stretched quite a bit, it&apos;s relatively short running time seems longer than it is and therefore, in my opinion, is the weakest of the bunch.\n\nThe Drop of Water is the final, and best, episode. Bava was fond of the kind of horror that deals with a person who&apos;s totally alone in his/her surroundings. He goes into supernatural territory and creates a highly stylish (again) and quite the scary episode.\n\nBlack Sabbath is not the best Mario Bava has to offer, it could have been more scary but thanks to studio involvement he had to keep things light and not too scary. Under such restrictions I think Bava did extremely well and Black Sabbath is most definitely a must for Bava fans.",

Yep you guessed it right. So this will firstly appeal to the fans of the group. Although I&apos;m not really one of them, I was curious about this documentary. And as it proved to be, it was quite entertaining.\n\nThis documentary does really have it all. From low&apos;s and high&apos;s, to the sort of revelation, of the (hu)man behind the star. Although it&apos;s safe to say, that the Gorillaz do not necessarily see each other as famous. This crazy mix of an emotion roller-coaster ride will show that. Not to be taken too seriously, this can be thoroughly enjoyed, by anyone who loves their anti-heroes and loves independent music! :o)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Take My Eyes (Te doy mis ojos)&quot; is a frank, classy woman in jeopardy/Lifetime TV for Women film.\n\nA couple of elements raise it above Hollywood&apos;s unfortunately already tired treatment of abused wives in such films as &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; or &quot;Enough&quot;, among many others.\n\nFirst is the superb acting by Laia Marull as &quot;Pilar&quot;. Her transformation from frightened mouse to tentative independent to an expressive person with a back bone is riveting. She does look distractingly like Annabella Sciorra, but that means she is beautiful and very womanly.\n\nSecond is the emphasis less on the physical violence by an abuser that American films revel in (this film opens right after such an incident) than on the psychological impact, both on abuser and victim. Even amidst strife, this is a passionate couple who were very much in love, though we get hints from the beginning that he was controlling, as in the conversations that include the titular phrase. Unlike Hollywood, her final revenge is not violent but in how she uses those words back at him. \n\nUniquely, we see the husband (Luis Tosar as &quot;Antonio&quot; looking distractingly like the Irish actor James Nesbitt) as a 360 degree person, with his own family stresses, and not just as the usual evil incarnate. Though we don&apos;t see how he got into anger-management therapy sessions for abusers that in the U.S. are usually only a result of a court-order and I couldn&apos;t tell from the untranslated credits what experts were consulted for these recreations, they are a fascinating look at an attempt to change abusive behaviors. The shrink finds he has to teach these guys even how to have a conversation with their wives to prevent triggers, let alone what to do when rage starts filling their heads. \n\nAnother difference is that while the husband jealously fixates on the possibility of her finding a new lover, a sensitive new age guy character invariably appears in the Hollywood versions (and it was entertainingly non-stereotypical that the Scottish brother-in-law is held up as a prized alternative), the threat to his marriage actually comes from her relationships with the women in her life, from family to friends. Through them she becomes more attuned to humiliation as violence than even her hospital records filled with lied about fractures. It was a bit much symbolically to have her suddenly get into artistic presentations of ancient sexy myths, though it was nice that the credits identified each of the paintings discussed.\n\nWhile sadly this is a familiar story in filmed outline, the film is continually suspenseful and involving as to what they will do, together and apart.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Zambezia&apos;, the new south African animated film is an obvious low budget animated feature, you wont see any ads on TV, and the animation looks 10 years old, but that&apos;s no reason to straight away hate on Zambezia, it&apos;s not one of those dubbed foreign trashy animated movies which have no single thing put into them apart from making money. Zambezia has a story, a plot, good characters. When it wants you to take it seriously you will take it seriously. When it wants you to laugh you will not be sitting there rolling your eyes.\n\nThe movie is another one of those typical &apos;parent letting go of child&apos; kind of animated movies, which is possibly the most cliché type of character development seen in any kids movie. But I guess there&apos;s good reason for the situation, it just doesn&apos;t have it thrown in to make a plot (hint hint Ice Age 4). But I thought the characters were good, not really that deep, but good, nothing to really complain about.\n\nThe movie has a nice soundtrack, and I thought the visuals of the landscape were absolutely brilliant. The humour isn&apos;t bad, with a lot of jokes that hit. Nothing laugh out loud funny of course, but still much better than the humour in &apos;Ice Age 4&apos;.\n\nThere are some obvious similaries to &apos;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&apos;Hoole&apos; and possibly the movie was made with the intention to &apos;duel&apos; Rio, but it still has originality, the bad guy for one, is new, and intimidating enough to be a good villain.\n\nZambezia is a perfectly good movie for kids and adults, there&apos;s nothing wrong with it at all really, and it actually kind of surprised me. I think this movie takes much more risks than &apos;Ice Age 4&apos;, &apos;Rio&apos;, and many other current animated films.\n\nGo and see it, have a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Salaryman&quot; is a Japanese term for somebody who works for a company in a boring job, not really going anywhere, working just to survive. They&apos;re generally caricatured as meek individuals without much of a personality, and looked down upon (even by other Salarymen, probably :p). Salaryman Kintaro is different! The former leader of a biker gang he&apos;s tough, honourable, brave and rather good looking. He&apos;s a very popular character in Japan, with his own manga, anime, TV-series and a few movies - the first of which was the Miike directed effort under discussion.\n\nAt or near the start of the film, Kintaro is transferred to a branch of the construction company where he works that&apos;s run by a curmudgeonly drunk. He attends various meetings where rival firms bid for public contracts, but they don&apos;t win any. When they are just narrowly underbid on a contract that Kintaro is *sure* they had gotten to the lowest possible price, he realises that something underhand is going on, and that officials are being bribed by a competitor. This is something he&apos;s not going to stand for! Now that might sound really dull, but it&apos;s not. Slightly dull, yes, but the characters are all likable/interesting enough to make us care about their business affairs - and we get more focus on their personal lives anyway. The film makes only minimal effort to provide the back-story for the characters, who are presumably familiar to the Japanese audience that would go to see the film already. The relationships between some of the characters is still unclear to me, in fact, as if I&apos;d started watching a TV series on the second episode. This may explain why the film isn&apos;t highly regarded by Miike fans, who don&apos;t know the characters and aren&apos;t as moved by what happens to them in the film as a Kintaro fan might be.\n\nThe other reason it&apos;s probably not held in high regard is probably because it&apos;s a very &quot;tame&quot; film by Miike standards. Well, by the standards of the most famous Miike films anyway - he has made quite a few films without blood, guts and sex in them, but they&apos;re not the ones that have received wide distribution. Kintaro is free of guts and sex, and the blood that&apos;s shed is on quite mild, human standards (no gushing arteries here). It&apos;s a Miike film that you could watch with your young relatives, and they might even enjoy it. It&apos;s never going to achieve the kind of cult fan-base that films like ICHI THE KILLER do, because it&apos;s not unique or different enough, and doesn&apos;t have anything that&apos;s going to raise any extreme emotions in the viewer unless they&apos;re rabid Kintaro fans... but it&apos;s an engaging story of some likable characters, and competently directed.\n\nNote: the film was released on DVD as &quot;White-Collar Worker Kintaro&quot; in the US.",

      "reviewBody": "Both J.M. Coetzee&apos;s novel and its film adaptation leave their audience wanting more answers. Disgrace is a confronting and brutal tale of life in modern South Africa. The message is clear. There are no simple solutions.\n\nLiterary academic David Lurie&apos;s admiration of Byron seems to have formed his personal morality and his professional ethics.\n\nHis amorality leads to a doomed relationship that precipitates both work and identity crises. His alienation from university colleagues and students results in a refusal to defend his reputation or his professorial position.\n\nHe is not the victim of an old fool&apos;s infatuation but the arrogance of a serial Casanova. He quotes William Blake as his sole defence, &quot;Sooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.&quot; His retreat to his daughter&apos;s remote farm entangles their individual problems in the realities of life in the post apartheid era.\n\nDirector Steve Jacobs and screenwriter Anna Maria Monticelli continue their professional and personal partnership as co-producers. Their earlier collaboration on La spagnola in 2001 was another Australian production that is a minor gem.\n\nJohn Malkovich&apos;s ability to convey complete self absorption and intense self doubt without dialogue make him an excellent choice for David. Relative newcomer Jessica Haines plays his daughter Lucy. Hers is a competent and moving performance. Eriq Ebouaney strikes the right tone in a difficult role as Petrus, the black farmer and her co-landholder.\n\nDisgrace is an adaptation that more than does justice to the novel. Like the book, it does not sensationalise or over-dramatise this extremely difficult story. I had misgivings before the screening because the novel seemed so bleak. Lucy&apos;s compromise and David&apos;s acceptance of her decision offer such slim hope.\n\nWe are left with little doubt that this is an allegory for the issues facing modern multi-racial South Africa. Yet it is at the personal level that the film is most powerful.\n\nKevin Rennie Cinema Takes http://cinematakes.blogspot.com",

The director of many B sci-fi/martial Arts projects (the &quot;Nemesis&quot; series, &quot;Cyborg&quot;), a teen video game adventure, and a post-apocalyptic musical, Mr. Pyun loves to combine genre tropes into stimulating, unique experiences. Pyun asked what many B-filmmakers did in the Tarrantino administration: why bother with new material when it has all been done so well before?\n\nThe 90s direct-to-video market thrived simultaneously with this era of genre hybrids; those movies that recycled old genre tropes, archetypes, and approaches into new material. In &quot;Dollman&quot; Pyun makes a tasty salad out of various conventions from &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;Honey I shrunk the Kids&quot;, &quot;Suburban Commando&quot;, &quot;Time Cop&quot;, various gang films, and the action and sci-fi conventionality of its era.\n\nTim Thomerson plays recurring Pyun character Brick Bardo who, in this incarnation, is a futuristic bad-cop who is inter-dimensionally displaced via space ship into the Bronx with his his WMD-packing floating head nemesis Armbruiser. During their trip, the two are shrunken into action figure proportions. After Bardo&apos;s spaceship is abducted by a young boy, he must struggle against various domestic terrors (the family dog, a cockroach) while Armbruiser shops his WMD to a dangerous local gang headed by the dangerous Braxton Red (Jackie Earle Hayley in a hammy, vicious performance).\n\nFortunately &quot;Dollman&quot; delivers in every way you want it to. The shrunken person tropes are satisfying and realized; the action scenes are intense; and its science fiction backbone is always present. Pyun juggles these elements well and has fun with the formulas at play. \n\nAlthough it suffers from Pyun&apos;s tendency toward awkward pacing, &quot;Dollman&quot; is one of his strongest and most controlled films.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the cleverest adaptations of a classic fable since &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (Jekyll &amp; Hyde). Here in &quot;Beastly&quot; we have an adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; set in contemporary New York and revolving around the image-obsessed youth of a fashionable High School in the trendy urban district. I know, right? Awesome premise. The execution may not be quite as awesome, but ultimately I think it&apos;s a great flick to watch when you&apos;re in the mood for a creative morality play.\n\nWhat makes it work is the depiction of the &quot;Beast&quot;. I won&apos;t ruin it for you (if the movie posters haven&apos;t already), but here, unlike other tellings of the tale which portray the Beast as a majestic animal, we get a Beast who is not only &quot;ugly&quot; in terms of scars and bad skin, but more importantly he is made to look like an outcast. He doesn&apos;t look like a literal beast/monster, but instead he looks very human but the kind of human who would make you cross the street to avoid.\n\nIn that respect it turns the microscope on ourselves because we the audience are repulsed without any justification. I thought this was a fantastic starting point.\n\nThe rest of the film may feel sort of like a predictable teen romance, without much tension or or peril, but it keeps our attention and gives us thoughts which we can apply directly to our lives, unlike typical enchanted fairytales which we approach as pure fantasy.\n\nBeyond the predictable, there&apos;s one character who really livened things up and I wish there were more of him: &quot;Will&quot; played by Neil Patrick Harris (yes! Doogie Howser M.D.). Will plays the role of the Beast&apos;s sarcastic, wisecracking teacher. This gives the story an element of humor and wisdom at the same time, as Will is sort of the Beast&apos;s &quot;Mr. Miagi&quot;.\n\n&quot;Beastly&quot; is mostly family-friendly (PG-13 due to some violence and a bit of crude language, though I don&apos;t remember hearing any outright profanity). So don&apos;t expect a harsh, gritty drama. This film is definitely on the lighter side. Movies I would compare this to include: Penelope (2006) starring Christina Ricci as a girl with a pig snout, or maybe something like Practical Magic (1998) starring Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock as two witches looking for love in a small town. If you like breezy supernatural romances, definitely check this out.",

I guess I just really liked the basic premise, because you have to admit the central idea is pretty weird and nutty. How stoned do you have to get before you come up with a dog that plays basketball? How would that even remotely work? I&apos;m really putting too much thought in this movie I guess, but it&apos;s just so bizarre that I&apos;ve always found it very entertaining. I&apos;ve learned the sequels actually stretch the premise even further and involve dogs that can play soccer, baseball and volleyball, but this one will always be the one and only original &quot;dog does weird athletic stuff it can&apos;t possibly do&quot;-flick.",

      "reviewBody": "The Appaloosa (1966)\n\n** (out of 4) \n\nRather bizarre Western has Matt (Marlon Brando) having his horse stolen by Chuy (John Saxon) so he sets out to get him back. The two men had previous run-ins over a woman (Anjanette Comer) who will come into play as the story plays out.\n\nTHE APPALOOSA is a film that Marlon Brando didn&apos;t really want to make but the paycheck was good so he took the role. When production started he realized that he really didn&apos;t want to do the film so the shooting was somewhat of a disaster with the legend battling director Sidney J. Furie. The end result is a fairly forgettable film that tries to be something different than your typical Western.\n\nThe biggest problem with this movie is the story. In all honesty even by Western standards the story here is quite weak and would barely fill up one of those 50 minute &quot;B&quot; films from the 30s. We basically have the two men running into each other a couple time and the film tries to be psychological and it fails pretty bad. There are really bizarre and weird camera set-ups that are meant to be deep or to bring you into the mental state of the characters but it just doesn&apos;t work. Whatever vision director Furie was trying to bring just doesn&apos;t come across and we&apos;re left with a pretty boring movie.\n\nThe always entertaining Saxon manages to be the best thing here. With his thick Mexican accent and the paint on his face, Saxon manages to make for a fun villain but it&apos;s too bad more wasn&apos;t done with the character. I thought Corner was also good in her wasted role and especially early on when she fears for her safety after trying to break free from Chuy. As for Brando, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s bad here but it&apos;s certainly not into what he&apos;s doing. He ends up mumbling more than anything else and just doesn&apos;t bring any energy or passion to the part."

Inna Churikova&apos;s character is beautiful: the evolution gives her room to show her talent, in a very dramatic manner. The book is very dramatic in the first place, but in a way that push the movie towards the flashy. Overall, I found that the film lacks subtlety and complexity.",

That means that there are a lot of things that are set up here but not resolved. The main storyline is not revolved. I get that it is part of a longer story but a movie needs to have a beginning, a middle and an end. It needs to be able to stand on its own.\n\nThe effects for this are a real mixed bag. The sci-fi spaceship sets look really good. The CGI for the monsters looks really dated and poor. The costumes for the bug transformations mostly look terrible. There are a lot of characters but most of them are only there to get killed and get no development. The movie doesn&apos;t have much of a story. It&apos;s not one of those movies where nothing happens. Something is happening all of the time. There just isn&apos;t much of a through line. There&apos;s a not a lot of rhyme or reason to some of it. It really feels like it&apos;s condensed from a longer story and sometimes coherence suffers as a result. As for the ending, it doesn&apos;t have one as I mentioned before. It just sequel baits and then stops. This one flopped at the box office so that sequel is probably not coming.",

In a deal which would allow Shokichi and Nanao to avoid the conviction and receive a lavish reward, they agree to be a part of a top secret mission - Terraforming Project; 500 years ago, to resolve population explosion on Earth, cockroaches were sent to Mars with mosses to make the atmosphere habitable for humankind. Now in 2599, the mission is to exterminate the roaches and colonize Mars.\r\n\r\nIncluding Shokichi, 15 destitute people from all walks of life have been assembled for the task. They land on Mars with hopes of a better future that awaits them once the mission is completed and they are rewarded. However, the moment Shokichi sets foot, he finds out that cockroaches have evolved into huge creatures with unbelievable strength and mercilessly attack humans. In the midst of this danger, Shokichi is informed that all the crew members have actually undergone an operation to fight against the humanoid cockroaches. With this power, Shokichi and the crew members struggle to defeat those bugs with the hope of returning to Earth.",

Wonderful.Now, sit back and enjoy the best of the best. This is quite simply the best psychological thriller ever made.Often imitated but never bettered. If you have a problem with subtitled films then don&apos;t worry because you will understand this film without reading them. If you want slash and gore, go elsewhere.If you want sophisticated entertainment,you&apos;ve come to the right place.Georges Cluzot&apos;s finest work is a thing of beauty as is his wife Vera, who stars opposite Simone Signoret as the schoolmaster&apos;s wife.From the very start it is very clear that all is not as it seems. But why? and who? What is the terrible secret of the swimming pool and later on, the bathtub? As the tension builds to an unbearable climax, we sit and hide behind our hands, peering through the gaps in our fingers.Oh my God!! it can&apos;t be!.....it is! Do not confuse this movie with the disgraceful remake starring Sharon Stone. All copies of that disaster should be burned. Watch this movie if you are a serious film buff. Rent something else if you have the attention span of a goldfish.Brilliant. 10/10",

Everything appears normal, Erin is a doctor, and Terry runs a big business, drives a Jag, and they live in a huge house. But everything isn&apos;t as it seems or we would have no movie.\n\nRuby starts to get suspicious about things she sees and hears, and the attempts of Terry to explain them seem to mollify her for a time. However, she finds things that are definitely wrong, and makes plans to escape with her brother.\n\nThis is where the thriller begins: car chases, and fights, and death and duplicity. It definitely kept my interest, and I suspect it will keep yours.",

      "reviewBody": "Diverso da chi? is a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny. Its manic, screeching, chattering pace is exhausting and goes nowhere but around and around and around a tired old formula that was done much better seventy-five years ago during the heyday of Hollywood screwball comedies. All it adds to that formula is an appallingly moronic and insulting gay element.\n\nThe ONLY thing that makes this irritating and offensive movie worth watching is a lovely, sweet and courageously subtle (especially in this Bugs Bunny cartoon of a movie) performance by Filippo Nigro. I started watching this movie to see Luca Argentero (who was captivating in Özpetek&apos;s Saturno contro), but I stayed with it ONLY for Nigro.\n\nI disagree that Argentero will become a big international star despite starring in movies like this. He may still, but if he wants to (and if he&apos;s smart, he doesn&apos;t, because superstardom destroys the humanity in actors) he&apos;d better get smarter about what roles he takes. He is gorgeous for sure, but if he has talent to match his looks he doesn&apos;t show it in this turkey. He only does two expressions: confused and pouting, and only the pouting is believable.\n\nAnd for such a gorgeous man, he has surprising little sexual chemistry on screen; the love scenes with both his male and female lovers are equally contrived and unconvincing. In Saturno contro, Özpetek may have brought out more than Argentero actually has inside."

      "reviewBody": "A lot more than just following native community leader Raoni and his quest for preserving nature, and the way of life and traditions from the Brazilian indians, which was an important cause embraced by many famous people around the world and that made him a known figure after this movie, this Oscar nominated documentary presents a native tribe from Mato Grosso, their traditions and the problems they face while dealing with the constant invasion of their territories due to the white man&apos;s intrusion with farmers expanding their cattle fields. A constant fight of 500 years where countless native communities were extinct and the few remainings struggle to preserve what they have which isn&apos;t much but it&apos;s all they have.\n\nThe version I&apos;ve seen was the one narrated by Marlon Brando (other versions are narrated by veteran actor Paulo César Peréio or actor Jacques Perrin), and the acclaimed actor has a brief appearance at the introduction when a huge March in Washington followed American natives fighting for their rights which at the time were being ignored by some major policies. If they weren&apos;t getting visibility and respect while living in a developed nation, you can only imagine what went in Brazil at that particular decade and even most recently when the talks of land demarcation on indian terrorities is a cause of controversy for those who feel entitled to their land so they could use as a resourceful place to be devastated to gain profits.\n\nBesides the many difficulties they faced and are presented throughout the film, I was mostly immersed by the natives culture, traditions and rituals. Most of what&apos;s shown from how they deal with the white man, their hunting, fight training, body paintings and all can be seen in countless TV projects or similar, but somehow there&apos;s a great sense of curiosity given that one keeps imagining living in that particular manner or even some deep thoughts on how much a primitive community rooted in tradition manages to survive without wanting more than what they know. Unlike us and our everlasting pursuit for progress and technological advancements, they just want to keep with what they know and what comes from the exterior world is simply pointless and they can live better without - except for medicine and treatment since the times around them evolved and the loads of disease they suffer, getting from the white man, can&apos;t be cured with just the plants from their environment.\n\nThe final third of the film is the encounter of Raoni - after countless meetings with his tribe, a rival tribe and members of Funai (a government foundation for the native), he meets with naturalist Cláudio Villas-Boas, the man who found Raoni and his tribe some years earlier, and together they go to the crazed big city of São Paulo where Raoni gets to visit not only the major finantial center of the country and its historical places but he also visits a small tribe located in the city where the small group of indians live on a territory owned by a Japanese company. It&apos;s a brief moment and Roani simply can&apos;t understand such thing happening. Back in Mato Grosso, despite the threats of losing his land, he knows that he&apos;ll be there or find means to go deep in the jungle. But no, he found ways to spread his message in Brazil and around the globe in order to fight for the place he lives. And the world also depends on it as well...the forest.\n\nHighly enjoyable and informative film. 10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart, good humor, and a classic message about love and honor, and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&apos;s Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn&apos;t need it.\n\nI&apos;ve now seen this film about six times, and though I can&apos;t say that I see something new in it every time (it&apos;s just not that complicated), I can say that I have enjoyed it each and every time. The characters, though relatively uncomplicated, are very lovable and the casting is quite excellent all around. Before Brokeback Mountain, William Thatcher was Heath Ledger&apos;s most memorable role. He&apos;s a poor boy from London&apos;s Cheapside who wants to change his stars and to become an honored knight. Travelling from tournament to tournament with his fellow indentured servants, his liege passes on, and William seizes the moment - taking his armor and his horse to become Sir Ulrich Von Liechtenstein of the Gelderland. \n\nHe is joined by the other now-free indentures, and eventually, by Chaucer and a female Farrier played by the wonderful Laura Fraser. Eventually, William falls in love with a princess and is challenged by a rival for her affections with a lot more experience, money and political clout. The love story, which could have easily become a distracting annoyance, in fact, comes to dominate and drive the story very nicely.\n\nSpecial kudos to Ledger, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany and James Purefoy for their awesome performances. And extra special kudos to Director Brian Helgeland for pulling off an impossible task - taking a fairy tale, making us want to believe it, and yet retaining some wonderful elements of silliness often missing in the fairy tale genre. This would make a wonderful romantic living-room double feature with The Princess Bride.\n\nRecommendation: Definitely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.\n\nThis is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.\n\nWhat makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don&apos;t look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you&apos;re going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn&apos;t no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that. \n\nPlus the Farrley Brothers added in &quot;some things&quot; that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you&apos;re thinking, &quot;Better them than me&quot;.....even if it was you!\n\nNot for eveyone&apos;s taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you&apos;ve reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things. This is as simple as it gets. Don&apos;t put too much into it, it is what it is, and to me, it was really funny! Good Show!",

      "reviewBody": "1970s movies are so cynical, aren&apos;t they? Dark, depressing, and often grainy-looking and washed out. &quot;Marathon Man&quot; fits that description. It&apos;s good, of course - very good - but it&apos;s not exactly a good time. Know what I mean?\n\nWilliam Goldman, one of Hollywood&apos;s few celebrity screenwriters, wrote both the original novel and the script for this film version. I find him a bit overrated, but here he does a good job of elevating hack-level thriller material into a sort of art form. The beginning of the film is particularly well-written and intriguing, since it&apos;s full of creepy and cryptic events that are not immediately explained. But, alas, I find the ultimate explanation of these events to be rather prosaic and disappointing.\n\nSo, I think the movie&apos;s strengths lie in the acting and directing, more so than the story. Olivier and Scheider give particularly great performances, and Marthe Keller comes across as appropriately sweet and sexy (her big &quot;secret,&quot; though, should be really easy for anyone to guess!) I&apos;m a little less enamored of Dustin Hoffman, whose character is inexplicably nicknamed &quot;Babe.&quot; He&apos;s just way too old to be a typical graduate student (almost forty years old, to be precise), and he simply doesn&apos;t have much charisma to me. Usually I like normal-looking, non-glamorous actors, but somehow Hoffman doesn&apos;t float my boat.\n\nStill, it&apos;s hard not to sympathize with the poor guy while he&apos;s being pursued, beaten, tortured etc. The &quot;dental horror&quot; scene is still quite effective, though it&apos;s rather short; I was more impressed by the subsequent chase through the dark streets of NYC. (The city, by the way, looks like a hellish, crime-infested, debris-strewn pit in this movie - like it does in most 1970s productions!)\n\nIn the end, &quot;Marathon Man&quot; isn&apos;t quite another &quot;French Connection,&quot; but it&apos;s got more than enough suspense to crush a lot of the dross that infests theaters today. It&apos;s worth watching just for the terrifying scene when the bad guys start tearing Hoffman&apos;s door off its hinges - it&apos;s good stuff.",

Schweighoefer is a charismatic actor on who this film is built  my wife commented that his presence reminded her of James Dean. To me the psychology of the human relations was more important than the actions  the opposite of how Hollywood movies usually proceed. The scene with the suicidal girl on the roof  the Cologne cathedral in the background  is a game of life and death that keeps you breathless. Were it not for some sentimental, heavy scenes (in particular between November and Crash), I would rate it 10.",

Everything about this film is bleak in terms of setting, subject matter and the harsh lives of the protagonists. What makes it bearable is the performances. Here we have another courageous and uncompromising portrayal by Pierre Fresnay as the Sacristan who takes over the running of the church once the villagers have been deserted by their distinctly non-compassionate Rector, played by Jean Brochard. Excellent performances also from Daniel Gélin, Madeleine Robinson, Germaine Kerjean and the utterly mesmerising Andrée Clement so tragically taken by tuberculosis in her thirties. Although directed and performed with the utmost conviction this grim, doom-laden and strangely Godless film is completely devoid of hope and will no doubt continue to languish in obscurity.",

I rated it a 7/10 because I enjoyed it that much even though it is kind of corny and silly, but that is the point, it is just intended to be that kind of film and I think it succeeds at that. Look how Bison uses buttons and a joystick to set off river mines, obviously a nod to the gaming console; it celebrates all of this more than poking fun at it or succumbing to it. I thought that the filmmakers did a fine job of achieving what they set out to do. The sets were cool, cinematography good, acting adequate, the script was not real deep but what do you expect. I thought that Raul Julia and Ming-Na Wen were terrific in their parts.\n\nThe only change I would have made was excise the Blanka storyline as I thought that it was too dark and cruel in the context of such a silly fun fatuous movie. So, all in all, I rate it a 7/10, though I am somewhat biased as I played the Street Fighter II video game before and was familiar with the characters.",

The editing is just fantastic.The conductor is such a dignified man, great presence. I really liked that the footage of the actual performance shows only a little of Beethoven, but then surprises us with a nice excerpt of another piece, which they also play very well.

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Skin&apos;, set in a grim Dutch working class area in 1979, tells the story of Frankie, who starts out as a normal, somewhat rebellious teenager, and ends up as a neo-Nazi in jail. His Jewish father, a concentration camp survivor, is unable to communicate with his wife and son, which frustrates Frankie and has already created a clearly uneasy father-son relationship at the beginning of the film. When Frankie&apos;s mother gets seriously ill and needs to be hospitalized, all frustrations come creeping out from under Frankie&apos;s skin and a rough process in which he alienates from his father and most of his friends is set in motion. Even though Frankie does not intend for it to happen, he gradually finds some solace with a group of skinhead neo-Nazis, and escalation ensues.\n\nThere are some parallels between this film and the classic &apos;American History X&apos;, but whereas that film shows us how a remorseful neo-Nazi seeks redemption, this one explores how exactly a young person who would seem an unlikely candidate for adopting such views ends up doing so for all the wrong reasons (if there even are any right ones to begin with). Moreover, &apos;Skin&apos; is a strong, gripping story about what may happen when communication fails, set against a background of growing intolerance and violence.",

      "reviewBody": "Now that the dust has settled, it&apos;s safe to say that Lars von Trier&apos;s much-vaunted Puzzy Power project was little more than a paltry publicity stunt. Not that there isn&apos;t a market for &quot;erotica&quot; (rather than plain old porn) geared towards female viewers, but as usually its progenitors didn&apos;t have a clue so they just made it look pretty instead. Hiring experimental video artist Knud Vesterskov, who had next to no experience with conventional cinema (albeit of the adult variety), for their inaugural effort proved positively disastrous. His self-penned script, relayed entirely in voice-over narration, falls squarely into purple prose territory filled with florid metaphors which should raise an occasional chuckle between stifling yawns.\n\nThe setting&apos;s a recent romantic past but rather than give it the full Mills &amp; Boon treatment, Vesterskov shatters the illusion right from the get-go with an appallingly inappropriate techno thump by Peter Kyed who scored Nicholas Winding Refn&apos;s PUSHER trilogy. A young woman (played by Danish singer/songwriter Christiane Björg Nielsen) sits in a gorgeous floral garden reading from her grandmother&apos;s diary detailing her erotic awakening at the hands of scarlet woman Lola (Katja Kean). Although the movie&apos;s ostensible focus, granny Constance (insipid starlet Anaïs in the flesh, voiced by filmmaker Hella Joof from the excellent OH HAPPY DAY) is completely overshadowed by her mentrix who supplies the lion&apos;s share of lensed lasciviousness.\n\nOnly five people do the dirty here, so it&apos;s a good thing at least that they are all photogenic, naturally none more so than the breathtakingly beautiful Kean, easily Denmark&apos;s most popular porn performer ever. Poor little unseasoned Anaïs barely stands a chance going up against this one woman volcano of voluptuousness. The three men run the gamut from boyish (cute Niels Dencker) to muscled macho (hunky Mark Duran, as well-traveled a stud as the dwindling Danish dirty movie culture currently allows) with bald Michael Larsen, briefly popping up for a threesome, falling somewhere in-between.\n\nIt becomes clear quite early on that Vesterskov has little erotic imagination of his own, content to crib from recent carnal concoctions such as Philip Christian&apos;s IMMORTAL DESIRE and Michael Ninn&apos;s FOREVER NIGHT, with Andrew Blake&apos;s aloof posturing thrown in for good measure. Sex is professionally if dispassionately performed, with an obligatory emphasis on female pleasure, which need not be a bad thing as Candida Royalle&apos;s Femme flicks confirmed time and again. Perhaps Puzzy Power needed a proper pussy in power as Lisbeth Lynghöft did a much better job of it on the subsequent PINK PRISON. Only at CONSTANCE&apos;s climax (pun intended) does the spectacle sputter to life with nude under her cloak Kean showing up at gamekeeper Duran&apos;s rustic cottage for a Lady Chatterley-inspired roll in the hay that will leave your embers glowing. Too bad it&apos;s a case of too little too late.",

      "reviewBody": "There are very few movies that dispense with the coyness and cleverness of a catchy title, and simply tell you flat out what you can expect to see. This is one of them.\n\nDirector Joseph Lovett&apos;s documentary is kind of like one of those retrospectives you see on VH-1 or the E! Network, only with more naked men, hot explicit sex (well, explicit for a documentary), and snapshots frozen in time that show us visions of a bygone decade, where the Gay Wide World went from draconian repression, to sexual liberation of Bacchanalian proportions, to the next chapter where &quot;the bill came due&quot; for all that excessive indulgence.\n\nNo one clucks their tongues or passes judgment, as the interviewees regale us with tales of just how things were back in those days, (although you have to consider that there was some extravagant embellishments here and there.) I was only privy to a taste of the lifestyle of which the subjects speak in this film, and I guess I should be grateful for it, because more than likely it saved my life and the lives of more than a few other people I know. Even back then, in my younger days, I only knew of the stories about Fire Island, the New York-based bars, baths and clubs and the infamous Piers and Trucks through hearsay, and it all sounded fabulous, hedonistic and legendary even as it was happening.\n\nThere are touches of the ominous, though, and it certainly doesn&apos;t shy away from the dark side of all that &quot;jazz.&quot; There were risks other than STD&apos;s, and in pursuit of ultimate bliss, there were some who still paid the ultimate price, and that was way before AIDS came to call.\n\nFunny, touching, shocking and sobering all at once, the only drawback is that it isn&apos;t the fully rounded account it could be. Maybe Lovett can find a way to extend this into a series and capture more accounts of the shock waves that spread out into other parts of the country, from the &quot;epicenter of the gay universe&quot; as someone in the doc describes the Big Apple. New York and San Francisco were important touchstones of gay culture, but they were not the &apos;Alpha and Omega&apos; of the Seventies&apos; sexual revolution.\n\nAt the very least, it is an important historical record that a new generation can learn from, for those who think that &quot;Stonewall&quot; is just another place in the mall where you can buy acid-washed jeans.\n\nAnd on a sadder note, maybe the reason why it hasn&apos;t been possible to film a more complete history of &quot;Gay Sex in the Seventies,&quot; is because many of the eyewitnesses to this remarkable time in history are no longer here to tell about it. I certainly hope that isn&apos;t the case.",

      "reviewBody": "I have always enjoyed this 1985 classic comedy crime mystery gem starring Chevy Chase, and I have watched it several times over the years, and trust me, the movie never gets old. It is one of those movies that have that special ingredient to it that makes it possible to watch it again and again.\n\nWriter Andrew Bergman came up with a very enjoyable and entertaining storyline that incorporated elements of the typical Chevy Chase comedy and elements of crime and thriller as well. And the result it just great. The storyline is pretty straight forward and easy to follow, but it never actually becomes too predictable, nor does the pacing of the movie ever slow down.\n\n&quot;Fletch&quot; showcases a lot of Chevy Chase&apos;s talent and his ability to portray various characters, and there were plenty of characters in the movie, many of which just makes me laugh hard every time. But the movie also has the likes of Joe Don Baker, Geena Davis, Tim Matheson, M. Emmet Walsh and George Wendt on the cast list, so there are a good amount of familiar faces if you watched movies or TV during the 1980s.\n\nThere are lots of funny situations throughout the movie, and Chevy Chase delivers some hilarious characters that really compliment the situations and scenes quite well, as well as providing the correct type of comedy needed to spruce up each scene. Personally, I am always busted up with laughing when he tries to evade the angry Doberman dog, where he sits inside the car with a camera and the dog is on the hood of the vehicle barking like mad, and Fletch says &quot;Smile, say flesh. Look, defenseless babies&quot; and the dog stops to check.\n\nThe dialogue in the movie is also good, and it feels like Chevy Chase was allowed to just make up names for his characters as they filmed. The way he comes up with names on the fly is just hilarious, and results in some wonderfully absurd and funny names.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen &quot;Fletch&quot; and find yourself with the opportunity to do so. I can warmly and highly recommend that you so, because this is definitely the embodiment of Chevy Chase comedy.\n\nMy rating of this timeless comedy classic is a solid seven out of ten stars. It is well worth a watch, and most certainly well worth your time, money and effort.",

      "reviewBody": "There are so many things to appreciate in this movie. First and foremost, Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren give outstanding performances as the First Couple of London&apos;s underworld. He, with the Cockney-made-good aspirations for status and the &quot;class&quot; he can never attain, epitomizes the hands-on manager overtaken by larger events. She, the cool-headed savvy- tough-and-sexy moll, is almost on top of things enough to redeem the situation but not quite. The key elements of the underworld ruling coalition-- dirty councilor and policeman, lieutenants of varying backgrounds both tough and educated-- make you believe in how this man has achieved peace through strength.\n\nThe film&apos;s plot is Byzantine whodunit, with gangland-style violence as an accent piece that seems downright tame in the age of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The real hidden star, though, is late-70&apos;s London-- oh so run-down and yet full of the potential that drives Harold&apos;s ambitions. The views from boating on the Thames are unrecognizable to those who have only seen modern London--- the sole landmarks in common are Tower Bridge and the Savoy hotel. The towers of the City and modern Docklands are just a twinkle in dreamers&apos; eyes.\n\nOverall TLGF is a modern tragedy in the true land-of-Shakespeare tradition, somewhere between Macbeth and Hamlet and King Lear: ambition, betrayal, and the sweep of history interact richly without being heavy-handed in symbolism or over-artiness. This is a satisfying and complex film that invites re-viewing and reflection.",

This film digs deep into the psyche of what it can feel like after being violated and humiliated by another human being. Everyone talks about the ending but the true horror of the film is the very long middle segments that explores Dawson&apos;s character true descent into depression and darkness. She just doesn&apos;t &quot;move on&quot;. She goes from living a normal college life to exploring the dark side of pain and trauma by failing out of school, drugs, alcohol and finally revenge. This is not a pure revenge story. It&apos;s more about the thin line between being prey or being the predator. At the end of the film , Rosario&apos;s character still feels empty, she still has a void. She crosses the line to become the predator but found out that it&apos;s extremely easy to become a predator. The difficult part of life is healing. With that said, the revenge is pretty sweet. I did not see that coming at all and honestly enjoyed it from the viewers perspective but not from the perspective of reality. Excellent film.",

This one is towards the top of the heap though. Coming later in his career you can tell he&apos;s becoming a bit old by &apos;82 but that doesn&apos;t stop our masked hero from getting in the ring and jumping around like a younger nut. This film might be the weirdest Santo movie I&apos;ve seen. It involves a jungle cult that&apos;s headed by two identical twin sisters with massive bosoms(these are both played by the same actress, Grace Renat, tahnks to a charmingly crappy split-screen effect) that use an illuminated meteorite to see the future. One sister is unfortunately evil(we know this because she wears the black outfit) and with her accomplice, pro-wrestler Tinieblas(who I&apos;m pretty sure plays a good guy in earlier lucha-libre films) they form their own bad-guy cult that worships a C3PO Halloween mask. There&apos;s also kung fu vs. wrasslin&apos; and a jungle gal and her wolf(really just a big dog) brother that never do anything all that wild but the thought was nice. The highlight is Santo throing a guy into a rotating plane&apos;s propeller that neatly slices him into 2 halves. Good trash cinema!",

The film features ridiculous governmental soldiers wearing nose cannons, borderline offensive content that may not be suitable for everybody. The type of silly effects, when a body gets a head or limb chopped off, 10 gallons of vivid red blood issues from the wound. \n\nThe story is absurd in the extreme, when the protagonist Rin has her 16th birthday, she not only discovers she is a mutant but both her parents are murdered by the government! This alone is a prime example of how silly and elaborate the story quickly becomes. I guess one could draw a comparison to Peter Parker getting bit by a spider and his Uncle being shot all at once. It would seem that not only is it a requirement to have superpowers one must also have a super tragedy to re-examine their part in the universe. Rin in this aspect is no exception, with people from her home town wanting to skin her and mount her on display at the local mall. Then meeting a weird group of girls led by a slightly demonic kabuki figure. \n\nLots of cheesy effects, blood, guts, and gore, makes this movie a laugh riot. The boss fights are very confusing with the viewer wondering who they should be cheering on to victory. With weapons like an ass chainsaw and boob swords this is not a family friendly film. I viewed this subtitled on Netflix this month.",

The child that sticks most in my mind was a lovely Black girl of maybe 8 or 10, with stumps for arms and legs. She could walk and play the marimba with her prosthetics, but she really shone when those prosthetics came off. I can still see her jumping on the bed with her siblings, laughing and so vibrant and alive. \n\nThere was nothing sappy or sentimental about &quot;Who Are the DeBolts.&quot; Just a family that was a little larger and more diverse than what we&apos;re used to. And I think if only for the lesson in valuing diversity, it would be wonderful if this film made a huge comeback.",

Two characters meet by chance in a Scandinavian city, a woman in search for her path in life, and a man who seems to have found his, only it doesn&apos;t feel like it is supposed to. Also the wrong significant other for the main character, Pernille, is a sketch of so many that roam the real world, hiding their faults behind a phony exterior, pretending to spread spirituality. And then there are the real ones... who do spread it, while doubting their own meanwhile. It is a precious movie, comforting to watch, and for those willing to resonate with it, it appeals to deeper levels, as mentioned above. Seen once, it stays with you and can be on your Christmas list each year. I wish more movies like this were available.",

      "reviewBody": "Harriet Craig (1950) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nForgotten Columbia film about a wife (Joan Crawford) who cares only about her possessions, her way of life and anything that involves her. Her blind husband (Wendell Corey) soon starts to realize that he&apos;s not married to the type of woman he thought he was. HARRIET CRAIG is a film that doesn&apos;t get talked about too often when it comes to Crawford but when you step back and look at the work she did starting with MILDRED PIERCE you can&apos;t help but call this another winner. As I go through these post-MGM Crawford films I must say that my respect for her continues to grow because she took on all sorts of roles and did a wonderful job at all of them. There&apos;s just something so evil and cold about her character here and it&apos;s something that perhaps lived inside of the actress. If MOMMIE DEAREST had been written like this film it would have been a masterpiece. If Faye Dunaway&apos;s performance was as great as what Crawford delivers here then I think she would have been willing to talk about it. I mention that film because the type of character that film portrays Crawford as is pretty much the type she&apos;s playing here. The coldness of this character is something that you&apos;ll certainly hate but the constantly lying and the way she puts herself before anything else just makes this one of the most memorable characters out there. What I loved about Crawford&apos;s performance is this bubbling evilness that you can feel with her character and you just get the feeling at any second she&apos;s willing to make something worse just to benefit herself. Corey also deserves a lot of credit as the husband as he makes for a very sympathetic character. The sequence when everything finally breaks and the two go at it is rather priceless in regards to the brilliance of the acting. The supporting cast includes good performances by Lucile Watson, K.T. Stevens, William Bishop, Ellen Corby and Viola Roache. HARRIET CRAIG is a film that&apos;s not often talked about, which is a real shame because Crawford&apos;s performance certainly deserves more attention."

Except maybe &quot;See this film&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the excellent work by Daniel and Pascal&quot;, who carries you through this neat, funny and heartbreaking story about &apos;spending your eighth day&apos; - your own day! \n\nSeeing this film made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It appears, that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either if it&apos;s pleasing a career or just consuming TV-shows and ballgames. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference. About taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day)... At least that was what I got from &apos;The Eighth Day&apos;.",

I have watched this film at least 8 times, and have seen something new in it every time.\n\nThis is based on a true story, and it is much more than a movie about parents demanding time, effort, and sacrifice of a child chess prodigy. This is about a seven-year-old boy who knows who he is, and resists adults attempts to make him into someone he is not.  Max Pomeranc gives about the best performance I have ever seen by a child actor in the role of Joshua Waitzkin.  Fortunately, Josh has a mother (played by Joan Allen) who recognizes Josh&apos;s innate goodness and protects him from those who want to change him.  This movie is about a father (Joe Mangtegna) learning to respect and appreciate who his son is, instead of trying to make him into something he isn&apos;t.\n\nI had seen the movie three times before I understood the title.  The adults are searching for &quot;the next Bobbie Fischer&quot; (a television reporter in the film uses those words).  Josh Waitzkin asserts to his teacher &quot;I&apos;m not him.&quot;\n\nWatch this movie with your children!",

      "reviewBody": "Had this movie taken on another title, or be a modern version of the novel, I would&apos;ve been more forgiving. Let me repeat again: this movie does not reflect Jane Austen&apos;s Mansfield Park, neither does the main character portray Fanny Price in the least bit.\n\nFor those who have never read Mansfield Park, this book Austen&apos;s &quot;virtuest&quot; novel. Generally people don&apos;t like Fanny because she is too modest.\n\nFanny Price is an exceptional character. Her modesty can never be properly portrayed by Hollywood. So I hope that no one will try to make another movie out of this novel. I love Pride and Prejudice as much as I love this novel, but this novel is far different from P&amp;P. P&amp;P can be captured on screen without boring out the audiences but MP cannot. Nevertheless, this does not make the novel any less valuable.\n\nFanny Price may not be as attractive as Elizabeth Bennet. But if these characters existed in real life, I would trust Fanny over Elizabeth any day. As witty as Elizabeth is, her judgement is faulty (as a result, the 2nd half of the title is called &quot;prejudice&quot;). She cannot discern who Wickham is, and believed in his good appearance. Fanny is just the opposite: her intuition is un-mistakable. Who, except for Fanny, knew that the handsome Henry Crawford was un-trustworthy?",

The drug which can transform an ordinary man to supermen for 5 minutes. (The director should be inspired from Hollywood film called &quot;Limitless&quot; &amp; many more - No offence though)\n\nIru mugan started with an amazing top view of Malaysia, however simply failed to become an impressive thriller. Anand Shanker&apos;s first film &quot;Arima Nambi&quot; was quite impressive as it was a well- cooked light meal to digest for. When it boils down to Iru Mughan, it&apos;s just a high calorie junk food which just fills the stomach without supplying any minerals. The director cum writer Anand Shankar have had an excellent plot in hand, however the dragging script formation &amp; laziness in showing the perfection in tailoring the scenes (Except Action) are clearly visible. The forced comic scenes by a Tamil Cop in Malaysia sits uneasily with the seriousness of Hero&apos;s mission. Why suddenly a flash back scene &amp; a song while chasing the truck to locate the main villain? The script is however flavored with twist and turns which was highly predictable for me. Anand should come up with challenging / engaging thriller if in case he gets date from an acclaimed actor.\n\nWithout Chiyan Vikram &amp; Nayanthara the movie could have been a crap, Anand should be thankful for their honest performance. Hats off to Vikram for his classic performance as both Akilan &amp; Love. Nayanthara was looking beautiful in all frames irrespective of quality of the movie. Thampi Ramayah&apos;s performance was decent, however exaggerated comic element was irrelevant for such a film. Nithya Menen becoming quite Typo character as she continues to do supporting actor along with the lead heroin. The rest of the cast were decent enough to play their own roles. \n\nWhen it comes to the technical side, Ace Cinematographer R D Rajashekar really deserves appreciation for brilliant delivery of frames and some moving close up shots. The top view of Malaysia, Kashmir &amp; songs were excellently captured. However, bit disappointed with Bhuvan&apos;s editing department as I guess the songs were misplaced and the flashback scene didn&apos;t sink well with the story narration. And it affected the film&apos;s flaw drastically. The choreography team did well &amp; innovative in all songs except &quot;Helena&quot;. Hariss Jayraj strikes with his impact-full BGM &amp; songs right from the opening credits.\n\nBottom Line –\n\nThe only reward if you spend time &amp; money in theatre by watching Iru Mughan would be the music by Haris Jayraj &amp; tremendous performance by Chiyan Vikram.",

      "name": "A Very Under-Appreciated Film",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; was a film that captivated me during childhood and still intrigues me today, albeit on a different level. As viewers&apos; comments have noted, &quot;Last Days&quot; is a little heavy handed with its moral theme and the character development of Marcus the Blacksmith-turned Gladiator-turned head of the Arena. Marcus (Preston Foster) is an innately good man, blessed with a loving wife, baby son, and a career, until an out-of-control chariot shatters his existence. With his wife (Gloria Shea) nearing death, Marcus must turn to the Arena, against his earlier values, now faced with the reality that money is the key to everything. Marcus becomes a killing machine, progressing up the gladiator billing to the top spot, but then adopts the son, Flavius (David Holt), of a slain adversary, resulting in another change. Acquiring a Greek slave (Wyrley Birch) to tutor his son, Marcus eventually heads for the Holy Land to make his fortune, meets Pontius Pilate (Basil Rathbone), and encounters Christ. Pilate uses Marcus in a symbiotic way that benefits them both, but it is the Lord who heals Holt when he lies near death. Marcus turns his back on the Lord, despite the protests of Simon (Murray Kinnell), in order to get his money back to Pompeii. The scene shifts, with Flavius (John Wood) now a young man appalled by the events in the Arena and struggling to remember the man who healed him in his youth. The conflict between father and son, arrival of Pilate to take Flavius to Rome, the corrupt Prefect (Louis Calhern) who demands gore for the &quot;Games,&quot; and Flavius&apos; romance with a slave (Dorothy Wilson) all intertwine and lead to the climatic eruption of Vesuvius. Marcus redeems himself in the emotional conclusion.\n\nAs a child, I loved Marcus&apos; spiritual journey from innocent joy to sorrow to hard-hearted bitterness to mercenary greed and, finally, to redemption. As an adult, I still like the tale, but have focused more on the acting and production values. I disagree with the commentators who call the acting &quot;wooden.&quot; Foster gives one of the best performances of his career as Marcus. As many note, Rathbone renders a sympathetic, sensitive delineation of Pilate. And the supporting players are superb: Edward Van Sloan as a kindly neighbor, Frank Conroy as a kind but condescending noble, Gloria Shea as the young wife, Dorothy Wilson as the son&apos;s love interest, Calhern as the despicable Prefect, Zeffie Tilbury as an old Greek soothsayer, etc. Even the minor roles are well-etched: Ward Bond as a bragging opponent of Marcus, Jason Robards Sr. as the tax gatherer, Reginald Barlow as the slave market proprietor, Kinnell as the Judean peasant, and many more. One can even spot Jim Thorpe throwing coins after a gladiator battle. A few players did very underrated work in &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii.&quot; Alan Hale Sr., as Burbix, captures the rough edges of a criminal and then the fierce loyalty to his understanding friend Marcus. William V. Mong, as the growling-at-times, cowering-with-fear at others, slave dealer, Cleon, gives a wonderful, colorful performance that is anything but &quot;wooden.&quot; But it is Wyrley Birch, as Leaster, the kindly Greek scholar/slave, who provides the moral compass for the film, counseling Marcus, tolerating his greed and seeming imperviousness to the suffering of others, while educating his son Flavius that there is a better way and far superior values than those his father seems to endorse. Birch walks the tightrope and never becomes overly sentimental. Truly, Leaster represents the apex of Birch&apos;s career.\n\n&quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; is an enjoyable film on many levels, including as a morality tale. It is much more than that, however. And for lovers of old character actors, it is a treasure trove!",

      "reviewBody": "By no means is this the greatest Horror film. I gave it a 10 because I thought it was a well made and original film. I was thinking before I watched Livestock that it was going to be another Low budget gore fest which is okay by me but I was so happy it wasn&apos;t. I mean I love those type of films but that&apos;s what every low budget Horror film seems to be these days. No Livestock isn&apos;t that. All though it has some nice gore. Livestock is a well made dark drama. It reminds me of a lot of older Horror films with the pacing and the way the build up is. I was really impressed with the main character Victor, he reminded me of a young Al Pacino. Also the character Annabel did a great job at one point she looked so scared that I felt for her. Livestock is definitely a different type of film. It&apos;s about a cult but they&apos;re not the cult like all those great occult films from the 70&apos;s. They&apos;re more like modern day gangsters, which is an idea I loved. All in all Livestock gives something different and I appreciate that. There is one scene in a creepy room which looks so cool it seemed so surreal to me. I loved it. Livestock has good acting, it&apos;s shot well, it&apos;s got a new take on gangsters and the direction was very good. After seeing this film I really look forward to what this director does next. I think this is a really enjoyable film if you give it a chance.",

De Sica himself plays a young physician in an orphanage for girls where a young girl named Teresa &quot;Venerdi&apos;&quot; or &quot;Teresa Friday&quot; (because that was the day she arrived) becomes infatuated with him. The doctor is carrying on a romance at the same time with a flirtatious singer, Loletta, played by a feisty Anna Magnani in a short but fabulous supporting role. The expressions of boredom on her face as she goes through a tiresome and tacky dance number are a wonder to behold. Teresa, the love-struck heroine, is played by the lovely Adriana Benetti, whom Italian film buffs remember from Blasetti&apos;s landmark QUATTRO PASSI FRA LE NUVOLE, made a year later."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Is this what they mean in other countries by &apos;Swedish sin&apos;?&quot;\n\nThis film feels like it was inspired by the French New Wave, having as it does a sense of cinematic freedom and experimentation. It&apos;s also wonderfully empowering to the young woman who is its lead character, played well by Inger Taube. She&apos;s allowed to express her sexuality before being married, decide for herself what to do when she gets pregnant, and not fall apart when the men behave badly, or because of what&apos;s happened to her. On the contrary, she navigates her life with maturity, not confined to conventionality, and for all that, I enjoyed it.\n\nWithout devolving into titillation, this film is unabashed about the young woman&apos;s sexuality, starting with her doing it in the stairway with her date from the movie house, and then picking up another guy while he&apos;s polishing his hubcaps, going for a ride with him where they eventually steam up the windows. Later he&apos;s in front of her bedroom mirror, gyrating his hips, and, kneeling, she grabs him from behind before another session in bed. We get the idea it was vigorous because afterwards, observing a broken leg post, she says, &quot;Did you see what&apos;s happened to the bed? That&apos;s what I call love.&quot;\n\nThe thing is, she knows it isn&apos;t really love. When this would-be rocker comes back after she&apos;s had the baby and mention he&apos;s the father, she gives him a perspective shift by saying &quot;you helped with a few drops.&quot; She doesn&apos;t leap to his suggestion that he&apos;s ready for marriage, knowing that it wouldn&apos;t work out, and knows she doesn&apos;t need him. She&apos;s not doomed despite her pregnancy, and is allowed to voice &quot;I&apos;m so glad I didn&apos;t get married,&quot; and defend herself when another guy, a would-be intellectual, says crudely &quot;girls like you are only good for one thing&quot; after tries unsuccessfully to force himself on her. On top of it all, her mother provides a rather sober view of marriage, as something that&apos;s &quot;worst in the beginning, then you get used to it.&quot;\n\nThe plot meanders and the camera work and editing are playful, giving the film buoyancy in the face of its heavy themes. The black &amp; white cinematography features interesting camera angles and shots on city streets. We also get bits of early 1960&apos;s life, like the styles in eyeglasses, and the nearly catatonic faces watching television (one the features an early remote control!). The jazzy soundtrack reflects a fluidity and vibrancy, which was also an interesting counterpoint to the music the two men are into, one singing a pale imitation of Chubby Checkers&apos; The Twist, and the other providing his &apos;expert&apos; views on Vivaldi. Quite a nice little find, and makes me want to see more from Bo Widerberg.",

      "reviewBody": "I know we&apos;re not meant to make reference to other reviews on this site (in case they get deleted or move) but I do have to say how much I love keithpettyworld&apos;s sarcasm on his review because he does totally capture the change in this documentary series. The third film sees them run out of contributions from established names and also runs out of old school conflicts and is left with &quot;beef&quot; which is smaller, less significant in terms of the development of the musical genre and also, frankly, between artists who are fleeting – artists who you will not discuss in a few years time if you ever really talked about them.\n\nSo what we get instead is the makers recognising that these films are selling and making more of them whether there is a need or not. The rot is evident from the very start because we are now getting beefs over nothing between names you have heard of, or dumb squabbles between people you haven&apos;t. Nelly and Chingy is the &quot;biggest&quot; name here and to be honest neither artist really interested me. Their &quot;beef&quot; is something over nothing and it goes nowhere. Bang &apos;Em Smurf (no, really) v 50 Cent held interest because it offers a background to 50 Cent but again it goes nowhere and doesn&apos;t inform on anyone beyond being just what it appears. The segment on Twista v Bone Thugs &amp; Harmony is a nothing since both of them say &quot;no problems here&quot; but the most hilarious is Lil Scrappy (who?) doing a high school gig in a gym and gets pushed by a policeman for inciting the crowd – that segment is Lil Scrappy v The Police and ends with the news that Lil Scrappy is suing the police and the officer for $250 million – for being pushed by the way, not shot or raped, just shoved. Hardly &quot;beef&quot; in the way I understand and hardly something worth putting in a film but it is given a good chunk of time.\n\nThe rest o the film more or less stays on this track as we have a few &quot;bigger&quot; recent names such as Ludicrous v TI (it was sorted out in private before anyone knew about it) and TI v Lil Flip and a few others. Like I say, they are all fairly low-level arguments over nothing which, being cynical, is about selling records or, taking things at face value, are just over minor words taking to heart by adults who should know better. There isn&apos;t anything in here about the music, about skill facing off over skill etc. I mean, the first two Beef films were not brilliant but the first one at least had a good structure and some cultural relevance, neither things are present in this film.\n\nBeef III is pretty poor. There is probably enough disposable arguments to satisfy those that like to see things at that level – but if pointless fighting over nothing is what you want then why not just watch Jerry Springer or something like that? The contributions are from a low level and say nothing beyond the superficial while the &quot;beefs&quot; are instantly forgettable. I know there are other films in this series, but this is my last one."

My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.\n\nThe acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.\n\nThe writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.\n\nThis is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."

      "reviewBody": "It was decent. The action sequences were definitely a bit choppy, especially the first one. Also, there were a few times when I had to go &quot;Is that even physically possible?&quot; and the ending left a few loose ends still left, so I was sort of disappointed with that.\n\nIf you don&apos;t pay attention, you will hate this movie. It moves fairly quickly, so once you miss something, it&apos;s gone and you will be lost. So pay attention. The story is actually pretty good and actually feels down to earth, which is more than I can say about quite a few sci-fi movies.\n\nFor the record, I went into this movie not expecting much more than average, and I was slightly surprised. If you go in expecting the next academy award winner, you will completely despise it. It is no Dark Knight, so don&apos;t expect it to be. There&apos;s not much there artistically, so, if you don&apos;t like a movie simply trying to be entertaining for the sake of being entertaining, then you won&apos;t like this one. All in all, it was a good watch, not entirely worth the price for a new movie, so I suggest waiting until it comes to the cheaper theaters (if you have one near by).\n\nAs another note (and I&apos;ll probably get some heat for this) I actually enjoy Vin Diesel as an actor. This is not his best performance, but it&apos;s certainly not his worst (even though I still moderately enjoyed Chronicles of Riddick, I admit it was pretty bad and to this day I still don&apos;t know why I like it.) I think Diesel is good at what he does, although he really hasn&apos;t been in anything that really blows me away, even my favorite Diesel film (Pitch Black) wasn&apos;t completely stunning, but it was really good. With that in mind, this is a Vin Diesel movie, so, if you&apos;re not like me and you don&apos;t like Diesel, you will not like this movie and should just steer clear of it.",

It&apos;s got some of the things generally associated with the genre, but it&apos;s too low-key to authentically belong in the same category as &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;Superfly&quot;.

      "name": "Great traditional Bollywood thriller",
      "reviewBody": "Devi (Madhuri Dixit) is a &quot;precog&quot;, or precognizant--she gets visions of some events before they occur. Near the beginning of the film she receives a vision of her sister, Rama (Sabeeha), being killed, so she desperately tries to stop what she believes is inevitable. Before she can take action, her sister disappears. We move five years into the future. After accidentally ending up at the wrong wedding, Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff) sees Devi and falls in love. He buys the bungalow next to Devi&apos;s and courts her. Soon after, Devi begins receiving another vision of a woman being murdered--only this time she doesn&apos;t know the identity of the victim. Can she find out who the woman is before it is too late? \n\nFor a film that is occasionally very schizophrenic, 100 Days holds together extremely well, even seeming tightly focused overall. The disparate elements come by way of the typical range of genres in a Bollywood film. For example, in the middle of the opening thriller material, all of a sudden director Parto Ghosh breaks out into goofy musical number, complete with faux-action/adventure/crime elements interspersed with pie throwing and a fashion display that&apos;s right out of a Kajagoogoo video--in other words, heavy 1980s style ala leg warmers, big hair, skinny ties and so on. Then for much of the first hour or so, 100 Days becomes more of a light romantic comedy. The thriller material returns stronger in the second half, although the musical numbers still tend to lighten the mood more than they ideally should.\n\nThe tone of the film, then, is a strong contrast to some of the work of other Indian horror/thriller directors such as Ram Gopal Varma, who has famously forgone musical numbers in films such as Raat (1992), as has Guddu Dhanoa in films such as Hawa (2003). But Ghosh manages to tie everything together so that the romantic elements, musical numbers and comic relief (especially in characters such as Balam, played by Laxmikrant Berde) not only provide a balance for the more intense material, but seem integral to the film--100 Days wouldn&apos;t be quite as good as it is in absence of any of its varied moods. Heck, Ghosh even makes repeated footage seem as if it&apos;s necessary rather than just being padding.\n\nAnd of course these different elements help set 100 Days apart from its precursor on the horror/thriller end, Lucio Fulci&apos;s Sette note in nero (1977), which also has elements of Edgar Allan Poe&apos;s short story &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (originally published in 1843). Ghosh also adds a number of interesting, recurring motifs, such as the pervasive conch shells, the statues/taxidermy specimens and the water symbolism, which helps bring to mind later films with a relation to &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, such as Byeong-ki Ahn&apos;s Phone (2002).\n\nThe performances throughout are very good. Of course it&apos;s primarily up to Dixit to help tie all of the threads together, but she receives a lot of help from Shroff, Berde, Javed Jaffrey as Devi&apos;s friend Sunil, and Jay Kalgutar as Jagmohan. At first I was lamenting Berde&apos;s relative absence later in the film, but as he&apos;s strictly comic relief, this was necessary. By the end, Ghosh is only concerned with increasing a roller coaster-like intensity, which he does effectively. Rather than continuing comic relief, he adds other elements to the overarching thriller atmosphere, such as a big action scene set in a junkyard that showcases some impressive stunts.\n\nAnyone who is a fan of the average Bollywood film and who also likes western thrillers should enjoy 100 Days.",

      "reviewBody": "This is my first movie review for IMDb, and I must confess this is being written out of pity and sadness. This is march 2006 and Brontosaurus has only received a vote from 8 people, none of whom bothered to write a comment. Granted, it is not a ground-breaking masterpiece we&apos;re dealing with here (I myself gave it a 6/10), but I would like to think there&apos;s other people out there who LOVE this film like I do, i.e. not so much LOVE as in &quot;it&apos;s a great film, go and see it&quot;, rather LOVE like you love an old friend, or that forest where you built a tree-house as a kid. All the main characters in this film are children and teenagers, and it is definitely meant to be enjoyed by children only (the script is pretty poor, even silly if watched from an adult perspective). It is set in a very small Czech town and the main character (Tomás) is a nature lover and a birdwatcher. The movie shows his struggle to keep the forests he loves clean. And there&apos;s a love/hate sub-plot there too: this girl in his class is secretly in love with him while her brother is his archenemy. I first saw the film when I was eight and it had a huge impact on me. It made me realize that nature was what i felt most passionately about. I became a birdwatcher and fifteen years later I got a degree in zoology at Aberdeen university. Therefore, needless to say, I am incapable of being objective about Brontosaurus, but I think it is a heart-warming and heartfelt little film and I wish it was available for children to see all over the world. In a way, its candor and innocence are its greatest merits. With today&apos;s film industry churning out flicks that not even the directors care about (and this is specially true of kids films), an old little movie that distills genuine love for its subject matter (nature-childhood) is to be treasured. Let your children watch it if they get the chance. It may stay with them forever. It certainly is still part of me. Five years ago I got the chance to see it again on the big screen (thanks to the Filmoteca of Catalonia) and hearing the Brontosaurus song again at the end of the film (as sang by all the children in the movie) brought tears to my eyes. It was time travel, a unique and wonderful experience.",

He stars as Jason Price, who is an ex-special agent who comes out of retirement to protect his friend who is also a witness, and soon gets caught up in a conspiracy where nothing is as it seems. The direction in this movie is competent and well handled. I hope to see more of Marc S. Greinier in the future. For once an intelligent action thriller that doesn&apos;t waste our time. Overall, Hidden Agenda is a worthwhile flick. I give it a 4/5"

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps the premier concern of modern filmmakers is locating somewhere in the film exactly where the film-making process is. This is often incorrectly called irony, self-reference or the odd construction of reflexivity. I call it &apos;folding&apos; and it seems to be everywhere and often in rich and engaging forms. Moreover, it seem to be a central concern of the Australian performing arts community. I imagine it can be traced back to a single person in the seventies on Bennelong Point.\n\nSo much of what we have gotten from this tradition has enriched us all, not the least of which are the actresses who master folded acting. That&apos;s where we get a portrayal of a character and another simultaneous portrayal of an actor portraying that character. Sometimes the &apos;character&apos; in these two portrayals isn&apos;t quite the same. Three mainstream film actresses today can do this. Two are Australian, and one is Kate.\n\nThis is her first film, and it is no surprise at all that the filmmaker has chosen to build a structure that is a representation and is about representation. The original, true story is about two girls, enwrapped in mutual fantasy, probably enhanced by the flush of sex, whose fantastic adventures get out of hand. From this, Jackson reshapes it all. It is now a film about films. Now the girls&apos; fantasy world is a Camelot driven by forces in film. They write. They sculpt characters, based on film characters. Those film characters come &apos;alive&apos; and form a world in which the girls live in parallel with the real world. So far so good.\n\nBut Jackson goes further. Some of the film prototypes are simple characters: Mario Lanza-like. Simple glamour with no pretense or irony. But there is the amazing Orson Welles also. Orson is not pretty, he is not direct, he is a folded prototype himself. The two worlds conflict, and that conflict is reflected in each world. In the Borovnian (&apos;borrow&apos;-nian) world, this is a conflict between two clay figures: the Welles and the Lanza, the winner getting to bed and impregnate both princesses. In the &apos;real&apos; world, the conflict carries over to the two houses, and even within Juliet&apos;s house between the bookish metaphysical father and the sexy &apos;psychologist- but touchy-feely&apos; mother.\n\nWelles was the one who reinvented the ordinary flat world of film into a melange of folding techniques. The film world since the late forties has been a combination of struggles and syntheses between the forth world of Welles and the simple dramatic stage of Griffith.\n\nEven the very young Kate surfs and exploits these levels with aplomb. Even as a teenager she gives us messages from each of these folds - not at precisely the same time as Julianne would later, but strongly nonetheless.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1776. France and England are in perpetual war. After the Declaration of Independence, British troops land in New York. Fur trapper Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) had lost most of his family. All he has left is his boat and his son. The revolutionaries confiscate his boat and they promise to pay him in gold in two weeks after the war is to end. His son Ned unwittingly signs up for the revolution and Tom is forced to join up to protect him. Daisy McConnahay (Nastassja Kinski) is the rebellious daughter of a rich New York family. She is drawn to the revolution and rebels against his war profiteering father. Sgt. Maj. Peasy (Donald Sutherland) is the ruthless English soldier who fights alongside his drummer boy son.\n\nThe son is the brattiest of brats. Pacino is Italian to his core. There is no way to alleviate that and his natural accent doesn&apos;t help. Kinski is foreign in her accent and annoyingly arrogant in her rebellion. Of course, her family is horribly selfish. The British are cartoonish. The revolutionaries don&apos;t start off well either. It&apos;s an ugly world overall. The only compelling work comes from Sutherland who knows how to play his uncomprising role without becoming a caricature. It is interesting to depict the rebellion start with such an ugly mob. Usually they&apos;re more noble than that. That has to be a part of the reason why this movie bombed so badly. There are also other pressing problems.\n\nIt&apos;s notable that the black actors barely speak a word. I&apos;m sure the movie is trying to say a little something about slavery. In Philadelphia, the slaves are rising up as freedom rings out all around them but it&apos;s left confused. Obviously, none of them are freed in reality but it&apos;s not clear from the movie. I think the blacks being march off in the opposite direction is suppose to be them being sent into slavery in the south. I also have a problem with Pacino fighting off the two Indian scouts. It&apos;s barely believable and it would be easily solved if the friendly Indians arrive a minute earlier. They could help him kill the two Indian scouts. In addition, I don&apos;t understand why he doesn&apos;t go with his son at the end. He spends the entire movie rescuing his son but leaves him for the city life. That&apos;s stupid. I don&apos;t mind portraying the war as an ugly affair but this one is not that good.",

The funniest line is the &quot;be-sexual&quot; scene.\n\nTony actually looks pretty womanlike, it was funny to see him in the black dress, and singing those German songs. Those songs sound pretty good, too.\n\nI rate this movie 7, but since it has a low rating. Therefore, I am rating it 8 to increase its rating a little.",

Gore also interjects humor and his own personality into a documentary about his own crusade, while DiCaprio&apos;s is more straightforward, inundating the audience with mind-numbing facts and portents of doom. He also doesn&apos;t focus attention to his own personality but stays merely a narrator. \n\nThe 11th Hour is more comprehensive, drawing from various sources, but lacks breathing room to digest each infoload periodically dumped on screen. It decides to interject these pockets of space for reflection far too late, already in the middle of the reel. \n\nDiCaprio&apos;s narration is also a disappointment. He is great eye candy that serves to pull the crowd to the theater, a terrific actor and is capable of memorizing tomes of text in his movies, but in his own documentary, his eyes too obviously dart left to right at a teleprompter, which loses the impact and earnestness he needs to communicate and connect to the audience. Meanwhile, the less-physically appealing Gore successfully portrays himself in Rocky-like fashion, valiantly trudging on in his uphill battle, which makes the audience identify with and root for him. \n\nTo The 11th Hour&apos;s credit, it offers more solutions on an individual level than Gore&apos;s. Despite the fragmented expositions of its well-meaning interview subjects, it offers hope and a heroic sense of optimism that we can still do something about the issue.",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t recommend this film nearly as much as I could recommend Waste Land or Exit Through the Gift Shop, but Beautiful Losers does occasionally have it&apos;s moments of merit. The running story of support that each member of this wide artistic circle should be commended. Without the constant support system, this sliver of the art world would have come and gone without much notice at all.\n\nBut really, that&apos;s mostly what I enjoyed about this film. I don&apos;t really care about self aggrandizement on such a large scale, especially when the people in question are ( with the exception of one artist) still very much alive and still very, very young. Most of the artists in the film are approaching their forties.\n\nThese artists are also very lucky to be alive at this time. It appears that everyone was filming themselves, even before making their own art scene, so this documentary is rife with footage of every artist from young kids to adults dressed up as kids.\n\nHo-hum...there&apos;s better films about artists and their respective scenes."

      "reviewBody": "Much of this movie is fiction, but the fact remains that Edna Gladley was a pioneer in the field of nursery care and adoption and her work to strike the description &quot;illegitimate&quot; from birth certificates as well as insure that these children could inherit from their adoptive parents has changed many lives for the better. Edna was born in Milwaukee; her father died when she was very young; she never had an adopted sister who was herself illegitimate. Because Edna suffered from respiratory disease she was sent to Fort Worth, Texas, when she was seven years old to live with her aunt and uncle. She and her husband Sam were married in Gainseville after which they moved to Wolfe City where they bought a mill to manufacture Gladiola brand flour. They were childless.\n\nEdna began her work in helping impoverished and homeless children soon after moving to Wolfe City where she started a crusade to clean up the county poor farm during which she arranged to have homeless children moved to the Morris Children&apos;s Home and Aid Society in Fort Worth. She joined the Society&apos;s Board in 1910. She then made trips to settlement houses in Chicago and New York City to study their methods; when she returned she set up a day nursery for working mothers (the movie has her setting up the nursery first when in fact this happened seven or eight years after she became involved in child welfare issues). \n\nAs in the movie, Sam&apos;s business failed in 1924 whereupon they moved to Fort Worth where Edna continued her work in child welfare. In 1927 she was named superintendent of the Texas Children&apos;s Home and Aid Society. Sam died in 1935 after rebuilding his business. Edna spent the rest of her life advocating for children, concentrating on placing homeless and abandoned children with adoptive families. She also expanded the Society to provide health care for unwed mothers and an adoption service for their children. The Society later bought a maternity hospital that it named the Gladney Center.\n\nI loved Greer Garson in this movie, she is strong, brave and gracious. I just wish the director and producers of this movie had used a script that portrayed the real life of Edna Gladney rather than resorting to the fictitious adopted sister who kills herself and inventing a non-existent son who dies in an accident to explain her motives. Edna was her own person who was genuinely involved in her life&apos;s work from her early 20s until she died in 1961 -- the movie didn&apos;t need these made-up people to explain why she became involved in child welfare issues.",

It follows Paula, a brilliant student of anatomy and granddaughter of a famous doctor, at her new, elitist school. The gloomy atmosphere at the school is well made, and the sequence that reveals early on what is really happening there is very effective and chilling.\n\nUnfortunately, the narrative tension goes down quite soon, and the rest of the revelations, the action scenes, etc. come along in blurts. I believe even in horror stories -or maybe especially in horror stories- there must be at least some character development, so that the viewer really relates to the victims and feels the tension, but there&apos;s none of that here; and the climatic ending suffers from the poor narrative and the unidimensional nature of characters.\n\n&quot;Anatomie&quot; had potential for a lot more; it was a small disappointment."

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in April 1993 after a Lincoln Center screening in Manhattan.\n\n&quot;Toubab Bi&quot; (an untranslatable title) is a very entertaining fish out of water story that marks the arrival of a talented new director from Dakar, Moussa Toure. It&apos;s worth a look-see for American distribution.\n\nOne of the most accessible films in the Lincoln Center African cinema series, &quot;Toubab Bi&quot; has entry points to fans of French cinema as well, recalling the well-made (though never released domestically) &quot;Black mic-mac&quot; in giving a glimpse of the African subculture of Paris.\n\nHandsome Oumar Dio9p Makena toplines as Soriba Samb, an aspiring filmmaker who&apos;s headed to Paris from Dakar for an internship. At the airport he&apos;s saddled with a 5-year-old boy, a distant relative, whose dd Issa split for Paris seven years ago.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that Soriba and Issa grew up together, so o9ur hero becomes obsessed with finding his old pal. In the meantime, director Moure (who himself apprenticed in France with Bertrand Tavernier and Francois Truffaut) with a light comic touch details Soriba&apos;s encounter with an assortment of quirky Parisians. Throughout, the director is even-handed in his avoidance of stereotypes and his sympathetic treatment of both African and French characters.\n\nHe finally discovers Issa successful as a pimp and vendor of porno videos and magazines Undeterred, Soriba works to fulfill his promise to Issa&apos;s mom and tribal spells (including animal sacrifice) are conjured to aid the process of getting Issa to return.\n\nApart from one confusing scene when Soriba sends the boy away (he is literally written out of the picture), the story is consistently interesting and well-acted. Lead thesp Makena with his excessive politeness and warm manner is a genuine find. French leading lady Helene Laplower, with whom he has an interracial romance, is affecting and natural as well.\n\nFilm is differentiated from Western efforts in this genre by its emphasis on superstition, leading to a clever nding that makes the mystical content ambiguous. Technical credits are first-class, especially Alain Choquart&apos;s photography."

Long, lingering shots of the characters angst (which normally frustrate the audience) are achieved in an effortless way. The acting is so flawless that it is difficult to find fault. The story is simple and meandering...but it works, and works incredibly well. Another Year will not be to the taste of the young kick-cutting action packed generation. It requires a mature audience or an audience that have at least pondered about what their life would be like after their forties.\n\nThis will gain nominations and should win Oscars.",

Not even the action is well directed, suffering from the jerky-camera syndrome of this day and age. The script is such a mess, why the year 2016? The eco-friendly message is forced and preachy, the characters are one dimensional, from the goofy detective to the bad guys, and the pacing is off and all over the place. Then comes the ending and slaps you in the frigging face. Sorry mr wisit but if you need two entire movies to tell such a broken story you are doing something wrong.\n\nIs not a movie you hate so much as a movie you want to pat in the back. We really don&apos;t need another &quot;gritty&quot; reboot of a super hero, we just need a well made action/adventure flick.",

      "reviewBody": "I have both versions on video, and I&apos;ll admit the 1956 version is much better. I had mixed feelings on this version, but I hated most of the plot changes. Many important bits that worked so well in the 1956 version were changed and replaced with hackneyed plot-holes. The saving grace is the songs, and the singing is passable. The best is Christianne Noll, and Barbara Streisand singing in the end credits was a treat. Back to the bad. The voice talents were OK, but there were a lot of dodgy accents. Miranda Richardson does well, and her character animation is good too. Martin Vidnovic was trying to replicate Yul Brynner, and in no way did he succeed. Adam Wylie has a false English accent, that was shown when he was singing, because his American accent was heard. Ian Richardson is a really good actor, but I was expecting more from him. He had lots of really good lines, but his delivery just felt a bit OTT. The worst character was Master Little, who was funny for only ten minutes, and then the occurring joke about teeth wore thin far too early. Don&apos;t get me started on the animals. they were cute at first, but they served no purpose at all to the plot, especially Moonshee. As for the animation, most of it was good, but why on earth did they animate a sea dragon and moving statues that were only there for a couple of seconds, I didn&apos;t get it! As for the romance between Tuptim and the Prince it was so unnecessary, and the romance between Anna and the king was painfully underdeveloped. And why did they change the ending? The ending in the 1956 version was so poignant, and this one was pointless. In conclusion, only watch it if you haven&apos;t seen the fantastic Yul Brynner version, otherwise you&apos;ll be disappointed. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "For the most part I enjoyed this movie very much. It is worth watching for the scenery alone (the visuals are easily worth 9/10). There are several areas where the retouched colors and CGI sky is blatantly obvious but it adds a larger-than-life feel to the savanna.\n\nThe story, unfortunately, is a mismatching of a folk tale and a Nat Geo documentary. The voice over technique works well enough but the narrator abruptly stops to interact with his audience. This causes the story to jerk between scenes. At the end of 90 minutes I felt like I had been watching for several hours... and not in a good way. Still, it is a tale of courage, strength, and loyalty, and the intended audience (kids) should enjoy it.\n\nNote for parents: as I mentioned, &quot;White Lion&quot; plays a bit like a documentary; there is some raw footage in this film including lions&apos; eating habits and territorial disputes. The themes of death and loss are also touched a few times, albeit briefly. You will want to watch this movie with your little ones so you can explain things to them. (Kids 12+ should have no trouble with it.) I will watch it with my 10-yr-old nieces to reinforce their studies, but the 4-yr-old will have to stick with Dora the Explorer for now.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not easy to give yourself over to this film, for like the unwilling victims&apos; it portrays, it rather slowly and methodically casts its spell, whisking you farther and farther away from the comfortable rhythm and conventions of the crime thriller it appears to be on the surface.\n\nKyua&apos;s austere landscapes are in fitful turns picture postcard beautiful, mundane and mysterious.  Much of the story unfolds in master shots, keeping you at a distance from the characters and affording the illusion of a comfortable intellectual detachment which it meticulously strips away scene by scene.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple; a weary Japanese Homicide detective is investigating a series of grotesque murders.  Each murder seems to have the same ritualistic pattern, yet in each case the culprit turns out to be an ordinary individual, dazed and unable to offer any motive for their horrific crime.  Nothing seems to connect the murderers to each other, until the Detective picks up the trail of an amnesia afflicted drifter who seems unable to answer even the simplest questions about himself, yet displays a disconcerting ability to reflect any line of questioning about his own identity back upon the questioner.  Time and again he returns to a question at the core of the mystery:\n\n&quot;Who are you?&quot;\n\nIt seems more and more, as the drifter is passed from detective, to guard, to clinician to pyschiatrist, that this question is far more dangerous than anyone might have guessed.\n\nKyua is a model of subtlety and restraint.  Although there&apos;s a significant amount of implied violence and several shocking scenes of murder, these aren&apos;t gratuitous.  Kyua&apos;s particular genius is it&apos;s ability to transform it&apos;s urban Japanese landscapes and even the most common objects from familiar to suspect and eventually sinister: a length of piping, a flashing traffic sign, a blast furnace, the sound of ocean surf at night, a flickering lighter, a dark apartment lined with academic tomes, a puddle of spilled water, the letter X smeared on a wall, a deserted rundown building.\n\nThere are few filmmakers with the audacity and imagination to venture into the places Kyua wants to take you.  Fincher, Lynch and Cronenberg come to mind as those who time and time again have shown their willingness, and perhaps compulsion to return to the unsettling territory of perception, identity, and the boundary between normalcy and psychosis.  If the director&apos;s first name were only David (it&apos;s not, his name is Kiyoshi Kurosawa) we&apos;d have the makings of a good conspiracy theory here.\n\n The film was released in 1997 but only recently has made it&apos;s way to western shores, and US distribution by Cowboy Pictures, and has wound its way inevitably to cable networks like Sundance.  It&apos;s cast includes Koji Yakusho as the detective Takabe.  Fans of Japanese cinema will recognize this fine actor from his award winning roles in &quot;Shall we Dance&quot; and &quot;The eel&quot;.\n\n Kyua isn&apos;t the type of visceral immediate drama that the average suspense film provides.  If you can put aside your preconceived notions and allow it to unfold in it&apos;s own time, I suspect you will find the questions it asks and secrets it reveals to be all the more disquieting, problematic and in the end profound.  Many critics have lined up to call this film a masterpiece, and pegged Kurosawa as one of a number of japanese directors worth watching."

Following the only link - a mysterious stranger who had brief contact with each perpetrator and their victim - detective Kenichi Takabe (Kôji Yakusho, 13 ASSASSINS, TOKYO SONATA) places his own sanity on the line as he tries to end the wave of inexplicable terror. \n\nDescribed as one of the greatest films of all time by Bong Joon-ho (THE HOST, SNOWPIERCER), CURE is a deeply unsettling masterpiece of its genre, and has shockingly been unavailable on home video in the UK until now. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present Cure in a special Dual Format edition. \n\nCURE [Kyua], Kiyoshi Kurosawa&apos;s mesmerising and hypnotic psychological thriller, is released on home video for the first time in the UK as part of The Masters of Cinemas Series in a Dual Format edition on 23 April 2018.",

I&apos;ve learned that a FF film was in &quot;development hell&quot; for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it&apos;s not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it&apos;s good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to &quot;let it go&quot;, to really enjoy the story. Overall, it&apos;s a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!",

It starts off great, with Richard Burton (McPhisto) with wind constantly blowing thru his hair no matter where he happens to be, squaring off with John Astin as Candy&apos;s square father Mr. Christian.  Expect tons of name puns like that, and way loads of social satire against all the 6 food groups of establishment authority figures (Military, Doctors, Beaurocrats, Teachers, Cops and Spiritual Healers) and see what they all have in common, namely hypocrisy and Candy.\n\nThis seems to be a sequel of sorts to The Magic Christian in not only author, but style and attitude as well. (Ringo Starr is coincidentally or purposely in both films). Its also reminiscent of Harold and Maude, O Lucky Man, Brewster Mcloud, Holy Mountain (okay, a tiny bit) and half a dozen other late 60&apos;s satirical and somewhat surreal comedies.\n\nWho needs a linear plot when you have great social satire performed by top actors (Marlon Brando, James Coburn, Walter Matthau)?  And Candy is as cute as the proverbial button to boot!\n\nGreat psychedelic soundtrack by The Byrds and others as well.\n\nI&apos;ll buy the DVD (if its out yet) and file it next to my copies of &quot;Beyond The Valley of the Dolls&quot; and the Monkees&apos; &quot;Head&quot;"

      "name": "Strange story about a peculiar love story  between  a girl who suffers amnesia  and her saviour",
      "reviewBody": "Intense as well as offbeat/intriguing drama with top-notch acting , superb photography and sensitive soundtrack . This brooding picture contains a magnificent performance by a beautiful woman , Emma Suarez , and a good support cast full of prestigious players giving right performances . It deals with Sofia (Emma Suarez) who suffers a motorcycle accident and loses her memory . Jota (Nanco Novo) is a musician, (Susana Gimenez) affected when misses his girlfriend , as he witnesses a motorcycle accident . When he meets Sofia who suffers amnesia , he then takes advantage of the deeds and reinvents her name as Lisa and her life according to his desires . Sofia/Lisa impacts on a great scale about Jota&apos;s life . As he makes up a name for her and tells the doctors (Ana Gracia , Txema Blasco , Cheta Lera) that they live together as a couple for several years . Later on , they go to a holiday camping and become involved with a couple called Antón (Karra Elejalde), a cabman , Carmen (María Barranco) and their children . After that , there appears a strange character named Felix (Carmelo Gómez) related to her . \n\nSpanish production with fine acting , colorful cinematography , excellently interpreted and rousing score by Alberto Iglesias . Julio Medem directed the film for Sogetel and producer Enrique López Lavigne and it was released in 1993 . Set in San Sebastian or Donostia and at a lagoon in Pelayos De Presa , this interesting and thought-provoking film dealing with a story of solitary people , as a strange , unsettling young , well played by Nancho Novo , desperate after separating from his girlfriend , as well as a twenty-five-years-old girl riding a motorcycle and falling off a bridge , subsequently suffering amnesia , being splendidly performed by Emma Suarez . The picture was considered by the prestigious ¨Daily Telegraph¨ : as taut and intricate as anything by Alfred Hitchcock . This is a thrilling , exciting , deliberate though magnetic drama . It contains marvelous photography , breathtaking musical score and enjoyable production design . It is a riveting film though sometimes a little boring , slow-pace and overlong . Anyway, the film is interesting , thematically intriguing and strange ; Medem has his own style of telling a story . Very good support cast such as Maria Barranco , Chete Lera , Cristina Marcos ,Txema Blasco , Ana Gracia , Monica Molina and Karra Elejalde , Julio Medem&apos;s ordinary . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score mirroring well the scenery, its people and the story line, it was superbly composed by several times Oscar nominated Alberto Iglesias , Julio Medem&apos;s usual . In addition , a spotless pictorial cinematography by Gonzalo Fernandez and a willingness , almost perfect of the elements of each shot , every sequence , every space ; being rightly filmed on location in Pelayos De la Presa, El Pardo , San Martín Valdeiglesias, Madrid, Usanos, Guadalajara and San Sebastián, Guipúzcoa, País Vasco . \n\nThe motion picture was well produced by Fernado Garcillan and originally directed by Julio Medem ; this his second movie, &quot;Ardilla Roja&quot; or ¨The red squirrel¨ released in 1993, was selected for the Cannes Film Festival and it confirmed Medem&apos;s talents and won prizes in Fort Lauderdale, Bogota and Bucarest . Medem had been making short movies with a super-8 camera owned by his father until he received a call from a new production company called Sogetel and executive producers Fernando de Garcillán , José Luis Olaizola , Enrique López Lavigne . They were interested in his script titled &quot;Vacas&quot; . It won the Goya Award from the Spanish academy for best new director, and won prizes in the festivals of Tokyo, Torino and Alexandria. In 1998 Medem released &quot; The lovers of the Polar Circle ,&quot; considered his best movie by most of his fans . It also became a box-office hit with more than one million spectators in Spain and was also released worldwide. In 2001 his fourth movie, &quot;Lucia and sex ,&quot; became a huge hit and began the career of actress Paz Vega who won the Goya for best new actress . Although in 2003 failed with the release , &quot;The Basque ball&quot; , a documentary that portrays the phenomenon of nationalism and terrorism in the Basque Country of northern Spain , it was very polemical and partial . In 2007 directed the flop ¨Caotica Ana¨ and in 2010 , ¨Room in Rome¨, a successful though with not sense film , plenty of nudism and only starred by two gorgeous naked girls . Julio Medem is for sure one of the the most important and original Spanish filmmaker. Well worth watching if you get the chance .",

But deep down, the movie is an attempt to differentiate between career &amp; vocation. Everyone&apos;s born with some talent. It&apos;s what we do with that talent that makes all the difference. I found myself pondering on these extremely important issues upon watching the film. It takes an artistic genius like Andrzej Wajda to understand the world of another artist, a musician in this case. That said, some people may actually find the movie a bit dull and slow. But that&apos;s exactly the point, it&apos;s not everyone&apos;s cup of tea! Needless to say that the music is excellent. A great movie for all music lovers &amp; by extension for all the artists out there! Highly recommended!",

Based on a book by Jimmy Breslin, the movie has a dated flavor to it that renders it rather stale; my kids didn&apos;t care much for it. However, it can still charm at times and the cast was very good overall. Orbach, without a drop of Italian blood in his veins, does a first-rate penny-ante mobster. There are plenty of sight gags, some more subtle than others, and many do make the viewer groan. The real problem is this type of movie requires a serious attention span on the part of the viewer, something sadly lacking in the modern era. DeNiro was no disappointment---he was fresh, funny and charming. The price of the video was worth every cent just to see him in such an unusually lightweight role. Who knew from watching this that he&apos;d end up as one of film&apos;s toughest dramatic actors? In summary, not a great movie, but not awful, either."

Cinematic chloroform from what should have been a fascinating film. Had the music not been so frightfully avant-garde, I might have enjoyed this a little more. I got the point that the music reflected his inner turmoil, but it was just a bit too noisy and chaotic for me. Also, his imitation of a three year old who can&apos;t keep the same train of though for more than five minutes de-railed my interest in the story. Vanessa Redgrave, especially, and the rest of the cast give fine performances, but the movie just didn&apos;t work for me. This film was a real disappointment and I kept thinking what Mario Bava could have done with material like this!"

Although suffering from deterioration and shrinkage and a missing last reel, the film was restored as completely as possible using existing materials (a final reel was constructed using still photographs and title cards).\n\nThe 1927 United Artists release garnered a &quot;best direction of a dramatic picture&quot; nomination for writer and director Herbert Brenon (for the very first Academy Awards).\n\nThe film, released as a silent picture, stars H.B. Warner and Nils Asther as father and son who strive to maintain their relationship and integrity despite being impoverished and deserted by their wife and mother, played by Anna Q. Nilsson.\n\n\n* Based on information provided by the AMPAS -\n"

But it definitely is a fairly poor Mabuse movie. \n\n I really missed Gert Frobe as Inspector Lohmann.  Peter Van Eyck is back as his suave espionage agent and the movie really centers on him, not Mabuse, who really is not even mentioned much until about two-thirds into the film. Add to that the completely outlandish concept of the &quot;death ray mirror&quot;, and you&apos;ve got a mediocre James Bond film on your hands...not a good Mabuse movie, which really relies on fairly realistic and reasonable (though often somewhat mystical or arcane) concepts in technology and the like.\n\n The cinematography is fairly good, as is the Italian (Sardinian?) scenery. I would recommend the film only to Mabuse completists, or the most ardent spy film fanatic.",

How does Hollywood, which has so many talented people in it, churn out such crap to put into our living rooms every night? \n\nI think the producers here try to give us a behind the curtain look at that, but they don&apos;t really hit it with the edge that they could hit it with.\n\nThe plot is that Duchovny&apos;s character is a writer who creates a show about a lawyer who is touched by the death of his brother by suicide, and slowly watches as his original concept is bastardized by network executives. Network meddling turns a neat idea into a farce. First, they put in an actor the creator doesn&apos;t want, and his inadequacy ruins much of the chemistry. Then they change the premise, and finally the title.\n\nThe movie ends abruptly as the main character watches a clip for a show that looks nothing like his original idea.\n\nIt works on some levels, but on others, it kind of falls flat.\n\nSigourny Weaver is brilliant. Duchovny just doesn&apos;t work well in this role. You are supposed to get the idea of a man who makes Faustian bargains to get his vision on the air, and then has his vision destroyed. Duchovny&apos;s character never really expresses his passion for his original concept, so you don&apos;t care all that much when Weaver&apos;s character steamrollers him.\n\nI find this interesting, because no doubt they cast Duchovny because of his name recognition. The premise is how a TV show can be ruined by bad casting when this movie was ruined by bad casting.",

Not something that wants to \n\nannihilate what us Star Trek fans have known since 1966 (1964, counting the original pilot :)).\n\nSome special effects could surely use some improvement. But special effects add to the story. Acting? As always some actors stand out more than others, quite normal.\n\nStory? Could the story be better? Perhaps. Now there is room to elaborate on what&apos;s behind all.\n\nIs there room for improvement? Sure, tell me, WHICH show does NOT have room for improvement?\n\nSomeone put it out there, let&apos;s show CBS we WANT Star Trek back! Let&apos;s backup this project.\n\nHopefully we&apos;ll see guest appearances from Star Trek actors, reprising their roles.\n\nLet&apos;s go where no Trek has gone before...\n\nQa&apos;p",

The one I throw in the DVD player on rainy Sunday afternoons and crack out my best junk food. And the political setting seems to give it more meat.\n\nMichael Douglas is perfect. Annette Benning is perfect (and I would give anything to look as beautiful as she does in that blue dress at the State Dinner). Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen, Anna Devoure Smith. People being passionate about each other and about important issues and about doing the right thing. Everything about this movie lifts me up when I&apos;m feeling down.\n\n I&apos;m not a liberal, and I&apos;m not a conservative - I fall somewhere in the middle. My beliefs in gun control to not include &quot;(getting) the guns&quot;. But this movie is so good - that I can look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own.\n\n I enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most &quot;romantic&quot; settings in the world - The White House."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; impressed me at once as a rather trite, artificial history-based (I won&apos;t actually call it historical) film about the Eaton Affair scandal of Andrew Jackson&apos;s presidency. It&apos;s an odd subject somewhat to choose as the basis for a romance-filled drama, and the script doesn&apos;t do it a whole lot of justice at times. A lot of the dialogue is just difficult to swallow or sickly-sweet, and American history is treated with a kind of overly orthodox distorting reverence -- turning the scandal into a stage for Andrew Jackson to be held up as an early defender of the Union in a proto-iteration of the Civil War -- that grates.\n\nThere are good points too however: Lionel Barrymore creates a wonderfully memorable performance as the raucous and rough yet wise President Jackson. He makes the former president human even while the script presents him somewhat two-dimensionally as a kind of grumpy but lovable old uncle most of the time (with a few nice scenes where he gets to be principled and statesmanlike in the face of his congress). Joan Crawford seeps magnetism and sympathy as Margaret, even as we are not really allowed to see the struggles between men that make up much of the movie emotionally dramatized for her. These actors get to play a few nice dramatic scenes amid the posturing, including a very effective one after President Jackson&apos;s wife&apos;s death.\n\nUnfortunately, the piety with which &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; treats American history extends to other elements of its subject matter. We are supposed to sympathize with Margaret about the viscous rumors that are spread about her, but we never really learn what the rumors are or why they are spread. In other words, in this Hays-code influenced feature, we see how the titular gorgeous hussy is gorgeous, but never really how she is a hussy.\n\nThere are a few fine performances here, and the film is quite watchable, but it is let down by an overly careful, pious, and reverent production in many respects.",

If you&apos;re not familiar with the aspects of the animal agriculture industry, I recommend watching the film Dominion (2018) first, and then this one; it will all connect for you. You won&apos;t find a better full-length film about the animal liberation movement, except perhaps The Animals Film (1981) and Your Mommy Kills Animals! (2007).",

And I always wanted to see a good film adaptation of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.\n\nSo, I&apos;ve been watching 1988 Decca&apos;s screen version of the opera, 1999 British screen version of the novel...and I didn&apos;t like it. I almost despaired, but I was thinking: &quot;There are no Russian screen version of &quot;Onegin&quot;? It can&apos;t be!&quot; And I was right! There are Russian screen version. And WHAT A VERSION! This 1958 Soviet film is just perfect film adaptation of the story + amazing Tchaikovsky&apos;s music + singing of the Bolshoi Theatre stars. But that&apos;s not all! Beautiful locations, costumes, ball scenes...And what a beautiful Russian actors..! Vadim Medvedev (Onegin) is incredibly handsome, red-haired (Oh,red-haired Onegin is something special!) man with an aristocratic face, majestic posture and eloquent face expressions (love his haughty, puffed-up mien and these curved eyebrows...), and he is amazing as arrogant and selfish dandy Eugene Onegin, Igor Ozerov is good as young and naive poet Vladimir Lensky, and Ariadna Shengelaya makes a lovely Tatiana, a shy landowner&apos;s daughter... \n\nGalina Vishnevskaya (Tatiana&apos;s voice) is the world famous Russian soprano and her singing is outstanding. Yevgeni Kibkalo (Onegin&apos;s voice) is a lyric baritone of truly beautiful timbre, and Anton Grygoriev (Lensky&apos;s voice) is expressive lyric tenor.\n\nSo, I can&apos;t say a single bad word about this film. Everything is perfect: singing, acting, direction, camera work, costumes...just everything. This tastefully made film is another proof of the greatness of the Soviet cinema and true pleasure for all the film and opera lovers.\n\nP.S. Try also a Soviet film &quot;Queen of Spades&quot; (&quot;Pikovaya dama&quot;), 1960 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054183/). This is screen version of another Tchaikovsky&apos;s opera, directed by the same director (Roman Tikhomirov) and also starring Vadim Medvedev. A beautifully made opera film.",

      "reviewBody": "Wes Craven&apos;s &quot;Scream&quot; was a strikingly dead-on persiflage of the Slasher genre while at the same time including enough scares to become more than just a parody, but an important part of that genre itself. &quot;Behind The Mask: The Rise Of Leslie Vernon&quot; is very similar in that aspect, but it&apos;s also completely different in others.\n\nFor the most part the movie is a fake documentary in true &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;-fashion. A TV crew follows Leslie Vernon around, a guy who has the ambition to become the next slasher legend after his idols Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger (who exist in the movie&apos;s reality). As Leslie shows the team how he prepares for a killing spree he deconstructs one horror rule after the other with pretty amusing results. The movie observes the genre pretty well and the sort of &quot;Backstage&quot; look we get of a horror icon lovingly planning his big night is nothing short of hilarious. Where &quot;Scream&quot; made fun of some ridiculous horror clichés and toyed around with them, &quot;Behind The Mask&quot; is merely explaining just how those seemingly supernatural killers are able to work so effectively. So, although both movies cover similar ground, &quot;Behind The Mask&quot; is never in any way repetitive.\n\nLeslie Vernon turns out to be a really sweet guy who just loves what he&apos;s doing. He&apos;s friends with an older, more experienced slasher, who&apos;s also very warm and talkative. Neither of those guys look like typical maniacs, so when Leslie does make his first appearance masked and all, it&apos;s rather amusing.\n\nHowever, the movie makes a pretty amazing turn in the final third. For the big showdown we leave the movie-within-a-movie scenario created by the documentary set-up and are taken right into the movie&apos;s reality. All of a sudden &quot;Behind The Mask&quot; turns into a real slasher film. Although this last part isn&apos;t half-bad, it&apos;s not quite as enjoyable as what preceded it. The twist is a bit predictable and the movie lacks real gore and suspense at the end in order to work as a slasher flick. One has to say that &quot;Scream&quot; coming from an old professional such as Wes Craven was more successful in that aspect. Still, regarding the fact that this movie strictly concentrates on fun in the first two thirds and only begins to throw in full on horror bits in the end, the showdown works quite well.\n\nLeslie&apos;s mask was chosen wisely. It can look ridiculous and scary depending on the mood of the scene. Nathan Baesel, who makes his movie debut here, was chosen even more wisely. He can play the nice guy and the psychopath without ever overacting and hands in a great, great performance. The other member of the cast that must be mentioned is horror legend Robert Englund who does a nice Donald Pleasance-impersonation.\n\nThe subtle little homages to &quot;Friday The 13th&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;A Nightmare On Elm Street&quot; throughout the movie are the icing on the cake and will make the heart of every true horror fan beat faster. And that&apos;s the only true flaw of &quot;Behind The Mask&quot; right there: it&apos;s for true horror geeks only who can laugh about the inside jokes. Everyone else will probably not be entertained as much. If you&apos;re into the genre, though, there&apos;s no way you should miss this excellent motion picture.",

      "reviewBody": "The Three Worlds of Gulliver is produced out of Columbia Pictures and is directed by Jack Sher. It stars Kerwin Matthews as Lemuel Gulliver, June Thorburn as his fiancée Elizabeth, with support coming from Basil Sydney (The Emperor of Lilliput), Grégoire Aslan (King Brob), Mary Ellis (Queen), Charles Lloyd Pack (Prime Minister Makovan) &amp; child actor Sherry Alberoni as Glumdalclitch. Filmed in England and Spain, it features stop-motion animation and special visual effects by Superdynamation genius Ray Harryhausen. Sher &amp; Arthur Ross adapt for the screen with a loose reworking of the 18th-century English novel Gulliver&apos;s Travels written by Jonathan Swift. And music maestro Bernard Herrmann provides the score.\n\nSwift&apos;s biting satirical novel has been watered down and given a romantic edge for the family market. That said, as the kids are enjoying the froth and tickle, the adults will note that there&apos;s just enough caustic comment in the piece to get the message across. This adaptation has slimmed down the four parts of Swift&apos;s work to just the two; Lilliput land of the little people and Brobdingnag land of the giants. With our intrepid normal sized hero Gulliver and his stowaway fiancée Elizabeth under threat either way.\n\nWhile the script has its pleasing moments it is still only serving as a bridging work for Harryhausen&apos;s effects to be shown. Be it the giant and tiny people sequences or the perils that come to our undersized protagonists courtesy of a Gator and a Squirrel, it&apos;s these that the children will find beguiling. This, however, can not be said for Harryhausen aficionados or adults more accustomed to more modern advancements. For this is bottom rung for Harryhausen, not bad at all, yet although there&apos;s a charm here, and no one should ever dismiss the painstaking amount of time it took him to weave it together, the work is creaky and lacking the dynamism so befitting his best work.\n\nMajor bonus&apos; come with the swirling and pounding score from Herrmann and the vibrant performance of Matthews. The role of Gulliver was first offered to Danny Kaye, which naturally makes sense given Kaye&apos;s previous work on Hans Christian Andersen some years earlier. That it was also offered to Jack Lemmon, though, makes no sense at all. Anyway, Matthews got the gig, and following on from his fine work in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he laid down a marker in the fantasy adventure genre that secured him fondness from legions of fans throughout the years. A safe, colourful and pleasant enough piece if ultimately not one for most fantasy adventure fans to revisit often. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Bela Lugosi is in fine form playing Karl Wagner, a sweet soul with a soft touch who runs a nightly Bowery mission, spooning out bowls of soup for needy tramps with nowhere to go. When he recognizes a new customer as an escaped safe cracker called &quot;Fingers&quot; Dolan, Wagner kindly escorts the convict to a hidden room and offers him a cigar. During the leisurely smoke, the host confides that he&apos;s admired Dolan&apos;s work for a long time, and springs a surprise on him: Bela&apos;s actually a crime boss, using the mission as a front and looking for someone new to join his racket. By day, Wagner leads a double-life as a professor named Dr. Brenner. When he&apos;s not showering his unsuspecting wife with gifts from his nightly escapades he teaches a class on psychology.\n\nThe potential is there for this to be as confusing as it sounds, but taken slowly it can be a hoot. An interesting ending, too, makes one suspect it was a possible influence for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Simply stated, BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT is one of the best of the poverty row pics made by Monogram studios with Bela Lugosi in the forties. Really more of a crime story with an occasional dash of horror as an added condiment, this is a tasty 62 minutes of absurd fun done on the cheap. **1/2 out of ****",

To avoid misunderstanding, the script isn&apos;t simple or stupid, it nearly doesn&apos;t exist.\n\nThe only thing, which shines are creative, scary, stylish, surprising visuals/sets. Those sets with recycled books, rotten town, waiting deads almost took my breath away from either visual or creative points of view. Worth mentioning, last time it happened to me with Silent Hill. Extra marks.\n\nSpecial effects and scares are not novel for those, who have seen previous Pang brothers features, but they are mixed in quite a fresh way. Across the movie one may also experience feelings resembling The Cell, Silent Hill, and even Matrix.\n\nAvoid if looking for traditional horror movie, but watch rather to widen your imagination and to have several strong scares. Provision yourself with patience to neglect the absence of the story.",

      "reviewBody": "The film is an odd one for the Fuller filmography. First, it is supposed to be set in Sudan, when nothing in the film resembles Sudan or the Sudanese. Second, Fuller dissociated himself from the film after disagreeing with the producers on using the apparent footage of a stunt diver being killed during filing by a shark (covered by LIFE magazine, and later all evidence of the mishap being mysteriously removed from official records.) Fuller is credited as the director in the final film credits, though IMDb lists another co-director Rafael Portillo. Fuller found the final product to be considerably different from what he had shot. Third, the ending is superb--where the viewer has to figure out the inevitable end--very unusual for a Hollywood film. Fourth, this is a rare Fuller film, which uses a good established actress--the Mexican actress Silvia Pinal, who was chosen by Bunuel in three of his films &quot;The Exterminating Angel,&quot; &quot; Viridiana.&quot; and &quot;Simon of the Desert.&quot; Fifth, actor Arthur Kennedy has an unusual role as a drunk doctor who has a degree from Johns Hopkins University and can still save an injured boy by operating on him in an open bar room with guests, while the doctor has imbibed a lot of liquor!\n\nFuller&apos;s pet theme of family persists. Here, an orphan waif, sleeping on the streets, is saved from possible deadly injuries by a father figure who doesn&apos;t even know the boy&apos;s real name.",

      "reviewBody": "Asia doesn&apos;t have many bona-fide superheroes in their fantastic fiction; they tend to have kung fu masters and such, but apart from Black Mask (which was very mediocre) I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen any other real Asian superhero movies except for this one; Silver Hawk. It is a true combo of kung fu and super-heroics, as the main character, Lulu Wong (Michelle Yeoh), has excelled in the martial arts since childhood and have found a way to use her martial arts for the good of all society as the silver-costumed hero Silver Hawk.\n\nThe movie takes place in the future, where they have holographic mahjong and some brand-new mind-reading devices. Stylistically, everything is entirely kept in ice-blue glass and metal, which all looks sleek and cool, but also rather cold and inhuman.\n\nA human dimension is added, however, in the childhood flashbacks, where a lot of connections are drawn to Silver Hawk&apos;s adult life. For instance, the reason she wears a mask is because she did so as a kid, too, to disguise her identity when she was kung fu brawling in defiance of her teachers&apos; orders. This cross-time dimension with her childhood works very well indeed, also because she runs into her childhood friend again as an adult, his having become a police chief. Initially he wants to catch Silver Hawk, but as soon as he finds out who she is, he starts working with her.\n\nThe bad guy (supervillain, really), Fire Wolf, is quite dull, and his plan not very well described. There are a couple of plot holes in the story, too, and while the action is pretty good, the fighting isn&apos;t spectacular. But still a relatively good and watchable movie. I rate it a 6 out of 10.\n\nI&apos;m very interested in movies that combine kung fu and science fiction. My list so far includes Silver Hawk, Avenging Fist, Jet Li&apos;s The One, and, of course, the Matrix Trilogy, and Equilibrium. And also, Star Wars, sort of, since the Jedi abilities are a form of martial arts... I hope to discover more movies with kung fu and sci-fi combined.",

The set up and background provides an eerie/mysterious feel to it that is amplified by intense tracks such as &quot;Careful with that Axe Eugene.&quot; Panned views of the volcano and computer generated graphics add to the effects. It unlike any other concert they have played in being that the only fans were those involved in the setup and movie creation. Songs like &quot;One of These Days&quot; provide an up-tempo song that highlights the drummer&apos;s capabilities. While the classic &quot;Us and Them&quot; shows their more mellow jazz oriented style. Extremely well produced a must see for any true Floyd fan.",

Even if it is a comedy and Lars von Trier himself in the start of the movie tells we can lean back and enjoy being entertained, the film has a message that - if you are open to it - will give you something to think about regarding moral and ethics. Like all good movies this has a surprisingly ending. &quot;The Boss of it all&quot; has divided the audience in Denmark in 2 groups  a group who absolutely dislikes the movie and a group which is rather enchanted with it. As you can understand I belong to the last group.",

The facts, that all concerts were set up in a realistic environment with people not knowing that they went to a movie shooting and that the band members are actually not actors give it an authentic atmosphere. The dialogs are quite entertaining, because a lot of clichés about men and women and their relationships are picked up in a humorous way. Men are fallible - don&apos;t we all agree on that ;) Heike Makatsch is great, and so are Juergen Vogel and Florian Lukas. It&apos;s almost like meeting friends from my own past. Having lived in a town on the German coast for several years, I also like the scene with the lonely sailor. Was he an actor or a real German sailor?",

On the WW2 front, death and destruction is always near and a soldier notices that his officer has two things in the dug out that make his life more interesting - music and a woman. Despite being warned off, he presents the girl a scraggy flower before they go off to likely death.\n\nYears later in the city streets, he recognizes her laugh and finds she has become an abrasive single mother street peddler. Half out of sympathy and half out of infatuation, he tries to improve her life, with wife Inna understandably non-plussed.\n\nThere are plenty of nice moments and the picture of eighties Russian life is a plus but the piece lacks structure and discipline and attention wanders."

      "reviewBody": "As with the previous two entries in the unofficial Animal Trilogy, Four Flies on Grey Velvet is short on explicit gore but brimming with atmosphere and artistic ingenuity, with set-piece murders primed and mined for maximum tension. It was with this film that Argento began to cement his particular style and is something of a crucible for future ideas. The murder of Roberto&apos;s maid in a local park foreshadows John Saxon&apos;s fate in Tenebre, and with its sudden lapses in time and attempted escape through the cobwebbed space between two buildings (to a soundtrack of whispers and sighs) it also sows seeds that would flourish in Suspiria. Other visual motifs (crimson curtains, extreme close-ups, inanimate objects suddenly wielded by a seemingly maniacal camera) would be repeated or re-jigged in Deep Red, Phenomena and Opera.\n\nArgento&apos;s original intention was to have a gay protagonist and though the character of Roberto is still open to such a reading - his victimisation being as a result of a fear of being outed (as a murderer) has obvious correlations (note also Brandon&apos;s shaggy mane v Farmer&apos;s gamine crop or the rather tame bathtub scene with Francine Racette which sees Roberto playfully seducing his mirror image) - the more overt references are passed to Jean-Pierre Marielle, who brings immense likability to a small role and whose swish factor is tempered by a steely determination to finally cracking a case. A frosty Farmer acquits herself well, though Brandon is merely okay. Argento&apos;s fascination with weird science (here ludicrous by design but ingenious in execution) gives the film its animal-themed title, and the finale boasts one of his greatest sequences - a stunning, slow-motion shot of a car impacting with the back of a lorry, which marries chillingly beautiful aesthetics to Hollywood folklore, scored with Morricone&apos;s haunting &quot;Come un Madrigale&quot;.\n\nFour Flies is a solid giallo and an important entry in the Director&apos;s canon which bears repeated viewing, blurring gender roles and sexual identity, adding subtext and hit and miss humour, asylum flashbacks, well-executed deaths and a recurring nightmare in the form of a sun-bleached, public beheading - the significance of which turns out to be twofold. It also has in spades what a good Argento giallo conveys like no other, that chilling feeling of something wholly alien on the loose in human form."

I just watched it for the first time on DVD, and I was quite impressed on how smart the story was, and even though there is no Human-Fly monster in it (which, to be honest, is a smart approach), I thought it was more clever to base the movie around the Delambre legacy, rather than focus on the whole &quot;man gets gene-spliced with a fly&quot; blah blah blah! To be honest, I was expecting something REALLY dreadfully cheesy, but surprisingly, I loved it! The visuals (especially, the opening credit sequence, very well thought up!), and the originality of it is superbly done! It&apos;s got the classic horror movie style down perfectly! True its not as frightening as say... Alien, but, for its time (1960s), the mutant make up and story are very well sorted! TOTALLY UNDERRATED!",

      "reviewBody": "How often do we wonder, or take the time to reflect upon, how it is that we came to be where we are?  How much do we know of what went before us; or more specifically, of the past that directly affected who and what we are today.  Moreover, is it important, or anything we need to know or should? How significant, really, is our past in relation to the present?  According to director Yimou Zhang, these questions are not only valid but of paramount importance, which he aptly illustrates in his lyrically beautiful film, `The Road Home,&apos; written for the screen by Shi Bao, adapted from his own novel, `Remembrance.&apos;  Without question, at the heart of the film is a monumental yet simple story of true love in the purest sense, and of the devotion which renders that love eternal.  But the film transcends even that, and within the greater context indicates the impact of the past upon the present, which is summed up in a single line from the film:  `Know the past, know the present.&apos;  And know, too, that the love portrayed in this story is the kind of love that is abiding, and that which sustains all that makes life worth living.  It&apos;s a veritable journey of the soul; one that will touch you deeply and linger in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.\n\nUpon receiving the news that his father has died, Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) leaves the city to return to his home, a small village in the mountains, to bury his father and comfort his bereaved mother, Zhao Di (Yulian Zhao). When he arrives, however, he discovers that his mother will not be consoled until her wish concerning the burial of her husband, Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) is fulfilled.  In keeping with a long standing tradition and superstition, Di insists that his coffin be carried by hand by the men of the village along the road connecting the village and the city, insuring by so doing that in death Changyu will always be able to remember his way home.\n\nYusheng quickly finds that realizing his mother&apos;s request will be no easy task; their village is small and all of the able-bodied men have left for the city, leaving only children and those too old for such an arduous undertaking.  And it is winter, a harsh time of year in the mountains.  But Di is adamant, and so Yusheng sets about the business of fulfilling her request.  And as he does so, he reflects upon the story of his parents; a story well known throughout the village, for theirs was a love that was unbridled and boundless, the likes of which no one in the village had ever know before.  Or since.\n\nThis film, so wonderfully crafted and delivered by director Zhang, is altogether ethereal and transporting; he tells the story in simplistic terms, and yet it is in that very simplicity that he finds the genuine honesty and truth that provides such an emotional impact and makes this love story one that rivals any the screen has ever known.  Aided by the masterful cinematography of Yong Hou, Zhang achieves that same sense of transcendence that defines much of Akira Kurosawa&apos;s films, such as `Ran&apos; and `Akira Kurosawa&apos;s Dreams,&apos; or Ang Lee&apos;s `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&apos;  There is not a superfluous moment in the entire film, and Zhang proves that capturing pure emotion with the camera can express more than pages of dialogue recited by an actor.  And with his lens, Zhang opens up the very heart of the film and lays it bare for all to see and feel, finding more in the eyes of his characters and in their expressions than words could ever convey.  It&apos;s a study of human nature that is disarming in it&apos;s candor, and quite simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking by a director with an irrefutably incisive understanding of the human condition.\n\nWithout question, though, the single aspect that makes this such an unforgettable film is the performance (in her motion picture debut) by Ziyi Zhang as the young Zhao Di.  A young woman of exquisite beauty, she has a sublime screen presence that is a portrait of the angelic, and her innate ability to silently express the myriad emotions called for by her character is used to great effect by director Zhang.  Ziyi&apos;s portrayal is one of youthful innocence mixed with stubborn determination, which gives her character the necessary depth to be entirely convincing, and she will win you over in a heartbeat.  She is so affecting that near the end, when Di, now an old woman, is hurrying across a rickety foot bridge, the same bridge we&apos;ve seen the young Di traverse many times on her way to and from the schoolhouse (which is central to the story), despite the weathered age so evident on her face, because of the lasting impression made by Ziyi, you realize that she still bears the heart of the young woman you&apos;ve come to care so much about by this time, and you understand that age is superficial; that this is a shell housing the spirit and the true beauty that resides within.  It&apos;s a beautiful moment to behold, and ours forever, due to the extraordinary performance and presence of the delicate Ziyi Zhang, as well as the tremendous sensitivity and care with which she is presented by director Zhang.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Bin Li (Grandmother), Guifa Chang (Old Mayor), Wencheng Sung (Mayor) and Zhongxi Zhang (Crockery Repairman).  A love story told sincerely from the heart is a treasure that endures forever, like a painting by Monet or Renoir; and like those artists, director Zhang is nothing less than an impressionist behind the camera, capturing the distinctive rhythms of life and love for all time in `The Road Home,&apos; a gentle, poetic film that will make it&apos;s way into the hearts of all who experience it.  And therein remain, forevermore.  10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I fail to see how the movie was sexist or racist considering the timeframe. In fact, the movie shows a woman can perform well in a position tradionally held by men. Only recently up into the 70s were women being comepletely accepted in male dominated positions. Only recently were MDs required to give honest brutal but truthful information to their patients. They would withold some information if they felt is was beneficial to their patient. As far as patient confidentiality goes. HIPAA was not around then and a husband just as entitled to know about his wife&apos;s medical condition as she was. As far as a husband developing an affair with a coworker. Where and when does that not take place today? In fact, this movie may have predicted a complication of coed workforces that were not too common back then. It doesn&apos;t take much of a brain and a tiny bit of history to understand the setting of this movie. Now speaking from a medical professional, I can say the death was a little too clean for a person dying of cancer, but back then showing such misery and horror was frowned upon. Look at how people died in war movies back then. She would have shown progressive weight loss, signs of anemia, growing weakness, etc. But, even now I see people who seem to be doing fine, get hospitalized and are dead within a week or two. In the end, the movie was one of the pioneer movies to address the depressive and taboo subject of dying of cancer, something really only as recent as the late 60s and early 70s was able to be more open about. Though it is not a classic tearjerker, it is a sad and depressive movie about the real threat of carncer and I would recommend it to classic movie buffs and those wishing to study how Hollywood tackled death and dying in the films.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1973, in Santiago of Chile of the first socialist president democratically elected in a Latin-American country, President Salvador Allende, the principal of the Saint Patrick School, Father McEnroe (Ernesto Malbran) makes a trial of integration between students of the upper and lower classes. The bourgeois boy Gonzalo Infante (Matías Quer) and the boy from the slum Pedro Machuca (Ariel Mateluna) become great friends, while the conflicts on the streets leads Chile to the bloody and repressive military coup of General Augusto Pinochet on 11 September 1973, changing definitely their lives, their relationship and their country.\n\n&quot;Machuca&quot; is a touching and realistic tale of friendship and coming to age in times of military coup in Chile. The Chilean director Andrés Wood made this fantastic movie following the political genre of Costa Gravas, but with a subtle drama with two children getting conscience of the fight of classes and the changes in their country by force and violence. The story in some moments seems to be a documentary so perfect the direction and acting are. The debut of the two lead actors, Matías Quer and Ariel Mateluna, is awesome: the eyes of the silent Matías Quer disclosing reality and the facial expression of Ariel Mateluna are amazing. &quot;Machuca&quot; is a highly recommended movie, and for the younger generations slightly see what happened in the 70&apos;s in South America and particularly in Chile. A few figures about Pinochet&apos;s dictatorship: 30,000 Chileans were killed; 100,000 Chileans were arrested without a trial; 22,000 students were expelled from the universities; 150,000 Chileans were exiled. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Machuca&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "The Clash may have been one of the most interesting, important and best rock bands to have ever existed. And this documentary does in fact support that theory. However, the selectiveness of the subjects leaves much to be desired. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20 - and in the case of the people responsible for this documentary - it&apos;s also very selective. There&apos;s absolutely no mention of the post-Mick Jones Clash that existed from 1983-1986. Four years of a bands history is an awful lot of time to simply not feel like mentioning. Sure the album this band produced (1985&apos;s Cut The Cr*p) may not have been on par with say London Calling but few albums are. To completely fail to not mention it makes me wonder why the filmmakers would simply choose to re-write history as if it never existed. All this does is support the fact that documentaries edit history any way they want. The unmentioned band (Simonon/Stummer/Pete Howard/Vince White/Nick Sheppard) toured the US in 1984 and also did a busking tour of England in 1985. By not mentioning them at all does no favors for any new young fan who actually wants to know about The Clash&apos;s history (and not just what was graciously selected for them).\n\nThen there is the issue of obtaining great rare footage only to have seconds of it peppered throughout the documentary! This seems to be the biggest complaint from everyone I know who has seen it. To not add any of this footage (i.e The Clash playing both songs on SNL/Their appearance on Friday&apos;s/Tom Snyder/US festive footage/etc) is simply not caring about the band or it&apos;s fans. All this does is give bootleggers even more viable footage to sell. Real smart.\n\nHaving said all that it is a welcome documentary. And there is the bonus footage of all the existing footage for The Clash On Broadway. Footage that I should add the reason why so little exists is because Topper took out an injunction so that film never be released. Since it was never finished (because of the injunction) most of it was thrown away or deteriorated since it would never see the light of day anyway. Gee thanks Topper, now we really see you in a positive light!",

With the &quot;String Theory&quot; it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines ARE possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them.\n\nAlthough it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic, I found the show VERY interesting and informative. It was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.",

      "reviewBody": "PROM NIGHT IV: DELIVER US FROM EVIL\n\n*** Out of 5\n\nTagline- They Ditched Their Prom for a Private Party. Now It&apos;s Their Last Dance.\n\nRelease Date- May 13th, 1992\n\nRunning Time- 89-Minutes\n\nRating- R\n\nScreenplay- Richard Beattie\n\nDirector- Clay Borris\n\nStarring- Nikki de Boer, Alden Kane, Joy Tanner, Alle Ghadban\n\nReleased in 1992 Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil is the 4th and final film in the franchise (excluding the remake). The Prom Night series is sort of an anthology as only 2-3 connect and even those 2 films don&apos;t directly tie into each other except the Mary Lou character, any other connection is quite minor and basically you wouldn&apos;t need to see the 2nd part to understand the 3rd. While the original Prom Night was a slasher film and one of the first produced in the wake of the success of Halloween, the 2nd film Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II went in a different direction with the series and owes a bit to the Elm Street franchise. As mentioned outside of Mary Lou, Prom Night III: Last Kiss is its own film, but does continue with the more supernatural. Here with the 4th film, the Mary Lou plot is dropped and this part goes back to the slasher style of the original. The only real connection between all of the Prom Night films is they&apos;re all set at Hamilton High. I really can&apos;t confess to being a huge fan of the series and while I like the original and to me it&apos;s the best of the series, but I don&apos;t hold it in as high regard as other slasher fans. Even though I like the original, but it wouldn&apos;t be in my top 10 slasher films and I mostly enjoyed Prom Night II. The one thing I do like about the series is the anthology aspect as I like the idea of all these things happening within the high school. Prom Night IV is generally seen as the weakest of the series, though some list the 3rd film. But based on what I&apos;ve seen, the 3rd would just edge out this one. I can&apos;t argue with the negative reviews for Prom Night IV since I don&apos;t exactly disagree with them, but I also feel Prom Night IV gets too many poor reviews. Prom Night IV is the very definition of a middle of the road film. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as awful as some, but it&apos;s also not very good either. But I&apos;m a little surprised at how many negative reviews are out there as this is basically an 80s slasher produced in 1992. You name the slasher cliche, no doubt Prom Night IV has it. Perhaps, that&apos;s a reason for the subpar reviews, but many slasher films have copied each other and the first 4 Friday the 13th films are more or less the same with 2 being almost a remake of the original. By the time the 4th Prom Night was released, the slasher film was basically dead. The peak of these films were in the early 80s and while by the mid-80s, the popularity was fading, but there was still enough life left for these films to be produced at a fairly high rate throughout the decade. There were still a few left trying to squeeze out one last cent, but the slasher film was basically dead until Scream was released in 1996. If Prom Night IV had come out a decade earlier I think while it still wouldn&apos;t be seen as a slasher classic, but I do think it would be better received.\n\nIn 1957 Father Jonas (Carver) murdered two teens on prom night and after that he&apos;s locked away by the church and heavily medicated. Flash forward to prom night 1992, Jonas escapes and sets his sights on 4 teens that ditched the prom to have a party of their own at a summer house.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Richard Beattie and his first writing credit was in 1987 with Blindside, which interestingly enough was directed by Paul Lynch, the director of the original Prom Night. Beattie would also write No Contest II also directed by Lynch. While most of Beattie&apos;s films aren&apos;t very well known though some may have a cult following, but his most notable work would be writing a few DTV films, which starred Steven Seagal, such as Maximum Conviction, Force of Execution, Mercenary: Absolution and Cartels. The writing for Prom Night IV is slasher 101 as it seems upon being hired to write the script, Beattie went on a slasher movie marathon as the script is strictly by the books and sticks to every slasher movie convention, which in someways is the scripts biggest issue as everything here has been done before and done better, but for me it does bring a sense of familiarity to the film, which rather than hurt, makes things a little more enjoyable for me. The characters are the standard ones seen in countless other stalk and slash films and aren&apos;t strong enough to carry the film during the lulls in action. Father Jonas also seems to have magical powers as simply by waving his crucifix he can start fires and one has to wonder why he didn&apos;t just do that to the characters he was after as in that case he would have killed them all. Most slasher films won&apos;t often be cited for strong writing with a few exceptions, but Beattie&apos;s script is no better or worse than the good bulk of these films released in the 80s even if it doesn&apos;t work as well.\n\nProm Night IV was directed by Clay Borris and if the writing was slasher 101 that best describes the direction as like the script, Borris as director sticks to every single slasher movie convention. The good portion of the films directed by Clay Borris are fairly unknown with really only Prom Night IV being the most notable. He&apos;s also directed a number of TV movies and TV shows such as several episodes of Forever Knight. Borris has also worked as a 2nd unit director on the already mentioned No Contest II and he also served that role on Wrong Turn. After a quick start with a fairly well put together death sequence, the film slows down and here Borris really doesn&apos;t get much going and while the script also falters a bit as characters are simply not strong enough to carry the picture, but Borris doesn&apos;t really set much of a tone and the pace does lag for a good portion of the middle as both the writing and directing rely on the standard slasher tropes, but there&apos;s never any feel of a real threat until Jonas shows up and despite a terrific isolated setting, Borris doesn&apos;t create enough suspense or tension, but at the very least at least to me, he does keep the film watchable even if never engaging. The good bulk of the action kicks in during the final act and Borris handles these scenes a little better, but again they just suffer from being done before and more effectively.\n\nOverall Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil has its moments, but not enough to make this anything other than an average at best film. While I fully understand the negative reviews, but I also feel it&apos;s a little better than its reputation (though not by a whole lot). Nicole de Boer in an early role is solid, but her character is very much the definition of the final girl, but de Boer is solid in her role as is Joy Tanner as she brings a lot of spunk to the role and with de Boer is the main reason for me Prom Night IV remained watchable. The very same year this was released there was another film that has a couple of similar ideas and that would be Happy Hell Night, which despite being released in 1992 was apparently filmed around 1989, but Prom Night IV and Happy Hell Night have similar ideas, only real difference is Happy Hell Night aims for more comedy as the killer is a poor mans Freddy Krueger.",

So, I&apos;m happy to be the first and I wish the best year 2005 to all the Underground&apos;s fans. If you never had this chance to see the long version (5 hours) of the film, give your priority, this year, to watch it. After this, the Palme d&apos;Or version will feel you so short!!! If you live in Paris, I can help you to discover the complete Chef d&apos;Oeuvre.\n\nTherefore, I understand that the film could be criticized on the political depths. But it is so easy to make movies without any involvement. Kusturica worked for 3 years on the film and involved himself on the content. But the film treatment is not only about Balkans war, but mainly about human ferocity and betrayment. Speaking Cinema, there is no film controlling so well aestheticism, scenario, actors, music and creativity. Emir did it and I am sorry that some arrogant journalists killed the film, getting it off the Cinema theaters without the popular success that Underground deserved.",

With Blacky convinced he should remain hidden in the cellar until the war ends, Marko conspires to leave him there as he grows richer from the toils of the people living underground.\r\n\r\nOver fifteen years pass before a web of lies unfolds and Blacky emerges from the shelter to seek his revenge.",

And while there&apos;s elements of these things it&apos;s mostly a movie about the lives of the people who work in this sex club. Your taking a look at their stories, their hopes, their dreams, sex lives, violent encounters, relationships and their endless search for good coke. Now this might sound a bit interesting but it&apos;s unfortunately really not. Most of these people we ever really get to know. And the script is paper thin for most of these characters. The disturbing bits are few a far between. Mostly the title sequence is the most disturbing bit of the movie unless the quick cuts of unsimulated gay sex in one scene scares you. And speaking of sex, for a bunch of people who work a sex show there&apos;s only one real scene with it happening besides the title sequence which again was better. If Anyone is even remotely curious about this film I would suggest just to watch the title sequence because that&apos;s the only interesting part in this whole movie. The rest of this is high grade trash!",

It takes place during the moors invasion in Italy. There is quite a lot of magic involved. And gruesome sights of people broken on the wheel. Strikingly beautiful Italian landscapes form the background to this drama. Sometimes confusing, always deeply rewarding. The quest for king and honor and in spite of all, the search for peace.

People complain about the acting, maybe its cause i watched the movie in french(dubbed) but it was very correct, nothing to complain on this...\n\nBasically i watched this at late night whitout expecting much and i was entertain and liked it. I saw way worse movie with bigger budget, and even winning Oscars...(ahem... hurtlocker...)"

His parents turn up for a visit, but remain wordless, rushing out of the place after 10 minutes. It&apos;s time to get out of the flat, the woman announces, and decides to go out with a friend- only the start of the night...\n\nThis film is based on a play by Jon Fosse, a Norwegian writer, who is very popular in Europe. If you enjoy theatre you&apos;ll probably enjoy this film, if you don&apos;t, you could easily get bored as 95% of the film is set in the flat of the young couple.",

Far-fetched and far from great, but made enjoyable by a few funny fish-out-of-water/mistaken-identity sequences and the spirited performances by Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Boyle: all three of whom, it may be noted, seem to have lost their careers in recent time...but were at the top of their games during the era and are certainly at home here in a film that is never quite as good as it could be but is nevertheless a whole lot better than I ever expected it would be.\n\nI like the beginning sequence with Ray Charles&apos; &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; over the credits. I don&apos;t know why - maybe because I saw it years ago and it&apos;s just stuck with me - but I always think of this when I picture the film in my head."

      "reviewBody": "This film is unbelievable. I mean, it&apos;s unbelievable that this film even left the drawing board. It&apos;s unbelievable that three talented actors could even choose to do a film of this quality. Correction. It&apos;s not the quality, it&apos;s the lack thereof I should be noting.\n\nAnna Magdalena is a &apos;romantic tale&apos; (it says on the back), in which a piano tuner (Takeshi Kaneshiro) bumps into a serial womaniser (Aaron Kwok) who is a no-hoper in his aspirations to become a novelist. The &apos;piano tuner&apos; decides to offer the &apos;novelist&apos; a hand by putting him up for a few days. Meanwhile a new resident (Kelly Chen) moves into their apartment block, with piano and all, only that she shows little talent. A &apos;love triangle&apos; forms.\n\nWell, maybe even the clichéd love triangle cannot be an attribute here, as I&apos;ve seen more chemistry in a bottle of air. The three characters seem as loveless as a defaced stone wall, and the film rarely ever delves further than skin deep. The storyline is virtually nonexistent, and where there is one, there is too much irrelevance to keep the flow running. In particular, the film tries the old tactic of showing the unique quirks of the characters, but in no way do they fit in with the story, nor add anything to what we want to discover.\n\nThere is nothing in this film that salvages it from me wanting to call it rubbish. It is simply pitiful. I am a big fan of Kaneshiro and Chen, and I did like to a certain extent their outing in Lavender, but Anna Magdalena would be a film I wouldn&apos;t want to remember them for. One to leave on the shop shelf.",

      "reviewBody": "Casting Marlon Brando in this film as Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for American troops in post WW-II Japan is considered by many critics and film historians alike as one of the worst casting errors ever made in a film history. In my opinion, though, Marlon Brando is the one responsible for turning this quite an average film into a hillarious comedy. Yes, they really did it. With a little bit of make up and great effort from actor&apos;s part to learn Japanese mannerism and language in order to get an accent in his speech we have here Marlon Brando in his most unimaginable role. The rest of the cast is also quite good, namely Paul Ford as Colonel Waiwright Purdy III, a somehow cliche figure of stubborn, narrow minded US military officer and Glenn Ford by his side as Captain Fisby, for whom Brando&apos;s character Sakini ends up working as an interpreter and, of cause, unforgettable Machiko Kyo, as a spirited geisha, whom lovers of Japanese cinema must remember from Akira Kurosawa&apos;s films.\n\n   Directed by Daniel Mann (Butterfield 8, Come Back, Little Sheba) and based on John Patrick&apos;s stage play that was a big hit on Broadway at it&apos;s time, The Teahouse of the August Moon is slow in parts and in terms of some aspects of the story considerably aged and outdated but still funny and entertaining movie. 8/10"

Nicholson&apos;s part is certainly unscrupulous to begin with, but in Jessica Lange he finds a confederate with even less scruples.   The legal loose ends that dangled in the earlier version are avoided this time with a more plausible chain of events... and the story ends when the story ought to end, instead of being dragged on.\n\nWonderful character and situation development, intriguing and engaging, even when you know the story.  Nice twists of the story from the Lana Turner and Italian (&quot;Ossessione&quot; 1943) versions.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, if you enjoyed the 2017 animated movie &quot;The Son of Bigfoot&quot;, then you will definitely also enjoy the 2020 animated movie &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot;. Trust me on that one.\n\nI found the 2020 animated movie to be every bit as entertaining as the 2017 predecessor. And while they were very different in contents, they proved to be equally enjoyable and entertaining.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot; is more wide-spreading in comparison to the 2017 storyline, and it does tell a story about something that raises a thought or two once the story is finished and the end credits are rolling. &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot; is centered around an environmental awareness-based story, for better or worse. Sure, some might see it as propaganda I suppose, but come on, this is an animated movie meant for entertainment. Sure, it planted a seed or two in my consciousness after having seen the movie, but for me it was hardly propaganda.\n\nThe art style used in &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot; is the same as used in &quot;The Son of Bigfoot&quot;, so if you enjoyed it back in 2017, you have something to look forward to with this 2020 animated movie.\n\nAs an animated movie, having a proper voice cast to deliver the dialogue and bring the characters to life is rather important. And I will say that they definitely had a good ensemble of casted performers to do just that in &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot;. I thoroughly enjoyed the raccoon and the bear characters, because they were just hilarious, and actually carried much of the movie for me.\n\nI was genuinely entertained by &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot; and I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch it, especially if you have children. It proved to be a fun movie, and my rating of &quot;Bigfoot Family&quot; is a six out of ten stars. While it was good, it was not a contender for being among the best of animated movies to make it out of 2020.",

      "name": "The most competent film adaption of the story as a serious mystery",
      "reviewBody": "Agatha Christie&apos;s 1939 story idea captures the imagination.  Ten strangers who each, in different ways, have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion.  Then their unknown host U.N. Owen systematically and mockingly murders them one by one.  The idea was adapted into a film in 1945, 1965, 1974, and 1989.  Unfortunately, neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeeded in turning this captivating but confining plot concept into a truly fulfilling story.\n\nThe book&apos;s premise is clever.  Careful attention is paid to plot detail. Compared to the films, the book&apos;s assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters&apos; attitudes toward them are more varied, subtle, and interesting.  The book is the least sentimental about the characters, treating them vaguely and suspiciously.  It maintains more of a sense of intensity and purpose than the films.  It details why and how Owen carried out the scheme.\n\nHowever, once the book establishes its imaginative premise, the story becomes thin and formulaic.  There is little plot or character development. The storytelling seems flat, frigid, and, at times, slow-paced.  There is no lead character to care about.  The characters and their past crimes are sketched in summary fashion, and vary widely in quality.  There are only two real plot twists.  The second creates a major logical problem, which the book acknowledges and tries to overcome by weakly suggesting that the ploy would trick or &quot;rattle&quot; the murderer.  The guests&apos; murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme and little more.  Some cosmetic frills aside, the killings show, in themselves, no special cunning, skill, strategic advantage, or plausibility.  Owen strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.\n\nWorst of all, the book (and each film) has nothing serious to say about the powerful themes at the heart of the story.  The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation.  How do the characters behave?  How do they try to reason, to survive?  Also by its very nature -- as the book&apos;s last pages show -- this is a morality play.  How is each character a &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;beyond the law&quot;?  Does each get &quot;justice&quot;?  Is justice the point, or simply a &quot;lust&quot; to torture and kill?  Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it, about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice?  None of this is meaningfully explored.\n\nIn some respects, the films are worse and better than the book.  The lighthearted approach of the 1945 and 1965 adaptations is entertaining, but comes at the expense of the story&apos;s plausibility and seriousness. Characters confess their secrets and treat the horror unfolding around them as if it were a parlor game.  The 1974 film took a decidedly different tone, for good and ill.  Gone from both 1945 and 1965 is the comical opening sequence and its catchy, upbeat music.  The 1974 film has no opening music, just simple credits and silence invaded by the sound of an approaching helicopter.  Its storytelling is cold and clinical.  This matches its setting -- a palatial, ornate, immaculate hotel, shuttered and alone amid ruins in the Iranian desert.\n\nThe 1974 movie captures more of a sense of fear, menace, and suspense. This includes the selection of Orson Welles to narrate the tape recording charging the guests with past crimes and also the way in which the killings are depicted.  The characters are more serious.  They are played, with authority, more like real people than caricatures.  Richard Attenborough&apos;s judge is more stern, less folksy, than in prior versions.  Stephane Audran is excellent as actress Ilona, radiant and charming on the surface but troubled and lonely at the core.  The maid and butler are believable as hard, smooth con artists.  In this important sense, the 1974 version is truest to the book and to those who want to see it presented as a serious mystery (the 1989 adaptation ends well but is low-budget and generally inept).\n\nOverall, however, the 1974 film is less substantial and entertaining than prior versions.  The storytelling is so spare and unartful it can feel sterile and uninvolving, lacking in wit, ingenuity, eloquence, and energy. The only moment of real charm comes early and abruptly, when Charles Aznavour performs a song, &quot;Dance in the old-fashioned way,&quot; with Audran looking on, enchanted and lovely.  By contrast, Aznavour&apos;s rendition of Ten Little Indians is disappointing.  At &quot;six little Indians,&quot; he starts pounding the piano keys and shouting the words, only to let the music die out in anticlimax before &quot;one little Indian.&quot;\n\nThe outstanding cast is unable to breathe much life into the characters or interactions.  Herbert Lom lends an air of authority, reserve, and intelligence (perhaps too much) to the doctor.  But his restrained, stiff performance lacks any truly memorable quality, like Walter Huston&apos;s buffoonery and charm in 1945 or Dennis Price&apos;s vanity and arrogance in 1965, and he is unconvincing as a drunkard.  Adolfo Celi can do nothing much with his role, and Gert Froebe little more with his.  Elke Sommer, unflatteringly filmed, makes no impression as Vera and has no chemistry with Oliver Reed. Reed gives an impenetrable, impish performance as Lombard.\n\nThe 1974 film copies from the imperfect 1965 script, and loses some memorable lines in the translation.  Also, by 1974, Lombard has no career. The 1974 film is least faithful to the nursery rhyme.  Events are out of Owen&apos;s control, as when a snake is let loose, an uncertain murder weapon; one character simply wanders off into the desert; and another screams when a candle blows out, in prior adaptations a diversion engineered by Owen. The location is so faraway and desolate it raises questions about why the guests would be willing to go there, without at least investigating, and how Owen could have made the arrangements.  The film lapses back to 1945&apos;s short final exposition scene.  Re-writes to reflect the end of hanging as a form of capital punishment, and to make Owen choke out incoherent last words, rob that crucial scene of even the inadequate dramatic effect of its predecessors.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the big achievements of Un Secret which must be noted is that the director, Claude Miller, doesn&apos;t entirely sympathize with his characters or make them out to be all completely good Jews. They&apos;re not. This is a film concerning the holocaust that doesn&apos;t just make a blanket statement like &quot;Nazis = Bad&quot;. No, there were Jews who were in denial, and tried to cloud over the horrible fact that was upon all of Europe, and indeed it&apos;s when the film takes its most dissecting view at the flaws of these characters that the veneer is stripped away of completely innocent people being swept up in the maelstrom. While Miller obviously acknowledges and shows the horror of anti-semitism in France (one brief scene in a classroom showing Night and Fog is especially startling) and of the rise of Hitler, he puts his eye on the Grinberg family and what really happened between François Grimbert&apos;s parents (name changed when he was a kid) before and during World War 2.\n\nMiller&apos;s approach with Un Secret is a tricky one structurally, and it doesn&apos;t quite find it&apos;s footing until a third of the way into the film. He tries to find a back-and-forth-and-back form of dealing with three periods of time: 1930s, 1950s/1960s and 1985 when everybody is older and it turns to black and white (an opposite touch that works, for a moment), and it&apos;s only effective in about the first five minutes. I became wary of those sudden jumps to the 1985 portion of the film, where we see an old Maxime Nathan Grinberg (Patrick Bruel) grieving over the loss of his dog and his son trying to find him, and found it didn&apos;t strike anywhere near as well as the 50s scenes. On top of this, after all of the film has ended, that huge chunk of the film with the focus on that first marriage of Grinberg&apos;s with Hannah and his very obvious but eventually-acted-on infatuation with Tania (very sexy Cecile de France) was far more effective dramatically and tonally than anything else in the film.\n\nThis is not to say Un Secret doesn&apos;t cast a very fascinating look into this particular boy&apos;s lack of perspective and of his father&apos;s determination to compete on a physical level with the Germans, to almost &quot;be&quot; one in a perfectionist sense athletically, and how this one secret is part of scarred memory, attachment to one&apos;s faith and religion and who they are, and love and lust. The cast is generally excellent, with Bruel, De France and Sagnier delivering work with nuance and exquisite, painful emotions that resonate from one into the next scene (Sagnier is so good she gets us to feel repulsed, or at least taken completely aback, by what she does while in hiding). And the moods of joy and despair in a Jewish family circa 1930s and 1940s- and the subsequent self-imposed shame of people in Europe even after the war ended- is captured with some real power and accuracy.\n\nBut Miller also can&apos;t completely fix together his narrative; he feels the need to jump around as if it will create a really intriguing rhythm, where if he stepped back and told it without sudden jumps or surreal bits like the &quot;brother&quot; in the boy&apos;s bedroom at night the film would benefit. There is also a lack of a real resolution; the 1985 scene just didn&apos;t cut it for me as far as an unspoken father/son thing, and despite it sounding conventional a confrontation of the boy to his parents might have brought something more interesting than the uneven subtlety of the ending. A lot of this is so hearth-breaking in its true dimensions and probing of the subject that the only real disappointment is how it doesn&apos;t fell... complete with itself.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s fair to say that my two biggest passions in life (at least when it comes to pop culture, hobbies, etc.) are movies and sports. I&apos;m a big fan of music, books, and eating large amounts of fatty foods, too, but they don&apos;t quite compare to the level of affection I hold for movies and sports, particularly basketball. The combinations of those two passions often feels like someone in the world is secretly reading my hypothetical diary at night and creating programming just for me. Such is the case with The Other Dream Team, a powerful and insightful documentary that I imagine will stick with me for quite some time.\n\nFor many basketball fans, the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain are considered special, maybe even sacred, as the team assembled to represent the US Men&apos;s Olympic basketball team was unquestionably the greatest collection of talent in the history of the sport. Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and eight other legendary players (plus Christian Laettner!) came together to form the Dream Team, annihilating every opponent that stood in the way of earning the gold medal and spreading the gospel of basketball to the world along the way. But while the Dream Team captivated a worldwide audience, there was a much more dramatic and significant story unfolding in the background. A group of players representing the small country of Lithuania which had only recently regained its independence in the fall of the USSR worked their way into the third place game and faced off with the Unified Team, the remnants of the squad they had been forced to compete with during the Communist reign. Weaving together the happenings on the basketball court with the rebirth of a small nation, The Other Dream Team expertly displays the importance of sport and the ways it can be used to inspire.\n\nGoing into this film, I had a basic understanding of what took place on the basketball court throughout this story. Like many other men my age, as a kid I was fascinated by the Dream Team. We&apos;d never seen anything like that team and we never will again; they were literally that good. The Lithuanian team, though, always stuck out to me partly because they appeared to actually be good at basketball (whereas some of our other opponents looked like a bunch of middle school girls) and partly because their top two players, Arvydas Sabonis and Sarunas Marciulionis, were tremendous talents. In this summer&apos;s Olympics, virtually every team that qualifies to play will have at least one or two NBA-caliber players but in &apos;92, that wasn&apos;t the case. Sabonis and Marciulionis, along with Croatia&apos;s Drazen Petrovic, were undoubtedly the best players in the tournament who weren&apos;t on the Dream Team. \n\nI did not know, however, the tumultuous background from which these players came from. At the time of the Olympic Games, Lithuania had only been an independent nation for two short years, two years which were trying to say the least. Amazingly enough, it&apos;s tough to get a new country off the ground when you&apos;ve spent 46 years under Communist reign (shocking, I know). The Other Dream Team heartbreakingly digs into the deeper elements of this fight for independence and paints a dark (and truthful) picture of what it was like to live through this period, both before and after Lithuania received its freedom from the Soviets. There are some truly devastating visuals and descriptions at play here and the film pulls no punches in ensuring that the audience understands not only what the players were going through but what every citizen of the country was going through. As such, the Lithuanian basketball team is simply the medium in which the filmmakers work to bring their story together.\n\nBy showing us the awful conditions which the players (and by proxy, their countrymen) lived through while under Soviet control and the immense struggle that was the fight for independence, director Marius A. Markevicius sets us up for a dramatic and deeply satisfying third act. Defeating the Russians to win the bronze medal was nothing compared to the hope their triumph gave a young nation and this is illustrated exquisitely through a mix of tear-inducing behind-the-scenes footage and touching interviews with both players and spectators. This is one of the more genuine sports documentaries I can remember and one that seems to really understand the significance of the subject matter it concerns itself with. It is a touching, at times quite funny, and beautiful example of the power of sport that will absolutely hit home for sports fans and non-fans alike. \n\nPlease see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start off by saying that I was skeptical whether I should watch this movie because of all the comparisons here to US productions. Because while I did enjoy most of the ones named, not enough to want to see a basically South Korean copycat at the theater.\n\nIf you fear the same thing: Don&apos;t worry! This movie is exactly what you would expect from great Korean cinema, comparable to the likes of &quot;The Chaser&quot;, &quot;Memories of Murder&quot; and &quot;A Bittersweet Life&quot;. In this movie, there is lots of rather believable tragedy, little kitsch (there is the occasional unsuitable one-liner and the girl sometimes says things that in my opinion are too mature for her age and yank a little too much at the emotional chain - these are basically the things that brought my rating down to 9/10) and a fair amount of graphic violence and realism in the fighting scenes. There are also some wacky characters just like they appear somewhat frequently in east Asian productions but I think they fit in quite nicely despite the otherwise very serious tone.\n\nIf one were to compare it to a US production, I would go with e.g. &quot;A History of Violence&quot; because of the serious tone and the realism but still, the overall style is drastically different.\n\nThe whole experience is nicely rounded off with a very beautiful score and the only thing I considered negative besides what I already mentioned was that the plot is moving very fast. At various points I was not sure whether I didn&apos;t pay enough attention or whether details were left out. Meaning for instance how one character got the information about another character. These connections of information between characters are not always clear in my opinion but it does not really hurt the story and I am sure that it would be clear with a second viewing - something that this movie absolutely deserves.",

      "reviewBody": "Le Grand Chef is a film about cooking. That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing in itself, taking its origins from what appears to be a popular comic book. It&apos;s comic book origins are very apparent in the film, from framing choices to character development to story progression. Unfortunately, in its adaptation, the film appears to try too hard to make it a comic book in movie form and leaves the dynamism of cinema behind.\n\nThe story is about a young man, who, outcast from his culinary school as a result of accidentally poisoning food tasters with golden blowfish sashimi, is recruited into a culinary competition to win the title of the greatest Corean chef and claim a historically important cooking blade, belonging to the last royal chef. Or something like that. He is rivaled by the heir to the school he got kicked out of and there are a number of supporting characters.\n\nI think one of the problems with this film is that it compressed a comic book series into a film and tried to pack in as much as it could and also played it as close to the comic book as possible. Unfortunately, it makes the film seem a bit like an anime series in fast forward. The story itself is very comic book-like, with lots of subplots and hidden revelations that aren&apos;t exactly necessary. Consequently, we don&apos;t see a lot of character development, but rather character revelations instead, as they or we learn about their background (sigh, in flashback). Ultimately, it leads the characters and the overall story to seem more than a little two dimensional.\n\nAnother thing that surprised me was how a film about cooking can fail to make the photography of the process of cooking all that interesting. There are plenty of other films with cooking themes that do this very well. Granted, I could see that a lot of the framing was probably taken from the comic book itself, but I feel that there is a place to copy and a place to use the strength of the cinematic medium and this film relies too heavily on the former.\n\nIn the end, I imagine it would be more worthwhile to read the comic book series instead. With such a two dimensional story, characters, pacing, and uninspired photography and merely adequate performances from the players, there isn&apos;t much here to recommend. On the other hand, production specs are good and the film isn&apos;t ugly. While it isn&apos;t painful to watch, I can&apos;t recommend it as it&apos;s equivalent to eating only a bowl of plainly cooked rice as your meal. Not very interesting. 5/10.",
