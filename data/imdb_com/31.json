She accomplishes that to an intense degree as Sadie Flood in &quot;Georgia.&quot;  The problem is that I didn&apos;t really want to feel what Sadie felt.  She scared and disgusted me.  Mare Winningham (who knew she had such a clear, sweet singing voice?!?) matches Leigh&apos;s believable portrayal, but had a more sympathetic character with which to work.  The stand-out, though, is Max Perlich as Sadie&apos;s worshipful husband/doormat.  My heart broke for him.  While the acting was strong, I found this film exhausting and kept checking to see how much time was left - it felt more like an assignment than entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is directed by Renny Harlin and written by Brian Helgeland and Scott Pierce. It stars Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Andras Jones, Tuesday Knight, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman and Brooke Theiss. Music is by John Easdale and Craig Safan and cinematography by Steven Fierberg.\n\nFreddy Krueger (Englund) is back again to finish off the last of the Dream Warriors, but when he enters the dreams of a new girl, Alice Johnson (Wilcox), he gets more than he bargained for...\n\nIn spite of part three being something of a return to form for the Elm Street franchise, it still signalled the point where Krueger as a character started to become more fun villain than a terrifying presence. By the time this fourth instalment rolled around, Krueger was iconic for sure, but also he was a marketing tool for merchandise, even getting his own spin-off TV show. Where once was this vile child murderer invading the dreams of children and killing them, now is a guy selling dolls and someone more known for a quip than a kill.\n\nDream Master follows the basic Elm Street formula, Krueger returns to kill more kids in their dreams. The methods range from the icky (insect) to the impressive (pizza), and the effects work is mostly enjoyable. The tying up of loose ends shows some modicum of thought in the writing, while the big finale is actually worth the wait. However, the acting away from a perky Wilcox is pretty poor and familiarity of formula does indeed breed contempt. It&apos;s just about above average as a whole, thanks in the main to the inventive kills, but as this third sequel coined it in at the box office, with that comes the basic fact that Kruegerville is a town built only for cash purposes. 6/10",

      "name": "Appallingly weak and unfunny; a sad end for a celebrated saga",
      "reviewBody": "On the one hand, the return of primary stars Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault as delightful gay couple Renato and Albin, and supporting cast members Michel Galabru and Benny Luke as conservative in-law Simon Charrier and outrageous manservant Jacob. Why, composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone also again lends his talents to this picture. On the other hand, Georges Lautner enters as a new director following Édouard Molinaro&apos;s declination to helm a new installment in the series; I won&apos;t judge Lautner solely on the basis of one prior experience, but I will say that 1974 &quot;thriller&quot; &apos;Les seins de glace&apos; was such a godawful mess that it was one of the worst movies I&apos;ve watched in recent months. And in what is all too often a bad sign for many films, this second sequel is marked by a writing team of six, with only Marcello Danon returning from the predecessors. Adding to the troubles of the viewing experience, it&apos;s hard to come by a version with the desired French audio track and English subtitles, so international viewers must suffer through the terrible English dubbing if they wish to give &apos;&quot;Elles&quot; se marient&apos; a try. No, the latter doesn&apos;t specifically reflect on the quality of the whole, but it does make the title more difficult to engage with, for this is the type of dubbing that gives dubbing a bad name.\n\nAnd then, sitting to watch &apos;La cage aux folles III,&apos; we begin to assess its content and craftsmanship. And, friends, things aren&apos;t looking good. Simply put, this feature struggles somewhat painfully to achieve anything remotely resembling the wit and charm that characterized the 1978 progenitor, or even the farcical 1985 followup when it was operating at its best. A fair bit of these ninety minutes could have been cut while losing nothing, for example scenes that in theory reflect the endless banter between Renato and Albin but which carry none of the cleverness to make them matter. Dialogue is mostly limp, scene writing often just trundles along, and characters feel like hollow shades of what they might have been previously. Meanwhile, it sure seems to me as though the writers were straining so hard to conjure a workable story that I&apos;m surprised no one landed in the hospital after hurting themselves. &apos;La cage aux folles&apos; cheekily played with masculinity and femininity, and gender and sexuality, while plainly celebrating the queer community; &apos;La cage aux folles II,&apos; at its worst, felt like it was sometimes punching down to laugh at rather than with that same community and subculture. &apos;La cage aux folles III&apos; comes across as a group of people who wanted nothing to do with the LGBTQ community, but in having signed on to make a sequel in this series, were nonetheless obligated to do the bare minimum and give the appearance of not being outwardly homophobic, and they had difficulty doing so. That&apos;s obviously not an accurate summation of the circumstances - but that&apos;s how it feels, as the minutes tick by.\n\nI sort of feel bad for Tognazzi and Serrault, not to mention Luke and the other cast members. Compared to the first two movies in the very least, this is not at all a good illustration of the actors&apos; capabilities. The crew turned in reliable work, sure: lighting, sets, costume design, hair, makeup, and so on. While the result is sadly flat and devoid of any vitality, Lautner at least demonstrates baseline capability in orchestrating shots and scenes (more than I can say for that one other title of his that I&apos;ve seen). In fairness, maybe none of this is Lautner&apos;s fault after all, and anyway, none of these qualities truly matter, for the writing mostly just altogether flounders. There are some small kernels of intelligence here, sure, and even ingenuity; it&apos;s not all bad. But apart from being weak generally, too much of Part III just feels like an empty rehash of Part I, or even Part II. In this moment, I can&apos;t actually remember if I laughed even once while watching, though I know I came close on maybe a couple occasions. Frankly, if one were trying to write an unfunny, self-parodying entry of a franchise, or even worse, a title that would serve to actively sabotage that of which it is a part, &apos;&quot;Elles&apos; se marient&apos; may be an exemplar. As if to kind of illustrate the point: even though she&apos;s given only a small supporting part and doesn&apos;t show up until the third act, the most earnest writing that this can claim surrounds the character of Cindy; Antonella Interlenghi may actually give the most admirable performance here, and in turn Tognazzi and Serrsault are at their best when they share scenes with her. How, truly, does this share a name with the 1978 film?\n\nThere are worse ways to spend one&apos;s time. Even if one is a diehard fan of someone involved, however, or Jean Poiret&apos;s original play, or the first two movies - I just cannot recommend &apos;La cage aux folles III.&apos; The humor is all but absent, not to mention the heart that we got so much of seven years prior, and what we get in their stead is nothing worth talking about. Why, the plot is resolved so feebly, with a horridly confounding shock of Movie Magic, that the production takes another hit right at the very end. I can assume I&apos;m not alone in having sought this out just to complete the trifecta, but please take my word for it: I&apos;ll watch anything, anything at all, and I admit to entering this with low expectations. Still I was disappointed. &apos;La cage aux folles III&apos; is a sad, dull send-off for the series, and I think we&apos;d all be better off if we just try to forget about it.",

      "reviewBody": "Returning from an oil field with a plane full of crew etc going on leave, Frank Towns&apos; plane enters a sandstorm over the Sahara desert and crashes. As various attempts at rescue or escape fail one passenger, Dorfmann suggests his plan to rebuild the plane as a smaller version and attempt to fly out, leaving the bulk of the damage craft behind.  However tensions mount as personalities conflict as all the men face death.\n\nI had only ever heard of this film before I finally got round to watching it last night on television.  I was aware of the basic plot and had assumed it was more recent that it actually was.  I watched it assuming that it was made in the early seventies when the disaster movie genre was just starting to take off (sorry  accidental pun).  However this was made prior to this and is probably a much better film for it  in the seventies the film would have required more spectacle, so the crash would have been much more dramatic and horrifying.  As it is now, the film is more about the men under stress than it is about anything else.\n\nThis is brought out well and the majority of the drama and tension within the film is as much from these conflicts as it is from the pressure to escape the desert.  The film is longer than I expected it to be but it pretty much sustains itself for that length.  The main reason for the film working so well is the cast, which has it&apos;s fair share of famous faces but also has more than it&apos;s fair share of good performances.\n\nStewart is really strong in the lead (although, in fairness, there is no one main character) and becomes increasingly grizzled as the film goes on.  His character is not without flaws even if he does come out of this well. Attenborough is also good but is less evident in the film than some of the others.  Krüger has the least pleasant of the roles given that he plays a tough German.  He manages to make the character likeable while still going about his task with a strict organised German air to him.  Finch is good and is well supported by Fraser.  The support cast includes strong performances from Borgnine, Bannen, Kennedy, Marquand and the director&apos;s own son is thrown in for colour!\n\nOverall this is much better than the disaster-type movie I had expected as it is a film where the plane crash isn&apos;t a blaze of spectacle and the death scenes aren&apos;t played out for full effect.  Instead it is a tension adventure story that is driven by some great performances by a cast full of well known actors."

      "name": "John and Olivia: BETRAYED!",
      "reviewBody": "There is only word one that fully does justice to this film: APPALLING.\n\nJohn and Olivia were BETRAYED! WHY they would choose this movie-someone else on here said they looked through over 30 scripts before settling on this one-and why they would let this first-time director decimate their careers in this way it&apos;s inexplicable. WHY anyone at any studio would take these two huge stars (though Olivia had been tarnished by Xanadu by this time) and TOSS THEIR CAREERS TO THE WIND on this turkey is again, inexplicable. Why does this film exist? \n\nThe answer lies, I think, in Olivia&apos;s &apos;rebranding&apos; effort, trying to shift out of being wholesome and pure and be a bit of a vamp, which in retrospect seems like a big mistake (look what happened to Sheena Easton when she tried the same thing and look at the continuing debacle that is Britney). Everyone loves Olivia being pure and a bit cheeky. Look how adorable she was in Grease! It is just so incongruous for her to be a bank-robbing shiftless liar that it is impossible to get involved with her character. Okay, that sounds like there is even one &apos;character&apos; in this film, but you know what I mean.\n\nThere are several compelling issues raised by this film, such as:\n\nWhy does John Travolta walk like he has a broomstick (etc. but ALL the way in) the whole movie? Did his mother tell him his posture was bad or something?\n\nWere general production values REALLY that low back in 1982? No wonder films are so expensive now.\n\nWHO was the director related to that he was allowed to make this?\n\nWHY, when Olivia&apos;s face is presented in the paper, in a loving 6&apos; X 8&apos; picture identifying her as a wanted bank robber, does she just walk around and attend her acting class as though nothing happened? Why does no one in her acting class mention it? Why don&apos;t the police show even the SLIGHTEST interest in apprehending her and recovering the money? Why doesn&apos;t anyone she the slightest interest?\n\nWHY do songs on the soundtrack blare inappropriately and completely without context throughout?\n\nThere are a few notable moments that must be pointed out:\n\nPlease take note of the first shot of John Travolta in those stupendously ridiculous glasses. And it&apos;s only getting better\n\nTwo words: &apos;I&apos;m Single.&apos;\n\nPlease note how someone offscreen obviously CHUCKS the live cat at the pots in the kitchen! This would not be allowed these days! \n\nThough you will obviously note that &apos;ethnic diversity&apos; is being DEPLOYED in the group of angels though it doesn&apos;t seem to prevent them from making the black man a bus driver!\n\nPlease admire the architectural splendor of Olivia&apos;s hair, and her multitude of 80&apos;s fashion debacles, including the green ensemble with big gold pirate belt and turned-down suede boots (as they&apos;re walking down the street, soon before sampling the edible sunglasses). \n\nNote that John is drinking Red and Olivia is drinking White, obviously because the producers thought this would appear &apos;sophisticated.&apos;\n\nOf course there&apos;s the &apos;Twist of Fate&apos; montage, where Olivia gets to sport the appalling sunglasses. \n\nOlivia&apos;s songs here definitely lack the John Farrar touch (who had composed all of her hits heretofore) and it&apos;s obvious where the problem lies.\n\nAlas, what more can be said? Oh, I know it was only on second viewing that I noticed that John and Olivia actually DIED a third of the way through the film (because John fell on Olivia from a great height, naturally), but were brought back to life by the angels to continue the film. Now isn&apos;t it kind of sad that a film-ANY film-can be so poorly directed that the main characters can DIE and you don&apos;t even notice?\n\nNow if you don&apos;t want to watch it after reading this, I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with you.\n\n--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies at: www.cinemademerde.com"

      "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this; Cuba Gooding Jnr, Terence Howard, David Oyelowo and Bryan Cranston in the same film? Surely this would be a master work of cultural importance highlighting egregious racial slights in WWII which were - clearly - absurd? The topic laid open the opportunity for aerial combat scenes that would make Top Gun look like walk in the park given that it&apos;s nearly 30 years on and surely SFX would have improved exponentially - it&apos;s LucasFilm for crying out loud - George Lucas knows a bit about SFX, right? Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. WRONG. This was Red Tails, light. The Disney version of the story, if you will.\n\nThe acting, with the notable exceptions of Oyelowo, who tried SO hard to carry the film, Gooding Jnr &amp; Howard who given their heavy-weight were woefully under-utilised but still shone in every scene (especially Howard) but who has Terence Howard in a film and only give him about four scenes? Who!? David Oyelowo&apos;s maverick-type character &quot;Lightening&quot; was the only character with depth, but even he struggled with the ridiculously poor script and naive plot formation as the film was a staccato of - largely predictable - events. Of course the dogfights and flying scenes were key but there was so much potential that was glossed over. insubordination, alcoholism, unlikely romance, fear and righteous rage at a government scorning them because of the colour of their skin! It could have been mindblowing... it should have been edge of the seat tense but nothing about this hit the nail on the head. It missed on every point. Direction, score, script, acting etc and even the aerial combat scenes were poor. It had no passion, or realism. There were a few good aerial moves but it was without emotional response, consequence or discipline! \n\nFor telling a true story, or at least based on true events and the Tuskegee Training program, these airmen were fighting to prove wrong (!) a Government edict that stated that Black people weren&apos;t smart, coordinated, skilled, brave or loyal enough to fly a plane in battle and would chicken out, as they were gutless. What a story to take part in!! Woefully disappointing. The moments of bravery, sentient, beauty, faith and camaraderie were glossed over, not enough made of them, and it felt like it dragged; I was convinced it was a three hour film as whilst things happened, they didn&apos;t *HAPPEN.* Overall it was too ... vanilla. This film shouldn&apos;t have been a 12A. It should have been real and raw and visceral. Oh what a waste.",

That&apos;s what THE NUN did for me last night....\n\nEverything Brian Yuzna (producer) touches lately seems to just end...not conclude...it just stops with some illogical reason for all the cool shite that just took up 90 minutes of your life....\n\nCool Fx.

Meanwhile, Dorothy Dandridge plays captain Curt Jurgens&apos; mistress, featuring interracial kissing and sexuality at a time very few American films would go near the subject. Add in the complexity that Dandridge&apos;s subjugated Lucy is a far more empathetic figure than any white character, and that Tamango and his fellow captives are show to be in every way – morally, strategically as well as physically better than their white captors, and you have a film that was way ahead of it&apos;s time. \n\nThat said there is odd flat quality in the drama and less than thrilling acting and film-making that keep the actual story from living up to it&apos;s potential. But it&apos;s still pretty involving, and worth seeing at least as a part of films&apos; maturing around racial issues. \n\nInterestingly, blacklisted director John Berry, went on to direct another racially &apos;ahead of it&apos;s time&apos; film; 1974&apos;s &quot;Claudine&quot;, one of the first mainstream American films to try and intelligently deal with the struggles of poor urban African Americans without falling into exploitation, violence or cliché.",

      "reviewBody": "Short stories often make better films than full novels as is evident in the case of JD Locke&apos;s &apos;Ladies in Lavender&apos; as adapted for the screen and directed by the multi-talented Charles Dance. Given the barest outline of a quiet little idea of a &apos;fairy tale&apos;, LADIES IN LAVENDER becomes an unfolding meditation of quiet lives altered by an incident that awakens sleeping needs and emotions.\n\nUrsula (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith) are elderly sisters living a quiet life of gardening, strolling the cliffs and beach of Cornwall, knitting, and reading. Their bumpy housekeeper Dorcas (Miriam Margolyes) cooks, cleans, shops, and chatters in a wonderful Cornish brogue, allowing the sisters to live an otherwise isolated life - isolated from history, personal emotions, and vulnerabilities. After a storm Ursula spies a figure on the beach below their home and the two descend to find an unconscious handsome young man whom they rescue, house, nurture, mend a broken ankle and ultimately become doting adorers. The young man Andrea (Daniel Brühl) finally awakens, speaks no English as he is Polish, and his charming ways attract inner emotions in both sisters. Janet studies some German and is able to speak with Andreas, while Ursula pastes English words on items in his room to teach him English. He mends and it is discovered that he is a concert violinist who was shipwrecked while striving to go to America. A Russian visitor to the town, Olga (Natascha McElhone), the requisite &apos;evil witch&apos; for a fairy tale, hears Andreas play, informs him she has a cousin who is a famous violinist, and attracts him away from Cornwall to London where he ultimately gives his own concert.\n\nThose are the bare facts of the film&apos;s story. The magic lies not in the story itself but in the submerged feelings of the two sisters. Ursula, having never been in love in her youth, falls in love with Andrea, fully aware that there is no possibility of consummation. She feels long desired emotional attachment to the lad and the stirring in her breast is overwhelming to her. Janet, who once loved but lost that love to death, likewise falls for Andrea. It is this sibling rivalry over the passion for Andrea that provides some of the most touching and understated brilliant acting moments ever recorded on film. There is a scene where, resting from a stroll on the cliffs, Andrea rests with his head on Ursula&apos;s lap, perhaps the first physical contact with a man she has ever known, and the gentility of the slow and reticent placement of her hand on Andrea&apos;s resting head is a crystal of acting magic. How the sisters cope with this time with Andrea and his eventual leaving for his career is the climax of the film. And touching and understated it is.\n\nJudi Dench and Maggie Smith give pitch perfect characterizations, creating two lovely beings we will never forget. Likewise Daniel Brühl is superb in a role far different from his usual German repertoire (Goodbye Lenin!, The Edukators, Love in Thoughts) and manages to create the illusion that he is actually playing the violin (while the true artist is Joshua Bell in some stunning performances). The atmosphere of Cornwall is magically captured by Dance and his cinematographer Peter Biziou with assistance from Ed Rutherford. Nigel Hess has written a musical score, incorporating well-known classical violin works as well as his own hauntingly beautiful music that adds immeasurably to the film&apos;s success.\n\nLADIES IN LAVENDER is not a major blockbuster of a success nor does it try to be. It is simply a exquisitely crafted and acted fairy tale that gently reminds us that age does not prevent the heart from responding to that most beautiful of emotions, Love. Highly recommended.

This is good stuff and I wonder if a more realistic pirate movie has ever been made.\n\nThis was Errol Flynn&apos;s first starring role and it sure got him off to a flying start. Few actors have ever played the &quot;dashing hero&quot; as well as Flynn. Despite being almost &quot;worship idol&quot; status by women, he is still comes across as a &quot;man&apos;s man,&quot; and that all started with this film.\n\nWhat I liked best about this was that the story stood out more than the action or the romance. Many times classic films overdid the latter, producing lulls in what was considered an adventure story. That&apos;s not the case here. It also isn&apos;t the typical clichéd pirate film in which the captain is seen with an eye patch and a parrot on his shoulder. \n\nThis is nothing fancy, just a just solid story.....period, which is probably why it holds up so well over 70 years later!",

      "reviewBody": "In the future the mining planet Sirius 6B has become a war zone with two warring factions. The ground is patrolled by underground robots called Screamers who target anyone not wearing identifying marks. One side receives a plea for peace negotiations after 10 years of war and discover from a lost soldier that the war has been forgotten on earth. The two sides have been left to die on Sirius 6B while another way is started on another planet. Commander Hendricksson (Weller) sets out with the lost soldier Jefferson (Lauer) to contact the other side and declare peace. However what they find will spell the end of their war one way or another.\n\nThis is based on a Phillip K. Dick story and has all the intelligence you would expect from a sci-fi from him - this is not a gory horror movie. This is an intelligent story about the creation of the Screamers and their &quot;evolution&quot;. It also has a cynical edge lended by the way that the soldiers have been deserted by their leaders and continue to be tricked into fighting while the leaders get on with their business.\n\nWeller is excellent as the world weary commander who finds his life sold out from under him. The supporting cast are OK with their stereotyped characters but the real stars are the Screamers who start out by small things with saw-blades and gradually take other forms. The child versions of Screamers are particularly creepy and perhaps a little disturbing.\n\nHowever this is not as terrifying as it should be, nor is it as intelligent as it starts out being.  The whole issue behind the different screamers is not explained and towards the end they just keep popping up without reason! It also has one of those &quot;watch out for the sequel&quot; style endings - although in fairness it isn&apos;t quite as bad as that.  The special effects are a bit ropey but do the job - after all this is a very low budget movie.\n\nThe whole thing is not as good as it could have been but is certainly head and shoulders above a lot of low budget sci-fi thrillers."

The film maker drove a few pegs into the wall: hire some banner actors, do some (great) static shots of desert and rail cars .... the premise had so much promise here, what could have been done. Watching the film, it was obviously a rock-bottom budget attempt at milking the Tarantino theme, and the props, stage sets and so on were just pathetic. Continuity was rank, acting was wooden at best, script was just awful ..... really, the waste of talent, manpower, money and audience loyalty was tragic. I watched to the end, and kept muttering to myself; I wish - given the great pedigrees from Madsen and Carradine - that this had been done by a real script writer and a pro director. Trust me, this film is a real stinker.",

I have seen three adaptations: &quot;Faust&quot; (1926, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau), &quot;All that money can buy&quot; (1941, William Dieterle) and this one of 1950 by Rene Clair.\n\nIt is interesting to see how different directors give a different interpretation to the story, maybe under influence of their national culture. The American production of Dieterle for example is by far the most materialistic interpretation, as the title already indicates. The European interpretations are more about non materialistic values as scientific curiosity and love (with the accent changing from the former to the latter when the wish of Faust for eternal youth has been granted by the Devil). Within the European interpretations the German one of Faust is much more pessimistic then the French one of Clair.\n\nNot only the Faust character gives rise to different interpretations but also the Devil / Mephistopheles character. In &quot;Le beaute du Diable&quot; Michel Simon plays a sort of funny apprentice Devil, just like Henry Travers plays an apprentice angel in &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful life&quot; (1946, Frank Capra)",

It&apos;s like Lord of the Rings never happened at the start of the decade.\n\nEven the opening credits sequence with those bloated flying things just made me cringe.\n\nIt appears to have been written and animated by middle-schoolers, and yes they were probably high too. They had to bring in all that big-name talent to do the voices, or the handful of people who did go see this film wouldn&apos;t have even gone.\n\nHowever, I do credit the animators with at least making a handful of nice images in the film. But really, a film like this should be beautiful to look at from start to finish, not just a few brief instants.\n\nThere are not-so-subtly racist overtones, and the use of the slur &quot;pansies&quot; renders it even unfit for viewing by children, although infants are probably the only age group likely to be able to enjoy it.\n\nWatching this, I feel insulted as a viewer. It&apos;s geared towards infants, as far as I can tell. Of course, so was Toy Story, but the difference is that Toy Story is a masterpiece, and this is ... not.\n\nAnd the thing was about 30 minutes too long.\n\nIf I had been associated with this project, I would have wanted it to disappear quickly and be permanently &quot;lost&quot;. I would not be alleging that a more competent team &quot;stole&quot; it. But, these days, it seems the courts are the refuge of the incompetent, when it comes to content creation. Avatar is such a superior work that obviously required far more effort, that there is just no way that the Delgo team could ever hope to claim to have contributed to it. Rather, it seems more likely to me as a viewer that Delgo was ripped off from Avatar, and rushed out the door to beat it to market. An inside job.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to concede that this movie is a very deficient sequel to the original Pinocchio plot. As I watched it I expected better images - this is a real point of criticism here. A movie like this one, which actually features substantial magical input and imposes visual challenges for the producers ought to meet the requirements and try to live up to the premise it is built on.\n\nThus this brings down the rating significantly. I would normally be more indulgent with low budget productions, but as stated above, Pinocchio lives and dies with the transformation of visuals and the quality of the images. Some were acceptable, the majority indifferent, and some simply ludicrous and a real shame.\n\nWhat makes me award this weakly equipped movie with a solid 6 though is based on two reasons: \n\n1. The British actor Gabriel Thomson as Pinocchio. Gabriel Thomson is one of very few young actors who have natural skills and the ability to project their characters&apos; sensibility with very subtle and decent acting. I was stunned by his genuine performance and the way he is able to express so much with so little endeavor. He shines here as he does in his most notable appearance in &apos;Enemy at the Gates&apos;. He manages to vitalize Pinocchio in a way that makes the audience relate to him as a character - something that is not always the case in movies featuring a preposterous edge as &apos;Pinocchio&apos; does. Gabriel&apos;s performance is very intriguing and much better than everything else this movie has to offer.\n\n2. The story itself detached from the actual transcription. I do not know if this sequel to the well-known Pinocchio-plot has a literary artwork as a basis. Anyway, I think the idea itself of how the original story can be continued is true to the original concept and properly developed. There are some nice messages and the story proceeds at a smart pace that compensates for some of the visual flaws.\n\n&apos;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&apos; is not for everyone and it could have been done significantly better regarding its decor. However, if you are looking for a well-developed story and a brilliant Gabriel Thomson as Pinocchio, you might want to give it a try.",

      "reviewBody": "...and so will faces, slashed throats, dismembered hands, decapitated heads, backs, arms, feet, stomachs, chests... In fact, just about everything that can bleed does bleed in this movie, and does so copiously.\n\nHigh Tension, aka Switchblade Romance (much better title) is the best horror movie I&apos;ve seen come out in theaters in years. After so many times hearing &quot;this is the movie horror fans have been waiting for&quot; and then being horribly disappointed by Cabin Fever, The Ring, Malevolence, Darkness, The Grudge, and every single other one, I am throwing my full weight behind this one. Switchblade Romance is the movie real horror movie fans have been waiting for. It&apos;s a bloody, merciless, no-humor and no-holds-barred homage to the classic slasher pics of the 70s, and yet it surpasses almost every movie it draws its inspiration from. We get an unstoppable but definitely human killer, far more interesting than, say, Jason or what Michael Myers has now become because of his obviously being human and because he makes some undeniably smart decisions and operates in a continuously logical, inescapable way. The arsenal on display is impressive, as it should be in any decent slasher movie. We get the basic straight razor, the butcher knife, shotgun, axe, and, in an incredible and deliciously violent nod to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the power buzzsaw.\n\nEvery aspect of this film is in place. The plot is simple and straightforward, the acting, even dubbed, is interesting (and despite complaints of why only parts of it were dubbed, if you watch closely and pay attention to who speaks French and who is dubbed, it actually makes perfect sense and fits with the movie), the cinematography is strangely artistic, almost gialli-like, the bloodletting stylish and gruesome, the sound design incredible, the tension almost unwavering. The initial horror set piece, the arrival of the killer and the slaughter in the house, is bound to become a well-remembered and oft referenced classic scene of horror. The sheer brutality and stark reality of it ranks it up there, in my mind, with the gut wrenching finale of &quot;Odishon.&quot; A quick word on the performances. There&apos;s minimal dialogue, but what there is is at least two steps up from most horror films. Its meant to build character, whereas most slasher flick dialogue is there just to drive the plot. Here, we care about the characters, even those who don&apos;t get much of a chance to talk, because the situation is so much more real than your average flick and so is the acting. Cecile de France&apos;s physical performance is stunning, the fear on her face, the tension in every limb, the breath rate, the pain, everything, and the sheer madness that Maiwenn&apos;s character endures is perfectly conveyed by the utter despair she is able to convey even with a gag in her mouth most of the time.\n\nAn, of course, a quick word on the ending. Quit complaining! The ending of this movie is great, not only does it take an extremely well made but somewhat shallow gore pic to a whole new level with some interesting things to say about... well, I won&apos;t say on account of not spoiling it, but yes, it actually does make sense if you&apos;ve watched the movie carefully and have enough intellect to think about it on your own rather than just taking at face value what you&apos;ve seen. I halfway wonder if the twist wasn&apos;t in part a snobby French joke Aja decided to play to see if we lulled, summer blockbuster-fed Americans could figure it out and realize that everything works without being spoon-fed exactly how it works.\n\n8 / 10 - which makes it twice as good as the next best horror movie to come out in theatres in a decade. The only thing that keeps it from attaining a perfect 10 is that, although the tension is cranked up high for most of it and the scares are a thing that will haunt you more after walking out of the movie than when you&apos;re watching, the suspense does kind of flag unexpectedly in a few key places. Still, given the other 80% of the movie is extremely suspenseful and effectively brutal, this is a small flaw. If you like horror movies, GO SEE IT.",

Based on a crooks scheme story filmed with some skill, and acted pretty decently by a good cast, it soon falls in routine and looks like a useless effort. The film is too technical and never succeeds to make us care about the characters or to entangle us in the grip of the plot. Even the final twist in the story comes too late - they lost us already, and good chances are that the spectator went out of the theater, or took the DVD out of the player already. 6/10 on my personal scale. Can be avoided.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw &quot;Trop Belle Pour Toi&quot; when it was released on the art-house theatrical circuit in the U.S. 30 years ago. This film has stuck with me since that time and still feels very true to life as our culture has become even more superficial than it was in the &quot;go-go&quot; &apos;80s--particularly when it comes to definitions of beauty. The plot is simple: A rough-edged, ambitious, striving man (Gerard Depardieu at the height of his international fame) has achieved great success in the auto business, and he&apos;s acquired all the &quot;trophies&quot; that he may have desired: the cars, the house, the lifestyle, the almost too-gorgeous, elegant, younger wife. But he develops a visceral attraction to his secretary, who is dumpy, older, physically ordinary. They begin an affair, and he finds his lover warm, comforting, engaging and sexually exciting in ways that his very beautiful wife (crisply played by Carole Bouquet) is not.\n\nWhat stuck with me about this film for 30 years is the deft way the director upends the classic interpretations of what makes someone &quot;attractive,&quot; desirable or sexy, and what makes for a really exciting sexual and romantic relationship. The film hits some very true-to-real-life notes about what drives people in their most basic appetites and desires. Depardieu gives an engaging, visceral performance as a man having a classic midlife crisis: he&apos;s bored by his marriage to the perfect woman that everyone else envies, even though she&apos;s perfectly nice and intelligent. Every time I read or hear people saying that some famous man must be crazy for cheating on his beautiful wife or that he must be blissfully happy because his wife is a famous beauty, I automatically think of this film. I plan to watch it again soon.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot; is a sadly under-appreciated Bond film which is stylishly-directed and features an outstanding score, like most of these early Bond films. Other than a silly self-referential line in the teaser and some sappy romantic montages, &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot; is a thrilling adventure which sees Bond traveling to the Swiss Alps to encounter villains and partake in dangerous action sequences.\n\nIt sounds like a Bond film, alright, but this is actually quite different from the formulaic films one would later expect from the series, and the sort of film Bond was gravitating towards with &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. It certainly delivers on the promise of sexual innuendo and lots of provocatively dressed women, but it&apos;s a different sort of Bond in that it seems to be more straight-faced and harsh, culminating in what is probably the saddest Bond ending. It&apos;s also probably the closest to Fleming&apos;s version of Bond outside of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, although &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was also somewhat similar to the literary Bond. As a Fleming fan it is nice to see the Bond series take after the books. \n\nLazenby, who has been frequently criticized and is many people&apos;s least favorite Bond, actually does a decent job of the role. He&apos;s nowhere near as good as Connery, of course, but I thought that other than the scenes where he tried to seriously emote, he carried the film with his charisma and physical presence. I strongly believe he should have continued in the role. Lazenby fits the content of the film, which is certainly far more down to Earth than many other Bond films, and focuses heavily on hand-to-hand combat in the action scenes, which is somewhat refreshing after the overblown (entertaining, but seriously outrageous) action scenes in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. This is a genuinely good script, with a solid plot, good dialogue, and good characterization. \n\nIt&apos;s not just a throwaway action flick, it&apos;s an excellent espionage thriller with a strong dramatic core, and as fun as things like &quot;Goldfinger&quot; certainly are, it&apos;s nice to see one of these movies treat women as more than mere sex objects, and it&apos;s interesting to see a Bond girl paired with a Bond who reacts as a human would and not a cartoon character. Diana Rigg is probably my favorite Bond girl. She gives a strong performance and is helped by an excellent script which gives her a fair amount to do. \n\nBy staying closer to the source material, &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot; dramatically improves on its two predecessors and features some of the best locations in the series, although I admit my familiarity with the majority of the Swiss shooting locations gives me a nostalgic view of things. &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot; is a strong contender for the title of best Bond film. \n\n9/10"

Though the viewer is sometimes left to sort out obscure animations and confusing images, it is not without direction. Subsequent viewings of this film reveal substance that only a genius could imbue in his writing. Character development through such subtle action in places casts a light upon Roger Waters as a person who understands the frailty of the human mind. The main character, Pink, portrays angles of the human condition we all face at some point by embodying a victimized character: sick over the loss of his father to the war; negatively spotlighted at school for talents that are apparently unfavorable at the time; unable or just unwilling to relate to his wife; and ultimately shut off from effectively relating to others because of an inability to express himself in ways that others understand.\n\nNot only is the story captivating, but the music is such that it will always be noted as not only ahead of its time, but timeless.\n\nThe Wall is a masterpiece of storytelling, but not in the traditional sense. One must not watch this film expecting everything on a silver platter. Symbolism and metaphors abound, leaving a great deal of interpretation and adaptation to the viewer. Sit with an open mind and let Waters&apos; character help you read into yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "Engaging Walt Disney Sci-fi/fantasy in which we meet Seth (Alexander Ludwig )and Sara (Anna Rob) as they are arriving in a flying saucer that crashes at a mountain . They have special telekinetic powers which make getting along with the rest of the kids difficult . During their escape , they get a strong feeling about a Cabman (Dwayne Johnson ,The Rock) getting into a car across the street. They runs over to him and tell him that he should not get into the car. The man listens and reluctantly decides to help them . Just then out-of-control cars crash into the doors. They are pursued by evil agents (Ciaran Hinds , Tom Everett Scott) who happen to work for government looking for clairvoyant kids , hoping to put his special faculties to evil use and the children confront using their special powers . The discover their supernatural powers and effect they can have on humans . They escape their pursuers and meet up with a scientific expert on UFO ( played by Carla Gugino). She agrees to help them find a place called Witch mountain.\n\nThis mystery-fantasy is packed with noisy action , thrills, suspense and spectacular scenes with abundant computer generator effects. The two children with mysterious powers played by Alexander Ludwig and Anne Rob are enjoyable and The Rock is likable as tough and agreeable ex-convict cabbie . The picture results to be a modern remake of ¨Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)¨ and sequel ¨Return from Witch mountain (1978)¨ by John Hough but quite different , as the pursuer was a millionaire played by Ray Milland who wanted to use their powers for his own aims and in recent version is performed by Ciaran Hinds as government agent . As homage to former adaptation appears the children Kim Richards as Sara and Ike Isenmann as sheriff in a brief roles . Furthermore , the movie contains a colorful cinematography by Gardiner and moving musical score by Trevor Ravin . A good children&apos;s film with impressive special effects . The motion picture is professionally directed by Andy Fickman though with no originality because being a simple remake .",

He executed criminal figures (maybe he will be the Killer of the killers in the history of the country, we don&apos;t know yet) and caught everyone who had guns or was selling drugs. Now El Salvador is one of the most safest countries in the area. The disaster that happens in the movie shouldn&apos;t be restored. God help the people who used to suffer in the past in this beautiful country. Hope El Salvador will be center of peace and example to other countries.\n\nThe director Christian Poveda after releasing the film was shot to death probably by a member of the gang. RIP."

It is odd to see the very young Isabelle Adjani when she still had puppy fat in her face, as she does not look particularly like Isabelle Adjani at all except in the eyes at that age. It was a big mistake to cast Gerard Depardieu in the role of two characters, one a boxer who is murdered and the other the killer who murdered him for money. When the boxer&apos;s girl friend Adjani shows no sign of recognition of Depardieu the killer when they meet, we know the film is hopelessly contrived, because anybody can see that it is Depardieu. This is really stretching things too far. The film is gloomy, washed-out, laden with hopelessness, a bleak vision. Andre Techine the director shows some directorial skill, so that the film is not what one would call &apos;badly made&apos;. It is instead badly conceived and a failure. Also, it is rather affected to try to achieve some kind of mock-profundity by a &apos;study&apos; of a girl who wants to get together with the killer of her boy friend. If this is meant to have some deep existential meaning, it flops. The profundity can be measured in millimetres.",

He just wanted to see if he could do it.  \n\n Filmmaking is a personal and social process for him, not a finished product. It&apos;s an extreme version of method acting.  Like Fitzcarraldo&apos;s lifting of the boat, grand gestures go far for Herzog, if only to show the world that you&apos;re great and visionary enough to try.  Most of his characters are done in by their obsessive drive (Fitzcarraldo&apos;s boat crashing into the rapids, Aguirre madly pacing about on his raft), but leave behind something beautiful.  Like a boat being dragged up a mountain in Peru with ropes and pulleys or a gun depot going up like the 4th of July.\n\nYou can&apos;t give Herzog too much credit--he&apos;s been more careful not to be done in by his hubris than any of his characters were.  In fact, he&apos;s capitalized on it, much the same way Cappola did after Apocalypse Now or Hopper did after Easy Rider.  No doubt, the tales of his misadventures contribute as much to his films&apos; popularity as the stories and images themselves, and he&apos;s been quick to market his persona with books, talks, and films about himself, the mad director. \n\nBut still, Herzog is a great romantic that was born of a time and place (Munich, 1942) with few romantics, which is its own great feat. See Fitzcarraldo for a little bit of that.",

      "reviewBody": "The Exiles by Kent Mackenzie, USA (Documentary). A 1961 documentary chronicling a day in the life of a group of twenty-something Native Americans who left reservation life in the 1950s to live in LA.\n\nA unique and powerful film, blending storytelling with documentation. Mackenzie constructed a narrative about one day in the life of three main characters - a pregnant young woman (Yvonne), the father (Homer), and a man about town (Tommy). Both men are profound alcoholics, and the woman seems stunned by the circumstances of her life though hopeful for the future of her child.\n\nThe film opens with portraits from Edward Sheriff Curtis&apos;s monumental North American Indian, which I recommend as a starting place. Mackenzie has a sharp eye for cultural details - check out the Grand Hotel mattress in Yvonne and Homer&apos;s apartment, as well as the magazines, comics, advertisements, toys, and street scenes.\n\nThe story develops via voiceovers by Yvonne, Homer, and Tommy - and an amazing middle sequence from the rez, with generous doses of native language and music.\n\nThis is a must-see movie for anyone interested in social work, indigenous peoples, or the dark side of American culture. Never boring for any viewer."

      "reviewBody": "Carlo Collodi&apos;s book has always been a joy to read for me, although some of it is dark it has also always been an accessible read. Evidenced by me reading it from cover to cover one holiday in two days, not always the case with books even others that gripped me from the get go (namely because they were longer books and more complex). And the characters and story are timeless.\n\nDEFA distributed a number of fairy tale adaptations from East Germany, some are better than others but they do intrigue. Mainly for seeing older versions of these stories and some have some very interesting differences to the original stories. All are worth a look, if some more for curiosity and completest sake. Their version of &apos;Pinocchio&apos; from 1967 is one of their darkest (one might say &quot;grotesque&quot;) and also one of their best and perhaps most successful. Also think it is one of the better versions of &apos;Pinocchio&apos;, the most famous of which deservedly is the Disney animated film (which to me is a masterpiece), which is second only to their &apos;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&apos; in the darkness factor.\n\n&apos;Turlis Abenteuer&apos; (not sure about the significance of the title), DEFA&apos;s version of &apos;Pinocchio&apos; is more faithful to the book, with more of the book&apos;s details and more faithful characterisation, and perhaps darker. Though the more gorier aspects aren&apos;t intact, understandably, the biting of a cat&apos;s paw is not exactly the most comfortable of images when trying to attract younger audiences. There is an awful lot to like here in this &apos;Pinocchio&apos; and very little to dislike.\n\nOccasionally the acting is a touch too theatrical, like with Stromboli (difficult not to play broadly).\n\nHowever, this &apos;Pinocchio&apos; looks great. Very beautifully and atmospherically shot and a lot of care and effort clearly went into the sets, that were so meticulous in detail. Especially good in this regard though, and actually surprisingly so, was the puppetry, some may find it creepy but not me. Actually admired the attention to detail and was amazed at the sometimes complex movement, wide range of body gestures and especially the wide range of expressions for Pinocchio, all of which required enormous technical skill and done better than a lot of puppetry in later films. The editing also helps quite a bit.\n\nIt would have been a tall order having music on the same level as that for the Disney film. To keep the comparison brief for fairness, it&apos;s not as instantly hummable or stays in the mind as long, but it regardless always fits and adds a lot to the atmosphere. It appeals to the ears too. The script doesn&apos;t become too camp, is lively and it feels natural and the story doesn&apos;t come over as traumatising or sugary, moving along nicely without feeling padded (a good thing as although &apos;Pinocchio&apos; is not a massive story it is not a slight one either).\n\nDirection does a great job in the technical front and also in the varied character interaction. Mostly the acting is deserving of credit, reacting just to a puppet is not easy at all but they don&apos;t come over as taxed. It is especially difficult for Geopetto, the fox and the cat, the ones with the most interaction in a way, who give the three best performances after the titular character. The fairy is suitably sincere too and Pinocchio himself is remarkably well characterised on all counts.\n\nSummarising, extremely well done. 9/10",

As a 14 or 15 year old (I&apos;m 38 now) flicking through the TV channels one Summer&apos;s day during the school holidays I was transfixed as beautiful and &apos;otherworldly&apos; images of crystal clear blue sea, surf, dolphins and crashing waves were wed to a perfect soundscape of Pink Floyd&apos;s &apos;Echoes&apos;.\n\nIf you are already a fan of Gilmour &amp; Co then you must see the &apos;Echoes&apos; section of this piece in a darkened room with your home-cinema system cranked up to really appreciate the perfect fusion of Pink Floyd&apos;s unique sound and Greenough&apos;s visuals.\n\nIf you are not a fan, try the above and you will be.",

Along the way they are attacked by a variety of villains.\n\nThis Taiwanese martial arts film is full to the brim with fighting. It&apos;s almost relentless in actual fact. But you can&apos;t criticise a film for trying to entertain. Aside from the typical combat and amazing leaping about, there are unusual scenes involving a man fighting off a horde of opponents while wearing very high stilts and on another occasion he has to push his barrow of gold over a tight-rope. It&apos;s these more distinctive moments that stand out mostly in this one, otherwise it&apos;s mainly a fight-fest. The two main actors seemed pretty adept to me and this has to be considered an entertaining enough old school martial arts flick.",

No expense was spared and the melodramatic manqué was given deluxe treatment by novelist/director Mario Soldati, who crafted an eerie, poetic propaganda-free example of Fascist-era entertainment at its best. Reminiscent of a Victorian-esque romance &amp; revenge &quot;penny dreadful&quot;, the phantasmic tale, although well-told, is a dark dream of near-operatic proportions that seems better suited to shadowplay. There&apos;s no denying this macabre melodrama with its rococo trappings harks back to silent cinema (where images were everything) but the gloomy Gothic style and tangible aura of unhappiness that hangs over everything is mesmerizing no matter the medium. Beautiful blonde Isa Miranda is equally compelling -all fire and ice- and her period costumes and long flowing curls show her mask-like beauty off to its best advantage.",

Despite the virtual reality in the game, I did not feel the meaning of the two words 3D, let alone Guo Caijie. Strange appearance.

I enjoyed this because it was educational and related the story of how one of Britain&apos;s stalwart retail chains came into being. It wasn&apos;t just an early attempt to make us all customers, but the beginning of an attempt at greater social equality. Apart from two well-known faces, I didn&apos;t recognise any of the actors, so I&apos;d guess they were amateurs. Ditto the production staff, too. \n\nSo don&apos;t approach this film expecting Hollywood standards; walk away if that&apos;s all you want. If you want to see a film about working folk pulling together against the naysayers, put together by non-professionals battling similarly, you&apos;ve come to the right place. You get a sense of what this meant to the factory workers of mid 19th century Rochdale, and what they believed and gave up for a chance to attain it. \n\nIgnore the low score and give it a chance if you get the chance. Thanks Film on Four for my chance.",

However one of the best German actor/producer Til Schweigert was the coproducer, I think this movie could be much more professional and deep. More tricks with the camera, and less humor. Just like an exam-piece of one of the highschools for directing scenes. Just an example:in the scenes and the house of the mother and the beach was a bit too much modern, and didnt fit into the picture how director described other part of Russia...But still very much liked it and recommend\n\n8/10"

Perelman&apos;s direction captures the dreamy lyricism contrasting with a sometimes brutal realism that is also found in Kasischke&apos;s beautiful and poetic 2002 novel. There won&apos;t be many better, genuinely adult movies this year, and most likely it will be ignored.",

      "reviewBody": "I had forgotten what it is to inhabit the frame, that is to be immersed not only in the world these characters experience but in the sensations made available in it. To feel a draught of air or the scorching heat.\n\nPeter Weir here in his best period reminds me again. His fascination in this period with the otherworldly is firstly Australian, that of a man awed by the mysteries of an alien, ancient landscape that trumps comprehension, outlasts our follies and dreams, then foremostly mystical, implying a communion with worlds beyond. \n\nIn this world answers are denied us, and we can only hear vague echoes of the questions we have asked. This is Picnic at Hanging Rock as well as The Last Wave and The Year of Living Dangerously, the tingle of excitement and fear before this enormous complexity to which we are only small and transient. The Hanging Rock here becomes Jakarta.\n\nThese visions of Jakarta, a veritable jungle of humanity teeming with passions and cruelties, he presents from a point of view that communicates alienation and fear. When our white characters venture out into the crowded slums, human misery reaches out at them with filthy gaunt arms. All this he doesn&apos;t merely document for the sake of political discourse, he stylizes as an experience meant to stir things in the soul. This also outlines Weir&apos;s limitations; that these visions are perhaps too tawdry, the savages noble and the gnomes magical.\n\nAll this in mind, the film is best experienced for me as a spiritual journey. But towards what? \n\nA dwarf is our guide through this, an ominpresent being that seems to create the story we are watching, an avatar of the filmmaker&apos;s consciousness. He narrates our hero&apos;s arrival, then makes him see his limits by offering him his folly, the desire for an exclusive story. In a poignant scene early in the film, holding shadow puppets before a canvas screen, he reveals to him a fundamental tenet of Buddhist thought. How desire clouds the soul so that reality itself becomes concave.\n\nThis is not always perfect of course, Peter Weir is no Antonioni after all. Our hero eventually gives up the big scoop to pursue love, but this is accomplished through violence perpetrated to him rather than a personal realization that comes from having experienced the folly of the mind (which Antonioni brilliantly dismantles for us in Blowup). Lying halfdead on a filthy bed somewhere in Jakarta, he remembers the wise words of how desire blinds the soul, but is none the wiser.\n\nHe doesn&apos;t willingly give up anything, which is to say even if his precious tape recorder (the tool by which he records the world, seeking &quot;truth&quot;) is snatched from him in the airport at the last moment, he has essentially lost nothing that he doesn&apos;t carry inside of him.\n\nPerhaps this is the film&apos;s apogee then, that faced with a chaos and violence which outlasts them and reveals them to be small and diminutive, mere specs of sand in the cosmic beach, the characters of the film stubbornly remain the same, having brushed off that encounter only as an exciting, dangerous escapade into the dark side. \n\nThe weather reflects that chaos in Weir&apos;s films, acting as an agent of transience whereby the world is shown to be in constant flux and motion. But the characters are phazed little by this, anxious to pursue their desires and enact their little charades of meaning. When a tropic downpour suddenly rains down on them, they laugh and play in it.\n\nBut if Weir&apos;s fascination with the mystical is entirely white Australian, his cinema is elemental, Aboriginal. Here is the communion made possible.\n\nThe fact that he unerringly insists to submerge his characters in these impenetrable worlds that defy understanding, where the sole reward is a moment&apos;s glimpse of the soul in spiritual hazard, means that the glimpse is reward enough because for that moment the apparent reality is peeled back to afford us a gaze into a yawning universe beyond. This yearning for the mechanisms of the universe to be made apparent is in itself the primal, ultimate urge of these films. The Last Wave takes us on the brink and gives us a vision of apocalypse (a revelation), this one stops just short of that."

      "reviewBody": "Alf Collins was a London stage comic who transferred to the fledgling movie industry as a director, and became an expert in chases. Here&apos;s an early example as a young couple elopes in an automobile and her papa gives chase in his. I&apos;m very hesitant to accept claims of cinematic firsts, but this came off the Library of Congress site, where it was claimed &quot;it may be the first car chase in the movies.&quot; I can&apos;t think of any earlier off hand and await others to write in, challenging that modest claim, excluding races. Any earlier auto chases will be appended to the bottom of this review.\n\nIt&apos;s a beautifully shot film for 1903, with an extreme close-up, trucking shots and panning shots -- including a couple of pans that move so rapidly that they would qualify as whip pans. In the hands of a later, more subjective director like Louis Feuillade, they might offer a subjective, auctorial point of view. Here, it just seems like a fast way of getting from one plot point to another.",

However, I bought it because I wanted something new for my 6 year old, and I really like Vince Vaughn. Many people I talked to didn&apos;t like Fred Claus because Vince Vaughn is &quot;the same as he is in every movie.&quot; I happen to love that. The rest of the cast was A+ and gave perfect performances. I LOVED THIS MOVIE and would recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas! There were so many funny parts as well as heart warming sweet moments that this movie was one that my 6 year old son and I could enjoy together. I&apos;m glad I skipped renting and just bought this movie as it will be one I look forward to every year.",

The high points (or low points, depending on your point of view) are the Muzak version of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and when the ex-Sub Pop employee made up &quot;grunge&quot; terms that The New York Times printed as gospel.  I wish this had acknowledged earlier Seattle musicians like Hendrix and Heart, and tried to answer whether the Nirvana-Pearl Jam feud was real or just part of the hype, but otherwise, this is an important cautionary tale, and it&apos;s also fun and informative.  Oh yeah, and the music is great too.",

      "reviewBody": "Renée Soutendijk was a very popular actress in The Netherlands and Belgium, where I grew up during the 80s and early 90s, and a beloved sex-symbol thanks to her roles in local cult-classics like &quot;Spetters&quot; and &quot;De Vierde Man&quot;. At the end of the 80s, she aspired an international career, but it was over very quickly, and I still don&apos;t fully understand why, because the few movies she made in the US were interesting; like this &quot;Grave Secrets&quot; and the Sci-Fi thriller &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. She&apos;s a good actress, and her English is almost completely accent-free, which can&apos;t be said from most Dutch performers trying their luck in Hollywood.\n\nThat being said, &quot;Grave Secrets&quot; is a sorely lacking and disappointing horror. Especially for being produced in the late 80s, the film doesn&apos;t nearly deliver enough in the gore and sleaze department, and this despite numerous shocking &amp; controversial themes in the plot (incest, rape, baby murder, ...). The main and obvious problem is that all the good stuff is saved up until the final 10-15 minutes. The first 70 minutes are far too dull, vague, and bloodless. The most exhilarating thing happening for a long time is a ghostly force throwing a raw egg in the face of paranormal investigator Paul Le Mat, go figure! The climax is fun, with a glorious over-the-top role for stunt man Bob Herron, but it comes too little too late to fix everything.",

I had to apologize for how lame it was. No suspense. Nothing scary. Boring. The trailer and movie cover will kick your ass. Go no further though. it is a waste of your time. maybe someday it will be a famous cult film of some the the worst, famous cult films ever made. Either that or just watch it cause that &apos;Twisted Sister&apos; guy is in it and you&apos;re curious."

Mix in a cop-scenario, interesting &quot;girls&quot;, some action plus a small spoon of mystery/esoteric dust - and voilà you have a flick good enough for the video stores shelf for a rainy Saturday night.\n\nI loved to see Patsy Kensit, and especially Denise Crosby. They tried best to be into the characters. Unfortunately, later you can see &quot;trough&quot; the plot somehow by the way the characters try to overact some of the less &quot;believable&quot; plot twists. That&apos;s more the problem of the script, which lefts lots questions open at the end.\n\nThe director seemed not to know which way to spin the story, so it wiggles drunken between psychology, cop-story and a little x-files. I also think there is too much repetition of the always the same (light) nudity scenes to fill the movie length up. I was saddened by the way they handled the showdown - there was MUCH more into this.\n\nAs a fan of movies in that time period, I can still give em a 5/10 on it, because they tried. But times have changed. I would only watch it on free TV if you are an fan of Patsy or Denise.",

That does not sound great for the Box Office...\n\nAnd the movie: Let&apos;s say it&apos;s entertaining. For Sure. But that&apos;s all! Vincent Perez (Fanfan) is too annoying playing the naive guy. Penelope Cruz.. annoying speaking french with such an accent &quot;Fangfang&quot; Hopefully the supporting actors are great! Didier Bourdon is a Wonderfull Roi Soleil... and the actor who plays &quot;de la Goule&quot; is WON-DER-FULL!!\n\nSo in fact: let&apos;s say: 1* on 4 If you have 8 euros in your pocket for nothing..otherwise..wait to see it on TV."

The moment the opening credits came on with that wonderful music playing, I knew I would love this film. Although I didn&apos;t meet anybody in New Orleans who talked like Dennis Quaid did in this movie, and his portrayal of Rennie McSwain came off as something of a caricature, I still found him extremely enjoyable to watch and as a leading man, he was as sexy as a romantic hero can be. Ellen Barkin was great as the leading lady. The suspense part of the plot was perhaps the weakest part, but the romantic storyline was perfect. The music was so great, it made everything work. Yes, the movie makers made some mistakes with their geography, but that was completely forgivable, as the overall film was such a delight to watch. And few movies nowadays have such a great soundtrack as this movie has. A true delight, this will be a timeless classic."

      "reviewBody": "I attended the World Premiere of &quot;Whip It&quot; at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is quite an impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore (who also stars).\n\nBarrymore works with a Shauna Cross script (based on her own novel Derby Girl) and an all-star cast featuring Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Daniel Stern, Kristen Wiig, Landon Pigg, Jimmy Fallon, Eve, and Juliette Lewis.\n\nPage is Bliss Cavendar, whose mother (Harden) sees her daughter in gowns and crowns as she continues the family tradition of winning beauty pageant trophies. But Bliss&apos; chance encounter with a group of roller skating girls plants other ideas in her head. Austin, Texas happens to host a roller derby league, it&apos;s not too far away, and Bliss finally sees a way out of her town (and gown). This sets up a family confrontation that is the stuff of classic coming-of-age stories.\n\nThe film starts out slow then whips into action, its brilliant ensemble cast hitting its stride and functioning like a winning roller derby team (without the bruises). Then just when you think &quot;Whip It&quot; is headed into sports rom-com cliché territory, surprising twists keep it original and refreshing. But despite the multitude of talented actors, Page clearly carries the film on her diminutive shoulders and is easily in control of the material.\n\nProduction values are naturally first rate, with a vivid color palette and in-your-face costumes that are occasionally (and appropriately) over the top. Cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman and editor Dylan Tichenor work perfectly in sync by reflecting both the snail&apos;s pace of Bliss&apos; home life vs. the secret one that flies on wheels around the Austin track. Camera-work places the viewer directly into the action. Despite having been filmed primarily in Michigan (due to favorable tax credits) the Austin scenes are prominent, placing its landmarks in a warm, affectionate light. One benefit of a big budget is the ability to purchase music rights, and the result is a killer soundtrack that will have the audience singing along. Be sure to stay for the second of the two closing credits songs, the best ever cover of one of the greatest rock &apos;n roll love songs of all time, The Association&apos;s &quot;Never My Love.&quot; Fox Searchlight scores again with Ellen Page, just like they did in 2007 with &quot;Juno.&quot; Unlike that (at the time) dark horse, this is no little indie. This is classic Hollywood comedy. &quot;Whip It&quot; is another crowd pleaser to add to this year&apos;s must-see list.",

It goes wrong in just about every area you can think of. It&apos;s a really cheap affair, from cinematography that at times resembles camcorder footage to tacky CGI effects. The tone of the movie is really slow and downright boring at times - it takes a little more than half of the movie before the characters find they are in serious trouble. But probably the worst thing about the movie are the characters. Except for the law enforcement officers, ALL the character in the movie act incredibly stupid and annoying. I simply didn&apos;t care whether they would live or die. Well, actually I DID want them all to die since they were very unpleasant. There is some welcome nudity, but there isn&apos;t a terrible amount, and what is displayed isn&apos;t exactly spectacular. Thank goodness there wasn&apos;t a part four."

      "reviewBody": "After seeing this film, I wanted to rush to read the Charlotte Armstrong novel The Chocolate Cobweb, not because I was wowed by the source material but rather to try and fathom what on earth she was trying for. Perhaps the fault can be blamed on the adaptation by Caroline Eliacheff and director Claude Chabrol. It&apos;s hard to know but what is certain is that this treatment poses more questions than it answers. Mysteries can be fun without having all the motivations explained, since human behaviour is often inexplicable, but here I found I had the same response as in Chabrol&apos;s La Ceremonie when Jacqueline Bisset&apos;s family are blown away - shock and disbelief. The plot contrivance that leads Anna Mouglalis to the house of Isabelle Huppert and Jacques Dutronc is as tenuous as a spider&apos;s web. One hears it and thinks, this can&apos;t be all there is?! And whilst Huppert supplies some intriguing duplicitious body language - note the movement of her legs as subtext in the scene where she visits Mouglalis&apos; mother - there is more suggested than actually revealed. It also reminded me of the non-end to Chabrol&apos;s L&apos;Enfer, where he dared not provide a conclusion to the unfinished screenplay by Henri-Georges Clouzot. Chabrol&apos;s camera occasionally pans past Huppert to make observations, and the edit from a photo of Dutronc&apos;s first wife whom Mouglalis resembles (the actress plays her in flashback) to Mouglalis listening to music, her hands covering her face in the identical pose, is amusing. But the climactic revelation at the end has no weight, as arbitrary as Huppert&apos;s movement from sitting enveloped by her web-patterned lacework, to a long one take closeup where she cries, to folding into a foetal position. The titular chocolate is a red herring, but I was more disappointed that the implication of incest with her son had no basis. Perhaps one&apos;s inclination to project onto the narrative is an indication of it&apos;s lack of focus. Mouglalis conveys a strong screen presence, and perhaps because Huppert and Chabrol have worked together to great effect before, one&apos;s expectations of her contribution in his films is high. But I can&apos;t feel I can criticise Huppert. She seems keyed to do something that the screenplay never brings to fruition. Hoping that a second viewing will make the filmmakers objectives clearer is never a good sign."

She&apos;s so beautiful and delicate so it was very interesting see her play this role. The chemistry between her and Eric Balfour was hot and naughty, but also romantic. It seems to me that she really had to let her guard down to play this role and I thought she was superb. Also, I no longer see Eric Balfour as Milo from 24 anymore, he has a nice body and booty. I recommend this film for just about anyone who is tired of the same old boring and predictable love scenes. This move is far from the norm in the department.",

The romantic angle is just an arbitrarily (in fact, awkwardly) placed distraction that sticks out like a sore thumb (hint: Drew Barrymore&apos;s character is good for only around 20-30 minutes of this 2-hour movie).\n\nHuck Cheever (Eric Bana) is a regular high-stakes poker player in Las Vegas whose skills in reading body languages of his opponents is hampered by his rashness. Constantly in the shadow of his estranged father L.C. (Robert Duvall), a two-time World Series of Poker champion who never fails to rub in his son&apos;s weakness, Huck falls for Billie (Barrymore) - a Vegas newbie who&apos;s just got a job singing in a bar. Problem is, Billie&apos;s cynicism-free personality clashes with Huck&apos;s callous opportunistic character. \n\nAnd it goes without saying that as cards are dealt and the stakes are raised, there will be some fixings to occur among Huck and the two people around him.\n\nStrangely, after being in projects with involving narratives, director Curtis Hanson and co-writer Eric Roth fail to draw any meaningful yarn with the characters. In fact, &quot;Lucky You&quot; works better when it sets its focus on the poker table, and not trying to deal with any of tepid characterizations. But such ambivalence ultimately leads to a hollow feeling.\n\nFor those who enjoy watching poker, it might be a worthy deal (at least the final act). But for anyone else, considering the people involved in this project, it leaves the feeling of an empty hand.",

Boy, was I wrong, Mobsters sure did not disappoint me and I think I&apos;ve seen just about every mafia/mob movie ever made in the last 50 years. I&apos;m not saying this goes up there with Goodfellas and The Godfathers, etc, but it definitely deserves some credit. The acting for the most part is very well-done. There is some good action with a fair amount of bloodshed, great set designs, and a good cast. I&apos;m not sure exactly how historically accurate this movie is, but nevertheless, it pulls through to bring an overall excellent mob flick."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;eXistenZ&apos; sorts out the men from the boys. That is, your reaction to this marvellous movie will depend whether you are S.F. literate and familiar with Cronenberg&apos;s oeuvre, or a &apos;Matrix&apos;-loving, Johnny-come-lately. Now I enjoy &apos;The Matrix&apos; as a superior action movie, but no movie in recent years has been so overrated, and grossly exaggerated as intellectual fare! &apos;eXistenZ&apos; and Alex Proyas&apos; similarly overlooked &apos;Dark City&apos; are everything &apos;The Matrix&apos; claims to be - intelligent, thought provoking, CHALLENGING S.F.\n\n This movie is almost a summary of all the themes and motifs that Cronenberg has been obsessed about for the last 25 years or so. Especially the Burroughsian &quot;biological horror&quot; and the Phildickian questioning of reality. While it echoes many of his previous movies, it especially evokes his masterpiece &apos;Videodrome&apos;. It may not reach the hallucinogenic heights of that movie - very few have - but it certainly takes you to places most contemporary S.F. and horror movies don&apos;t even try to reach.\n\nHowever this movie isn&apos;t just Cronenberg rehashing his &quot;greatest hits&quot;. There are more than enough new and interesting touches, especially the Rushdie-like Fatwah theme, the odd sexual symbolism, and the witty touches such as the bone guns that fire teeth. Helping all this along is the interesting, carefully chosen cast. All are good, but I especially like Willem Dafoe&apos;s creepy garage mechanic, and it was also great to see Canadian cult star Don McKellar (&apos;Highway 61&apos;, &apos;Twitch City&apos;,etc) as the enigmatic &quot;Russian&quot; Yevgeny.\n\n&apos;Videodrome&apos; has taken many years to find its real audience, and maybe &apos;eXistenz&apos; will too. But I believe eventually it will be recognised for what it is - a work of great imagination and flair."

I just tried to submit this review and I received an error message that it has to be 10 lines of text. No sex scenes, no intelligent dialog and a lot of bad acting. Definitely a B movie. I have to admit that the guns/rifles that they used looked cool. The bad guy in the movie that was referred to in the previous post was probably the best actor.

      "reviewBody": "As someone who had read the Bible and knows what goes where, I am easily critical of too-Liberal Biblical movies, which is usually the case....except for the last 40-some years when hardly any films were made on this subject at all.\n\nMy point is that this film gets toasted a lot, even by Christians, and I think unfairly. Yes, I became a bit annoyed the first few viewings when I would hear Jesus&apos; speeches way out of order, or a few other things that really weren&apos;t 100 percent on the mark....or it just simply dragged.\n\nHowever, after a long absence and my first look at this on the ultra widescreen (2.75:1) DVD, I was impressed. For instance, the scene with the Last Supper shows everyone at the table, which is impossible to do in a formatted-to-TV mode. There are other similar panoramic shots that are very impressive. gave me a new appreciate of the work director George Stevens did here. Of course, he was one of the best in his profession so it&apos;s no surprise this is nicely filmed.\n\nUpon that recent viewing, I was please that none of Jesus&apos; quotes are inaccurate and I have never had a problem with Max Von Sydow&apos;s portrayal of Christ. He had a penetrating eyes and spoke his lines with authority. Why he, too, gets bashed by a few people is unfair. He was just fine.\n\nIt&apos;s a sanitized message, nothing that &quot;preachy&quot; to turn off the unchurched, but I do think it was a bit too slow to go three hours and 20 minutes. In this case, lopping off 15-30 minutes might have helped. It&apos;s still worth viewing, no matter what your &quot;religious&quot; views.",

A 70&apos;s feeling in the Paris suburbs, tons of gags, a reflection about consumerism and four awkward guys who are out to proof that they got nothing to proof, &quot;Le Grand Bazar&quot; is a masterpiece of the genre. I got to watch it about 200 times at least with my young brother, and never got enough of it, because this is so funny, because it shows a nice picture of France during the early 70&apos;s, and because of the awesome performances of some of the most talented actors within the comedy genre at the time; Michel Galabru as a frustrated bartender, Jacques Seiler as dumb security guy, and of course the four Charlots as a young and naive crew trying to do what they can do to keep what they took for granted for so many years... An awesome movie, the Charlots at their BEST !!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Despite receiving top billing, I wouldn&apos;t call this a Dudikoff movie. It&apos;s Mark Hamill&apos;s movie all the way, as the former Luke Skywalker chews the scenery and steals the entire film. In a role that again demonstrates Hamill&apos;s versatile talent, he plays a mental patient who has escaped from his hospital to visit his doctor, Robert Mitchum in a small supporting role towards the end of the film. After an argument, Dudikoff&apos;s wife leaves him and goes to see her sister, picking up hitchhiking Hamill along the way. Dudikoff borrows his friend&apos;s car and sets out to find her, unaware of the danger she will soon be in. As much as I like to see Hamill play good guys, he always makes a delightful bad guy, and his role here is one of his best psychotic characters. Even when he&apos;s playing nice there&apos;s an underlining sense of uncertainly. The wife finds out Hamill is a psycho when he kills a hotel clerk and fashions a necklace out of her fake eye, dangling it from his finger and asking if she likes it. Dudikoff soon catches up, but learning he&apos;s a cop, Hamill forces the wife to hightail it, setting off a dangerous game of pursuit. Dudikoff thinks his wife is trying to get away with another man, and the entire time, always ends up one step behind. At one point he loses his car, forcing him to steal another from a car carrier truck as it speeds down the highway. (A great scene, by the way).\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of action: car chases, explosions, car chases, explosions, and one tense scene in which Hamill straps Dudikoff to the hood of a taxi cab and proceeds to slam repeatedly into the rear of a gas tanker (the driver of which must be completely unable to feel the hits his vehicle is taking). The climax at a hospital is pretty good as well, with a tense final encounter between Dudikoff and Hamill on the roof of the building. The gritty cinematography helps give the film a horror movie-like tone. I just wish we had known a bit more about Dudikoff and his wife. All we know is that he and a friend helped get her out of Russia, though how we are never told. But that little unknown plot point aside, MIDNIGHT RIDE is effective as a creepy little road movie, and fans of those should enjoy it. It would make a terrific Saturday triple-bill with DUEL and THE NATURE OF THE BEAST."

The movie follows 5 guys who travel from brewery to brewery in a 40 day binge of good drinking and good living. The highlights were definitely the smallest guys - McNeill&apos;s brewery in Vermont, Climax Brewing in New Jersey, Hale&apos;s in Seattle, but it was nice to see some of the old guard of craft beer - Fritz Maytag of Anchor, also Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn, Yuengling. Needless to say, I rushed out to a bar immediately and downed a cold one. Cheers to good beer.",

      "name": "one of those cases where the acting and direction (most of the time) is better than the script",
      "reviewBody": "Spike Lee&apos;s films are consistent in one respect, even for the lesser ones, which is that they&apos;re always pressing buttons. In the case of Jungle Fever, it&apos;s another work where messages come out more than from a guy on a postal route. But that&apos;s perhaps part of the point, where such points come in many forms and sometimes like a barrage. This time, it doesn&apos;t completely gel as well as Lee&apos;s Do the Right Thing, which also held anger, contemplation, humor, and pathos about city life. But this time it&apos;s also a tale of sexual morays, where both white and black sides have their share of racism and prejudices, and at the core is a story of outcasts. The interesting thing then about Jungle Fever is how Lee&apos;s own decisions in casting and in the unique way he shoots his subjects and implements a subjective take more often then not trump what comes out in his script. Then again, maybe it&apos;s close to being inevitable with how the elements mix, and at the end there are some parts of the film that are the best that Lee&apos;s done so far as a filmmaker.\n\nWesley Snipes and Anabella Sciora star as the said &apos;jungle fever&apos; couple, the man being married with a kid, of all things to a woman who is also light-skinned and with her own &apos;issues&apos;, and the woman having an &apos;old-fashioned&apos; Italian father. When their affair becomes known to both sides, the costs come out and they both become outcasts. And at the end of all of the points that are made in Jungle Fever by Lee, even through the ones that are pounded and (of the period) quite topical and prominent, this notion of society and culture being the biggest culprit is hard to ignore. This main point is made very well by Lee&apos;s script, and even as sometimes the script doesn&apos;t have the best dialog or lines a little &apos;too easy&apos;, if that makes any sense, there are many scenes which do support this to the fullest. And as the job of any good director is to cast right, this film is filled with a who&apos;s-who&apos;s of professionals and character actors.\n\nOne could go on as to who appears in the film, from Anthony Quinn to Tim Robbins to Ossie Davis to John Turturro, and they all fit their parts and contribute to adding a level of fascination in each. When the less desirable aspects peak in even more, it only adds to what ends up working on screen. Sometimes the script, as mentioned, is a little derivative and trying to touch ALL bases, with a but the film is more often than not alive due to (some of) the music at times. Maybe the most genius pieces of casting were Samuel L. Jackson, in (arguably) one of his very best performances, and Halle Berry. In a sense there are similar points made in the &quot;A&quot; storyline and the &quot;B&quot; one, where there is some extra interest in the supporting characters and their connection with the main ones. Jackson and Berry are crack-heads, and outcasts, and to their own degree have the same crap end of the stick as the leads to. Among many scenes where confrontations reach a great emotional intensity, the best comes with Snipes going into the crack-house and seeing just the purest dark side of society, what really does bring people down.\n\nIn the end, Jungle Fever is one of the Lee movies that is worth seeing, that may prove on a repeat viewing to bring even more thought than previous. It&apos;s energetic, somber, occasionally funny and shocking in equal measure.",

In &quot;Black: Man From The Darkness&quot;, which follows the stupendous success of his Onam release &quot;Kazhcha&quot; featuring him as a village simpleton forced to accept the insensitive and inhuman ways of the corrupt system, he does not disappoint. In this Ranjith movie he is the ultimate of what a superhero should be: a man with steel body and iron fist who at the end does a vigilante act to clean up the muck of goondaism littering the urban landscape.",

It&apos;s also possible that there&apos;s a better copy on the site...so you might want to look around first to see if another is there as well.\n\nWhen the film begins, evil Robert Fuller (of &quot;Emergency&quot; fame) is holding some women hostage. Soon, in smashes Cotton...saving the day. Interestingly, Fuller is dubbed her by someone other than himself...which is odd considering it is in English.\n\nSoon Agent Cotton is investigating a strange murder in which a wife and her small child are brutally and methodically killed...as if by an assassin. Later, more similar deaths occur and there is no obvious link between them and the killers are not the same person. It seems as if some sort of murder for hire scheme is taking place. Oddly, the trail soon leads to an evil psychiatrist who apparently convinces very sick people that they have a compulsion to kill for him! Nice guy, huh? So how is Cotton going to catch him and put an end to all this nastiness?\n\nThis is yet another Cotton film. I&apos;ve seen three so far and they all are exciting light-weight fun...and are worth seeing. George Nader is excellent in the lead and the films are a bit like smaller- scale James Bond films with less gadgets and domestic criminals instead of Spectre-like baddies. Worth your time.",

The film is the oldest surviving work in French literature, which testify to its enormous and enduring popularity from the 12th to 16th centuries. Widely unseen, it lacks Kinski&apos;s usual genre horror sexploitation gimmicks that lead to cult fandom and distribution. Instead it is one of his rare non-Herzog art films, and brings an intriguing folkish meta cinema narrative where Kinski plays two characters, the storyteller and the knight. Kinski was a committed, disciplined artist to his craft. A mad man could not perform a hundred films and complete each character. I found The Song of Roland an incredible effort with an alien feeling that called to mind Fellini Satyricon and the best works of Pasolini."

      "reviewBody": "Written on August 30th, upon my first viewing: I&apos;m not saying that I love it, though. It&apos;s infinitely more watchable than the other two Buñuel &quot;masterpieces&quot; that I&apos;ve seen, the execrably boring The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie and the somewhat lame Belle de Jour. I have been told time and time again to go back to his early stuff, that I&apos;d be much more likely to enjoy those films. And those who pushed me were right. Of course, when I sat down to watch it, I didn&apos;t have the highest hopes. Immediately, I began to nitpick. &quot;What is that supposed to mean?!?!&quot; &quot;What the heck is going on!?!?&quot; My favorite three letters became, throughout the first half hour of this film, WT&amp;F. But, as much as its narrative (or anti-narrative) was annoying me, its technical aspects were very much delighting me. The cinematography is quite good, the editing is fabulous and unique, and the use of sound is simply fantastic. Eventually, I just decided that the narrative wasn&apos;t supposed to make much sense and that Buñuel&apos;s purpose was anything but a storyteller. He was after the absurdist image and the absurdist mood. After that, I had a lot more fun and enjoyed it quite a bit. All good film watchers have to eventually train themselves away from depending on narrative. I&apos;d still not call it a masterpiece, or even a great film, but it was very interesting and quite entertaining. I give it an 8/10. However, I do plan to rewatch it, since it is short and I do have it for another four days. Perhaps, now that I can watch it entirely prepared from the very beginning, I will raise that score.\n\nUpon watching it the next day: Nope, sorry.

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say much for the storyline of 3 Godfathers as much as I can say for its visuals and imagery. For many, it is an allegorical tale with its heavy use of the Bible and other symbols throughout. However, I had a problem with the realism of the story, something this kind of plot needs to rely heavily on. Here we have three rough and tough men, by no means weak or unable to take care of themselves. Still, what they go through in this film along with trying to take care of a newly born infant, it boggles my mind as to how it is possible and perhaps it isn&apos;t.\n\nI think I am reading too much into this and am missing the point John Ford was trying to make. So, I will try to understand the movie in its simplest terms. That would be that Ford was a master of imagery and using it to further the story. Here, every shot of the desert and swirling winds captures perfectly the atmosphere and mood, making the audience feel as if they are in the desert. It is most effective and does pick up some of the slack such as when the three men are first taking care of the infant or the final ten minutes in deciding Wayne&apos;s fate. All in all, this is not one of the great Ford Westerns. But, it shows once again his ability to control the mood and tone of his films and that can go a long way in providing leverage to an audience.",

The original film was over nine hours long and was trimmed down to just over two and a half hours. Director Erich von Stroheim condemned the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for slashing his film. Continuity and subplots were torn from the masterpiece. Turner later tried to restore the film with publicity stills and new dialogue cards. This helped the film regain continuity and bring to light some of the subplots in the film. Turners new version is four hours and is splendidly done.\n\nThe film is about a miner named John McTeague who becomes a dentist through an apprenticeship. He soon opens his own business and meets a woman already involved with his friend Marcus. Marcus agrees to step aside since McTeague is obviously in love with the woman. After the woman named Trina wins $5000 in a lottery the story really takes off in what can only be described as a serious case of &quot;Greed.&quot; I can tell no more without spoiling the film, but if you can stomach silent films this is one of the best.",

But it&apos;s some three to four hundred years later and we&apos;re just entering another millennium. Dennis tries to teach a young prince the right way of things, but the kid is just plain no good. He grows up to be David Thewlis and one nasty tyrant of a king.\n\nThis is after his life was saved by transplanting half a dragon&apos;s heart into his wounded body on the condition he mend his evil ways and trod the straight, narrow, and just as a king. Thewlis has no intention of living up to that.\n\nDragonheart would be a nice kid&apos;s story, but for the presence of one thing, the voice of Sean Connery coming out of the mouth of the animated dragon. To me it is absolutely inspired how the animation folks managed to invest so much of Sean Connery&apos;s personality into their work. Connery is droll and witty as the last of his kind and I love just listening to him.\n\nEven though Dragonheart is recommended for kids, it&apos;s also recommended for Sean Connery&apos;s fans even though you only get to hear his voice coming out of a dragon.\n\nBut what a voice.",

      "name": "Decent war flick from Umberto Lenzi",
      "reviewBody": "I have to be honest and say that I don&apos;t generally have much interest in war films and thus my only reason for bothering with this film was due to the fact that it&apos;s directed by one of my favourite horror directors, the great Umberto Lenzi. Like most directors that made films in Italy during the sixties, seventies and eighties; Lenzi dipped his hand in many different genres and while he was always best at Polizi flicks and Giallo (in spite of being most famous for blood splattered cannibal and zombie films), Lenzi was clearly talented enough to make films outside of his &apos;comfort zone&apos;, and for a cheap World War 2 thriller; Desert Commandos is actually not too bad. The film takes place somewhere towards the end of World War 2 and focuses on a group of German commandos who parachute into the desert with a special mission. The group, dressed as British soldiers, must make their way to a secret meeting that is taking place between the allied &apos;Big three&apos; - Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin - and eliminate the powerful trio.\n\nThe plot is fairly preposterous and obviously a work of fiction. As mentioned, I&apos;m not a fan of war films in general; so I haven&apos;t seen many so I don&apos;t have a lot to compare this film to. Umberto Lenzi was obviously not too concerned with reality, and I found it odd how the group of fascist, racist Nazi&apos;s easily found help from an Arab woman in the desert. The film is different to most western war films in that our &apos;heroes&apos; are actually German and the British and American troops are the antagonists. The first two thirds of the film are fairly interesting but never truly fascinating as all we really have to go on is the interaction between the various members of the group and as you can probably imagine considering the type of film that this is; none of them are particularly interesting. Still, there&apos;s a fair few action scenes to keep the action ticking over. The film tries to become a bit deeper in the final third and while this doesn&apos;t really come off; the final scenes are better than what went before it. I wouldn&apos;t really recommend this film as I&apos;m sure there are better war films out there; but on the other hand, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s worse too.",

A must see, Stallone on screen from the first to the last second of the movie embodies the disarray of an entire generation, which at some point contemplated terrorism against its own institutions public or private. Sly&apos;s performance is brilliant conveying the confusion of the times, as in the wake of 1969 America was on the verge of civil war. Beautiful soundtrack of protest songs. Classic direction by Robert Schnitzer. Look for the fully remastered version of 2006."

Watching this movie also requires that you put yourself back in the era to an extent, to realize the impact these newsreels would have had. Today, we get our news from endless different sources. In World War II, there were newspapers, radio, and what was shown at the local movie house. Since the government could control all three of those, it did. (Yes, there was also short wave radio, which was how the French got news from England.) What I would have liked at the end is a few sentences telling us what became of each of the big figures in the newsreels: Pétain, Doriot, etc.",

Since none of the other officers would help her, Det. Sean Kenny(Robert Davi) and Cordell are on the same page. Cordell takes on the usual trash crooked cops to be exact. I liked the part where he puts on guy under several exposures of X-rays. Then there&apos;s the scene where Kenny tells Cordell that she&apos;s been cleared of all wrongdoing. Somehow, underneath his hulking and ravaged exterior belies a interior that&apos;s anything but supernatural, it&apos;s human. Both went with the explosion, and covered in white. To me, it goes to show that love never dies, especially when Cordell touches the dead woman&apos;s hand from the sheets. I mean good grief, let her be. This version got a little sappy, yet will he continue the fight against crime, or will he settle down? This one got me baffled! 2 out of 5 stars!",

But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s helpful to say it&apos;s &quot;definitely an artsy masturbation job&quot;. I would urge readers to pay more attention to the fact that 150 people gave it a vote of 8 out of 10. Even the 1st reviewer gave it an 8. SEE THIS FILM! I thought it was very provocative -- an indie that deserves the name in the best of the tradition. Even if it is pretentious or self-important, or whatever &apos;artsy masturbation&apos; means, this film goes well outside the dull, predictable, mainstream -- at least in its ambition if not farther. But not in a Warhol kind of way. It had something to say. Perhaps the message was, as Ben Harper sings, &quot;You have to fight, Fight, FIGHT.......for your mind&quot;, i.e., fight conformism, fight indoctrination, fight regimentation, fight bourgeois control of the mind space. And enjoy the freedom you obtain thereby.\n\nJust my $0.02",

      "reviewBody": "La Marge, directed by Walerian Borowczyk, is an unusual film that blends art-house cinema with erotica, resulting in a thought-provoking yet sensual experience. It explores the subtle ways emotions are conveyed through body movement, particularly in the context of sexual encounters and the notion that the type of orgasm one experiences with a partner can indicate the depth of their love.\n\nThe film focuses on a sex worker, Diana, and the story is told through a unique soundscape that emphasizes ambient noises and music over dialogue. The wind, juke box tunes, and everyday sounds like eating and cleaning create an atmospheric backdrop to the visuals. The cinematography is mobile and sensitive, capturing the environment and characters effectively. The film has a personal and artistic feel, and its slow pace and subtle symbolism add to its enigmatic appeal.\n\nHowever, the film&apos;s obscure nature might be off-putting to some. La Marge sits in an uncomfortable middle ground, perhaps too conventional for fans of the director&apos;s early work, yet too restrained for those accustomed to his later releases. The film&apos;s exploration of sex and its links to guilt, persecution, and death might be expected themes for those familiar with Borowczyk&apos;s work, but they are presented in a more subtle and restrained manner here.\n\nLa Marge is an intriguing, if somewhat perplexing, film. It is a unique and personal work of art, but its slow pace, ambiguous symbolism, and focus on subtle emotional cues may make it inaccessible to viewers who prefer more straightforward storytelling.\n\nLa Marge is an acquired taste, much like the director&apos;s other works, but it leaves a lingering impression, inviting reflection on the relationship between art, sexuality, and human emotion.",

      "reviewBody": "I disagree with some people feeling that this film was no better than the first. It is easily better than the first, which is a very hard thing to do (normally). I thought the first movie wasn&apos;t brill but it was OK, it was kind of what I expected but I did expect a bit more in the fight scenes and I felt that Jet Lei just like the story wasn&apos;t up to much. Everything Stallone is doing here is a great idea and it has a great feel to it. Expendables 2 has finally got to where the first one should&apos;ve been. This one is far more enjoyable, the action / fight scenes are better, which is mainly why we watch these sorts of films, but also the characters and their relationships with each other are better. Some of the scenes are pure genius. Some of the scenes are not but hey ho. I am really looking forward to a 3rd instalment but I do feel that they will take it too far and end up with some of the most annoying and worst ones appearing like Steven Seagal and Vin Deisel... I hope not! If they do then they might as well go the whole hog and get the Heather Small bird from M People on there to just totally annoy us all!! \n\nExpendables 2... Anyone who is between the age of 30 and 60 that remembers the best 80&apos;s action flicks with the likes of Arnie, Stallone, Bruce Willis, van damme in will know that these films didn&apos;t ever really have great acting in, it was all about the action and the fight scenes. Expendables 2 has got it going on! Really enjoyable film.",

      "reviewBody": "Der Herr vom anderen Stern -- I found it on Archive.org and, knowing nothing about it, watched it one recent afternoon. What a perfectly charming movie it is! At the outset, the man (who is from a distant planet) appears in a dystopian city street. Two police officers see him appear and follow him. In due course, he piques the interest of the government, the criminal world, the military, and God knows who else. If for nothing else, watch this film for the incredibly funny &quot;dance&quot; that a ballroom full of high party functionaries are seen doing. (&quot;Oh, it&apos;s the latest thing! It&apos;s the most popular song today!&quot; says a bartender. The man looks on bemusedly.)\n\nI&apos;m not sure if this film is available in English, but is certainly should be. It&apos;s far ahead of its time, and a lot more fun than the dour &quot;The Day the World Stood Still.&quot; Heinrich isn&apos;t Klaatu: Heinrich has a sense of the absurd. That is what makes this such a good film. What&apos;s surprising is that it dates from the year before either East or West Germany declared themselves self-governing, so this was made, so to speak, in no country at all.",

      "reviewBody": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning \n\nAfter a UN report was published linking minerals used in mobile phones to financing of a bloody, brutal fifteen year war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Frank Piasechi Poulsen was unable to sleep with knowing this may be true of his beloved Nokia phone and so set on a mission taking him to conferences held in his native Denmark, to the mines in Walikalie where various militia groups control day to day life and boys as young as fourteen are sent down in risky conditions in the mines to risk their lives for a pittance, to a campaign group in the United States, all the way to Nokia&apos;s head office in Finland to get to the bottom of whether it is aware of unethical practises and whether it&apos;s &apos;socially responsible&apos; image is really a sham.\n\nIt&apos;s a scary but eerily true (and something we&apos;re all too aware of, if we&apos;re honest) fact that most of the material goods we&apos;re accustomed to and even depend upon in this day and age have almost certainly been manufactured and appropriated off the back of the exploitation of people in the poorest corners of the world, from mobile phones to the laptop I&apos;m writing this review on now, and guiltily most of us turn a blind eye to this, desiring as we do the latest gadgets and gizmos. But Frank Piasechi Poulsen would appear to be so troubled at the thought of his phone being a &apos;blood mobile&apos;, he took a round the world trip in search of the answer. And what he&apos;s ended up with is this well intentioned but amateurish and basic, straight out documentary.\n\nFrom the off set, it seems less of an investigation into &apos;whether there is a link between the sale of mobile phones and the war in Congo&apos; and more of a straight out statement, which Poulsen seems to just repeatedly go over and over, taking his time to really start digging into whether this is true, where it goes on and delivering facts and figures relevant to his project. It does serve as an eye opener to what really goes on, as we see the workers going down into the mines in terrible, unsafe conditions and hear tales of guerrilla soldiers committing atrocities against people, but Poulsen seems convinced from the out set that &apos;yes, the biggest mobile phone company in the world is guilty&apos; and this ends up feeling like propaganda for this assertion.\n\nThis is obviously a fairly cheap, low budget effort that Poulsen put his neck on the line to make and wanted the world to wake up and see. If only it had delved a little deeper into what goes on and not just hammered the basic, simplistic &apos;the minerals in the phones are financing the war in Congo&apos; message, which just leaves it with a cheap, amateurish feel. **",

Following the book line by line, even the authors comments (given by the author Erich Kästner himself in the movie!) on what is happening, the story is highly enjoyable and more than touching! \n\nSet in Austria/southern Germany in the beginning fifties, the story about the unhappy divorce of the famous musician and conductor Ludwig Palffy and the hardworking (at that time!!!) mother/journalist Louiselotte Körner is ever so realistic. Don&apos;t let yourself being prejudiced by it&apos;s old appearance; this movie is worth watching! Sentiments and misunderstandings, a laugh and a cry, everything comes up. Here, the switch is kept up for at least a couple of weeks, with all the difficult situations to master. In the later movies, like the latest Parent Trap, how funny and nice that one is, the exchange doesn&apos;t last more than a few days. But these original Lotte and Louise had a REALLY hard time, keeping it up so long!\n\nTo me, all the main characters are sympathetic, and that&apos;s a must in a movie like this. You really want them to get together again, and are so happy when they finally manage! With, as a symbol, Palffy&apos;s atelier moved to the condo next door, instead of somewhere else in the city.\n\nThe only real minus is the fact that the twins Louise and Lotte don&apos;t really look alike. It&apos;s quite easy to tell them apart, and therefore rather strange that nobody notices. Their acting isn&apos;t all that fantastic either, but on the whole this movie is - at least in my opinion - the best parenttrapmovie ever made.",

Hop is by far, the weakest movie from Illumination. Yeah, it has some good ideas its going for, some good animation that brings Easter to life and actors that have a decent amount of effort. But considering this is from the creators that brought Alvin And The Chipmunks, the story is lazily predictable. The tone tries to be modern for the young crowd making it outdated. The humor is mostly weak. The characters feel they aren&apos;t something for an Easter movie. And the ending was highly childish. The one thing I can recommend this is for the children for Easter time. As for anyone else, I think it&apos;s best to stick with the Sonic The Hedgehog movie from 2020. It may have the same plot line as this, but at least a good version. The idea sounded great of something like one of those Christmas specials, but the movie itself is just easily mediocre. Maybe one day we&apos;ll get a good Easter movie, but this is not really it. Happy Easter.",

All kids should have the kind of relationship that Jeff (the character played by Russell Crowe) is lucky enough to have with his father.  The world would be a far better place for it.\n\nJeff&apos;s father, Harry,  is a widow, and is not only Jeff&apos;s dad, he&apos;s also his best friend.  The film focuses on their relationship with each other and with their prospective partners.  Jeff is gay, and rather than being the stereotypical &quot;movie father&quot; full of shock at his son&apos;s sexuality, Harry is very supportive of his sons lifestyle.  As Harry explains in the movie, our kids are after all &quot;the sum of us&quot; .\n\nJack Thompson and Russell Crowe are a joy to watch as Harry and Jeff, father and son, and best mates,  and this is a genuinely wonderful, touching movie which draws as many tears as it does laughs.  One to look out for, and well worth a watch. Harry and Jeff will stay with you long after the end credits have finished running."

I thought Amanda Peet and Sean Patrick Flanery had good roles but the rest of the cast seemed like they were hanging on the bottom of a kite! I was a little disappointed in Tara Reid, I was expecting more than what I got. She has done such a great job in such films as &quot;American Pie&quot;, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, and &quot;Urban Legends&quot;, but somehow this movie just didn&apos;t suit her artistically at all. The movie was filled with pointless sex scenes, and the explicit sex scene with Brad Rowe getting his groove in the parking lot of a club. But, I think the whole rape issue in the film could&apos;ve been left out because it was just boring and a waste of film. The whole he said-she said thing has been drawn out to make a movie a big mess, the only time it has ever worked was in &quot;The Accused&quot; and that&apos;s about it! I think &quot;Body Shots&quot; could&apos;ve have been unmade but I mean it&apos;s a good movie to watch if you can&apos;t go to sleep but other than that, save your time, and read a book or catch up on what you&apos;ve missed on &quot;The West Wing&quot;."

Best feature is that none of the major characters behave idiotically to further the plot.  One never feels compelled to yell &quot;Turn around, stupid!&quot; or &quot;No. Don&apos;t go into the basement alone!&quot; or &quot;Please turn on the lights!&quot; or (to the heroine) &quot;Don&apos;t you remember it&apos;s invulnerable to bullets?&quot;  The heroine is afraid throughout the movie (shouldn&apos;t she be?), but is she irrational at any time?  The curmudgeonly, wheelchair-bound senior researcher is trapped on an upper floor, but does he emerge at the end from his place of hiding behind the computer console?  The detective is disbelieving at first, but does he obstruct and endanger in the end?  The science may be unbelievable (it&apos;s like finding a mummy curse) and that prevents this from being a great sci fi, but the behavior of the characters seems authentic (researchers who know their environment) and that is this movie&apos;s major strength."

      "reviewBody": "After hearing Fred Astaire put his stamp in a song, it&apos;s hard to imagine anyone else attempting to improve in what seems to be the definite rendition of it. That is the case when Mr. Astaire sings Cole Porter&apos;s elegant &quot;Night and Day&quot;. In pairing Ginger Rogers with Mr. Astaire, Hollywood hit the jackpot as it produced a winning combination that went from film to film with such ease and panache, it will never be imitated.\n\nMark Sandrich worked with Ms. Rogers and Mr. Astaire in several movies. Somehow, &quot;The Gay Divorcée&quot; is one of their best collaboration. This film is a lot of fun to watch, even after more than 70 years after it was made. It speaks volumes for all the people involved in the production of this movie.\n\nThe Great Depression was the right background when movies like this were made. In a way, it was an escape from the harsh realities of the times America was going through. The public went to the movies to see their favorite stars that were shown in such a glamorous roles. How could anyone not admire the great Fred Astaire, always impeccably dressed? Or how could not any woman in the theater envy Ms. Rogers&apos;s beauty and easy grace? That era made it right for Hollywood to show the world a sensitivity and sophistication that only few rich types were able to enjoy in real life, while the rest was trying to eke out a life of whatever work they could find.\n\nThe musical numbers are amazing. &quot;The Continental&quot; alone, must have blown the budget of the picture. Imagine how much it would cost today to have all those dancers in a sound stage! Not only that, but in that lengthy number, there are at least four changes of costumes for the women. Also, he is delightful singing &quot;Looking for a Needle in a Haystack&quot;. A young and radiant Betty Grable makes an appearance singing &quot;Let&apos;s K-knock K-knees&quot; in which she shows a bit of her enormous charm and talent.\n\nGinger Rogers makes a gorgeous Mimmi Glassop. Alice Brady, is perfect as the dizzy Aunt Hortense. Edward Everett Horton plays an excellent Egbert Fitzgerald, the divorce lawyer. Erik Rhodes is one of the best things in the film; his Signor Tonetti injects a funny shot into the movie. Eric Blore, as the waiter, has great moments in the movie.\n\nIn setting the film in London and Brighton, a rich texture is added to this winning picture that will remain a favorite that will live forever because of the chemistry that Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire produced in anything they did together.",

And failed of course, a big budget wasted.\n\nYou can clearly see that the Russians were making this film using a laughable budget but created a masterpiece. Every single scene is in its place and serves the purpose of the drama. It creeps slowly under your skin and provokes thinking. What do we hide deep in ourselves? How far can we go in our dreams? What price can we pay for our wishes? Who stands behind this crazy carnival? &quot;Martians&quot; is a stupid idea. The movie is about Man&apos;s soul. And Man on his own is weak. As simple and as difficult as that.\n\nA 10 out of 10, definitely. Thank you for attention.",

Honestly, his character has no meaning in the movie, could have been better if his character was just killed. All his actions were just causing trouble to the main actor, stupidity at his finest LOL That kind of character is the one should be killed in early part of the movie. Then here&apos;s the most stupid police officer - it&apos;s just depicting that Korean police are the same as him LOL.

Tsatsiki is in the middle of a continued battle between love and misunderstanding. A young boy that needs contact with those around him, but who never gets what he deserves. Inventive, delicate and sometimes difficult, this film is an open page to write in with your past. Even when many things turn out wrong for Tstatsiki, hope never dies and, in the end, it&apos;s hope what drives the film. All the characters are believable, definitely well portrayed and carefully picked. The turns and twists of fate for Tsatsiki are as real as they can get, because they are the twists of life. Seen from the eyes of a young kid, make everything more believable. Anyway, this is not a &quot;common&quot; family, but one of the many functional-dysfunctional new phenomenons that try to convey the sense of possibility even in dire straits. A film for the family.",

      "reviewBody": "Fairy tales are movies that either sink or swim when it comes to the silver screen, based upon the merits of their story and the characters that exist to propel the fantasy past the absurd and into the tangibly real. The Secret of Moonacre is unfortunately an example of absurdist fairytale done with little restraint or tact; the story is robust with cliché devices, the characters flat and cursed with banal dialogue, and the backstory, costume designs, production—everything just falls far short of what you may come to expect fro productions of this nature. To be fair, there are certain elements inherent to Csupo&apos;s outing here that borders on mildly entertaining if only for the references that they make to other works, yet such moments are far and few between and never truly dispel the sour taste of hackneyed amateurism that permeates the majority of Moonacre&apos;s ridiculously generic universe.\n\nAt its core, The Secret of Moonacre strives to be part adventure fairytale and part whimsy comedy stitched together with undercooked themes of pride, corruption and the power of love to overcome all shadows of the human heart. Ostensibly, this mix has all the elements to make for an enjoyable family feature, yet burdened with a plodding pace and characters that never come off the screen in any manner, the Secret of Moonacre is a dull one. Centring around young teenage girl Maria (Dakota Blue Richards) as she moves into her extravagant and eccentric uncle&apos;s mansion in the Middle of Nowhere Forest under the protection of nanny Miss Heliotrope (Juliet Stevenson who serves as a trite source of comic relief every now and then with her biggest character trait being an impromptu belch), Goudge&apos;s story is one built upon established ground-works for any old fantasy tale. Sure, fair enough—there&apos;s nothing wrong with building upon already tried and tested methods—yet very little is done beyond this to help Moonacre feel like a tale of its own.\n\nPerhaps the greatest and most obvious detractive trait inherent to Alborough&apos;s adaptation however is simply through its writing which seems to go through the motions at each and every turn. The result is a feature that plods along through countless cliché and predictable contrivances to the point where all fantastical elements are lost within the generic gloop that is the whole backstory and focus point of Moonacre&apos;s world. About half way into the movie, it should be no surprise then that the production boils down to one of absurd ridicule—without the feeling of otherworldly mysticism to back up all the theatrical dialogue, sets and costumes, Csupo neglects his feature to being bland and utterly forgettable in spite of its striking visuals and over-the-top performances. In fact, with the exception of perhaps Ioan Gruffudd , the majority of the acting ensemble here feel just as disconnected to the story&apos;s fantasy as everything else does. It&apos;s not just bad—it&apos;s distracting and downright laughable when any sort of tension or conflict is pushed down the throat with little to no tangible reason to believe in it.\n\nYet this neglect to raising the suspension of disbelief is what ultimately stops The Secret of Moonacre from ever truly coming off the screen. Perhaps with a greater budget, some bigger stars and a re-write or two, Csupo could have made something more than a sporadically pretty treat for the senses, yet as it stands nothing of the sort of achieved throughout its bumbling and overly melodramatic runtime. This in turn makes recommending Moonacre a lost cause; young females may be able to enjoy all the unicorns, pretty dresses and coy humour to the extent that everything else is ignored, yet even this assertion serves as a broad test of the imagination—which is ironically more than Csupo manages here through his excruciatingly mundane two hour exercise in creating yet another Pedestrian Fantasy By Numbers.\n\n\n* A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n"

      "reviewBody": "Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Interview With The Vampire (1994)\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Louis (Brad Pitt) a vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness, and hunger.\n\nAt the time of release, this was not like any other vampire movie I had seen. In movies like Lost Boys and various others, being a vampire is portrayed as almost fun. This movie goes into what a curse immortality is, in a similar way Highlander did, admits all the decapitations. \n\nCruise does not play the main role in this one, but he does something all great actors can do. Play the best part in the movie and steal every scene. The best role in a movie, does not need to be the lead role. It just needs to be the most memorable, and Cruise dominates proceedings and truthfully the movie is duller when he is not on screen. Which sadly is almost all the last half of the movie. \n\nBrad Pitt is not an actor I really care for. There are exceptions, but generally he bores me. This is one such example. I must point out Kirsten Dunst,who was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Her performance is superb. If it was not for Cruise she would have stole the movie. Antonio Banderas is OK, whilst Cristian Slater doesn&apos;t really have much to do. I never realised Cruises future MI2 co star Thandie Newton was in this. I enjoy the use of Guns N Roses cover of Sympathy For The Devil over the end credits too. I actually let the credits run. \n\nI wonder why there was never a sequel, it&apos;s certainly open for one, and the potential is there. Maybe it wasn&apos;t a big enough hit. Finishing outside the Top 10 highest grossers of the year. As Interview With The Vampire grossed $105 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 11th highest grossing movie of 1994.",

      "reviewBody": "One wonders what motivates Ms Campion. Like Spike Lee, she seems to have one thing to say, and somehow believes that film is the right place. Well, never mind. In this particular film, she has reached me. \n\nFor film to be good, it has to place me where I would not go, and change me. This time, I was swept up in this seemingly simple drama: the wilds, unknown motives, undirected ideals, misplaced trust. The images were unique, and the acting superb. I saw Kate in Hamlet and wondered if this was the same woman I had seen in Titanic. Her Ophelia, a challenge for anyone, was delicately layered. I&apos;ll be interested in watching her grow. Somewhat gratifying to see someone without a Barbie figure being sexy.\n\nWhat worries me is how Campion had to make the whole rest of the world comically surreal in order to focus on her duo. She controls this part, and then lets the central drama run wild. I think she really was beyond her limits with this central drama, but that&apos;s what makes it genuine. &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; suffered from too much control --  here she shifts that control to the ludicrous aussie family, and lets the central drama roam.\n\nKate understands that she is not acting a character, but a belief system, or rather a belief in belief systems. We saw that in Ophelia and I&apos;m sure that&apos;s why she was picked here. Keitel&apos;s defeat is an exposure of Christianity. But poor Harvey is a plain old (excellent) actor who just becomes his character. I&apos;m sure he had no understanding that he was to &quot;symbolize&quot; something, and so while he connects with Winslow, he doesn&apos;t with Campion&apos;s vision.\n\nSome symbols were unwelcome by me, because they were so deliberately placed: the pee, the reindeer-car, the koala bear...\n\nSo a little out of control, tarted up with post-feminist pretentiousness, and one of the performances excellent, but a near miss. So what? Do you want intellectual adventure, served visually or not?"

      "reviewBody": "Joe Morelli is a scam artist that loves to prey on innocent people in the poorer regions of Italy. As we meet him, he is trying to swindle whoever he can from the impoverished Sicilians that happen to live in those forgotten towns. The movie is set after WWII in a ruined Italy that hasn&apos;t come out of its defeat and most of the population is having a hard time eking a life, mainly from the land.\n\nMorelli, pretending to be a scout for a big Rome studio is seen traveling the back ways of Sicily with his small van that opens up to a mini studio where the unsuspecting people of those towns flock for a screen test that no one will ever see. For the price of 1,500 lire they get a chance to act for the con man and his camera, hoping they will be the next discovery, once the film is seen by the big casting directors in Rome.\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore has a love for the cinema, as he showed with &quot;Nuovo cinema Paradiso&quot;, which chronicled, perhaps, his own childhood in a small town in Sicily. Mr. Tornatore is a director that hasn&apos;t forgotten his roots, as he demonstrates with this tale about innocent common people being duped because their love and the allure of the cinema, that dream making medium.\n\nSergio Castellitto, one of the best actors working today in the Italian cinema, does a wonderful job interpreting Morelli for the director. His Morelli is never mean, or nasty; in fact, one of his best qualities is the way how he bonds with his subjects. Mr. Castellitto does wonders as the man without scruples, who eventually is found by one person who he made a fool of. Also, Morelli finds in Beata, the sweet and innocent girl from a convent a love he never knew he was capable of having.\n\nBeata, is played by Tiziana Lodato, a beautiful young actress who is the one that makes Morelli understand his guilt after he is beaten and young Beata is interned in an institution. Leopoldo Trieste is seen as the mysterious figure who comes to recite a Spanish text for his screen test. Franco Scaldatto has some good moments in the film.\n\nThis is a film that will not disappoint fans of Giuseppe Tornatore because of his vision about people love for the cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the Eon sanctioned documentary on 50 years of James Bond films.\n\nThe documentary Everything Or Nothing: The Untold Story Of 007 could had been a fluffy celebratory piece like many other documentaries but it is rather warts and all approach.\n\nAlthough I reckon some of the unedifying stuff has been left out. You still get a lot more behind the scenes information and footage than previous similar documentaries.\n\nFive of the six actors who have played James Bond take part. Sean Connery who seems to have had a big falling out with the Bond producers in the past does not take part but instead archive interviews are used.\n\nAs Roger Moore implies here, the Scots can certainly hold a grudge.\n\nThere have been several spiky moments for the Bond producers over the last five decades that get a good airing here. The first being getting the rights and bringing the films into fruition.\n\nThen Fleming collaborating with Kevin McClory which meant McClory was a thorn for years resulting in the rival film Never say Never again in 1983 with Connery.\n\nThen there was the problem when Connery wanted to leave the role and being replaced by George Lazenby who himself left under acrimonious circumstances after one movie.\n\nWe then have Roger Moore who took over Bond and then the parting of the ways between Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, the two producers who started the series. Saltzman&apos;s sold his rights to United Artist.\n\nMoore who found the right blend with The Spy who loved me, maybe stayed in the role for too long as the producers were unwilling to replace him in the early 1980s.\n\nMoore certainly looked creaky in his last Bond film. He was older than the actual mother of the Bond Girl, Tanya Roberts.\n\nWhen there was dispute over the availability Pierce Brosnan, Albert Broccoli had to go for Timothy Dalton before there was the 6 years hiatus in new Bond films because of litigation.\n\nThere was a relaunch with Brosnan finally in the role and up to the present day with Daniel Craig and the partial reboot of Bond.\n\nIt is a great primer for those new to Bond and want some juicy behind the scenes gossip and hard information as to what it takes keeping such a successful franchise going for 50 years.\n\nThere is plenty of archive footage (as many of the main movers and shakers have passed on) and scenes from the movies and some humour as well.",

I was a little leery to watch Lady in the Water because I am a person who tends to like either action or drama and this movie is not classified as either. The movie was much better than I expected and it kept me guessing from the very beginning. I felt myself being drawn into the plot and wondering if I would believe any of this if it were to happen. I was surprised to see the larger than usual role played by M.Night and really enjoyed seeing him act in his own movie. I have a great deal of respect for his writing and acting. I would and will recommend this movie to people of various ages and interests. The lead characters did such a good job in their roles and have kept my interest even though the movie is over. Great Movie..",

Although this may appear &apos;thin&apos;, many layers of this struggle are peeled off. The German (looking) conductor appears to portray an easy comparison to Adolf Hitler, but another could be to Herbert von Karajan, the dictatorial conductor of the Berliner Philharmoniker. And then there is the great music score, that still lingers in my head, although I have not been able to find a recording of it (CD/LP?)(after almost 30 years!). I saw this movie again some years ago and it does not look dated. While I am not a Fellini adept and this movie was seen as one of his minor ones, this is a real classic to me.",

This one just is not good at all.  The main problem for me was that the alligator was not all that impressive quite frankly.  I have seen alligators this size before.  The only thing different about it, is the fact it is tougher to kill.  The story here isn&apos;t good either and neither is the action.  They go into the sewers to hunt it then it attacks some festival and then they figure away to kill it.  This movie is not going to knock your socks off with buckets of gore and it isn&apos;t very interesting either, best just to skip it.  It just does not measure up to the first one.",

      "reviewBody": "This brought to mind CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, another early Czech New Wave film about a teenage apprentice who&apos;s none too excited about his work. Both are coming-of-age comedies with some moments of awkward teen romance. This film (Forman&apos;s first feature) actually predates Menzel&apos;s, and has more of a freeform, anecdotal structure. Although not explicitly a commentary on Communism, Petr&apos;s distaste for spying on customers clearly has some political implications. The film has a gentle, naturalistic pace with scenes that have a nice attention to detail. Ladislav Jakim struck me as a fine young actor, and I liked how the rival boy gradually developed into a more sympathetic character (particularly during the dance scene, which was my favorite part of the movie). Jan Vostrcil, the wonderful lead in Firemen&apos;s Ball, perhaps lays it on a little thick as the overbearing father, but it&apos;s a somewhat humorous performance. Although the comedy is quite mellow and subdued, there are a few laugh out loud moments. Unfortunately, the Facets DVD sports an ugly transfer, and woefully incomplete subtitles. Entire swaths of dialogue went by without translation.",

It&apos;s a bizarre hybrid, set in Atlantis in 20,000 B.C., which combines the &quot;Hercules&quot; genre with the kind of science-fiction motifs found in Flash Gordon serials. True, the plot is the usual strongman-vs-the-evil-tyrant affair, but the &quot;look&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot; surrounding this plot make for striking viewing and have that touch of stylized madness found in only a handful of movies. (Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; and David Lynch&apos;s &quot;Dune&quot; are some of the few comparable efforts which spring to mind.) Adding to the almost-hypnotic effect is a somber, restrained, at times almost atonal music score.   \n\nGordon Mitchell spends the entire movie in one of those &quot;Hercules&quot; loincloths and one never tires of looking at his bare torso which is often contorted into a variety of &quot;bondage&quot; positions. \n\nOnly in the final cataclysm do the proceedings become routine but for the most part this movie is one of the cinema&apos;s most eccentric flights of imagination.",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing the trailer for this on a DVD, it looked like a pretty promising movie. I was led to believe it was a supernatural thriller, which it was... or at least I think it was.\n\n&quot;Ring Around the Rosie&quot; is about a woman named Karen (played be Gina Phillips from &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;) who goes to clean out her grandparent&apos;s secluded old summerhouse after her grandmother passes away. She spends the weekend there with her boyfriend, and he leaves to go back to work while she spends a few more days there to finish up packing. She has some strange visions and dreams about the house, and some odd occurrences take place. While staying there, she is introduced to the caretaker of the place, Pierce (played by Tom Sizemore), who seems nice enough, if not a little strange. Her sister Wendy shows up to help, and as time progresses, Pierce begins to become violent, threatening the girl&apos;s lives.\n\nThe main problem with this movie is that it can&apos;t decide whether or not it&apos;s a supernatural horror film or a dramatic thriller. Or maybe it is one of the two, but I just didn&apos;t pick up on it. I thought it was some sort of supernatural story for the first 45 minutes or so, and then it turned into a thriller from there. Then when the dream-like twist ending wrapped things up, it seemed to combine the supernatural and thriller elements together - leaving the viewer very, very confused. On the plus side, the acting was pretty good, and it had some good moments. But it doesn&apos;t make up for the tangled, confusing plot.\n\nI still don&apos;t exactly know what happened, it makes no sense to me. If you watch this film, you will see how many questions are left unanswered, leaving the viewer with the attitude like &quot;What in the hell was that!?&quot;. This movie could have been decent, but as it progressed, things got too confusing and it ruined the movie. Perhaps someone else may understand the plot better than I, but it just didn&apos;t work for me. 4/10.",

Not bad, but nothing really worth watching for. The events have rather dragging pace, most of the actors are plausible, music suits the movie well and action looks good. The plot is weakest point of the movie, being unconvincing at best, it focuses on Korea digging up their Emperial history and rising to resist Japan after all the cruelty they have suffered from their behalf. Certainly not best that Korean movie industry has to offer.",

Karl Markovics acts best of all these people with the more serious and deep-minded character of the wheelchaired former angel of death.",

Here the script is disjointed , the lines fall flat and it hesitates between drama ( the death of Till&apos;s father) and pranks:these are the latter which saves the film from wreckage : Philipe is stunning as the court jester (admire his mime) and using a mirror to burn the indulgences (the Catholic wealthy bourgeois could redeem their souls by giving dough to the clergy ,a shameless practice Luther and Calvin denounced ) is a good trick .\n\nIn 1956, the Soviet tanks invaded Hungary ; the film was a total commercial failure.",

      "reviewBody": "Mommie Dearest is a film based on the book of the same title written by Joan Crawford&apos;s daughter, Christina Crawford. This film and the book it is based off of tells the story of how Joan Crawford behaved behind closed doors with her children, how she abused them, had crazy/wild outbursts, which sometimes turned violent. In my honest opinion, mommie dearest is very well acted, Faye Dunaway blew me away in her brutally honest portrayal of Hollywood legend Joan Crawford. In the beginning, we are introduced to ms Crawford as a young actress, at the height of her career, working at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, no children, and two divorces. She applies to an adoption agency, but her application is denied, so she goes through some loopholes, pulls some strings, and adopts her daughter, Christina, and then her son Christopher. Throughout the film Joan is depicted by Dunaway as a self obsessed, selfish, child abusing alcoholic that never really gives her love to her children. In many scenes, a teenage Chrisrina tries desperately to gain her mothers love, but she never really receives it. The chemistry between Joan and Christina is good here and the acting is very dramatic and very intense, as it should be. I don&apos;t exactly understand some of the negative reviews this movie has received both when it first came out and over the years. I think mommie dearest is a well made and well acted film telling the very sad true story of actress Joan Crawford and her private life and strained relationships with her children with with whom she woefully mistreated. 8/10 for mommie dearest.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; may have updated the film&apos;s premise for the cynical late &apos;60&apos;s, but as much as I love that old hard-boiled film, even I have to admit that it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. Though it may be hard to remember now that the premise has been used so much, the impossible mission theme was NOT a common staple in action films until this movie. The question of whether or not the team is going to pull it off is, for once, not as simple as many other simple-minded movies have made it. There are moments where the mission is endangered by just about everything imaginable: the CO being critically wounded, suspicious enemies, personality conflicts, wrenching moral dillemas, a traitor in the ranks, being captured by the enemy. The storyline plays out like the most extreme manifestation of Murphy&apos;s Law: everything that can go wrong DOES go wrong.\n\nThe team put together here couldn&apos;t be more incongruent with each other. Gregory Peck&apos;s world-class mountain climber who becomes the team&apos;s reluctant CO, David Niven&apos;s hot-tempered, authority-defying sapper, Anthony Quinn&apos;s Greek ex-Colonel who has promised to kill Peck at war&apos;s end, Stanley Baker&apos;s weary soldier who&apos;s tired of the unending slaughter, a young Greek national who wants more and more of it...the real miracle is that they manage to get as far and as well as they do. For every step forward, they wind up paying for it. Be it in blood, moral anguish, or pain, no one comes out of this mission unchanged or unscathed. I honestly feel that it is this theme of sacrifice that is the key to the greatness of &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "THE PUBLIC ENEMY (Warner Brothers, 1931), directed by William A. Wellman, is a prime example of how a motion picture produced in the early sound era can still hold up today. A worthy follow-up to the studio&apos;s most recent gangster outing, LITTLE CAESAR (1930), that elevated Edward G. Robinson to stardom, THE PUBLIC ENEMY brought forth another new screen personality, James Cagney, displaying a different kind of movie thug: rough, with guys who betray him; tough, with women who get on his nerves or play him for a sucker; and ready, to succeed by socking, punching, slapping or killing anybody who gets in his way. His only soft spot for his mother, but far from being a &quot;Momma&apos;s Boy.&quot; \n\nThrough its passage in time element starting in 1909 Chicago, THE PUBLIC ENEMY plays in the biographical mode, displaying the origins of its main characters, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle, as boys (Junior Coughlan and Frankie Darro), leading to their adult lives (James Cagney and Edward Woods) as tough thugs. Tom Powers character, regardless of his fine upbringing, indicates he was born ... to be bad. He has a brother, Mike (Donald Cook) who knows of his activities, while their mother (Beryl Mercer) may suspect but overlooks his actions. As things start going well for Tom and Matt in the bootlegging racket under Paddy Ryan&apos;s (Robert Emmett O&apos;Connor) leadership, Scheiner Burns, a rival gang leader, attempts on taking over Ryan&apos;s establishment, leading to more gun-play, especially for Tom, quick on the trigger, only to have things backfire on him.\n\nIf not the most famous of the early gangster films, THE PUBLIC ENEMY is one of the most revived. Quite frank in its actions, and adult for its intentions, much of the then so- called violence occurs out of camera range. Yet, whatever is displayed on film is something not to forget. These days, there isn&apos;t a year that goes where THE PUBLIC ENEMY isn&apos;t televised. Whenever a topic pertaining to THE PUBLIC ENEMY arises, it&apos;s not the story that immediately comes to mind, but Cagney&apos;s individual scenes consisting of squirting beer from his mouth into the bartender&apos;s face; Tom&apos;s cold-blooded killing of Putty Nose (the man who let him take the rap for a crime) while playing his last song on the piano; and Tom&apos;s off-screen shootout with a rival gang in a fancy nightclub, stumbling out in the pouring rain saying to himself, &quot;I ain&apos;t so tough.&quot; All these scenes pale in comparison until reaching its most chilling climax ever recorded on film. Yet, the one where Tom, at the breakfast table, pushes a grapefruit into his mistress Kitty&apos;s (Mae Clarke) face, never has such a brief scene have such an long impact. Other than Clarke&apos;s famous few minutes of grapefruit glory, Mia Marvin (whose face resembling Maureen &quot;Marcia Brady&quot; McCormick from TV&apos;s 1970s sit-com, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;) playing a slut named Jane, is one who gets her face slapped after getting Tom drunk enough to seduce him. The second billed Jean Harlow doesn&apos;t get any abuse from her leading man as did the other two actresses receiving no screen credit for their trouble. While Harlow&apos;s performance has been criticized as one of her worst, chances are her portrayal might have been intended to be enacted in that manner. Harlow&apos;s Gwen Allen is an uneducated blonde floozy with her gift for attracting men. What possibly hurts the film is not Harlow herself, but the inane dialog she recites, (&quot;Oh Tommy, I can love you to death!&quot;. Joan Blondell&apos;s limitations on screen is mostly one involving her relation with Tom&apos;s pal, Matt. Edward Woods, whose has almost equal screen time with Cagney, is a Hollywood name very few recollect today. Several documentaries profiling gangster films have indicated Woods as the initial star of THE PUBLIC ENEMY with Cagney assuming the subordinate role, with director Wellman seeing an error with the casting and wisely having these actors switch roles. While a smart move on Wellman&apos;s part, he failed to switch roles on the boy actors who portrayed them, especially a keen observer noticing Frankie Darro playing Matt, not Junior Coughlan playing Tom, performing in the Cagney manner. Donald Cook, Beryl Mercer and Robert O&apos;Connor appearing in subordinate roles, are essential with their parts, but never outshine Hollywood&apos;s finest movie thug, a/k/a Public Enemy, James Cagney, whose tougher roles, ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES (1938) and WHITE HEAT (1949) were years into his future. With limited underscoring, the theme song, &quot;I&apos;m Forever Blowing Bubbles,&quot; like Cagney and his grapefruit, has long become associated with THE PUBLIC ENEMY.\n\nTHE PUBLIC ENEMY, which has become one of the first major movies from the Warner Brothers library to be distributed on video cassette (consisting mostly of prints from slightly edited reissues), and later on DVD (with either edited or restored prints), can be seen quite frequently on Turner Classic Movies. It might not have the realistic violence as any crime film of today, but THE PUBLIC ENEMY presents itself as a gangster drama that doesn&apos;t have to be all blood and guts to become successful. Good acting, fine story, interesting characters supplied with tight action is all what is needed to make a good movie. Being a natural talent, Cagney makes THE PUBLIC ENEMY all it&apos;s worth.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Hellraiser&quot; or &quot;Clive Barker&apos;s Hellraiser&quot; is an excellent horror film. If I were Clive Barker I would race a the chance to get my name in the credits of this film. Clive Barker directs and writes this film based on his book &quot;The Hellbound Heart.&quot; This film is about a simple (or thought simple) puzzle box that Frank gets from a wierd man who we find out is some sort of guardian of this box or something but sells it to unleash the demons or just sells I guess.\n\nThanks to Clive Barker we have a classic film with a very serious villain with no comic relief (but none is needed). Many people enjoy Pinhead&apos;s one liner&apos;s like &quot;We&apos;ll tear your soul apart&quot; and &quot;Oh please, no tears, it&apos;s a waste of good suffering!&quot; Pinhead also tends to enunciate most of his words or phrases. Plenty of gore, violence, and drama. A nice music score also.\n\nThis film is not for the weak stomach so don&apos;t watch this and eat your lunch or else you&apos;ll be scrubbing your lunch off the carpet (if you have a weak stomach).\n\n&quot;Hellraiser&quot; does somehting that most trendy horror films and slasher films rarley do, scare you!\n\nClive Barker is a wonderful writer I also like &quot;Candyman.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "Like many, Evil of Frankenstein is my least favourite of the Hammer Frankenstein films starring Peter Cushing and is a lesser entry of the Hammer horror films. But does that make it a bad film? No, in fact it is very watchable, just disappointing.\n\nEvil of Frankenstein has its flaws, the main one being some of the story which is like different elements from past Universal/Hammer films recycled and cobbled together to sometimes muddled and underdeveloped effect, there are though some interesting elements(I personally found the mute girl subplot quite touching). It also took a while to get going and there is a clumsy and contrived script with a number of contradictory elements compared to other Frankenstein films, as a standalone the film&apos;s okay but continuity-wise comparatively it just didn&apos;t seem to fit. The monster&apos;s make-up is poor this time round, wasn&apos;t crazy about it in Curse of Frankenstein(the only real criticism this viewer had of that film) but at least the make-up in that film didn&apos;t look like layers of out of date oatmeal being put on the actor&apos;s head and face like here, giving it a fake rather than freaky look. It was nice to see the Monster as a misunderstood creature again but Kiwi Kingston for personal tastes played the role rather lifelessly, the monster never felt menacing here and it wasn&apos;t easy to root for him either. Sandor Eles also does next to nothing with a very underwritten role.\n\nHowever, Evil of Frankstein looks great apart from one cheap back-screen projection. The cinematography is simply splendid with nice shadowy effects and the sets and costumes are wonderfully sumptuous and Gothic, who can&apos;t love the lab set. Freddie Francis had big shoes to fill and his direction was a respectable effort but there was a sense that he wasn&apos;t quite the right man for the job. Narratively and pacing-wise, his direction does have a tendency to lumber but when it comes to the visuals and creating an atmosphere Francis&apos; experience as a cinematographer shines through. There are some effective scenes here, the opening scene is brilliantly creepy and the climax and monster-coming-to-life scene are exciting. One notable exception is Frankenstein&apos;s escape from the Burgomaster, clumsily done as well as a little cheap-looking and should have been excised(personal view of course). Don Banks&apos; music score is enough to evoke chills. The cast are good on the whole. Peter Cushing comes out on top as a more sympathetic than usual Frankenstein, he gives an as always great performance and makes his lacking dialogue seem more than it actually is. Peter Woodthorpe plays an absolute slimeball and literally has a ball with it while Katy Wild is touching as Rena the mute beggar girl, conveying a good deal of emotions through eyes and facial expressions.\n\nOverall, very watchable but this is not Hammer at their best. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "They had the funds, they had the means, they had some good acting crew, they even had a fine reputation of the previous Shaft, but somehow they managed to make only half a movie - the second half is barely watchable.\n\nThe first half goes quite smoothly, introducing us with the main characters and the main plot. Samuel L. Jackson is a great choice for the role of Shaft, but even his flawless appearance couldn&apos;t make this movie special, or even above average.\n\nThis new Shaft lacks cunning and authority, making him nothing more than a regular cop who is trying to right the wrongs. And that would be just fine if the whole bunch on nonsensical and absurd things didn&apos;t occur in the second part of the movie. As if all the following events were just randomly piled upon each other, still connected with the story, but lacking common sense. All of that just made me indifferent about how the movie will end.\n\nStill, it&apos;s watchable, but don&apos;t expect anything special and overly exciting.",

While this isn&apos;t as bad as the pap the Asylum grinds out, it&apos;s still really bad. Why? Well, the acting is atrocious. The SFX is extremely horrible and cheap (watch for the guy to get his head squashed, you&apos;ll be laughing hysterically). The story, what there is of it, is kind a rip off of Blade, but without any of the talent. If you watch this, just turn your brain off, ok?",

      "reviewBody": "Although I&apos;ve heard that Michael Powell chose, over a skirt-slashing Colpeper, to instead have him be The Glueman, his choice is, I think, serendipitous. The Glueman is not just the (superficially, as most post-modern critics mistake about him and about so many other characters in earlier films - about which more later) repressed sexual pervert Glueman, but he&apos;s also the Clueman. Yes, he&apos;s vaguely sinister, but he provides the glue that diverts the film&apos;s younger, war-preoccupied characters from their immediate concerns, and he suggests the clues that connect them to the heritage (some of us Yanks know the words of &apos;Land Of Hope And Glory&apos; because England/Britain is undeniably, in many respects, our Mother Country) that has shaped them and made them who they are - and to the Civilization for which they&apos;re fighting.\n\nToo many of today&apos;s critics obsess about the &quot;Lesbian&quot; farm woman whose character, in the 1940&apos;s, would have been ordinary and been regarded as being ordinary: a woman raised under the sterner discipline and mores of her day, with no-nonsense, no-b.s. values of virtue, obligation and hard work - and of getting to the point. It&apos;s postmodernists&apos; affectation to automatically suspect doughty, matter-of-fact women characters - any eccentric women characters whom their postmodernist Miss Jean Brodie nonsense has bent them to suspect of fitting their screwy postmodernist (i.e., most often Marxisant, but often also Romantic) worldview - in earlier films of being &quot;Lesbians.&quot; This woman is, consummately, a farmer who has to consider pragmatically what all farmers have always had to consider: how to smartly, efficiently work their land to its top yield against time and weather, pests and parasites, poachers and market conditions; there&apos;s nothing &quot;Lesbian&quot; about any of her singleminded agrarian pragmatism, or about her unremarkable - for her day - country ladies&apos; sartorial choice, or even about her puffing a cigarette.\n\n&apos;A Canterbury Tale&apos; isn&apos;t among the best of Powell &amp; Pressburger&apos;s efforts; but it doesn&apos;t fall far short of their best. In a spot or two the plot plods, but then plodding was the pace of the Kentish countryside, so I think that it&apos;s only to our early third millennium sensibilities that it seems to plod. Seldom has black &amp; white cinematography managed, as it manages here, to communicate through chiaroscuro the pilgrims&apos; unease, and through the blessed splendor of sunlit, cloud-garlanded vistas of the Weald of Kent their respite.\n\nAs the Glueman strives to communicate the pace, sensibilities, and sensations of Chaucer&apos;s pilgrim&apos;s time, so too must we latter-day viewers accommodate our viewing of this film to the pace, sensibilities, and sensations of its period and setting: once we&apos;ve done that - which demands of us no extraordinary effort - the legendary, enduring Powell &amp; Pressburger magic works its spell.\n\nFrom the outset I found Sergeant Sweet&apos;s unaffected acting well-suited to the storytelling. The Yanks whom Wartime Britons recall were probably more like Mike Roczinsky, yet among those &quot;overpaid, overfed, oversexed, and over here&quot; American &quot;invaders,&quot; among all those &quot;brown jobs,&quot; were young men quite like Sweet&apos;s Bob Johnson. Dennis Price&apos;s manner is a bit too aristocratic for his portrayal of a sergeant, but on the whole Price&apos;s thespian gifts help him to carry off his role very well. Sheila Sim gives a perfectly iconic portrayal of a young woman of her time: bereaved but not crushed; proud yet considerate; tender yet not mawkish; vulnerable yet capable. Eric Portman&apos;s Glueman is appropriately mysterious and mildly menacing and yet, in the ending we discover that he&apos;s all along been a benign agent of illumination, the neutral but never indifferent catalyst, the benevolent spur to the young people&apos;s sleuthing to know their present through their coming to touch their collective past; the Glueman is, if you think about his role in the narrative, rather God-like - or, if your prefer, rather Nature-like.\n\nWhat&apos;s lovely about the dénouement here is that it enchants without indulging in sodden kitschiness, and indeed that it enchants in spite of of its scant kitschy elements. In the end the Glueman vanishes from the pilgrim&apos;s and our ken because he&apos;s accomplished his task of cluing and gluing the pilgrims to their past, to the mystical dimension of Being in their Own Time as that Being can only have come about by dint of their having touched their Past in their Present, which is the predicate of their harboring good hope for their Future. This message, to people whom wartime exigencies shifted brusquely about en masse as people had hitherto never shifted about, may have rung in &apos;A Canterbury Tale&apos;s&apos; contemporary audiences a chord of sentimental longing and welcome reassurance.\n\nThis is a thoroughly English film best appreciated when one knows that Powell grew up in rural Kent and that he loved his home county&apos;s loveliness as only a native can and does love eternally his childhood home - and the verities it imparts early to him. In our present age of rapidly successive, plug-in and plug-out residential and professional transience - the first age of nigh-universal human rootlessness - &apos;A Canterbury Tale&apos;s&apos; blessing is its acquainting us with our 1940&apos;s forebears&apos; more permanent, more grounded sense of themselves and their place in the world and in time, a sense which they felt the war had put under threat and had hurled them and their world, willy-nilly, into unsettling uncertainty. It seems unlikely that we - our species - shall ever again know the quiet certainties, tranquility, and satisfaction of lifelong residence in, or near, our birthplaces. Until our time urgency meant for people something quite different from what urgency means for us. If people before our hyper-active, attention-deficited, more artificial time were not more &quot;authentic,&quot; then they were certainly far less remote than we&apos;ve become from Nature&apos;s cycles and temper.\n\n&apos;A Canterbury Tale&apos;s&apos; charm is quiet, subtle, and in the end it&apos;s sensual, mystical, illuminating, and eternally dear. Pity that few have nowadays the time or the temper for such charm.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, I certainly didn&apos;t know what was waiting for me when I decided to watch this movie... I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m generally hardened, I like horror video games, movies, even read some mangas like Berserk and Junji Ito&apos;s horror mangas but wow this movie was a bit too much for me.\n\nNever have I seen such a divisive public when it comes to a movie like this, some people don&apos;t like it and some people praise it. I really understand both sides. In fact I first came to know about this movie through a book called &quot;1001 Movies to see before you die&quot; and this movie was amongst them, I really don&apos;t remember what was the reasoning for it being there but I can understand in some sense why. This movie is relentless, like every scene that you expect the director to not show the explicitness the director shows it- sometimes I wonder if such violence is needed? Perhaps as a means to not deter from the original vision of where it came from I.e. A manga? With drawings you can stylise violence, make it into a part of the aesthetic of your story and I think that Takashi Miike wanted to do something similar with this and show everything just like in the mangas. Honestly one would believe the scenes involving the titular Ichi would be the most terrible ones because he commits the most gruesome murders ever but since his character and his suit and the way he kills his victims are done in such an overblown cartoonish way it is hard to show it done without it looking very fake with CGI and stuff, unless you want to spend a lot on practical effects which Takashi doesn&apos;t so most of the killings Ichi does luckily are mostly implied or not shown a lot in contrast to Kakihara who does drawn out painful torture scenes, these were the ones that I wanted to look away from and had to cover my eyes even! Never have I ever encountered something like this before. It is also interesting how it tries to show different sides of violence from different points of view, both equally brutal.\n\nViolence aside I think this movie oozes style, it has cool camera placements and editing that is really frantic... but I think this film excels the most in how it captures it&apos;s characters, the costuming is brilliant- Kakihara&apos;s wardrobe is so bright and colourful which is a joy to watch (who&apos;s the designer?), same with everyone else on the cast, it is a joy (but also a fright) to see everyone imbue their characters with such effervescence.\n\nA negative of this movie I guess is that the story isn&apos;t conveyed really well? Some plot points, motivations and relationships in characters weren&apos;t done well enough- which is also the difficulty in adapting a manga to a live action movie cause in the manga you&apos;ll always have the advantage of having pages and pages to develop everything. I had to read a summary just to understand what was going on and why some characters did some stuff in the movie. This is also a negative side of the hyperactive and stylistic cutting of the movie, sure it looks very cool but it might confuse more than lead on. Also the ending is a bit confusing, make sure to read the wiki to understand it lol! But as I understood it it&apos;s a cycle of violence that repeats itself and that revenge never pays no matter how you do it.\n\nWould I watch this movie again? I don&apos;t think so really, maybe look at images of the characters to take inspiration for costuming and such but otherwise I couldn&apos;t stomach it- even watching it this time I had to take breaks from watching it and cuddle with my dog before I could see the rest of it. Make sure to watch this with someone because going at it alone is not something I recommend. It made me feel and that is what art is supposed to do, it wasn&apos;t pleasant feelings but nevertheless it made me feel, and for that I applaud it. Takashi Miike is brave for doing this but I certainly hope that I won&apos;t have to watch anything like it again cause wow this was certainly something different. As I said, I understand why it is appreciated but I also understand why it is hated.",

      "reviewBody": "The film is about several thieves and murderers who travel with carnivals and prey on decent people--in this case, a man who brought his sheep to town to sell them and his overweight daughter. The man is shot and killed (by Lionel Barrymore) to get his money, though when it turns out his daughter has the money, another of these low-lives (John Gilber) tries to film-flam the money from her. While all a bit silly when you think about it, some of the tricks they tried to use to get the money were really cool. My favorite was when they re-staged the execution of John the Bapist (who, for some odd reason, they referred to him by some name I have never heard of before--NOT John). The fake chopping off the head and sticking it on a silver platter bit was really exciting to watch--BOTH times they staged it.\n\nBack in 1927, I am sure this film was considered better than people today would assess it. Now I am not saying it&apos;s a bad film--it&apos;s pretty good. But, the melodramatic style of the film seems dated and the idea of evil &quot;carnies&quot; stealing and murdering was an accepted theme back in the 20s--but today it just seems kind of silly. But despite this and a very, very, very simplistic and moralistic plot, it is pretty good and a good film for silent movie buffs. But, overall, it&apos;s not one of John Gilbert&apos;s best films nor is it one that has especially lasting appeal.",

I really can&apos;t blame Tony Todd, as this was probably a chance to make a few dollars for two or three days of work. Thankfully, he had to interact with only one of the other actors.\n\nEverything the other reviewers have written is absolutely true. These kids basically wander around in a (relatively) small building, completely oblivious to the fact that they can go look out a window to see where they are. And how lost can you get when there are stairwells with exit signs all over? \n\nI actually know something about geocaching, and I&apos;m guessing that the director might be a geocacher himself. How do I know? Because virtually all of the geocachers are tall and good-looking, and their girl friends have big boobs. This is not true in the real world. (Bring on the flamers....) \n\nThe giraffes were a nice touch, though.\n\nNot recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard for Hollywood to make an adaptation of a book by Dr. Seuss. Especially if it&apos;s something like The Lorax. The Lorax is one of Dr. Seuss&apos; darkest tales with a serious sentiment. This film adaptation keeps the story but it focuses too much to its fun characters and gimmickry of the 3D than the environmental message. It leaves the message as the background of the film. As a whole, it&apos;s colorful and fun but it feels very different.\n\nThe film adds a lot of new things to stretch this small story. Like the Once-ler reveals his face and the kid from from the beginning has a different motive why he went to the Once-ler. It&apos;s strange and clever. This is from the creators of Despicable Me and the studio&apos;s trademark is to add some cute comic relief characters. The Humming Fish, Swomee Swans, and The Barbaloots are cute enough.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to say that Danny DeVito is perfect as the Lorax and Ed Helms is a bit charming as the Once-ler. Everything in this film fun. The songs are pretty good although it&apos;s not quite memorable. What disappoints here is the execution of the story. Yes, the message is there but it feels like it&apos;s just the background of the film. More goes to the fun. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that but it&apos;s too light for this dark story.\n\nThe film has the heart and soul to show Dr. Seuss&apos; illustration but the storytelling feels too different. The message is there but it&apos;s not as compelling as the book. It&apos;s pretty hard to say it&apos;s a bad film because it&apos;s entertaining and fun. It&apos;s hard to say it&apos;s great because it lacks eagerness to the message. It seems like Horton Hears A Who will remain as the best Dr. Seuss adaptation so far.",

Granted, Claudette Colbert plays the poet, the hopelessly romantic dreamer, well, and that plays off Stewart&apos;s greed-driven detective splendidly.\n\nThe detective, crime-solving part of the film is well done within its confines, Edgar Kennedy and Nat Pendleton are cast well as the rather slow-witted police. If this 1939 film had been made two and a half decades earlier, they would have fallen over each other, broken things, and caused ultraviolence in a Mack Sennett sort of way.) Guy Kibbee is, of course, perfect as the Stewart&apos;s partner. I will not spoil the ending, but I can say that as with all well-written screwball comedies, the film has a delightful way of meandering through situations and reaching a conclusion which satisfies.\n\nI don&apos;t know if this will help, but before viewing, I had to promise my wife that it was not that Christmas movie.",

It&apos;s interesting work and is considerably more than the soft-core porn for which it might be mistaken. The film was also an experiment on the part of the director Michael Radford, who began his film career as a documentary film maker. To remain true to his school, Mr. Radford allowed the principal actresses to map out their own back stories and interactions, then filmed the results. Many people seem to feel this process failed. I must disagree as I think it worked very well. The slight raggedness that resulted simply made the film more convincing to me. It&apos;s a thinking person&apos;s adult film. Viewers looking for a straight-up porn hit should pass. This film is more about people who have faced certain facts and settled into lives along the underbelly of Los Angeles. The fact that some of them happen to strip is merely coincidental.\n\nDancing at the Blue Iguana takes an MRI-like scan of life in an L.A.-area strip club, clinically sectioning the lives of the dancers and staff of the club, as well as providing interesting vantage points on the various types that patronize it. There&apos;s an elderly gentleman who watches the dancers from ten feet away through opera glasses, understanding that the devil is truly in the details, a Russian hit man who may be targeting one of the dancers. There&apos;s even a young woman regular, apparently in the same age bracket as the dancers. The overall slant is so detached, so transparent, that one comes away from the film feeling as though almost nothing has happened. A number of questions are asked but not really answered, but life is that way at times.\n\nThe entire cast turns in solid performances that simultaneously reveal both the surface and hidden aspects of their characters but the story really zeroes in on the various dancers, all of whom are portrayed with great conviction by several very fine actresses who have really taken the plunge into their roles; Daryl Hannah&apos;s wasted, self-deluding Angel and Jennifer Tilly&apos;s freaked and superfreaky Jo to mention just two off the top. There are more. But the real depth resides in Canadian actress Sandra Oh&apos;s Jasmine whose character, away from the pole, is a gifted poet in deep mourning for the dead end which her life, due to a lack of faith in her gift, is approaching. When Jasmine is finally persuaded to read at a local open-mike event by the owner of the bookstore where the reading takes place, she blows everyone out the door, including the headlining poetess who is touring behind her newly-published collection. But Jasmine can&apos;t be happy because her triumph is simply more proof of her, apparently, terminal weakness and lack of belief in herself, as well as the hate of what that lack has made her. It&apos;s a heart-rending performance. (You can catch a glimpse of this little-known actress in the beautifully-done Canadian production, The Red Violin, as the wealthy Asian lady who, with her husband, bids on the instrument near the film&apos;s climax.)\n\nDancing at the Blue Iguana also contains what may be the shortest 75-second sequence ever filmed in which Kristin Bauer&apos;s Nico, a touring professional stripper and porn star, whose anticipated guest performance comprises one the film&apos;s wispy back stories, takes the stage. The regular dancers all tend to mime various stages of sexual involvement as part of their individual routines; no such nonsense for Nico. When she confronts the hooting, cash-brandishing, SRO crowd, she operates behind a calm, Apsara smile that might have floated off a wall frieze at Angkor Wat. Nico is obviously the girl who really does this stuff for a living. If you were a fan of the great 80&apos;s group, Echo and the Bunnymen, as I was, you&apos;ll never hear their hit, &apos;Lips Like Sugar&apos; quite the same way after Nico works with it. Hard to believe that Ms. Bauer is the same lady who played Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s entirely mainstream girl du jour in the &apos;Man Hands&apos; episode, but it is. Her opening at the Blue Iguana is also set up by one of the most unexpected scene-to-scene jumps that I&apos;ve ever witnessed. Nico&apos;s tough as nails but later, in a touching scene with Jasmine, the girl behind the woman comes out. If you find a VHS copy of this very engrossing movie, (It&apos;s probably available as a DVD.) you may want to have it duplicated to provide a backup when you finally wear out the tape under Nico&apos;s scene."

      "reviewBody": "Tsui Hark directed this sequel (1989) to John Woo&apos;s classic heroic bloodshed films Better Tomorrow 1 and 2 made couple of years earlier, and this third installment is more a prequel than sequel. It concentrates on what happened before the first two films and has more drama than action in it. Chow Yun Fat is again Mark Gor who is in Vietnam and meets there his cousin Mun (Leslie Cheung) who is just released from prison when Mark arrives in Vietnam. They meet mysterious female assassin Kit (the beautiful sweetheart Anita Mui) and both of the men are attracted by Kit. The film concentrates pretty much on the war infested Saigon and the hell that&apos;s free in there, so there isn&apos;t any particular plot in the film, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not interesting.\n\nI think there&apos;s couple of strong scenes of social criticism, mostly the horrific &quot;customs scene&quot; at the airport when Mark, Mun, Kit and Mun&apos;s father try to travel away from the country and are abused by the corrupted custom officers. Also the scene at the hospital is very harrowing and is there to underline righteously the state of the world of that time, and unfortunately there are even today places with same kind of circumstances in our world. Fortunately Tsui&apos;s attitude isn&apos;t this time as underlining as in his Once Upon a Time in China (1991), and Tomorrow 3 is therefore perhaps more noteworthy film as commenting society.\n\nThe visuals are also brilliant as can be expected from this director. There are great use of blue smoke again and the gun fights are incredibly beautifully shot and are more effective than any gun fight in some Western effort. The slow motion death scene of one important character in the film&apos;s finale is perhaps among the most beautiful &quot;heroic death scenes&quot; I&apos;ve seen and it is finished very carefully and thus it has such a power. After that scene everyone should know what this name &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot; for this genre means and what makes it so unique. The end is very sad, too, but as we know how Mark ends up in his subsequent adventures, it gives some positivism for the sad ending of this third film. The ending is little irritating due to it&apos;s prolonged gun battles and fire power, and I think it should have stopped little earlier in order to be more effective finale for the otherwise pretty great film.\n\nBetter Tomorrow 3 is not as great and interesting as Woo&apos;s films, but still this is much more than average effort from Hollywood, and due to Tomorrow 3&apos;s great look and visuals, I give this gladly 8/10 rating and think this is among the greatest films Tsui Hark has directed himself. He has produced perhaps as many films as he has actually directed and many have said he is better producer than director, but this film shows that he really knows how to direct noteworthy films, too.",

But his work brings him into conflict with a local drug lord (Paco Christian Prieto), whose operations are threatened by Dacascos&apos; interference...\n\nPredictable B-movie, elevated above the routine by virtue of its slick presentation and interesting cast (including Geoffrey Lewis), under the assured direction of Sheldon Lettich (DOUBLE IMPACT). The capoeira sequences are exotic and colorful, which blunts the impact of some pretty heavy fight scenes, and the script is alternately naive and obvious. However, the virtues are considerable: Ultra-buff Dacascos flaunts his pumped-up torso through a variety of tight-fitting vests (drool! slobber!), while ultra-cute Stacey Travis (the romantic interest) hovers around the periphery just long enough to temper the film&apos;s relentless macho swagger.

So, amongst other things, he gets no present, gets the blame for ruining the family Christmas dinner, gets pelted with snowballs by the local heavies, also clobbered by same at the inter-neighbourhood festive American football game and joint worst of all, blows his chance of romance with the pretty new girl who arrives next door and sees his dad and grinchy old grandad argue to the point where gramps walks out on the family before the end of the day. Same day by same day, like a junior Bill Murray, he rights every wrong, closing on the real biggie, reconciling his dad and grandad to break the loop at last.\n\nSo it&apos;s pretty obviously a Christmas edition of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; meets &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; the latter right down to young Pete using his repeat time to learn a musical instrument from scratch and find a way to his initially reluctant girl&apos;s heart, but it&apos;s all done so openly, inoffensively and amicably, plus it&apos;s only a Christmas T.V. show for pity&apos;s sake, your surname would have to be Scrooge for you not to be mildly entertained at the very least.\n\nThe two young male and female leads give nice performances in their Kevin and Winnie-type roles and Bruce Dern is the most recognisable cast member as the hard hearted old grandfather. The only really objectionable thing for me about this otherwise pleasant Christmas movie was the wishy-washy original music trilling away in the background but for fans of the two sources mentioned, this is a nice little film to while away the time if you&apos;re stuck indoors at Christmas with nothing much to do.",

Corniest has Tommy Gunn&apos;s cock supposedly sticking up a yard in the air under the covers, a typical Cialis/Viagra problem solved by contract star Jesse Jane by humping it (much smaller when revealed, of course) into submission.\n\nOther players on the payroll like Stoya and Riley Steele show up but it&apos;s boring sex comedy start to finish. The guest ladies outshine the trademarked girls, as both Jenna Haze and Sasha Grey yield some sweat equity performances for their fans. And the late Shyla Stylez is the sexiest of all."

On his way he meets up with 2 strangers - Millard Mitchell, an old prospector looking for his first strike and Ralph Meeker, an ex army lieutenant. Both agree to help him for a share of the bounty, but can they be trusted.\n\nA terrific, character lead study of 5 people, including Janet Leigh, who all have individual greed and obsessional issues. This is probably the best of the Mann / Stewart westerns with Stewart giving an often frightening dramatic performance and with exceptional support from the other 4. It is a first rate character piece where the action, good though it is, comes second to the characters such that all of them are given enough time and script to really develop.",

Ione Skye is so beautiful, and very talented. She played the lonely girl perfectly. I cannot imagine a better actress for her part...her eyes said something to me while watching, as did her heart and soul she put into this role. Jennifer Aniston, whom I&apos;m not a big fan of, was actually well written, and her knack for switching accents though out the film was quite funny. The standout character was David, played by Mackenzie Astin.\n\nHe&apos;s a nice guy, plain and simple. His dialogue was witty, charming, and never went over the pretentious mark. His character actually meant something to me, and for once, I agreed with his role. I think he has a bright future ahead of him, and I even think he is a better actor than his older sibling, Sean.\n\nI loved the romance that built between David and Frankie. Even though we have seen this kind of mushy clap trap on screen several times before, it just seemed to work differently here.\n\nOverall, this is a surprisingly sweet, well acted and non-pretentious romance film that deserves more recognition.\n\nI loved it, very much."

      "reviewBody": "Bring the crackers because mama, this movie is bringin&apos; the cheese! If there has ever been a more culturally diverse group of no-name actors to brave the jungles of Borneo then I&apos;ll end my movie reviewing career right now (future users of the Alan Smithee pseudonym applaud). All right, I&apos;ve kept this secret, but I actually sat in on a production meeting for Anacondas and here&apos;s how it went down:\n\n&quot;Annoying black dude who just screams the whole time?&quot;\n\n&quot;Check. But let&apos;s put a tough black dude in there as well. Don&apos;t wanna be accused of stereotyping.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good idea. Who is Morris Chestnut?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, we thought it was a brand of chewing tobacco, but he&apos;s actually who we&apos;re gonna use as our tough black guy.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, OK. How about a Latino woman with an unnecessarily bad attitude?&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean the J-Lo wannabe? Check.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. Did y&apos;all find that tough-looking Asian guy?&quot;\n\n&quot;Check. It wasn&apos;t easy, but we found one with a mullet.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perfect. That&apos;ll alert everybody that he&apos;s not one of those brainy Asians. How about a blonde babe with a thick, fake Southern accent?&quot;\n\n&quot;Check. She&apos;s from Georgia, but her accent sounded too realistic. We told her to fake it up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good job. And I saw that you found a white European male, but how about the protagonist?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, you mean the muscular white guy with a 2-day beard growth and husky voice? Check. He&apos;s in wardrobe right now having the sleeves on his tight shirt rolled up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perfect. Just don&apos;t forget the tattoos. Now how about somebody who&apos;s actually famous?&quot;\n\n&quot;Um, well, we don&apos;t exactly have that. But hey, we&apos;ve got everything else!&quot; And that, my friends, is your cast. Some other guy of some sort of foreign descent was thrown in there as well. He looked like Gregg Rainwater from The Young Riders. He died soon enough, so it doesn&apos;t really matter.\n\nMy money says you really won&apos;t care about anybody involved in this production. Well, I did like the southern girl. She was pretty hot. But why do producers insist on accents being so fake? Her accent dwindled as the movie went along. She eventually was only accenting about one word per sentence, but by the climax she started fakin&apos; it up with reckless abandon!\n\nAnd I&apos;m sure plenty of girls will think Johnny &quot;Five O&apos;Clock Shadow&quot; Messner is pretty hot, but for the most part you&apos;ll spend the first 10 minutes of the movie picking which characters you want to see swallowed whole by a giant anaconda. My first choice was the Jennifer Lopez wannabe. When B-movie characters like her prance around with a huge chip on their shoulder, I usually pray for some sort of creature to sneak up and bite that chip right off. Along with the entire shoulder.\n\nThis is one of those movies that relies on every cliché in the B-movie book. In other words, you can expect a whole lot of stuff like a door opening slowly and then something jumping out while a loud noise is made. And since this is a &quot;creature feature,&quot; by definition a lot of the action takes place at night, in dark caves and in water, with only flashlights to light the way.\n\nDialogue is expectedly bad. We&apos;re treated to such intellectually-challenged exchanges as: &quot;What&apos;s wrong with this picture?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re in it.&quot; And it&apos;s mostly dominated by Messner&apos;s Michael Paré-esque line delivery and Eugene Byrd&apos;s banshee-like screeching. It&apos;s funny up to a point, but eventually you start looking at your watch and thinking, &quot;OK snake, it&apos;s time to eat this kid.&quot;\n\nThe CGI looks a little goofy at times, but most of it is well done thanks to the wise decision to hide the flaws with darkness and water. If you&apos;re wondering how this compares to the original Anaconda, well, the two really have nothing to do with each other except for presence of an anaconda. The first movie had famous people in it, this one doesn&apos;t. However, this one does have more anacondas! It&apos;s been 7 years since I saw the original, but I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s the better of the two.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that Anacondas wasn&apos;t cheesy ENOUGH! If you&apos;re gonna be bad, then go as far out on the cheesy limb as you can go! Instead of a blood orchid, their research should&apos;ve discovered a rare, Indonesian banana that held the secret to long life. Then once it was discovered the anacondas were eating these things and living forever, one of the bad actors could&apos;ve deadpanned, &quot;What are these things? Bananacondas?&quot; BWAHAHAHAHA! Man, I really need to start writing screenplays for intentionally bad movies.\n\nAnd I&apos;ve said this before, but I&apos;ll say it again. Since &quot;versus&quot; movies are the current sequel trend, they should&apos;ve dug up Harrison Ford (it&apos;s been four years since the guy had a hit), given him the Jack Ryan moniker again, and given *us* Jack Ryan Vs. Anaconda: The Hunt for the Blood Red Orchid in October. He could&apos;ve been the guide for the scientists, and when one of them started whining he could&apos;ve cracked, &quot;Traveling through Borneo ain&apos;t like dusting crops, boy.&quot; Then he would&apos;ve looked into the camera and winked. It&apos;d have been awesome and you know it.\n\nOh, and let me leave with a word of advice. If a bad guy is standing near the edge of an anaconda pit, and he&apos;s holding a gun on one of your colleagues, but his back is to you, then please, for the love of all that is holy, instead of whimpering like someone forced to sit through a post-1987 Corey Feldman movie, stand up and kick the guy in the pit."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen The Monster Maker a couple of times and found it quite enjoyable, despite reading bad reviews about it.\n\nA mad scientist falls in love with a pianist&apos;s daughter when he sees her at one of her dad&apos;s concerts. After he goes round to the scientist&apos;s home one night to tell him to stop sending her flowers, he knocks him out and injects him with a fluid that will give him a disease of the glands and turn him into a monster. He gradually turns over a period of time and goes back to this mad scientist after his doctor recommend him as he has a cure for this disease. Back at the scientist&apos;s home, the scientist straps him to a bed and will only give him a cure if his daughter agrees to marry him. The pianist&apos;s daughter&apos;s lover turns up and kills the mad scientist and the pianist is given the fluid that will cure him by the scientist&apos;s assistant and makes a full recovery.\n\nIn the mad scientist&apos;s laboratory, we get to see a pig that he has been experimenting on, a dog and, best of all, a gorilla (a man in a gorilla suit), which tries to kill the scientist&apos;s assistant.\n\nThere several familiar faces in the cast in this movie: J Carrol Naish (House of Frankenstein), Ralph Morgan (Night Monster) and Glenn Strange (House of Dracula). Also in the cast are Wanda McKay, Tala Birell and Terry Frost.\n\nThe Monster Maker is a must for all sci-fi/horror fans. Great fun.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 5.",

Zeman seems to have an endless bag of tricks that fit the story to a T.\n\nIt&apos;s a perfect sci-fantasy flick in just about every way done in Zeman&apos;s immersive imaginative way. A young &quot;foreign legion&quot; officer finds himself in a sea of conflicts as he tries to help the &quot;girl of his dreams&quot;. All the while the world is facing cataclysm from a &quot;close approaching&quot; comet. Zeman is the master of what I would call, &quot;impressionistic cinema&quot; where surrealism adds immense detail to the story somehow.\n\nThe score is lavish and simple at the same time and pulls you in with it&apos;s odd orchestral intensity and has it&apos;s own surrealism. The action is packed with visual finesse. The actors are comical in the reactions to their situations and there lays a wealth of social commentary. Like the young officer&apos;s pointing out to his &quot;lady in distress&quot; a strange creature making evolutionary transformations before his eyes, only in the reverse order... Lot&apos;s of great &quot;sight gags&quot;.\n\nI&apos;ve lost my VHS copy... too bad!",

      "reviewBody": "Rakshak is one of my top four favourite action movies of all time the other being Telugu movies, Samba, Aravinda Sametha and Vikramarkudu but Rakshak is on top. The story of the movie is unpredictable and credit goes to the great Raghuvaran for his portrayal of a frustrated man to a dreaded antagonist. To build up the character of main protagonist you need a great villain too and here in Rakshak, Raghuvaran gave his one of the best performances with incredible voice modulation. I believe the movie should have been certified adult pertaining to the raunchy sequences between Sunil and Karishma and brutal scenes. The action was one of the best of the 90s. In acting Raghuvaran was above par, Sunil Shetty was brilliant in action and emotion both. Karishma and Sonali both looked beautiful, however the show was stolen by Raveena Tandon with the chartbuster like Shahar ki ladki. The music by Anand Milind was superhit and topped the charts back then in 1996 with songs like Shahar ki ladki, kuchi kuchi and Sundara sundara but the most soulful song was rendered by The great SP Balu sir Zalim jahan Berang hai. Among supporting casts Aruna Irani was phenomenal and Mushtak khan was decent. Overall Rakshak was a bang for the buck in 1996 with superhit music, breathtaking action, some brilliant performances and a decent story.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m surprised at the mixed reviews here, I felt this intimate portrait was really irresistible. felt Karl was irresistible. There&apos;s more to his story than you get here, certainly. It&apos;s part of a very engaging puzzle. I agree with the reviewer who said that somehow KLs work doesn&apos;t seem to appear dated in a way that a lot of YSL does, from even before the 80s. All of KL&apos;s famous bitchiness about YSL is completely repaid by Pierre Berger anwyay. . . it comes with the territory. As Morton Feldman once said &quot;People say it&apos;s not a contest but they&apos;re wrong, it IS a contest and Wagner won, Brahms lost.&quot; Only in this context . . . we witness an instance in which the truth of Feldman&apos;s simplification is rendered more ambiguous. Anyway, I look forward to seeing this movie again.\n\n---\n\nI watched this again. This time I realized as a film it&apos;s not very strong; it&apos;s pretty sloppy in fact. Some of the montages with music I just fast forwarded through this time. And I don&apos;t know where I got any sense of YSL having anything to do with anything in this movie. There is paydirt here though, Lagerfeld, who clearly is never taken aback by any question anybody might likely think to ask. In fact in every instance we discover that whatever you might ask him, Lagerfeld has thought through whatever it is and he he rattles forth with the answer getting it out just about as quickly as humanly possible. He&apos;s extremely funny and quite adorable. Actually this time I noticed that some of the dresses didn&apos;t really float my boat, while some did. My experience was, then, rather different the 2nd time around. I&apos;ve little doubt I&apos;ll watch it again one day.",

      "name": "Soviet fantasy B-movie, worth to check out at least as a curiosity",
      "reviewBody": "I came across this film on TV accidentally and being born in USSR it brought back some sentimental memories, mostly because it is based on Kir Bulichev&apos;s story - this author used to be published in almost every soviet youth magazine - so this made me feel like 12 again Don&apos;t get me wrong - it is quite bad, it was never a hit, and it looked pretty outdated already when it came out at the end of the soviet era. At the time, not only the audience but even the directors were totally mesmerized by the B and C level American trash films - mostly because were so different from everything we saw before that. So this film is clearly an attempt to emulate those foreign films: not even the original Star Wars, Predator or Conan but their cheap imitations. In less than a year my home country quit the USRR in the midst of wars and economic collapse and relations with Russians have been getting worse ever since. So this is a fantasy film (I would not dear to call it a science fiction) from the time and the country that now only remains in the memories and fiction and may be that is why I appreciate it more than it deserves as it gives my this sad memories of the world that doesn&apos;t exist anymore.\n\nThe actors playing the main parts (except Karachentsov who seems to be out of place here) were mostly the young generation that were not yet that popular in non-Russian republics (unlike the older generation that is still loved and admired) even though Zhigunov was star of the Russian knockoff of 3 musketeers (&quot;Gardemarini&quot; series) and Pevtsov (the villain in this movie) went on to become the major heartthrob of Russian cinema over the next decade, none of them are appealing enough to hold the entire film, and director&apos;s decision to cast own wife as a female lead did not help - if both hero and antagonist are trying hard to be Schwarzeneggers (Pevtsov comes close - with over the top ridiculous grimaces), the leading lady is obviously really poor man&apos;s take on every single &quot;Tanya Roberts wearing fur bikini&quot; character from American B movies. The special effects are really lame, not even the &quot;American B movie&quot; lame but rather a &quot;Godzilla wanna-be&quot; lame. And one can feel that it was too obviously aiming at young audience - it is felt in dialogs, and in many scenes, like in a sequence that has a promise and look of a vintage German porn the female lead takes shower in the waterfall, but alas, doesn&apos;t even take of her Stone Age bikini. The film is also gives an interesting alternative of the future where the an astronauts are wearing only soviet red flag - badges - I suppose communism was meant to survive into XXX century.\n\nThe funniest part for the Russian speaker comes when the a soviet astronaut of the future and a savage princess talk with an obvious Russian yuppie accents and seem to be almost embarrassed to be doing all this adolescent ninja staff.\n\nOn a positive note however, even with all of this criticism, the film has more heart and plot than most of its foreign sources of inspiration. It is pretty interesting, and pretty fun, even though in a masterpiece theater kind of way."

      "reviewBody": "I first saw &apos;Danger:Diabolik&apos; on British television when I was 5 years old, peeking from behind the sofa when I was supposed to be in bed  fast asleep. The next morning I thought the whole experience had been a vivid and bizarre dream. The film has fascinated me ever since.\n\nMario Bava&apos;s film is a hallucinatory, artistic, but undercooked and under-budgeted concoction which never quite coheres into the film we want it to be. &apos;Danger: Diabolik&apos; nonetheless conjures up some masterful cult moments that richly reward the intrepid viewer who is willing to brave (and embrace) some ropey filler scenes and awful dubbing.\n\nThe magic of this film is sometimes missed by the casual viewer, and many of those who I have lent my copy to have simply stopped watching half way through, as the plot gets bogged down in the muddled, leaden Valmont scenes.\n\nThe magic of this film for me lies in this childhood connection that I have. Diabolik is indeed (as many viewers have pointed out) amoral and selfish. He kills people and lives only for his hedonistic indulgence. But this isn&apos;t really the point. Diabolik&apos;s greed is a metaphor of all our material greed and fantasies of self-indulgence [for more on this, see the definitive article on &apos;Danger:Diabolik&apos; on the &apos;dvd savant&apos; website] Diabolik, in all his piecing glances, hystrionic leaping, minimal dialogue, fetishistic costumes, and designer love parlours is very much like an irrational, inexplicable dream that we read our own meanings and desires into. Diabolik is a hypnotic, mysterious figure beyond judgement and law; he&apos;s not a real person in any way, and is not supposed to be one. His love for Eva is an erotic, wet dream and has nothing to do with anything except sensual pleasure and wish-fulfillment, and these scenes linger on as if the editor had forgotten to cut the film.\n\nBava denies us (or is perhaps incapable of constructing) a conventional, well-paced narrative, or a palatable, structured story. Instead he gives us a psychadelic reverie. A string of moments to enjoy and remember. Oh, and some really crap bits too, there&apos;s no denying!\n\nDON&apos;T WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU HAVE A SHORT, MTV ATTENTION SPAN OR NO APPRECIATION OF EURO-TRASH / PSYCHOTRONIC CINEMA.\n\nI agree that &apos;Danger:Diabolik&apos; isn&apos;t everything it could be, but it almost succeeds in achieving pop-art genius on several occasions. Definitely worth checking out. Just put your normal movie expectations aside for this one and you might love it!\n\nIf you are a big fan of &apos;Danger:Diabolik&apos;, or just feel like debating it, please feel free to email me!...."

      "reviewBody": "At this point in horror history, long gone are the simple, yet effective, &quot;By-the-numbers&quot; slasher flicks. Everything has to be bigger and better than the last big thing. What Kill Theory does NOT do, is be an innovative force. It doesn&apos;t try to create the next big gimmick for horror movies to come. What it DOES do, and well I might add, is take everything that has made slashers work in the past, and incorporate that into a very competently made modern slasher flick.\n\nOne of the things I liked most about Kill Theory, is that there really isn&apos;t a main character. There is no obvious hero, there isn&apos;t really a &quot;Red herring&quot; so to speak. The film puts together a decent ensemble of people, some of whom are recognizable from past efforts, some were unknowns. For me, I immediately noticed Theo Rossi, and Taryn Manning from Sons Of Anarchy, an excellent show if you haven&apos;t checked it out yet. I also recognized Daniel Franzese from &quot;Bully&quot;. Overall though, Each character appears to be as important as the last. It never emphasizes one character over an other.\n\nThe concept is interesting. It&apos;s not something new, but it&apos;s done very well, and keeps you engaged in the story, instead of waiting for the next kill. Normally in modern slashers, I&apos;ve completely tuned the &quot;Story&quot; out, and I&apos;m sitting in anticipation for the next piece of visual effects put on display. Speaking of effects, there are plenty of scenes of blood and gore in the film, which are also done very well. So if you&apos;re looking for some grue and grime, you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised by the level of gritty violence and gore.\n\nThe pacing was perfect. Sitting at a brisk 81 minutes, the film takes no time setting things in motion. There is a &quot;Whodunit&quot; aspect to the film, but it never harps on it. You don&apos;t see the &quot;Killer&apos;s&quot; face until the end of the film, but it doesn&apos;t make it a big &quot;Reveal&quot; moment,and those of us who have been keeping up to date on slashers, will immediately recognize his voice.\n\nIf you&apos;re thirsting for a slasher film, and if you&apos;re like me, and are sick of the &quot;Saw&quot; franchise, and it&apos;s imitators, give Kill Theory a shot. It may not be the next big thing, but it takes different elements that made classic slashers work, and put them together in a fun, bloody, competent package.\n\n3.5/5 - napalmfuzz\n\nhttp://liberaldead.blogspot.com",

He has to leave home, so he hires a nurse (Sarah Ball) to watch both of them.\n\nThe son locks out the nurse and cares for his mother. This proves to be extremely embarrassing to Mom. And, if two pills are prescribed, then taking a dozen or more will get you better quicker. Mom went from embarrassment to fear.\n\nThe sinking into schizophrenia is disturbing and frenetic and may upset some viewers, but it is an emotion packed film that bears watching.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always liked Giménez Cacho&apos;s work. He&apos;s usually a solid actor but, in this one, he looks like a zombie; and it&apos;s not because his part demanded so but for the weakness of the screenplay. If we are talking about jealous (a thing this movie is based on), it should be reflected almost in an animal way; it&apos;s about instinct and reactions right from the guts, blind rage and a mad love one step shy of hurting the one you care about. In Aranda&apos;s film, this is treated just as a matter of personality, like an accident in life or even in the way you may perceive things. My guess is that since the film doesn&apos;t go far beyond the words on paper --to a place where it should actually reach, considering the complexity of the main plot--, this was a no win chance for Cacho as well as Gijón; and everyone else involved too.\n\n The main problem of Celos (Jealous) is that you don&apos;t buy the story right from the start because it&apos;s impossible to. No matter how willing you are to get INTO the movie, you cant; it´s a fact. Mainly because if you have been a witness on how somebody&apos;s extreme jealous makes his life a living hell, then you&apos;ll realize how hollow the subject is taken here. And besides being a terrible state of mind it&apos;s also a common one, so I think it&apos;s not that strange to have known somebody like that. But in the film there&apos;s no passion, it lacks real visceral reactions and wiser ways to show a conflicted mind (at least one better than just a man talking to himself). The only way they let us know how really obsessed is this guy (Cacho) with one of his fiancee past relationship, is by showing him traveling long distances and talking to weird persons to get to find the ex boyfriend, which would lead to an answer and then to a cure for his torture; that&apos;s the way he sees it.\n\nI believe the message here is that a real deep love may hurt the other person if you don&apos;t keep your mouth shut to not let go out your worst doubts from the past, and then inflict an unnecessary pain on your partner. Just give and take love as it is. Realize that, if you&apos;re not a teen, then all of your relationships got to be second hand. Just take a look over your shoulder and take a count on yours. But, as I said before, if Celos doesn&apos;t make an impact on us is because it suffers from a severe lack of real human factor: serious reactions, flesh and blood bodies and lots of pain, something that cannot be felt without depth in dialogues and believable stages of grief. In it&apos;s whole atmosphere it sure fails, but is not an awful movie; nevertheless, in terms of depth, tension, twists and intensity, it&apos;s vague and pointless, so you may find it kind of boring every now and then through the experience.",

The best thing is the photography, however-- in particular the dance scene, in which the camera follows Fonda and Caan as they move through a crowded outdoor dance floor without every losing either focus or the stars. Breathtaking.  Some great mountains somewhere in Wyoming come close to stealing the show.",

It&apos;s a well written tale and extremely well directed. To take this screenplay and bringing it to life and to extract such great acting from the kids is a serious director&apos;s job and kudos to Linklater for having done that so well.\n\nIt&apos;s a tribute to all those rock bands that have inspired over the years and this movie played a big part for my introduction to Rock music. A bunch of school guys form a band with the help of their teacher. Rather the teacher forms a band with help of school kids assigning them a job and its their journey from becoming a band to making songs. Passionate is how I would say the acting of Jack Black was as he lead the film all through bearing the weight solely on his shoulders.\n\nThere was no big star cast except him in the movie and this modest film budget did not allow the movie to explore may be. However, this movie is extremely well made in all departments. Production deign, editing must be given appreciation. editor for sure would have had a major job to have the unwanted and unnecessary things out. \n\nThe music selection is also top notch with apt songs coming at the right time.\n\nIt&apos;s 4/5 for one of the best musical movies ever.",

      "reviewBody": "From the original script of director Sam Peckinpah, who first penned this rousing western tale of Calvary vs Indians arises this movie called &quot; The Glory Guys &quot;. Contrary to other films of the genre, this film allows the Native Americas to win an occasional battle. But other credits supplement it as well. The beautiful outdoors, the exciting bar-room brawl and the spacious land conflict called for by a good script. Within the story of myopic Gen. Frederick McCabe (Andrew Duggan) who seeks a glorious victory over the southwestern tribes at any price, is an inner one dealing with two men Capt. Demas Harrod (Tom Tyron) and Chief of Scouts Sol Rogers, (Harve Presnell) who love the same lovely woman named Louisa Woddard (Senta Berger). Although rivals, they bear a mutual respect for each other. Demas is an experienced officer carrying a bitter grudge against General McCabe who sacrifices his men without compunction. His main concern are his raw recruits who he feels deserve better than to be sacrificial fodder for the general. Rogers seeks to settle down, marry and become a farmer. Slim Pickens plays Sgt. James Gregory and rightly garners much praise for his convincing, steadfast role. James Caan and an equally young Wayne Rogers are impressive and complementary characters in the movie. Their fine acting and the film&apos;s dramatic action makes for excellent viewing. The musical score is patriotically stirring and further enhances the movie. Recommended for all interested viewers***",

The love story is uninteresting and unnecessary. The film plot should be about new pilots&apos; training and frankly this is hardly seen, although may have been the main focus of interest. Fess Parker and Chuck Connors (among the best of the film) do appear in small roles. So in the end the best thing about this movie is 3D: although there are not special effects -not even great aircraft fights- the restoration makes it bright and gives us an ultimate approximation to those years&apos; stereoscopic experience.",

The German Navy commander is fanatical, ruthless, confident, arrogant, intelligent and shrewd. Both of them spend some time trying to pull one over on the other, and they both know each other knows that, so they spend a little time playing a cat and mouse game while trying to gain the upper hand. Keith&apos;s captain drinks a little whiskey and plots with resolute calm. The German sings a few Nazi songs and plots with resolute calm. Then they both put their schemes into action.\n\nI like all the acting here and the wet , cloudy , but bright green Irish landscapes. This is a fascinating World War II story that takes place neither on the battlefield or some goofy nostalgic homefront, but still contains plenty of action and thrilling suspense. When you watch it, emulate Brian Keith and drink a glass of whiskey.",

But compared to the Korean original, it&apos;s just absolute garbage.\n\nI&apos;m glad I saw this version first as when I watched the original, I wasn&apos;t as shook up as I may have been with how the plot unfolds. The Korean version is in every way superior and much more dark, but this film is a much more simplified version of he story and a decent B movie if you haven&apos;t seen the original.\n\nIt&apos;s worth watching, but watch the original too.",

I guess the popularity of that title is why Lions Gate selected to make this appear as a sequel when it&apos;s actually the first film. Kim Jee-Woon&apos;s Memories has a woman lost in the streets without any memory of who she is. She has one phone number that she keeps trying to call but when she can&apos;t reach anyone she just continues to walk around hoping her memory will return. Nonzee Nimibutr&apos;s The Wheel has an old man dying and leaving behind puppets, which are cursed and start to come to life. Peter Ho-Sun Chan&apos;s Going Home has a cop searching for his missing son when he is kidnapped by a man who keeps his &quot;wife&quot; locked inside their apartment. These three films aren&apos;t any good but the first and third one are the most interesting. The second film dealing with the puppet is quite poor without any good moment. The first and third stories are the best."

I&apos;m not sure why it was canceled but the thing comes as a major disappointment. Greg Mank, Tom Weaver, Roger Corman, Joe Dante, Wim Winders, John Saxon, Peter Bogdanovich and other discuss the &quot;B&quot; movie director who many consider a genius. I&apos;m not that big of a fan of Ulmer so I was hoping this documentary would show me what I was missing but it certainly didn&apos;t do that. All of those giving interviews seem to not know what to say and for the most part they don&apos;t say a thing. We get clips from films like The Black Cat, The Man From Planet X and various others but that&apos;s about it. I&apos;m sure Mank and Weaver had stuff to say about these films but they give comments like &quot;that was creepy&quot;. Bogdanovich has a taped interview with Ulmer, which gets played some throughout the documentary but not enough because what he says is a lot more interesting than anything else here."

It&apos;s been a while since I last saw this movie and I only hope the DVD quality is as rich and colorful as the VHS release was.

      "reviewBody": "Key Largo is just one of John Huston&apos;s many memorable films that somehow always seem to transcend the intention--the Hollywood intention being to make a few bucks--and to this day still plays very well and indeed appears as something close to a work of art. It features what I think is one of Edward G. Robinson&apos;s finest performances as Johnny Rocco, a sociopathic gangster holding the off-season personnel of a seaside hotel hostage as he concludes a counterfeit money deal.\n\nThe story begins as Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) pays a visit to the family of one of his G.I. buddies who was killed in Italy during WWII. He finds the welcome from the hotel&apos;s only &quot;guests&quot; chilly except for Gaye Dawn (a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name) played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel&apos;s owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) have been tricked into allowing Rocco&apos;s gang to stay and now, as a tropical storm begins to blow, are being held at gunpoint. McCloud&apos;s delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn&apos;t murder everyone.\n\nNote that this is a splendid cast, and they all do a good job. Note too that Huston adapted this from a play by the versatile American playwright Maxwell Anderson. So the ingredients for a good film are clearly in place; and aside from some self-conscious mishmash with the Seminoles of Florida, this is a success. Anderson&apos;s desire to explore the psychopathic personality (some years later he adapted William March&apos;s novel The Bad Seed into a stage play) finds realization in Huston&apos;s direction and especially in Robinson&apos;s indelible performance. The utter disregard for the lives of others and the obsessive love of self that characterize the sociopath reek from the snares and callous laughter of the very sick Johnny Rocco. I especially liked the crazed and thrilled grin on his face when he emerges from the hold of the boat in the climactic scene, gun in hand, imagining that he has once again fooled his adversaries and is about to delightfully shoot Humphrey Bogart to death. What I loved about this scene was that Huston did not think it necessary to contrive a fight in which the good guy (Bogart) beats the bad guy by fighting fair. What happens is exactly what should happen, and without regard for the fine points of Marquis of Queensberry-type rules. Also good is Rocco beginning to sweat in fear of his life as the storm moves in while Bogey gives us his famous laugh and grin as he assesses the essential cowardice of the petty gangster.\n\nLauren Bacall, in one of her more modest roles, does a lot without saying much, and Lionel Barrymore is very good as the cantankerous old guy in a wheelchair. Claire Trevor actually won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work, and she was good as the alcoholic moll with a heart of gold. Robinson won nothing, but he really dominated the picture and demonstrated why he was one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest stars.\n\nBottom line: watch this to see the gangster yarn meld into film noir with overtones of the psychoanalytical drama that characterized many of the black and white Hollywood films of the forties and early fifties.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t imagine anything thinking that &quot;Airport &apos;77&quot; is a great movie. After all, it takes the usual &quot;Airport&quot; formula and throws it into a premise that is not only bizarre but rather silly. Yet, oddly, despite this, the movie IS enjoyable and worth seeing.\n\nA rich guy has arranged for a private luxury 747 airliner to bring friends and loved ones to a big party. What no one realizes, however, is that several members of the crew are planning on using knockout gas to take control of the plane and then land it on some abandoned airport in the Bahamas. Apparently, it&apos;s all because they plan on stealing some paintings aboard the plane....though this seemed like silly motivation. I would have also considered ransoming off the passengers...which they aren&apos;t planning on doing.\n\nSpeaking of not planning....the overly complicated plan goes awry when the plane is flying under radar and accidentally collides with some beacon. IMDB says fog was responsible....I never noticed fog in this scene at all. Regardless, the plan crash lands in the ocean and soon sinks in what IMDB says is about 100 feet of water*. The cabin has managed to stay air tight....at least for now. But with air running out, is there any chance at rescue?\n\nDespite a totally ludicrous premise, the film manages to make it all seem possible...which it surely isn&apos;t as you continue watching the story. Regardless, the story IS engaging and interesting. I did find it unusual that Jack Lemmon of all people plays a bit of an action hero! But still, it does manage to entertain and it sure kept me glued to the screen.\n\n*Although they said the plane was a hundred feet down, this really could NOT have been the case, as the pilot swimming to the surface clearly would have been highly unlikely (that is a LONG way to free dive for someone untrained) and if he had survived, he likely would have been a physical mess as a result of decompression. Here, it all looked too easy to be that deep and the water clarity made it seem like the plane was about 50 feet down...from which a dive to the surface is much, much more likely to result in survival. I&apos;ve made such dives to the surface myself....which isn&apos;t easy but is so much safer and easier than from 100 feet.",

      "reviewBody": "After filming a few bits on the revue musical Elstree Calling, Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s next full feature directing job was on this terrible adaptation of Sean O&apos;Casey&apos;s popular play. A long-suffering Irish family struggles to get by during the Irish Civil War. Matriarch &quot;Juno&quot; (Sara Allgood, who had played the role on the stage as well) tries to get layabout drunk husband Captain Boyle (Edward Chapman), whom she refers to as the &quot;Paycock&quot; (peacock) due to his strutting vanity, to find work to help support the family, which includes daughter Mary (Kathleen O&apos;Regan), a worker on strike, and son Johnny (John Laurie), a former IRA fighter left bitter and resentful after an injury resulted in the loss of an arm. When the Captain learns that he&apos;s come into a generous inheritance, the family thinks that their fortunes may have finally brightened, only for tragedy to occur. Also featuring Marie O&apos;Neill, Sidney Morgan, Dave Morris, and John Longden (the policeman boyfriend from Blackmail).\n\nI&apos;m not familiar with O&apos;Casey&apos;s play, but if this film is an indication, it&apos;s awful. Hitchcock made the conscious decision to abstain from any cinematic style, and attempted to present this as a largely static filmed play, rendering the already-tedious proceedings even more unbearable. Allgood isn&apos;t bad, but the rest of the cast is forgettable at best. The original play had starred Barry Fitzgerald as the Captain, and he makes his film debut here as a speech-making rabble-rouser at the movie&apos;s start. Perhaps Hitchcock thought that Barry&apos;s Nosferatu-with-a-bad-wig look wasn&apos;t camera-friendly enough to reprise his lead role. This is definitely my least favorite Hitchcock film.",

Don´t take this flick too serious in any way, folks! It´s the purest stupidity but great fun to watch! John Woo-star Chow Yun Fat is in, but his role is small and not very important for the film. Just another movie to laugh your head off! Highly recommended for your next trash video party!!!"

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been seen by most film buffs many, many years ago on late night TV. If you are like me, it was an interesting film purely as a reference point for a young George Lucas. If you remembered it at all, it was for the use of white space and the long periods during which almost nothing discernible happens.\n\nWell, it is almost 35 years later (35 YEARS!) and for reasons best known to film and DVD marketers, George Lucas has pulled it out of the vaults. Instead of just transferring the original print to new film stock, Lucas has re-cut several critical scenes; added a tasteful bit of CGI; zipped up the sound track and film score; and, best of all, turned it into the best reason yet for digital projection. Whether this is the original version he had in his head as a 26-year-old or one that he has fleshed out over the years is sort of beside the point. What is on the screen now is definitely worth your $10.\n\nYes, it is still a bit tedious at times (in a &apos;2001: A Space Odyssey&apos; kind of way) and, yes, the plot holes and infamous continuity issues are still there.\n\nBut, Wow! The plot is a weird stew in which an allegorical Adam and Eve story is crossed with &apos;Brave New World.&apos; (The Catholic act of confession will never be the same after you see it re-imagined here.) The crystal clear cinematography is a revelation. The characters&apos; multiple layers are wonderful. Donald Pleasence&apos;s performance as the would-be leader/rebel is downright creepy. The way the camera lingers on a scene rather than quick cutting for effect is a welcome relief. This is adult subject matter and it is not what you expect out of Lucas. You have to ask why he didn&apos;t pursue themes like this in later films. (Who knows, maybe the upcoming Darth Vader fest will return us to the dark side.) \n\nBe forewarned, this is not a casual film that you can sit back and munch popcorn while it plays out in front of you. This is definitely art-house fare by a young director finding his chops.\n\nMany of the message boards and most of the reviews of this film point out how many elements carry over to later Lucas films. (C3PO, the climactic chase scene, drones in service to masters, etc.) For me, the touchstone is not for Lucas, but for the Executive Producer, Francis Ford Coppola. Many of the themes explored in THX show up in Coppola&apos;s &apos;The Conversation&apos; three years later. Gene Hackman&apos;s Harry Caul character is a clone of Robert Duvall&apos;s loner forced to confront a faceless progenitor. See if you don&apos;t agree.\n\nThough they are releasing the film to theaters ahead of the DVD release, the place to see it is in a theater with digital projection. Similar to &apos;Lawrence of Arabia,&apos; much of the action takes place in the far corners of the scene and I can&apos;t imagine seeing this on anything less than a very large HDTV screen.",

While all of this is going on he stumbles into the attack where he finds a box chained up. He breaks into it and finds a mirror, which he hangs up and soon enough all sorts of gory and crazy murders are happening.\n\nIttenbach&apos;s BLACK PAST is typical of the splatter slashers that were coming out of Germany during this era. If you&apos;re looking for great performances and high art then you&apos;re not going to find it here but, then again, why on Earth would you come to a film like this an expect that? If you&apos;re looking for non-stop gore and over-the-top and vile nastiness then Ittenbach certainly won&apos;t let you down.\n\nThe one thing that has always amazed me about these German splatter films is that they were filmed on peanuts yet they always managed to have wonderful special effects. Just compare the effects in this film to countless direct-to-VHS movies that were coming out of America. Rarely did those films feature any gore and what it did show were rather amateur effects. More times than not they simply had someone off camera shooting blood around. These special effects here are all rather creative and there&apos;s no question that they go highly over-the-top in the amount of gore.\n\nYou&apos;ve pretty much got various decapitations, non-stop skin slashing, several scenes where eyes are damaged ala Lucio Fulci and there&apos;s no telling how many gallons of blood were used. Obviously if you have a weak stomach you will want to stay away from this film. The &quot;story&quot; itself isn&apos;t the greatest but it&apos;s good enough to keep you entertained whenever there isn&apos;t any gore going on."

      "reviewBody": "OK, I&apos;ll say up front that this movie features only 1 AC/DC song (the title track) in the very beginning. At the end there&apos;s a good cover of &quot;It&apos;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;, and somewhere in the middle is a bizarre country version of &quot;TNT&quot;. Hardcore fans might recognize a song by Fraternity, Bon Scott&apos;s band before he sang for AC/DC.\n\nBut this movie isn&apos;t really for hardcore AC/DC fans, it&apos;s for everyone. Rather than the music of AC/DC, it focuses on the mischief and mayhem caused by 4 loser friends in their late 20s, twelve years after their rock&apos;n&apos;roll dreams burned out.\n\nIt&apos;s a road movie, meaning there&apos;s not much of a plot other than a bunch of guys being on the road most of the time. Strange, almost random scenes happen along the way, and that&apos;s what the fun is about.\n\nMy favourite parts were: the creepy gas station guy and his &quot;surprise&quot;, the crazed wheelchair rugby team, the Korean mafia (stick around after the credits), the argument over what letter should mark the spot (X?), and of course the two terminally stupid &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot; fans who take the lyrics of &quot;Jailbreak&quot; too literally.\n\nSome might say that this film has deeper themes about loyalty to friends and youth, and about staying true to dreams despite getting older. But nah, I just see it as a wacky road movie.\n\n&quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is pretty tame, not too much swearing and only one sexual situation. There are some references to drug use and 1 gross-out scene involving drugs and a toilet (and other things that go in toilets). But other than that it&apos;s mostly family-friendly.\n\nThree years after making &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, director Darren Ashton would make &quot;Razzle Dazzle: A Journey into Dance&quot; which is my all-time fave Aussie comedy and one of the funniest comedies I&apos;ve ever seen. For Ashton fans: these 2 movies are very different. While &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; has a cheeky Christopher-Guest-type of humour, &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is more physical and in-your-face like maybe &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;.\n\nOther similar Aussie comedies I recommend are Alex Proyas&apos;s &quot;Garage Days&quot; about a struggling band trying to get their first big break, and &quot;The Wannabees&quot; about a team of foul-mouthed crooks who somehow become the nation&apos;s most popular children&apos;s show. See them all and maybe you&apos;l agree, Aussie comedy rocks.",

      "reviewBody": "Now that I&apos;ve recently watched &quot;Beaches&quot; I feel like I need to watch this again, to compare which chick-flick I like more. Those two, plus &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; tend to be mentioned together as ultimate weepy chick-flicks, and I&apos;ve seen them all, but I don&apos;t remember liking this one quite as much as &quot;Beaches&quot;. I&apos;ll have to watch again to see...\n\nUPDATE: I watched it again, and I have to say there was far more laughter than tears here, which I appreciate. &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988) actually made me cry more than this one, which surprised me, given the reputation of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989) as being one of the ultimate tearjerkers. But, this movie shows that it&apos;s not the amount of tears, but the quality of them that makes for a great tearjerker!\n\nThe subject of losing a loved one was handled with rage, comic relief, and ultimately grace. It made me cry, without bringing me totally down, which is a kind of miracle, really.\n\nThis is a tearjerker, but not a bitter one, like &quot;Miss You Already&quot; is- instead, it was one wherein, as I traveled through life with these women, I felt less resentment, and had fewer regrets, despite the bitter-sweetness of it all. This movie managed to take what could be very depressing subject-matter, and inject dignity and an uplifting quality into it. By the end, I didn&apos;t feel like cursing the Almighty for allowing such suffering (as I sort of did with &quot;Miss You Already&quot; and to a lesser degree, &quot;Beaches&quot;), instead, by the end, I just had a line said by Dolly Parton&apos;s character lingering in my heart- i.e. &quot;God works in mysterious ways.&quot; And somehow, that made it alright and gave me such comfort!\n\nYes, this is a tearjerker, but like it&apos;s tagline says, &quot;It&apos;s the funniest film that&apos;ll ever make you cry!&quot; As I said, it&apos;s far more laughter than tears here, and I mean laugh out loud moments! So, be prepared to laugh til you cry with this one! It is indeed a classic! Do I like it more than &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988) though? No, I don&apos;t think so, cause I have a soft spot for Bette Midler and her Easy Listening music and her comedic ways. That said, this one is right up there with it, and definitely one of the best of its kind!",

Just keep that cheery thought in mind as you suffer through this. Morgus has been off the air since Katrina hit, but said in a posting to his online fan site that he&apos;s hoping to return to the airwaves. Fortunately, his leather-clad fetish-boy assistant Chopsley made it safely through the storm as well. The New Orleans laboratory is described as miraculously intact, and he&apos;s working on an invention which will present such a catastrophe from ever happening again. Sleep well, America!"

      "reviewBody": "A film about Jane Austen, one of the greatest writers of English literature, will garner expectations and hopes, especially with a cascade of stars newly discovered (James McAvoy, Anne Hathaway) and well-established (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell). That it focuses on her life before she becomes a writer certainly had not dulled my appetite.\n\nThe 22 yr old Austen is played by the very pretty Anne Hathaway, who you&apos;ll know from Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada. We meet her family when her older sister is happily married. The cash-strapped parents have the pressing problem of finding eligible young Jane a husband. A promising offer is the stuck-up relative of wealthy Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith), who Jane rejects.\n\nLet&apos;s meet Tom Lefroy. He&apos;s a penniless, charming, intelligent, apprentice lawyer. He also loves boxing, drinking and the fairer sex. These latter hobbies, mind you, do not endear him to his uncle, the imperious Judge Langlois, who promptly sentences him to a summer in Hampshire as punishment. In a rustic backdrop of dancing and match-making, Jane and Tom develop a teasing, flirtatious rapport. Unlike the other men in her life, Tom presents Jane with intellectual company as well as dashing good looks and a flair for the odd chat-up. As they grow more serious about each other, they become equally aware of how doomed their relationship is - something their elders twigged on page one. But Tom has given Jane something she needs - the knowledge of the heart that will impassion her writing.\n\nFirstly be warned. If you are expecting a nice feel-good movie, don&apos;t bother. This made me thoroughly miserable. Not just because a poignant lonely destiny is too much to bear, but because it&apos;s a wasted opportunity to bring a great life to the screen. Our ultimate theme Austen&apos;s writing, yet we see little to convince that this bland and photogenic girl has much between the ears. In Devil Wears Prada, an outstanding script enabled Hathaway to suggest hidden brainpower. In Becoming Jane, the occasionally erudite lines sound leaden and false. Her body language, meant to portray a rebel, seems a bit anachronistic. Although she looks quite resplendent, dashing across the hills in a billowing red dress to watch the lads skinny-dipping, the film is a sad disappointment in the development of Hathaway&apos;s otherwise promising career. Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman (who were apparently also considered for the role) might well have fared better: they have a depth and experience that could perhaps have compensated for such a clunky script. Maggie Smith and other strong actors are reduced to ciphers and little more than icing on a badly made cake.\n\nOn the other hand, James McAvoy (fresh from The Last King of Scotland) is a revelation. In what seems like a flash of brilliance in the generally myopic casting, he shines in every scene. A talented actor, he also brings his skills in boxing and sport to imbue Lefroy with vibrancy and charisma. It is when he works his seductive charms on Jane that he also brings out the best in his co-star. After her first adult kiss, Jane trembles, wondering if she has done it well. Hathaway does gooey-eyed emotion much better than persuading us she is a genius about to happen. The film gathers pace as we are drawn into an emotional cat and mouse. Jane&apos;s &apos;experience of the heart&apos; that will inspire her, is the one of the best things about the film, second only to the large and constantly moist dollops of budget-saving Irish countryside.\n\nBut how does the film reflect on Jane Austen the author? Austen&apos;s possible flirtations with Mr Thomas Langlois Lefroy are more speculative than fact. Historian Jon Spence worked as a consultant on the film and has written a book of the same name, which is probably a must-have for Austen fans. He gives attention to the inspiration he feels Lefroy gave to Jane, and this is developed into actual events in the movie.\n\nAusten is one of the most influential and revered novelists of the early nineteenth century and her social commentary is marked with a strong sense of irony. Devotees will no doubt enjoy scenes such as the one where she corrects Tom&apos;s uncle on the definition of the word &apos;irony&apos;. But the transition from girlishness to mastery with words is so contrived that it could almost be two parallel scripts.\n\nThere are many that will love Becoming Jane in spite of its imperfections. The rest of us might wish it had been told better.",

      "reviewBody": "Have you always been fascinated by the Bermuda Triangle mystery? Would you also like to know more about the mystical forces or possible extraterrestrial activities that are at large on the ocean&apos;s floor? Well, then I suggest you watch National Geographic or dive into the relevant Wikipedia pages, because you most certainly won&apos;t find any answers in this largely goofy &amp; low-budgeted Spanish/Italian co-production! It does, on the other hand, provide a good hour and half of brainless (albeit utterly senseless) exploitation entertainment for fans of sharks, demented plots, underwater footage and the ravishingly beautiful Janet Agren.\n\nThe beginning of the film is admittedly very intriguing, as it starts with the sudden return of professional diver/adventurer Andres Montoya after he, and an entire ship with crew, inexplicably vanished at sea more than six months ago. Andres doesn&apos;t have any recollection of where he spent the past half year, but it doesn&apos;t bother him too much. He gets back together with his fiance Angelica, even though she hooked up with his brother in the meantime, and cheerfully visits illegal cock-fight events. Andres is then hired by the despicable Arthur Kennedy to dive up a valuable box that got lost during a plane crash, and he realizes that he&apos;s drawn back to the mysterious bottom of the Bermuda area.\n\nIt must be highlighted that, even though completely random and disconnected from the rest of the film, &quot;Cave of the Sharks&quot; contains one very atmospheric and uncanny sequence. In a sort of flashback, a bunch of people on a yacht suddenly all become hypnotized and stoically step into the sea. One of the group&apos;s member is a little girl with the world&apos;s ugliest and creepiest doll, which is a cheap horror trick, I reckon, but still very effective. Furthermore, there also are sleeping (!) sharks, bare-knuckle fights and lots of nasty back-stabbing acts from Kennedy&apos;s character. The finale is extremely violent and doesn&apos;t solve anything, but that&apos;s exactly how we like our Italian cult!",

      "reviewBody": "Having no idea this movie even existed, I was surprised to come across it late one night on cable. I thought it might be good for a few laughs. While it is worth a chuckle or two, ultimately it&apos;s not as much fun as I hoped it would be. The plot&apos;s a rather involved one that starts in the 1970s where a crazy soldier who was part of a mission to take down a werewolf injects himself with werewolf blood. For reasons, I guess. Then he&apos;s cryogenically frozen for twenty years by bad guy Barry Bostwick. In the present day of the 1990s, some scientists led by Kim Delaney are working on creating a new type of artificial skin to treat cancer patients and the like. Bostwick comes in and takes over the experiment, forcing them to test their new skin on his frozen werewolf guy. Long story unfortunately not short enough, the werewolf awakens with super strong skin that makes him even more indestructible than he already was. He goes on a killing spree and you can pretty much figure out the rest. It&apos;s a cheaply filmed bit of business with Kane Hodder in the cheesy werewolf costume. Barry Bostwick provides some fun but Kim Delaney treats the whole thing more seriously than it deserves. It&apos;s goofy and unintentionally funny at times but, as I said already, never as much fun as you want it to be. Still it&apos;s pretty watchable so give it a shot if you like low-budget &apos;90s horror.",

Like opening a tin of sardines, leaving it out in the sun all day, then eating it just before he goes for his medical exam. But he is drafted anyway. He is tormented by the usual stupid sergeant who, barking guttural commands, keeps ordering him to fling himself down and pick himself up. Except that the places picked for this exercise are knee-deep in mud.\n\nThe hero makes it through the war safely and one day in a Berlin street-car, hears an officious, strangely familiar voice bullying passive passengers. It is the conductor who is his old sergeant, in uniform again! Eye to eye, neither can believe what he sees. Suddenly the conductor starts barking orders at him and old reflexes take over; he flings himself to the floor of the street car. up, down, up, down. End.\n\nThe above doesn&apos;t give an idea of how funny it all is, but consider it was made in 1952, just seven years after the German disaster of World War II, and clearly by a German team wanting to ridicule German militarism and you see the possibilities.\n\nThe real humor, though, comes from the English voice-over of Henry Morgan, brilliant, cynical, sarcastic radio comedian of the 30s. I believe he wrote all the belly-laugh wisecracks in the commentary. They certainly sounded like him."

It&apos;s the story of a strong, firm link that will keep a husband and a wife together during and after her artificially induced sleep.  She gets hybernated due to an illness that had no cure at the time.  While dealing with the pain with the help of Irene, a common friend of theirs, David (The husband) remenisces this beautiful story since its beginning:  The pictures taken in Venice&apos;s Piazza San Marco, making love to her, their numerous walks.\n\nShe will wake up after twenty years and her love for him is still the same. Albeit their strong feelings and the fact that they are together again, David has aged and won&apos;t have enough time to make up for the years he spent apart from his loved one.\n\nI have been looking for this movie for the longest time without any success. If there is anyone who can point me out to some websites that might have this movie please let me know.  Thanks."

      "reviewBody": "This is rational and perspective review:\n\nIf created in US, this movie would be laughable, ridiculed by all, and reduced to its own special place on a shelf in your local video store. The main actor would receive invitation to be an extra in a movie directed by Dolf Lundgren, and from there he would slowly grow as an actor, until the highlight of his career will be playing a bodyguard for a villain in a movie directed by Uwe Boll.\n\nBut since it&apos;s not, since this was created in Chile and has this special exotic smell, it goes to film festivals and gets screenings at the theaters. The main actor will still receive invitation to be in a Dolf Lundgren&apos;s movie, but that is not the point.\n\nThe movie looks like an amateur action/martial arts movie, but actually has a little more to offer. \n\nThe martial arts are good, and although it&apos;s not Tony Jaa good, the important thing is that it looks and feels very real. That is a first achievement. There are some funny scenes, sort of self humor, that have this WTF? potential and will make you laugh. Like when the Mirageman jumps from height to land bad on the hard asphalt, and then he rubs his foot, like it really hurt him. This small self humor is another achievement.\n\nThe story is rubbish, of course, full with melodramatic moments and silly situations. The production value is very poor, some of the street scenes were filmed with hidden camera and the reaction of people is real.\n\nThe Mirageman is not bold thematically, and mainly uses primitive and stereotypical tearful situations to awake some emotions in the viewer and create an empathy toward the heroic protagonist. You will find just a little complexity in this movie. \n\nBut Mirageman explores some difficult issues too, like what people are capable of in order to get famous, the price of fame and what is it mean to be a hero and what are the reasons to be one. \n\nOverall the watching experience is very decent, and it even gets some big reinforcement by the ending, which is surprisingly good. The ending puts all the movie in the correct proportions, tights properly the plot, and delivers the movie as a good and solid product. The ending is the final and the biggest achievement.",

I&apos;ve been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.\n\nWow...\n\nI guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. Time and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor, but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow...\n\nI actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.\n\nWow...\n\nWhy it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator&apos;s brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.\n\nWow...\n\nWhy Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while.",

The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. \n\nIn Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? \n\nShall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.",

This film leads us through the reunification of a father and son after 20 odd years as the son visits his dad in Old Crow - an old and dying settlement in the Yukon. Jr. comes from the city and likes to drink and party. There&apos;s absolutely nothing in common between the father and son. As the film goes by, we see a subtle transition in the way Jr. thinks, and a certain realization by Senior that if left alone to do a job, Jr. is certainly capable of doing it. One can see through the entire film that Senior so desperately wanted to make up for the lost years by teaching his son his own way of life. That was Senior&apos;s way of showing love. Jr. finally realizes this as the film goes on. The uncanny thing is, at the end of the film, and after he has returned home - back to drinking and partying with friends, he missed Old Crow and the snowy landscape of the Yukon - The hard and cold work. I&apos;d certainly recommend this to anyone who likes heartfelt documentaries.",

Not only did we NOT laugh even once, no one in the theater laughed. We walked out after 45 minutes, and we weren&apos;t alone. I&apos;m not too picky and don&apos;t mind dumb humor. This didn&apos;t rise to that level. For anyone to say this is an &quot;instant classic&quot; and imply there will be those who watch it year after year- IMHO these people must be a fraud and only hyping the movie for someone else&apos;s good. For a spouse to buy a father every drug, is so far fetched, unless they hate their spouse and have bought a huge life insurance policy. We were looking for something light and funny. We didn&apos;t find that in this one."

A true swashbuckler.\n\nErrol Flynn really is one superb hero. Not only has he got the right looks but he also was a very talented actor who unfortunately died far too early at the age of 50.\n\nI also love how the rest of the characters are portrayed such as Elizabeth I and the &apos;gentleman&apos; villains. Also the love story is done good in a non-distractive way and Brenda Marshall really was one beautiful woman!\n\nStill its funny to see how much more polite the English are portrayed than the Spanish. Not only do they politely capture all the Spanish soldiers but they also find time to free all the galley slaves and take them ALL on their ship back to England. It really is funny to see how black and white the story is at times. But this is really my only small point of critic about this movie.\n\nA very entertaining adventurous swashbuckling movie with some wonderful music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. After more than 60 years it hasn&apos;t lost any of its power and therefor is recommendable to everyone, even those who aren&apos;t familiar with &apos;classics&apos;.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

We &apos;ve got two American actors, once known for making better movies who look like they are in for the money, we have a kid with more balls than Rambo and some cheap looking stunts looking like they have been cut from a Hong Kong action flick. Only watch this movie to see what is wrong with Dutch movies, there is not one thing that is worth mentioning and that is rare, but what do you want with a director best known for the infamous &quot;Flodder&quot; series. this movie sank to the bottom of the movie graveyard and nobody did see it in the cinema&apos;s , with a good reason, do not be fooled with the trailer."

Or rather doesn&apos;t make, which is more than unfortunate. But if you don&apos;t really care about the logic, this will be a tension filled thriller.\n\nThe lead performance is good (again not accounting for internal logic) and it Cantona sort of plays a Tommy Lee Jones inspired character. But softer if you can believe that (I know). A nice little french thriller that is decent enough to watch then",

      "reviewBody": "Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson, it should come as no surprise that his latest film, The Darjeeling Limited, demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction, arguably Anderson&apos;s strongest work to date. \n\nThe typically disjointed plot details three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman) who, in an attempt to bridge the gap between them, embark on a &quot;spiritual journey&quot; across India by train. Of course, considering Anderson&apos;s tendency towards offbeat comedic situations, and a series of problems involving Indian cough syrup, a poisonous cobra and pepper spray, the journey does not, of course, go as planned, and the brothers are forced to cope with their increasingly difficult situation and each other in turn. \n\nDo not mistake the film for the conventional road trip buddy comedy it may appear to be - Anderson is far too eclectic and clever to subscribe to such traditional fare, and his film is instead a far more emotional effort. With a particular knack for intricate character and storyline development, Anderson&apos;s script carefully doles out tidbits of character history throughout, painting a gradual and remarkably detailed portrait of the central characters as the film progresses. Though the film may drag or feel as if it falls slightly short of its true potential at times, on the whole it is far to easy to be swept up by the film to dwell on such minor concerns. \n\nThe gorgeous Indian scenery is captured with particular affection by Anderson&apos;s jarring cinematography and sharp eye for intriguing colour schemes. The film&apos;s wonderfully fitting soundtrack perfectly compliments the sublime visuals, making for one of the most aesthetically pleasing films in recent memory. \n\nThe central three actors are the real draw of the film, and all three boast excellent chemistry throughout. Owen Wilson, as usual, is effortlessly funny as spiritually obsessive control freak Francis, but also brings a tragic undercurrent to his character, made more poignant due to recent real life events out of character. A superb Adrien Brody steals the show as the emotionally unstable soon to be father Pete, demonstrating both previously unseen comedic abilities, and genuinely affecting emotional clout. As bitter writer Jack, Jason Schwartzman proves proficient at raising many a laugh, but despite his strong performance is easily overshone by his two co-stars during the film&apos;s dramatic moments. Watch also for amusing cameos from Bill Murray and Natalie Portman (featured more significantly in the film&apos;s 13 minute prequel found online at www.hotelchevalier.com), and a somewhat forced supporting role from Angelica Huston near the end. \n\nLike the rest of Anderson&apos;s other work, audiences will likely either love it or hate it. This is not a typical belly laugh evoking comedy à-la-Superbad - the humour present is more sly and chuckle worthy, and prides itself more on precisely crafted characters and situations than sight gags and one liners. Those willing to appreciate the film for what it is will enjoy an intelligent and touching spiritual meditation on family, and life in general. The joy is in the journey, and a journey as quirky and sentimental as this is one easily worth taking - for those willing to put forth the effort to overcome mainstream expectations, the film will not disappoint. \n\n-8/10",

      "reviewBody": "WATERHOLE #3 (4 outta 5 stars) I&apos;ve always loved this movie... mostly for the a great song by Roger Miller (&quot;The Code of the West&quot;) that plays throughout. James Coburn is a con man and grifter who comes across a map that leads to a fortune in stolen US Army gold. Carroll O&apos;Connor is the crooked sheriff who stays on Coburn&apos;s tail. The movie kind of meanders along in a lazy way... with amusing comedy bits and some violent gunplay along the way. As I said, the Roger Miller soundtrack is what really propels this movie along... without it I think the movie would be barely mentionable. The only flaw in this movie... the reason I can&apos;t give it 5 stars is for the awful subplot about James Coburn raping the sheriff&apos;s daughter and having her fall in love with him for the rest of the movie. I guess a case could be made that the movie is supposed to be &quot;satirizing&quot; the casual treatment of rape by its characters but such &quot;playful&quot; moments as describing rape as &quot;assault with a friendly weapon&quot; seem calculated as laughs AT women rather than AGAINST the menfolk. This probably didn&apos;t bother people a bit in 1967 but nowadays... well, you can see why this doesn&apos;t play much on TV anymore.",

It seems that these days there are too many films out that just have a quality about them missing. One thing about this film that wasn&apos;t missing was emotion, there was a lot of it happy and sad...\n\nHowever the acting was just not able to pull off the emotion the writer was obviously trying to portray. One major thing that made the film get right on my nerves was the make-up, it was too over done if you watch it you will totally see.\n\nThere were some really good parts, like the special effects however it is greatly weighed down by the cheesy teen lines and the high pitch annoying school girl voices... If your bored just watch it but its nothing special.",

He won his only Oscar for it of course, but he hadn&apos;t yet completely found ol&apos; Rooster&apos;s voice.\n\nIn this sequel co starring Katharine Hepburn, the Duke has every aspect of Rooster down pat. The scenes he and Hepburn share, trading their philosophies and anecdotes while they come to know and admire (and platonically fall in love with) each other is the engine of this film. Forget the plot, it&apos;s passable enough but very much secondary, this story gets along strictly on the strength of the two lead characters and it&apos;s worth seeing again and again just to watch these two Hollywood legends banter and spar in their one and only movie together.\n\nThis was the first John Wayne film I ever saw in a movie theatre (I was 9 years old in 1975) and it made me a lifelong fan. This is easily one of his most entertaining adventures. Hepburn and Wayne together is even more fun than Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen. A timeless treasure.",

But what it lacks in dollars it has in heart and its ability to make you think about what we are missing out seeing with our vision.  I am not sure that much, or even any, scientific creedence can be given to the idea behind the experiments of Dr. Xavier James and his search to see beyond what normal vision allows.  Ray Milland gives a fine performance as the obsessed man out to continue his experiments even if they involve using himself as the human guinea pig.  Some of the scenes and dialogue are a bit hokey by today&apos;s standards but most fit the film very nicely.  The scene with Milland at a party is a real hoot and great comedic relief.  I also loved the end to the film but thought it could have been plucked out a little longer.  The effects are very sparse and the only ones I really thought were any good were the ones used to highlight Milland&apos;s eyes through the film.  The film boasts a fine cast of stalwart sci-fi/Corman people such as Morris Ankrum, Dick Miller, Jonathan Haze, and Barboura Morris, as well as a young(and obviously talented) Don Rickles. Definitely try to see your way to seeing this film."

His vague dissatisfaction with his marriage is tested as he wander into Greenwich Village (nicely filmed on location)and compares himself to his friends--an older, struggling married man, the bridegroom, the confirmed bachelor. Will he stray or not? The movie is depressing, far less uplifting than Marty. But good performances from Murray, Jack Warden and Carolyn Jones."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is better than &quot;Amelie&quot; (which I loved). The story is intricately plotted so people with a &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; attention span will be overwhelmed. It must be the only movie to combine amazing combat scenes with romance, comedy and a complex mystery puzzle. Audrey Tatou is a goddess. Jeunet (the director) is like a combination of Chaplin (the romance and comedy); Hitchcock (the incredible camera work and storytelling); and Spielberg (the battle scenes and emotion). \n\nAs to some of the comments I have seen on this site: \n\nThere were French people complaining that people were speaking too fast. Gee, I don&apos;t speak French, but I can read subtitles just fine, so it was not a problem.\n\nSome people complained that it was too long. Then there were people that complained it was too short. Like Goldilocks, I thought it was just right.\n\nThere were those that said that Tatou can&apos;t act. Audrey&apos;s performance was nuanced people, she&apos;s no Jim Carrey. Some said she was just playing Amelie again. Wrong. Amelie was a good-hearted but wishy-washy spirit who was afraid to take any action in her own life. Mathilde is just the opposite, somebody who believes so strongly in her convictions that she is able to follow what her heart tells her in spite of all available evidence and every single person she meets. In fact, every actor, no matter how small the role, turns in a great performance (I&apos;m especially partial to the great Dominique Pinon, who plays Audrey&apos;s uncle). \n\nThere were complaints about the sex. There are a couple of brief shots of people having sex in the introduction, very similar to Amelie. Plus you get to see Jodie Foster doing the nasty from several directions. If that bothers you, go see Polar Express instead. Personally (especially in light of the rumors of Jodie being a lesbian) I am in favor of the sex scenes. There is also a shot of Audrey&apos;s fabulous naked booty, which justifies the price of admission all by itself.\n\nSomeone else complained that it was too jarring switching between the horrific WWI trench warfare scenes and the idyllic 1920s Paris. Argghhhh, that&apos;s the point!\n\nThen there was the complaint about seeing a scene or shot from a different perspective later in the movie. Have you heard of a story called &quot;Rashomon&quot;? The idea is that you are experiencing the events from the viewpoint of different characters. This is cleverly done and never superfluous. At least one time you are quite startled by new information revealed by that shift in perspective.\n\nAll in all, this is a movie that really does have everything. If it were an American movie it would win best picture, best actress, best supporting actress (Jodie still might get nominated), best cinematography, best script from a novel, and best director. As it is scheduled for a Christmas national release, hopefully a lot of people will see it.",

Carla attended a Catholic College and was given a book from a Nun concerning Berlin, Germany during 1936 and WW II and Carla becomes very interested in this book and it has a great effect on Carla&apos;s visit to Germany. This is something like a story of &quot;Diary of Anne Frank&quot; and Carla begins to have visions of what it was like during these war years. Carla does not get along very well with Lili and causes all kinds of problems in her hotel room and starts moving furniture all around the room and even starts to steal large amounts of food, silverware, cups plates and acts like a completely crazy person. This is a very interesting film and worth your time in viewing.",

The premise is familiar but still usually works - 3 American girls go to Europe and fall into mischief and romance. The problem is there is very little romance and very little humor. The screenplay is badly written without amusing situations or a build up of romance. The dialog is not witty or charming. Hardly any laughs. The directing is bad and choppy. Scenes just seem to jump from one to another abruptly. Leighton Meester is a good actress on Gossip Girl but here she seems to have just limited expressions. Katie Cassidy is slightly miscast a bit too together looking to be what she plays. The casting is strange. Selena Gomez looking like a British heiress? Not only does she not look the part her accent and acting in her 2 characters are not different enough. The male leads Cory Monteith who is a bit of a limited actor usually and Pierre Boulanger don&apos;t have much to work with. Only saving grace the locations and scenery are spectacular and it has a very on location feel. Overall: See if it you are a die hard fan of one or more of them but prepared to be disappointed."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Candy&apos; will probably garner several AFI awards later this year. Ledger is Dan, a troubled and likable juvenile-come-poet who is in love with Cornish&apos;s Candy, a sometimes-practicing artist who falls head first in love with Dan and heroin. Ledger&apos;s understated performance gives Dan a boyish vulnerability that would otherwise leave him less sympathetic. And his ability to use his face and especially his eyes to communicate Dan&apos;s uncanny reluctance is both staggering and understandable. There are many moments where silence is used to express emotions in this film and Armfield deserves to be commended for his restraint and trust in his actors and the narrative. The script by co-writer and author Davies is decidedly different from the novel but nonetheless strong and taut. It&apos;s rarely melodramatic and has been manipulated more for it&apos;s performers and their execution on screen rather than resigning itself as merely an adaptation of a great novel. The result here provides superb cinematic balance. Cornish too is brilliant, often abrasive as the troubled artist. Rush is also amazing and understated as Casper, Dan&apos;s older homosexual friend. Hazelhurst reprises her role in &apos;Little Fish&apos; but to less effect. She is great, but those who have seen &apos;Little Fish&apos; will find her casting a little too convenient. Martin too is good with the little he is dealt. The only thing that stops &apos;Candy&apos; from being superb is the material. It is too familiar and the characters are too stereotypical. Had this film been made before countless others in the &apos;drug-film&apos; genre this would have been more refreshing (although the denouement is a much welcomed change). But sadly it isn&apos;t. This in turn is nobody&apos;s fault. It&apos;s just been exploited too many times. The only thing that isn&apos;t stereotypical is Dan who is the backbone of the narrative. Ledger has made it his own and could have mimicked any drug-stricken angsty protagonist the &apos;genre&apos; has spat out. Instead he has made him a hero.",

      "reviewBody": "If there is one complaint about the Hollywood system that rings true, it is that Hollywood seems quite bereft of ideas. Then films like Equilibrium come out and remind us that it&apos;s not that we&apos;re out of ideas so much as we&apos;re just not trying hard enough. Not that Equilibrium is inherently new - it borrows a fair few plot concepts from Farenheit 451 and Nineteen Eighty-Four, to name the most prominent examples. It is the way in which the old ideas are combined with the new that makes Equilibrium a fun and underrated experience.\n\nThe premise is simple enough. In a kneejerk reaction to the horrors of World War Three, the survivors outlaw what they blame the chaos upon. Their own emotions, in other words. As the lead character has a series of revelations, we begin to understand that in so doing, they have also outlawed much of what gives our existence a point. In the bland, lifeless world that the law-abiding citizens inhabit, everything that the audience takes for granted to make their lives worthwhile is being systematically destroyed. Shades of the America of today, the whole principle of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, are shown in a stark horror show.\n\nI&apos;ve read people comparing this film to The Matrix or its sequels. Where The Matrix series&apos; fights were overlong, and often with no payoff, Equilibrium&apos;s fights are short and to the point. The difference this makes is, needless to say, as uplifting as Preston&apos;s fight to regain the humanity he stripped so many others of. Instead of having fights with no emotional connection to the characters, the story is given sufficient development to make the audience care what happens.\n\nThe film is not entirely without flaws. The Prozium element seems to have been written with no regard for the facts about psychiatric medicines. Their purpose is not to suppress emotion at all, but to balance the chemical system of the brain in order to give the patient better control of them. Sure, they&apos;re not without problems of their own, but exaggerating them like this does not do the portion of the community that needs them any favours. That aside, however, the on-camera struggle is one of the most intriguing I&apos;ve viewed for some time. Ergo, this minor plot problem is made up for. The only other real complaint I have is that the film could have done with a little more footage to give some characters more of a chance to develop.\n\nI gave Equilibrium an eight out of ten. It&apos;s not the best negative science fiction you&apos;ll ever see, but it is enough of a breath of fresh air that this won&apos;t entirely matter. If the MPAA made more films like this, it wouldn&apos;t be suffering the constant financial dire straits that it so loves to blame everyone else for.",

      "reviewBody": "An absolute abomination. Shot like a porno with all the sex removed. It got off to a bad start as once shot of a staircase started to drift off to the side as though the camera man had nodded off for a split second. This film tries to do a little modern day twist on Snow White, with a &apos;troubled&apos; young girl sent off to camp by her wicked stepmother. She is soon having hallucinations and murders take place. The epic scale of the awfulness is worth the two stars as it did entertain. Watch Eric &quot;I was in The Dark Knight 4 years ago&quot; Roberts try and hide his shame. I&apos;m pretty sure he agreed to be in the film but wasn&apos;t paid to act. Like hiring a hooker to wait tables. &quot;You can have my face and my name, but the acting will be a little extra&quot;. The director decided not to take him up on this offer. Maureen McCormick of Brady Bunch fame is the evil stepmother who appears to have taken some Giblin Formula as she talks to herself in mirrors. All the nighttime scenes are actually shot during the day which leaves them looking bright and blue. The costumes involve black T-shirts and jeans, which the script tries to pass off as the camp uniform, but when the sheriff arrives with nothing to set him apart other than a plastic badge clipped to his belt, you realise that the actors are probably supplying their own clothes. Heck, the casting call probably stated as much. The film drags itself to feature length, with an end that makes such little sense it was like the punchline to a huge practical joke. Brilliantly awful and should be enjoyed with many beers and a few close friends.",

The two have a wild night ahead of them as they run from irate Iranians. That makes more sense than it sounds, trust me. Lots of cameos from directors such as David Cronenberg, Jonathan Demme, and Don Siegel. Also a fun cameo by David Bowie. Goldblum and Pfeiffer are great. A solid comedy from John Landis; good escapist fun. Great soundtrack including the title song from B.B. King. Also worth checking out for a very rare (but brief) Pfeiffer nude scene.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Les veinards&quot; is a movie made up of sketches ,two of which are funny ,the others are bombs .\n\nSegment one: &quot;the mink&quot; .François Périer ,Mireille Darc . A maid wins a mink ;her employer needs it because he&apos;s got a business meeting with an important client whose wife wears a leopard-skin coat ; he wants his own wife to look as chic as her ,but the servant and her mistress are at odds .Eventually ,they have to reverse the roles ,and it&apos;s the maid who dines with her employer in the Italian restaurant;This situation leads to lots of mistakes and misunderstandings . Directing is undistinguished ,but both Périer and Darc have plenty of go and the screenplay ,with its sudden new developments ,is funny.\n\nThings go awry in sketches 2, 3 and 4 and you should use your fast forward button and directly go to segment 5.\n\nSegment 2:&quot;the gastronomic meal&quot; .Francis Blanche . A guy wins a meal in a renowned restaurant ; this one takes up back to the worst of the silent era; the gags are antediluvian and repetitive (notably ,that of the chair)\n\nSegment 3:&quot;an evening with a star(let) ; Pierre Doris,Darry Cowl. It&apos;s all the more disappointing since it was made by Philippe De Broca ,a director known for his elegance: his sketch is vulgar and devoid of interest.\n\nSegment 4 :&quot;the yatch &quot; ;Pierre Mondy , Jacqueline Maillan,Jean Lefèvre . Brilliant on stage ,Maillan would lose 80% of her comic appeal on screen ;and anyway the screenplay is repetitive and quite dull after a while.\n\nSegment 5 &quot; the jackpot&quot; Louis De Funès , Blanchette Brunoy,Noel Roquevert . De Funès &apos;s presence is cause for celebration after three horrible stories ; he&apos;s perfect as a not-so-dumb peasant who comes to Paris to be given his prize : 100 million francs! The screenplay is rather inventive ( the &quot;birds&quot; in the suitcase , the bubble head wife and daughter who do not have a clue , the false thief , the lesson of economics ....)and De Funès is at the top of his game.\n\nTwo good sketches,you hardly make it on the percentages.",

Even a mundane scene like riding down a small creek (the opening scene) or seeing a man chop wood seems magical when you accompany it with evocative music.\n\nThe arrangement of the music is skillfully done. Just to take two examples: the arranger noticed a similar theme in Saint-Saens&apos;s AQUARIUM and Ravel&apos;s DAPHNE AND CHLOE (D C D C D G) , and made it sound like a theme-with-variations. DAPHNE AND CHLOE, in turn segued into Debussy&apos;s CLAIRE DE LUNE with perfect continuity. (NOTE: I looked up the musical sources afterward)\n\nFocusing on the beauty of the countryside and the music meant that the film-makers could avoid any of the messiness of French history -- the persecution of the Huguenots, the frequent revolutions, the colonial abuses in Algeria. That can be worrisome, but as I said, this is an artificial work of art.",

      "reviewBody": "I not only liked this movie, but I feel a need to defend it and the Walt Disney company.\n\nWalt Disney movies are notorious for plot changes. Almost no movie touched by them is safe from this process. From cartoon production to live action films, any adaptation by Disney is going to have plot changes to suit there vision of the final product. For example, their cartoon The Sword in the Stone bears almost no resemblance to the original story of King Arthur.\n\nTo say that Disney does not stick to the original plot is like saying an elephant does not ride a bicycle. It is obvious, even before you see it, that this is not going to happen. This is why they are adaptations. The definition of adaptation is &quot;The condition of being made suitable to an end.&quot; Disney sets what they want the end product to be and adapt the story line to meet that goal. They did, however, remain close enough to the original story line that one who had not read the original might be intrigued enough to do so.\n\nThis movie was made for one reason... to entertain. Sure money was a motive, but if it does not entertain, it does not make money. And, as with most Disney adaptations, if you approach it with the understanding that liberties have been taken, it not only can entertain, but can be downright enjoyable as well. Disney will never fully stick to an original story line for any adaptation they produce. This is how they make it &quot;theirs&quot;. This is how they give it that twist that a lot of people have come to expect from a Disney film. And once this IS expected going into the movie, you can watch it in the spirit in which it was released.\n\nAnd remember this, the cast all had the opportunity to read the script BEFORE they agreed to make the movie. If they had any qualms about the quality of the writing, you can be assured they would not have put their reputations on the line."

Once again examining the country&apos;s history at the time of a major upheaval (the eve of WWI) and with Brandauer - very ably inhabiting every facet of his complex role - giving another subtle, compelling portrayal of misjudged pride and the shameful exposure (thankfully, the homosexual angle of the plot is barely stressed) at the hands of the regime he had devoted his life to serving.",

I truly believed it to be Bacon&apos;s career performance.\n\nThe script is solid, full of great dialogue and thick symbolism. The characters all fully developed and never one-sided. Each has their dark side. A commendable effort to Emmy winner, Mos Def, who makes us hate him when he&apos;s a good cop, and love him when he&apos;s a bad one.\n\nThe reason the rating is so low is because it&apos;s hard to accept a character that is a child molester. Probably because everyone knows someone or is someone who has been sexually abused. This is a film about redemption and forgiveness--something we can all definitely agree with. It is also a story about humanity--something we all have in common.",

I like the film&apos;s way portraying of everyday life in East Berlin. You can almost see and feel the city. The love story between a passionate single mother and a complacent, married bureaucrat is not your typical Hollywood movie. The film also has a psychedelic and hippie feel. The soundtrack suits the film. I like the portions of the film where some elements (like the band that plays music while Paul and Paula are making love) are placed for no reason. The movie has a simple charm that captivates audiences. I guess that the film&apos;s success lies in its way of making the ordinary scenes of life extraordinary.",

The dialogues depends heavily on in-depth understanding of Polish culture and Polish way of life - this makes the movie great, but unfortunately it also makes it of little value for foreign viewers - even if a subtitled version is ever released.",

The pace  was too slow IMO and several times I thought it was about to end when another 5 or 10  minutes were tacked on. There were a few shocks and surprises along the way but the  sheer length of the movie and it&apos;s ambiguous ending renders it hard for me to recommend.\n\nAs someone else stated, it does make you think and that is probably what all good  films hope to achieve. One would just hope for a clearer thoughtscape to ponder on."

Auf Wiedersehen Amerika is almost like a family film which can be enjoyed by everyone.It is about some old people who leave USA to come to Europe.In the lives of human beings nations,borders and languages do not play a major role.Such is the theme of this film as we are shown how old people are fond of the place where they were born.Jan Schutte does not force his actors to be sentimental about their life.This does not happen in the film as we are shown that in the lives of human beings miracles will happen at regular intervals for everybody.",

      "reviewBody": "Das Rasthaus der grausamen Puppen (1967), directed by Rolf Olsen, is a wild ride through the shifting landscape of 1960s German cinema. It&apos;s a crime-adventure flick with a healthy dose of comedy and eroticism.\n\nThe film follows Betty Williams and Bob Fishman, a rogue couple attempting to rob a jewelry store in Glasgow. Their plan quickly unravels, leading to the accidental death of a policeman at Bob&apos;s hands. He flees, leaving Betty to face the consequences alone. This sets the stage for a tale that blends action, titillating moments, and a glimpse into the harsh realities of prison life for women.\n\nThe German film industry was in a state of flux during this period, and this movie sits in an intriguing liminal space between the &quot;older&quot; and &quot;newer&quot; styles. The influence of the Edgar Wallace films is evident, but Das Rasthaus der grausamen Puppen also embraces the emerging trend of &quot;wilder&quot; cinema, flirting with softcore elements.\n\nThe prison scenes are particularly notable, depicting the mistreatment of female inmates and the shocking-for the time-inclusion of lesbianism. The German censorship organization, FSK, likely cut several scenes, including water torture and a forceful encounter between Betty and the female warden. Despite these cuts, the film still pushes the boundaries, especially when compared to its contemporaries.\n\nDas Rasthaus der grausamen Puppen is a fascinating snapshot of a changing industry, and its blend of genres and tones keeps viewers on their toes. While it may not be a masterpiece, it&apos;s an entertaining and daring ride that will appeal to fans of 1960s European cinema and anyone seeking a unique blend of crime, adventure, and eroticism.\n\nSo, if you&apos;re in the mood for a wild ride through 1960s German cinema, buckle up and get ready for a Glasgow heist gone wrong!",

      "reviewBody": "Hugh Grant is pretty &apos;watchable&apos; in most films he does. His on-screen presence is pretty much consists of witty lines, snappy articulation and boyish / non-threatening charm - and some element of nerves.\n\nHe&apos;s got that same appeal in this movie - and with the over-the-top acting of Tom Arnold, the film has great comedic performances. Still though, it lacks a compelling story.\n\nThe simple storyline never got interesting: an unmarried couple discovers they have a baby on the way. The soon-to-be father (Grant) seems uncomfortable with idea of becoming a responsible husband and father - leading to problems with the mother (Julianne Moore). Being in presence of a reckless family (headed by Arnold) just seems to make things worst ... and the story progresses from there.\n\nIf you&apos;re a Grant fan, you&apos;ll enjoy his part in the movie. However, get ready to also discover that it isn&apos;t enough to save this movie. It&apos;s just not that fun to watch.",

As Robinson escaping from England aboard a ship , after killing a man .Then , a wreckage happens and Robinson washes at a mysterious island .There he frees a native , William Takaku , who is nicknamed Friday .\n\nSo-so recounting about the classy castaway novel with the loner Robinson who meets his pal Friday , retelling their adventures and unfortunes . While sticking some incidents close to original tale , others are utterly fictious. Being narrated under his point of view . The picture has nothing to do with the classic original by Daniel Defoe , taking freely parts here and there ; but where are the thrills and chills? . The movie relies heavily on the relationship between Robinson and Friday , charting the peculiar treatment the native receives of the civilized man ; as Robinson teaches English language to the escaped native until evil slave traders spoil the fun . Pierce Brosnan gives a passable acting as the distressed castaway stranded on a deserted island and he tries to civilize the proud native Friday . It boasts a good secondary cast with very brief interventions from notorious secondary actors such as Polly Walker , Ian Hart , Damian Lewis and James Frain. The motion picture produced by Robert Halmi and was regularly directed by George Miller : The man from snowy river , Zeus and Roxanna , Aviator , Neverending story 2 , and by Rod Hardy , a Tv usual filmmaker : Mentalist , Librarians , Supernatural , Covert affairs , Mental , Doll house , X files and occassionally for cinema : December boys , Two for Texas , Over the hill, Thrist.\n\nOther retelling of this prestigious novel are the following ones : silent version 1927 narrated by Don Carney . Mr Robinson Crusoe 1932 with Douglas Fairbanks . Robinson Crusoe of mystery island 1936 by Max Wright . Robinson Crusoe by Luis Buñuel with Dan O&apos;Herlihy .Sci-fi interpretation of Defoe classic titled Robinson Crusoe on Mars , 1964 , by Byron Haskin with Adam West .

But not after watching this. This movie was funny say the least, And when I first pop ed in the movie I was thinking that it was going to be some old movie that was just thrown out there in hopes of having a little money. But Honsitly I was surprised , it was enjoyable, and it wasn&apos;t boring. I also liked the idea that Cuba Gooding Jr&apos;s Character, wasn&apos;t able to speak, and how Lighting Jack wasn&apos;t able to read without his glasses , but how he tried to hide it from everyone. For anyone who hasn&apos;t seen this movie, and they like a good comedy, or Paul Hogan for that matter. What are you waiting for....? Go rent it !

Strangely, THE KID BROTHER has been almost forgotten, which is a shame, as it is Harold Lloyd&apos;s masterpiece.\n\nBetter known for the &quot;human fly&quot; sequence in SAFETY LAST, it is in THE KID BROTHER that Harold reaches the top level of silent comedy stardom, alongside Chaplin &amp; Keaton.\n\nThe story is a Western, set mostly on the ranch where Harold lives with his burly sheriff father and two older brothers. There&apos;s a dumb bully down the road, a very pretty young lady, a traveling medicine show and a nasty, bald bad guy. I don&apos;t want to give away any of the plot, but suffice it to say that Harold gets to showcase his famous athletic agility and there is a very complex &amp; satisfying final showdown with Mr. Bad Guy at the climax.\n\nFor pure romanticism, however, there are few scenes in any silent film that can beat the one where Harold climbs a tree, ever higher, for one more glimpse of the very pretty young lady. It&apos;s about as sweet as they come...",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched this film again, and I must say that it still looks good.\n\n\n\nTron is the story about Kevin Flynn, a young ,hotshot computer programmer who is determined to find the proof the he is the creator of five of the most popular video games from the man who stole them. When Flynn gets too close, the artificial intelligence super-computer ,MCP, digitizes Flynn into the video game world he created, to fight for his life, all for MCP&apos;s amusement.\n\nThis film may have been for too ahead of it&apos;s time in 1982.  It told the story about a super-computer gone power hungry (two year prior to Terminator and seventeen years prior to The Matrix) and it was the the springboard for early computer generated images.  Although this film mixed CG with hand-drawn animation, I dare anyone to sort out one from the other. The film also sported computer terms such as bit, ram ,end of line ,etc.)\n\nThis film also sported some of the most unique and original action sequences, such as the &quot;Lightcycle Maze/chase&quot; and the &quot;Disc Duel&quot; The same goes for the computer world ,that is unlike anything presented on the big screen. Even the score done by Wendy Carlos was unlike any other. The performences by the cast were well done.  One in particular was the commanding performance of David Warner as the ruthless Commander of the gameworld Sark.\n\nThis film is one of those over-looked gems from the 80&apos;s that should be seen in it&apos;s pristine DVD release.  End of Line"

      "reviewBody": "In the world of Turkish cinema, Spider-Man leads a gang of counterfeiter who use murders people with outboar dmotors, axes and man-eating guinea pigs. Santo is a secret agent who rarely wears his mask and puts things directly into his pants, pockets by damned. And Captain America doesn&apos;t have a shield, smokes and brings his girlfriend, Julia, along.\n\nJust strap yourself in — 3 Giant Men is a ride into insanity, the kind of world that Sergeant Joe Friday worried about when kids in the 60&apos;s started doing LSD and jumping out of windows.\n\nIstanbul! The Spider&apos;s Gang — led by Spider-Man — are taking over. They cut the head off of a woman with a boat propeller to start the movie off right.\n\nThe film then kicks into the craziest title sequence ever — they basically filmed a board of photographs, pulling out on image after image, with the type for each credit simply vinyl type on a board.\n\nJulia, Captain America&apos;s girlfriend, is captured but is able to send a distress call to Cap, who rescues her but can&apos;t catch Spider-Man after a battle through a graveyard. Captain America is played by Aytekin Akkaya, who was Ali in Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (better known as Turkish Star Wars) and Ukan in Yor, the Hunter from the Future.\n\nI&apos;d like to inform all of you right now that Spider-Man has the biggestt eyebrows you&apos;ve ever seen. He can also die and come back to life with no lasting damage, for some reason. He also gets his men to drop off what I can only refer to as mini-tents near mafia bases, emerging from them to kill other gangs.\n\nMeanwhile, Santo infiltrates a dojo known for counterfeiting. Santo&apos;s fight style is to basically no sellkicks to the face and do rolls and judo. So, you know, nothing at all like he real Santo. He also likes to look right at the camera whenever he is film. I could watch Santo fight karate men for hours and hours of my life. Santo gets captured, but escapes with the evidence. He and Cap raid a hideout while Spider-Man kills a woman in the shower.\n\nSpidey calls out the dude who let Santo escape, punishing him by putting a tube over his head and letting two guinea pigs EAT HIS FACE. Sorry to scream, this movie this movie is just one shock after the other. Spidey tops it off by watching couple shower (!), killing them by stabbing them together ala Jason Vorhees to Jeff and Sandra in Friday the 13th Part 2 (!!) and then stealing a statue that has no importance toward the rest of the movie (!!!).\n\nYes. If you are keeping score, Spider-Man has two different shower based kill scenes in this movie. If you like your Peter Parker murderous, then this flick is for you. But wait what would make this movie better? If you answered watching Spider-Man have sex while surrounded by frightening puppets, then you are on the same wavelength as the insane people who made this movie. You should really speak to someone or be on one of this lists where you have to announce yourself to all of your neighbors when you move.\n\nSanto and Captain America then battle Spider-Man again, where we find out that there are four Spideys, several of which die horribly. After some undercover work at a club — the same club we keep seeing with a girl in shadow spinning boob tassles — Spider-Man&apos;s goons kidnap our heroes. They fight one another, but it&apos;s all a clever ruse, as they kill almost all of the gang members, including Spider-Man&apos;s girlfriend (who is not Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Felicia Hardy, Betty Brant, Carlie Cooper or Liz Allen).\n\nThere&apos;s a battle that doesn&apos;t stop until every Spider-Man is dead. Spideys get knocked off ladders, their necks broken and crushed by presses. It&apos;s an orgy of Spider destruction, highlighted by Captain America&apos;s trademark offense: one footed dropkicks , face slaps and punches to the belly.\n\nBut just as Cap is about to leave town, he sees one more Spidey. However, it&apos;s just a kid in a mask. \n\nI don&apos;t know if it&apos;s possible to love a movie as much as I love 3 Giant Men. Today&apos;s superhero movies fail to capture the majesty of this film. It answers the big questions, the ones no one had the guts to ask or care about. Cap punching Spider in the breadbasket? It&apos;s in there. Santo powerbombing goons and then putting them into submission holds in a nightclub? Yes. Wacky asides with comical music? Yes. A Cap that smokes and wears a leisure suit? Evet.\n\n3 Giant Men comes in at 78 minutes of what I can only imagine being in a coma and pumped full of iowaska would feel like. Everyone knows all about Japanese Spider-Man Takuya Yamashiro (they do, right?), but laughing, killing, giant eyebrow having Turkish Spider-Man? He is the greatest villain ever in the best superhero movie ever made.",

A rich husband on medication can quickly be put out of his misery and Trixi finds it quite a profitable undertaking.   I am not sure where the police hang out or what the coroner is supposed to be doing.  There seems to be no hindrance to any of Trixi&apos;s plans whatsoever. One husband succumbs after another.  And be prepared for a dismemberment scene in which a hungry cat assists in destroying some of the evidence; and later, a dog helps out too.\n\nI suppose the fascination about this film is to anticipate what tricks Trixi will get up next as she seduces one husband after another.  She knows what men enjoy and she gives them what they want.  Little do they realise when they propose marriage their fate is sealed.\n\nGambling on the race course is the least effective way of augmenting the bank account, but Trixi&apos;s methods are not recommended either.  I think it&apos;s a wise man who insists on preparing his own medication.  And spiked drinks are becoming rather too popular these days for people wishing to gain their own ends.\n\nIf you don&apos;t take this film too seriously you&apos;ll probably enjoy it.  And you&apos;ll understand why some men prefer to remain bachelors.",

      "reviewBody": "Two years after the success of the smash hit Karate Kid&apos;, it was inevitable that the forces behind this most entertaining movie were going to go on and continue the story. In KK2&apos; we get to learn a lot more about the life of Mr. Miyagi and the development of his student, Daniel-san&apos;. We once again get to see that fighting is only the last resort to your problems. There&apos;s plenty of adventure and conflict as our triumphant duo discovers more about the price of honour, the way one must fight when only the winner survives and the true power of friendship.\n\nAfter their triumphant victory at the All-Valley karate championships&apos;, Daniel and Miyagi continue their training, focusing on the honour and discipline of karate and the deeper powers of meditation. However, when Miyagi receives news that his father is near death, he and Daniel take off to the island of Okinawa where Miyagi&apos;s family lives. Upon Miyagi&apos;s return to his homeland, he is reunited with his long-lost childhood love, Yukie. Despite their youthful love for one another, Yukie was forced to marry Miyagi&apos;s rival, Sato, in an arranged marriage, causing Miyagi to flee Okinawa forever. Now his old rival is a powerful karate expert and a rich, embittered landowner who demands a final grudge match with the wise and elderly Miyagi. As Sato threatens Miyagi and his family, his nephew, Chozen, is out to fight Daniel in a battle of young wills. Both teacher and student are forced to stand up to their rivals in a matter of honour or shame and life or death.\n\nWhat I like about KK2, is how the story allows us to learn more about characters that we grew to love in the 1984 movie. Sure the movie continues where the last finished off, not like your normal sequel does. Yet it does show us a different side to what we saw in the original movie. I feel that is what a sequel is meant to do, be a little bit different and allows us to learn new things about characters that we already know. The story was once again written by Robert Mark Kamen, who I thought wrote the part about Miyagi&apos;s problems back home beautifully, as is the way that we see Daniel assimilate to the customs and traditions of the Okinawa people, and the way that Miyagi&apos;s problems in the end are Daniel&apos;s as well. I feel it always helps to have the same director back for any sequel, with John G. Avildson back to bring his touches into the story as well. \n\nThe great part of KK2 has to be the return of Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki Pat Morita). The start of film has a most powerful scene between Miyagi and sensei Kreese (Martin Kove), where Miyagi teaches Kreese a karate lesson without even raising a sweat. The popular pairs return gives the story strength to continue on as it did. They also share quite a remarkable chemistry onscreen. It also good for the story to have Daniel fatherless&apos;, as he helps his teacher come to terms with the loss of his father, in one of the more emotional scenes in the movie. I must admit I like how Miyagi has faith in Daniel, even when he does not, (there is one scene where this reigns so true in KK2, and is probably the highlight of the entire film). \n\nHowever, Ralph shares a very special role with Kumiko (Tamlyn Tomita), as their characters fall very much in love with each other. Kumiko wants to be a dancer, and Daniel feels that she would be a successful dancer in America. Then there is the evil side to KK2. Sato, (Danny Kamekona), is still bitter about what Miyagi did to his honour before he fled Okinawa and wants a fight so he can reclaim what he believes is rightfully his. Sato&apos;s nephew Chozen (Yuji Okumoto) also has feels his honour has been shamed by Daniel, with most of the movie showing Daniel on the receiving on end of Chozen&apos;s fist. Yuji has appeared in movies such as The Truman show&apos;, The Game&apos; and the 2001 blockbuster Pearl Harbour&apos;.\n\nKarate Kid II also shows off some impressive Japanese locations. The Okinawa village used as Miyagi&apos;s was striking, as were the style of the homes, as a person from western society would not be accustomed to such a different lifestyle. There is also the wonderful music that accompanies KK2. Bill Conti&apos;s melodic musical score gives the movie great tension, and you have the music from the dancing hall which was live and upbeat. Yet the standout part of the soundtrack for mine has to be the Oscar winning hit, Glory of Love&apos;, sung by Peter Cetera. That is one song I like a lot.\n\nThis movie is a great extension of the Karate Kid&apos; story, which shows an uplifting story about overcoming the odds and staying true to yourself. Miyagi&apos;s strong anti-violence&apos; theme continues in KK2, showing Daniel that the secrets of karate are that it is only to be used it when there is no other way. This movie is also very much about forgiveness, as Miyagi says at the start of the film A person with no forgiveness in heart, living worse punishment than death&apos;. I could not agree more with that statement. Miyagi is the standout character in KK2, as he is always calm and rational, in situations in which most of us would not be, with his character going through a range of emotions that give us a much greater insight into him. If you are a Karate Kid fan than you have to watch what is a most satisfying of sequels.  \n\nCMRS gives Karate Kid II&apos;: 4 (Very Good Film)"

      "reviewBody": "When I decided to watch this movie in the cinema with one of my friends, I didn&apos;t really know anything about it. All I knew about this film was what he told me. He said that it was directed by the man who made &quot;L&apos;Auberge espagnole&quot;, which he liked a lot, but he didn&apos;t think that this movie would be a sequel to that one and I believed him. If I had known that it was a sequel, I would probably not have given it a try, because in my opinion there are only few sequels worth a watch and when you haven&apos;t seen the first one, it&apos;s almost always impossible to know what exactly they are talking about. But despite what we thought, this was a sequel. \n\nEven though I hadn&apos;t seen the first movie, I could easily understand the story. Xavier is about to celebrate his thirtieth birthday and he is on a turning point in his life. He&apos;s no longer a student, but he hasn&apos;t yet got a regular adult life either. He&apos;s single, works as a reporter and ghost writer instead of being a renowned novelist,... and to make things worse, his love life is a gigantic mess. He&apos;s afraid of not finding the right one, because all he has are unfinished romances and one night stands. When he finally finds a girl that he likes, he always believes that there is something better out there and not knowing when to stop looking for more, he is unable to keep them with him...\n\nI really liked this movie a lot and I guess there is a very good explanation for it. When watching this movie I had the feeling that it was me they were talking about. I&apos;m a bit too much like Xavier than what I sometimes would like to admit. I&apos;m in my late twenties, haven&apos;t got a terrific job, I&apos;m still single, sometimes don&apos;t feel ready for the steady adult life, but still want to enjoy my youth... Even the friends from all over Europe are the same since I&apos;ve studied in a similar project. But even when you can&apos;t completely identify yourself with one of the characters, I believe there is something good in it for everyone. The story on itself is very well written and thanks to the different places never feels the same. They have filmed in Paris, Saint-Petersburg and London and those three cities and the situations that take place there are different enough to keep you interested from the beginning until the end. Next to the story, this movie also offers some very fine acting by all the actors, but what else can you expect from people like Audrey Tatou, Cécile de France,... \n\nAs a conclusion I would like to say that everybody who is about to turn thirty will probably like it, but even the others will find enough good and interesting things in this movie. There is some very intelligent humor, a lot of fine acting and a lack of too many romantic movie clichés to be found in it. And although I&apos;m sure it will never become a very popular movie (there were only 12 people in the audience when I went to see it on a Sunday evening), I&apos;m sure that those who will give it a try, will not regret it. I know I didn&apos;t, I even give this movie a 9/10. If I had seen the first movie and understood from the beginning what was going on, it might even have been a 10/10. This movie should be cherished by all.",

After seeing the first 15 minutes I still had no idea where the movie was going but I knew I was in love with the movie.\n\nPacchigi is yet another movie about Zainichi Korean but it differs from all other movies sharing that theme I&apos;ve seen so far. Mainly because it&apos;s a comedy (or at least starts out as one) but also because it doesn&apos;t in any way victimise the Koreans or demonise the Japanese.\n\nIt would be wrong to say this is the story of a Japanese high school kid falling in love with a Korean high school kid because the movie revolves around so many other things. It would also be wrong to say this is a story about violence between Korean and Japanese gangs in the 60&apos;s because even though there are many violent scenes depicting this it&apos;s not really relevant. I think more than anything it&apos;s a story about the 60&apos;s in Japan, about sexual liberation, about freedom, about music, about doing what you want.\n\nBasically I recommend it.",

I had not read the book, and knew nothing of the story, but went because the book was voted &quot;Book of the Year&quot; by two local colleges. So I cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done.\n\nIn short, I thought this was an incredibly moving story. The acting was believable, and the insight into Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, and so I felt an affinity for certain Middle Eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie, as they reminded me of the times I spent with his family.\n\nThe themes of friendship, family, human values, and courage under fire are universal, and are well developed in the film. I won&apos;t list the plot details, as these can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the film&apos;s technical aspects, the acting, and, above all, its heart-wrenching story, I would definitely recommend this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I have never laughed &amp; cried so hard at the same time. Finally, a man pregnant. And having it Arnold playing this part was wonderful. He ran the emotional and physical gammet and he did it beautifully. As a woman who had a horribly difficult pregnancy and constantly wanted to smack men up the side of the head when they make comments about how easy we have it, I finally felt that someone got it.\n\nDanny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger pair up as a Doctor (OBGYN) and a Research Scientist who are trying to come up with a formula to help women with difficult pregnancies to have a better chance of carrying through. (A worthy effort in itself) They are turned down by the FDA for a human testing and the University revokes their funding. (TYPICAL) In a totally bold, crazy and plot driving move, Devito talks Arnold into trying the formula on himself. But where to get the donor egg. (Enter Emily Thompson as a fellow Dr/Researcher who has cryogenically frozen eggs). And the humor just gets funnier from here.\n\nArnold suddenly is going through the mood swings, the nausea, the nipples itching and everything else that goes with a &quot;WOMAN&quot; being pregnant. And he doesn&apos;t pander or downplay any of it. He was down right beautiful in the part.\n\nI highly recommend this to any woman who is, will be or has been pregnant. You will laugh and cry and totally enjoy this movie.  And guys, if you don&apos;t get it, well, you never have when we were the pregnant ones, so why should you get this portrayal???  Give it a shot, you may learn what real strengths women have."

This movie is an entertaining collection of love stories which deftly cuts across so many barriers,whether they be cultural, social, class or religion. It is funny in a very real and potent way and the character development has been executed to great details in an effortless fashion. That probably is one of the hallmarks of a really gifted director.\n\nThe story revolves around the preparations of an Indian arranged marriage. The main characters are the bride,her father and a marriage arrangement contractor. All dealing with their own constraints and still trying to give their hopes wings. What is remarkable is that this movie has characters who show courage when they have a lot to lose and win higher rewards like love,trust and self-respect in the process. \n\nKudos to the Monsoon wedding team!",

Just wonderful and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe plot can be told very quickly: Tobi and Achim live in a Bavarian village, are the best of friends and also together in a rowing team. But Tobi has a secret: He is in love with Achim, doesn&apos;t dare to tell him of course and is jealous of Sandra, Achim&apos;s girlfriend. When Tobi, Achim and their team travel to a competition (which at the same time is a camp) and meet a gay rowing team there, the emotions boil over and soon Tobi has to face the truth and find out who he is.\n\nTo sum it up: This film is a masterpiece and in my opinion should be officially one of the best films of all times. It is filmed in a very quiet way, with calm shots of nature, of teenagers, their dreams, fears and emotions, but also their conflicts. It takes teenagers seriously without being too serious and deals with homosexuality, coming out and coming of age without drowning in clichés. Plus it has some hilarious comic situations and great one liners in it. One could say: The movie shows pure life, for life is sometimes fun, sometimes tragic, sometimes beautiful and sometimes hard. Also everyone, from the protagonists to minor characters is casted perfectly and you have some of the most talented young German actors of our time here: Robert Stadlober, Marlon Kittel, and Hanno Koffler. &quot;Sommersturm&quot;  a terrific piece of art that you can&apos;t help falling in love with."

I grew up in Oregon, attended U of O (the setting for much of the movie), and witnessed some of the events portrayed. So it was with a surge of satisfaction that I watched this movie that got it right at each point along the way. The attention to detail was astounding, and the recreation of races was uncanny - I compared it to actual news photos later, and the actors playing competing runners were chosen so well that their bodies and running styles actually match the original men.  When a movie cares this much about being faithful to details, you can be sure it will take a quality approach overall. Billy Crudup&apos;s portrayal of Pre is full of inner fire and consistent with the real man; Donald Sutherland is marvelously powerful and yet understated as Bill Bowerman; the examination of the real reasons athletes compete is thorough and moving. Innovative use of music and camera work brings the race scenes to life, and if this movie doesn&apos;t make you want to immediately go out for &quot;a quick ten,&quot; you&apos;re a completely hopeless sedentarian-- in heart and body. This is among the five finest movies about athletics ever made.",

Leena comback film after 10 years. In 1970&apos;s she acted opposite Jeetendra in many films, she also acted in those days in Jeetendra home production Humjoli and incidentally her comeback was with Jeetendra and in Jeetu&apos;s home production. When Jeetendra went to sign her for the film, Kishore Kumar told Jeetendra okay just to make him happy. In reality he did not want Leena in the film or near Jeetendra. When she told him she had signed the contract and had to go, Kishore Kumar sulked like a child for 2 weeks. When she went to Madras to shoot for the film, he would call her every hour to see what she was doing and remind her to keep away from Jeetendra. Kishore Kumar even went as far as to threaten we would not do any playback singing for Jeetendra. super song &quot;chor chor&quot; sung by Kishore Kumar for Jeetendra &amp; Asha Bhos;e for Sridevi. wonderful music dun by Laxmikant payrelal.wonderful to watch this Era of 80&apos;s..",

      "name": "Gorgeous rendition upon a notorious novel with colorful cinematography  and evocative settings",
      "reviewBody": "Drama intelligently adapted based on the novel ¨Bearn or La Sala De Muñecas¨ by Llorenc Villalonga , considered to be one of the best books in Catalan language . It deals with Juan Mayol , Imanol Arias , a priest of an aristocratic marriage , Don Antonio : Fernando Rey and Doña Antonia : Amparo Soler Leal . Then , there appears their niece , Xima nicely played by Angela Molina , and events go wrong . Some years earlier , Xima escaped with Don Antonio to go París to watch the famous opera ¨Faust¨ by Gounod .\n\nThis is a luxurious and splendidly set drama , including glamorous gowns and great production design . The plot bears remarkable resemblance to ¨El Gatopardo¨ by Giuseppe Di Lampedusa in which there is also a tarnished aristocrat and concerning the fall of the rural aristocracy of the Ancient Regime , a period filled with social revolutions , and here is set during the fall of the queen Isabel II . Well adapted about a prestigious novel whose first part titled : ¨Under influence of Faust¨ is formed by 20 chapters and a second part titled : ¨Peace rules at Bearn¨ , and finally an epilogue . The main cast gives very good interpretations as Imanol Arias , Fernando Rey and Amparo Soler Leal . Special mention for Angela Molina who appears very brilliant and attractive. \n\nEvocative and glimmer cinematography by Hans Burmann . Lush costumes by Yvonne Blake , present-day is President of the Spanish Academy. Impressive sets and production design by recently deceased Gil Parrondo . Atmospheric musical score by Francisco Guerrero , including Mallorca dances and regional score . The motion picture was professionally directed by Jaime Chavarri , a good professional who has directed good films . His first movie was ¨Los Viajes Escolares¨ (1974), with an autobiographical touch but it was misunderstood by most critics . Later he worked with the producers &apos;Elías Querejeta&apos; in prestigious documentary titled ¨El Desencanto¨ (1976)) and Alfredo Matas in this successful costumer titled ¨Bearn¨ (1983) . With the last mentioned film he also had success in terms of the numbers who saw the film . He also directed intense dramas such as ¨Dedicatoria¨ and ¨A un Dios Desconocido¨ . To change the genre he also filmed the musical , ¨Las Cosas del Querer¨ (1989) , being followed by ¨Cosas Del Querer 2¨ (1995) , along with a Tango film as ¨Tangos Are for Two¨ . And adapted from the theatre play by Fernando Fernán Gómez in his most popular film titled ¨Bicicletas Son Para Verano¨ . His last picture was a biography about ¨Camarón¨ (2005) .",

      "name": "Johnny Knoxville has lost his mind",
      "reviewBody": "Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.\n\nIn the first Jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme Candid Camera  but in Jackass: Number Two he&apos;s really off his rocker.\n\nBeginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull, or later when he rides a rocket (a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O  notorious party animals  were the daring ones, but you know it&apos;s pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.\n\nThis is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one-up each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in Jackass 2 Steve-O nearly loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as aforementioned) is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly I can&apos;t imagine any stunt out-performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that&apos;s incredible footage. It&apos;s almost unbelievable, and I wondered whether it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually kind of frightening.) And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.\n\nUnfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take beer up the butt (yes, honestly), gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended  who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It&apos;s not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it&apos;s a matter of saying, &quot;Is this even entertaining or funny?&quot; Many times, sadly, it really isn&apos;t.\n\nBut for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people&apos;s faces, there are some brilliant hidden-camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze (&quot;Adaptation&quot;) dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That&apos;s classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an R-rating. It&apos;s a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.\n\nStill, there&apos;s enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing, and it&apos;s really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.",

The scenes, and David Carradine morphing into Woody Guthrie, took whatever time was needed to ripen into the enriching story of inherent human value, undeniable personal dignity, and the insidious soul-starving quality of greed that this masterpiece movie tells.\n\nRonny Cox, Melinda Dillon, Gail Strickland, Randy Quaid, and David Carradine all delivered academy award worthy performances. No saints, no heroes, no cavalry to the rescue; just actors tenderly disappearing into heart capturing characters who are disturbingly vulnerable, familiar, ordinary, and profound.",

So Norman freaks out and leaves. Maureen tries to kill herself in the bathtub while a new killer in the black dress and grey wig wants to kill her, so Norman runs to her aid. He brings her to the hospital. Later on, Norman lets her stay at the motel. And later on girls at the motel start to get killed. Who is it? Has Norman returned to insanity?

Yet the review to this movie I just read completely bashed it and said it has no scares in it.  I&apos;ve been watching horror for MOST of my 20 years, and this movie gave me the creeps.  Then again, I DID deliberately wait until 11 at night to watch it in the dark, so that added to the atmosphere.  But it&apos;s not without it&apos;s horrific charm.  Maybe it isn&apos;t a great Children of the Corn movie -- God knows the Second one stinks in comparison to the first, and the fourth one is pretty good.  Yet this movie still stands a chance at good reviews if you don&apos;t compare it."

Unfolding in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity. A chance encounter with this film on one of DirecTV&apos;s many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems. There is no glitter or &quot;bling&quot; in this movie, just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this telling.\n\nJLH",

The people in this film are lost, both in the social space of a world they cannot live in and in time.  They lack most of the usual human equipment, like faith and hope (see Thomas McGuane&apos;s &apos;Panama&apos;).  But they blunder on, as much by default as by will, in the illusory world of Bronco Billy&apos;s road show and guided by Billy&apos;s real values, with each other.  Like most of Eastwood&apos;s films, Bronco Billy is built around a story, but in this story how it comes out is not important, it is how Billy and this cast of lost souls get there. And the film has one the greatest lines in cinema history:  The one Bronco Billy used to tell Antoinette what happened to his wife."

      "reviewBody": "There may have once been a grain of truth in the original Merimeé novel, but it has been turned into an icon beyond recognition as much as La Dame Aux Camelias has. Vivian Romance camps it up playing &quot;gitaine&quot; for all it&apos;s worth. She plays it like grand opera, probably the director&apos;s immediate frame of reference. When one thinks of the Rom one thinks of oppressed people, and it is perfectly consistent to see a young woman from an oppressed group as a sexpot--- that&apos;s their value. It is no accident that the story has been redone with former slaves (Carmen Jones) and by Senegal, although in that case, while still oppressed and clandestine, she is more in command than some of the others. Two of the best Carmens are by Sara Montiel and Imperio Argentina, although there is no question that we are watching a bourgeois stereotype regarding what the directors consider a &quot;lower class.&quot; Romance&apos;s Carmen is worth seeing for comparison."

      "reviewBody": "Too bad this neglected horror film got lost in the wake of the similarly themed Rosemany&apos;s Baby. Modestly successful journalist Alan Alda suddenly becomes a successful concert pianist following a chance meeting with piano virtuoso Duncan Ely (Curt Jergens) and his darkly seductive daughter, Roxanne (Barbara Parkins). His growing involvement with the wealthy family and their strange friends eventually comes between Alda and his loving wife, Paula (Jackie Bissett). As sinister events unravel, Paula is drawn deeper into a web of diabolic happenings until the threads come together in a surprising and oddly gratifying climax.\n\nThe script is tight and well-thought out, with the exception of Dillman&apos;s role as Roxanne&apos;s ex-husband. After all, if the diabolists are so sexually compelling, how could he divorce her. And though director Paul Wendkos occasionally goes overboard with the camera tricks, the scenes are stylishly done, especially the banquet with its snatches of pretentious banter, and the New Years party with its erotic grotesqueries bound to end in an orgy. And underneath it all lies an undercurrent of evil, even during the brightest splashes of sunlight.\n\nThough Alda gets star billing, it&apos;s actually Bissett&apos;s movie, which she carries off in finely shaded fashion. Her scenes with the ominously silent Roxanne (just count Parkins&apos; few lines) amount to an exquisite model of civilized contempt, minus the fisticuffs. Alda too, shines, as he acts out Ely&apos;s imperious manner at just the right moments, proving in those pre-MASH days that he was more than the humorously caustic Hawkeye Pierce.\n\nAs good as the movie is, I can&apos;t help wondering if it might have been even better had the mystery not been exposed as early as it is. Suppose the script had skipped the transference ritual and simply had Alda take on Ely&apos;s characteristics without explanation, such that the audience would have to ponder what&apos;s going on, instead of having it handed to them. There may have been good reasons for not taking this mystery route, but at least it&apos;s worth considering.\n\nStill and all, Waltz remains a fine example of movie horror done in both color and sunny surroundings, and with a lot of style and conviction. Too bad, it&apos;s slipped into movieland&apos;s version of yester-year oblivion. It deserves better. And, if nothing else, the script raises the scary question of whether dogs really are man&apos;s (woman&apos;s) best friend."

      "reviewBody": "The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost&apos;s silver screen release. Spielberg&apos;s movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.\n\nHowever, Ghost accomplished of what &quot;Always&quot; tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others&apos; feelings, and that taught us: &quot;Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts&quot;. On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam&apos;s ghost drew upon Oda Mae&apos;s body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. \n\nI was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam&apos;s ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae&apos;s body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I&apos;m talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: &quot;I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don&apos;t need to be alive to recall this&quot; Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in &apos;90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam&apos;s ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.\n\nTo watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you&apos;re on a date.",

Before watching the film, I didn&apos;t know that much about Joe Meek and his legacy and this was an eye-opener. The filmmakers have done a fantastic job in conjuring up Joe&apos;s talent and controversial personality through their interviews with artists, colleagues and family members. The film is incredibly informative and entertaining and it tackles topics such as Joe&apos;s homosexuality and thunderous character in an honest and open way. Its editing style and use of music are very creative but never divert your attention from Joe and his work. What becomes absolutely clear in the film is the fact that Joe&apos;s life interest didn&apos;t lie in making money but in making the music that was so obviously part of his deeper inner being. Joe succeeded in creating a new sound world through hard work and perseverance and although his life was short his legacy has proved to be long-lasting. This is a great film and a must-see!"

      "reviewBody": "Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length Technicolor film. I can&apos;t say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip). At any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. In fact, just how good it looks is amazing.\n\nKudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski, Director Of Photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and, for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. All of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.\n\nI thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. It gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. I can&apos;t say more without spoiling things.\n\nMarlene Dietrich never looked better, I don&apos;t believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character (&quot;Domini Enfilden&quot;). Heart-throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini&apos;s object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as &quot;Batouch;&quot; John Carradine as &quot;The Sand Diviner;&quot; The most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer &quot;Irena,&quot; played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there is a face and a dance you won&apos;t soon forget! I&apos;ve never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I&apos;ve viewed. Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. Looking at her IMDb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.\n\nBasil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing &quot;Sherlock Holmes,&quot; also is in here as is C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, &quot;The Shop Around The Corner,&quot; with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.\n\nThe beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly&apos;s dance, are the things I&apos;ll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one. Had the last half hour been better - although I admire the ending - I would have rated it even higher. It&apos;s definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at a free screening in Denver last night. From the opening sequence, you know you&apos;re in Aaron Sorkin territory. His rapid-fire dialogue and the &quot;that was then, this is now&quot; editing is a little disorienting at first, but you get used to it. When Mark Zuckerberg breaks up with his girlfriend, you have a pretty good idea of everything going on in his mind. And yet, the film portrays him in a sympathetic light. Everyone was laughing at the hilarious put downs and one-liners. The best one, at least in my opinion, is a reference to the original &quot;Karate Kid.&quot; All the actors are OK, but this is Jesse Eisenberg&apos;s movie. He convinces you of all the insecurities and doubts percolating in his character. While his reasoning is usually explained with a gesture or a snide remark, his confrontation with the Winklevoss twins&apos; lawyer lays out his true motives for being the way he is. Rashida Jones&apos; character although minor is pivotal since she explains to Zuckerberg where he went wrong. There are some brief digressions like Saverin&apos;s girlfriend problems which contribute to the 116-minute running time(sans credits.) It&apos;s a little too long, and David Fincher seems confident enough in the material not to indulge in any of his usual tricks. I&apos;d say the film is a mix of &quot;Juno&quot; with &quot;Greenberg&quot; without the self-conscious dialogue of the first, or the nastiness of the second."

      "reviewBody": "Chu Chin Chow was a well-known stage musical that started during the First World War years and lasted through the twenties and the thirties. Then mention of it suddenly stopped and was heard of no more. Of the songs used in the musical, only the Shoemaker&apos;s Song was catchy enough to survive outside the musical, and was covered by all kinds of musicians from trad jazz bands to Paul Robeson.\n\nAs others have said, the musical is set in Baghdad and is a variant of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. The costumes are exaggerated, with grotesque turbans and fezzes.\n\nWhat is unusual for a British film is that the background music is almost non-stop. Often the background music has nothing to do with what is happening in the scene, and is thus more like Muzak in a supermarket or an elevator. This was sometimes done in early thirties films by First National/Warner Brothers. This is the first time I have encountered this in a British film. \n\nThe orchestration is adventurous and the higher pitches feature unusual instruments. These include domras that tremolo in the string section, and - soloing in the woodwind - are a sopranino recorder, and even an ocarina, to accentuate clownishness. As big jars, each containing a thief, are rolled into a pit, we hear the timpani making a thunderous noise - inappropriate due to the size of the jars, but unbelievably effective.\n\nWith one exception, the singers are not very good. The exception is the Australian basso profondo, Malcolm McEacharn, who is billed as &quot;Jetsam,&quot; because he was a member of the Flotsam and Jetsam duo. An exceptionally rich and powerful voice that can reach down, down, down to depths that a basso cantate like myself can only dream about. \n\nI have never seen anything quite like this in a British film of the period.",

      "reviewBody": "The importance of this film cannot be overstated.  1 - It gave us JAMES EDWARDS, thus ending Hollywood&apos;s Heroic-Black-Man Prohibition.    Without Mr. Edwards there would be no Sidney Poitier, no Denzel.  2 -  This film, hot on the heels of President Truman&apos;s Executive Order integrating America&apos;s segregated military, examines the possible pressures of this new policy on both the races - without demeaning either.  3 - Until this time Hollywood had managed to fight two world wars on screen without any major assistance from America&apos;s Black population except as domestics.  4 - The existence of HOME OF THE BRAVE put pressure on subsequent films (which only a scant few bowed to)to present a more accurate racial and ethnic portrayal of America&apos;s fighting forces.  So (with the exception of SAHARA) every Black man in a Hollywood war film owes thanks to Mr. Edwards.\n\nThe irony is Mr. Edwards&apos; last film, PATTON, has him portraying a valet. The insult is that Patton&apos;s most important victory - The Battle of The Bulge - was facilitated in great part by the contribution of The Big Red One - a battalion of Black truck drivers - who risked all to keep Patton&apos;s front supplied until the weather cleared enough to allow cargo flights.  This historic fact (the race of the drivers in this segregated unit) is ignored in the film leaving Mr. Edwards with the only Black speaking part in a sweeping biography about a WWII general - isn&apos;t this where we came in?\n\nIf you examine Mr. Edward&apos;s filmography (by which I mean screen the films) it is difficult to understand the spottiness of his career and his relative obscurity.  Part of the explanation may lie in the murky machinations of HUAC, McCarthyism, the Hollywood Blacklist and Mr. Edwards&apos; worldwide tour with this film (it included a stop in the then Soviet Union).  If you have any information regarding this aspect of his life please post it here.\n\nCeOTIS"

All his scenes (particularly the fly in the mess hall) are cringe-worthy in their silliness!\n\nAll the fun is somewhat spoiled by the (historically accurate) sight of foreign invaders murdering US soldiers. These scenes would have been better off if they had been whitewashed as they undermine Savalas&apos; &quot;lovable rogue&quot; performance, though it probably played better in those early-seventies days of &quot;radical chic&quot; than it does now.\n\nOverall, the film is so fast-paced that you never slow down long enough to realize how dumb it is until the ending credits roll and Telly starts singing to you!",

      "name": "Man-Hating Feminist Propaganda",
      "reviewBody": "This so-called documentary was anything but objective. It was produced by a feminist with an axe to grind. It took a predetermined negative stance towards pornography and had a clearly one-sided, unilateral, anti-porn agenda. It only showed the hardest, roughest forms of sex and avoided showing the much more prevalent sex-is-fun films. It tried to claim the women were being &quot;degraded&quot; and portray them as victims, while failing to mention that everything that occurs to women in porn also occurs to men. Men must &quot;cum on command&quot;, they are &quot;objectified&quot; too,and there are numerous porn films where men are portrayed as inferiors. (slave-films, femdom, domination, etc.) In fact, one of the porn actresses in this film (who enjoyed her work) was so angered over the edited and skewed manipulation that the director had used to make her appear as a &quot;victim&quot; who was against porn, that she later went on to become a filmmaker herself in protest. This film was obviously a hack-job that didn&apos;t even accurately portray its subjects and intentionally tried to artificially portray them as victims of the porn industry. Obviously, this was nothing more than a feminazi propaganda film.\n\nErotic and sexual images have been viewed by people since ancient times. Such images have been found in every ancient culture in the world and were commonplace and acceptable in ancient Rome, Babylon, Egypt, and India. It is absurd to think pornography is somehow new or &quot;harmful to women&quot;. LOL Only the media has changed. Attempts by man-hating feminists to outlaw pornography are nothing more than misguided misandry. Feminists want to outlaw pornography as a method of oppressing men and taking away men&apos;s freedom. They don&apos;t want men to be able to masturbate and satisfy themselves sexually, but want women to have a monopoly on sex and use it to control men. That&apos;s the REAL reason why man-hating feminists seek to outlaw it. There is no legitimate, objective evidence whatsoever that porn leads to &quot;violence against women&quot; or is harmful to women in any way. Its just an attempt to take away men&apos;s freedoms and oppress men. Outlawing porn also takes away women&apos;s freedoms too. In fact, cultures where porn is illegal (like Iran) are cultures where women have the least rights, and cultures where porn and prostitution are legal (like Denmark/Sweden) are where women have the most rights. If anything, the empirical evidence shows a positive correlation between pornography in a culture and women&apos;s status. In a society that really respects women, women would be free to do what they want with their OWN bodies. If a woman wants to strip, perform in porn, or perform sexual acts then that is HER choice and should be respected. She doesn&apos;t need some dumb feminist trying to take away her right to choose by outlawing porn. I thought it was &quot;Our bodies, our choice&quot; (the famous feminist slogan regarding abortion). If that&apos;s the case, then why do feminazis insist on interfering with other women&apos;s rights to do what they want with THEIR bodies? Each woman should be allowed to choose to either do porn, or not. Feminazis try to take away that choice by attempting to outlaw porn and prostitution. Feminists are the REAL oppressors of women!Each woman should have the right to choose to do what she wants with her body.\n\nCommissions were formed in the 80&apos;s by the Reagan administration to try to form links between porn and social harm to provide a &quot;justification&quot; for outlawing porn, but even these commissions had to concede that no harm whatsoever can be shown. The Supreme Court in the USA and Canada both made several modern rulings on pornography and came to the conclusion that pornography should be available to those consenting adults that choose to view it. Those who don&apos;t like it don&apos;t have to watch it. The feminazi&apos;s lost their war, thankfully. Now we can view porn easily through mainstream media such as pay-per-view and the Internet. Hooray for men&apos;s rights!! The feminazi&apos;s failed to oppress us; even with inflammatory one-sided propaganda films such as this! \n\nI give it 5/10. Zero for intellectual content (since most of this was misinformation and politically-biased feminazi propaganda), but 5 stars for the good skin and explicit sex shown.",

      "reviewBody": "A tale of warring townships and two strong characters who cant help but being pawns in a horrible game of carnage. Set in rural Japan in feudal times the setting is beautiful.\n\nToo bad the camera works don&apos;t quite follow up. The scope is 70mm (or close to it), but I could settle with less if the cameraman (I suspect they didn&apos;t have one) didn&apos;t cut off the heads all the time. The use of zoom-lens sometimes works and sometimes don&apos;t. One time zooming in on Tane-san for instance was very dramatic. Intense was also the battle scenes. Very good.\n\nZatoichi is a good character and the actor playing him is fitting. The story is good and makes for an intriguing film despite some flaws. In all respects I think its inferior to Sanjuro though.\n\nThis is my first Zatoichi and I will check out other entries in the series for sure (at least the Kitano &quot;Zatoichi&quot; from 2003 is easy to get hold on).",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969&apos;s &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960&apos;s when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film&apos;s cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee&apos;s &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;.\n\nThe meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.\n\nIn his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe&apos;s paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from &quot;The Graduate&quot; and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger&apos;s film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character&apos;s fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner.\n\nThe two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, &quot;After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later&quot;, which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight&apos;s screen test; &quot;Controversy and Acclaim&quot;, which examines the genesis of the movie&apos;s initial &apos;X&apos; rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, &quot;Celebrating Schlesinger&quot;.",

If you want to know what jazz performers are like, you will learn more from this one hour film than all the hours of Ken Burns&apos; documentary put together. It makes Burns&apos; film insignificant by comparison. Jazz performers shine in this work because Jean Bach is such a skillful interviewer. You can tell the musicians all like her, and since they are always shown talking to the camera, not to her, it comes across as if they all like you, too, the viewer. The film makes you feel very privileged. I own this film and I watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Who could get tired of hanging out for an hour with Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Bud Freeman, Art Farmer, etc. and listening to the excellent narration of Quicy Jones?",

I don&apos;t know if that was a real movie or not, but I suspect it very well might have been, and this film was done in that same hokey style. It wasn&apos;t meant to be high art, and it&apos;s not, but, while I wouldn&apos;t tell anyone they just had to see it, I found it more entertaining than I was expecting, and think it accomplished what it set out to.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are looking for a very entertaining western, it&apos;s hard to top this one. It&apos;s fairly long at 134 minutes, but the deep cast and always-interesting story make the time fly by.\n\nThe first half of the film is about as good as it gets but two climactic scenes at the end get a little too carried away with the &quot;Rambo&quot; mentality of good guys not getting shot when they should have, etc. But, overall, it&apos;s so good it is still very highly-recommended. Among the &quot;lists&quot; you see on this website&apos;s message boards and elsewhere, you rarely see this movie mentioned among top westerns and that is a huge oversight.\n\nThere are four main &quot;good guys&quot; that are played by well-known actors: Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. I especially liked Kline as &quot;Paden&quot; with his gentlemanly manner about him and Glenn&apos;s voice always makes him interesting. Costner is so young looking he almost looks like a teenager.\n\nBrian Dennehy, as the villainous &quot;Sheriff Cobb,&quot; is verbally restrained in here, which was nice to hear, for a change but he&apos;s still intense and fascinating. (This movie marked the 10,000th time Hollywood made a lawman the villain since the 1960s).\n\nThe story is fun, a straight cowboy movie with no romances or gratuitous sex scenes thrown in and has the usual beautiful western scenery and photography. The only problem was the sound. The soundtrack is so loud so have to crank up your center speaker to hear the dialog over the music.",

      "reviewBody": "A fine film that is mainly forgotten but still worth seeing, it deals with a homeless boy in Victorian London (1876) who rubs shoulders with two of the leading figures of the time - Queen Victoria and Benjamin Disraeli.\n\nA heart-warming story of historical fiction, directed by Jean Negulesco, it displays the formidable acting talent of Irene Dunne and Alex Guinness. Disreali&apos;s audience with the Queen at the start draws us into the main themes of the movie. Andrew Ray, as the boy, is exceptional. The great character actor Finlay Currie plays the role of the Queen&apos;s friend John Brown, a crusty, boozy Scot and a close companion of the Queen, who takes a personal interest in the boy. (The character of John Brown was also the subject of the movie from the 1990&apos;s - Mrs. Brown, played by Dame Judi Dench.)\n\nThe role of the mudlark-a child who scavenges on the banks of the Thames is played by Andrew Ray. It was while doing this,that he found a cameo of the Queen. Illiterate and poverty-stricken, he knows nothing about the Queen but when he finds out who she is, he wants to meet her. The discovery of the child during a banquet at Windsor Castle becomes a national story, in which the Prime Minister (Alex Guinness as Disraeli) uses the issue to underscore the need for social reform and to thus win support for his government&apos;s program. The speech in the House of Commons is a high point in the movie, as is the widowed Queen&apos;s encounter with the boy near the end of the film.\n\nColourful conversations between Alex Guinness (Disraeli) and Findlay Currie (John Brown) add sparkle to the film as does a well-lubricated Brown as he takes the boy on a tour of the castle.\n\nAt the end, Disraeli and Brown, totally different in character, are drawn together by their love of the monarch. The widowed monarch, at first alarmed by the boy&apos;s stealing into her private residence, is moved by a second encounter when she learns that he merely wanted to see her. This also suited the Prime Minister&apos;s purpose of giving the monarch confidence to come out of seclusion.",

The plotline also resembles some adventure movies from 90s.\n\nIf your&apos;re reading here to decide, just go for it.

Of course th villains are starting a big hunt through the streets of Berlin, and the mail man on wheels has to climb on wheels, escape through the subway and show his artistic abilities on every different street to stay alive. While on the run, he&apos;s trying to find out the mystery of this conspiracy.\n\nThough it&apos;s just a prime time TV action movie with a standard plot and with no big stars in it, it has a big impact. The scenes on the run are thrilling and sometimes really breath-taking, with an over 20-minute-long car/roller blades chase sequence in the middle of the film that appears like a mixture of the &quot;Bullitt&quot; car chase, &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Lola rennt&quot;.\n\nThe main actor of the film, Turk Erdogan Atalay, is well-known to German TV audiences as star of the car action series &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11&quot;. Supporting roles are played by former mystery crime show moderator Guntbert Warns as police detective, beautiful actress Bojana Golenac, soap opera star Arne Elholz (&quot;Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten&quot;) and b-movie veteran Rolf Zacher (the last both being murdered just in the beginning of the story).",

      "reviewBody": "Although she might admit to it now, but not back in her salad days, one of the reasons that Olivia DeHavilland&apos;s films are so well remembered from her days at Warner Brothers was the sheer expense of them. She did do her share of sound stage shooting, but as often as not Warner Brothers would cast her as the heroine in their expensive period costume dramas. She certainly did them well, though she wanted better parts. Even films like Anthony Adverse and Gone With The Wind added to her reputation. But these films and Captain Blood, Dodge City, The Private Lives Of Elizabeth And Essex and The Adventures Of Robin Hood are what we remember of her early period and one of the reasons she&apos;s better known than a lot of her contemporaries today.\n\nOne that was less known and I suspect because she did not have Errol Flynn as her leading man is Gold Is Where You Find It. This is a western feud story set in 1879 in California thirty years after the Gold Rush. It&apos;s not hard rock Fortyniners panning for gold out of the stream any more. Huge mining concerns are using hydraulics to create mudslides that are ruining the crops of landowners large and small. The biggest of these is Claude Rains whose grain crops like everyone else&apos;s is threatened by the mine owned by Sidney Toler whose foreman is Barton MacLane. \n\nInto the lives of all of them comes mining engineer George Brent from the east and he makes an impression on all, on MacLane&apos;s skull and on the lives of Rains&apos;s children Olivia DeHavilland and Tim Holt. He gets caught right in the middle of the feud coming to a boil. Do we doubt where he&apos;s going to end up?\n\nMichael Curtiz directed Gold Is Where You Find It with the usual Curtiz supply of action. There&apos;s a climax involving a battle between the miners and the farmers that&apos;s exciting and well done. The costumes and sets reflect a good eye for the period. In fact Curtiz probably decided all this needed was Errol Flynn and he got him next year for Dodge City.\n\nThough she hated making the costume epics, these films have survived and part of the reason they have survived is Olivia DeHavilland is so darn good in them. Sadly this film is not out so one has to wait until TCM broadcasts it. It&apos;s worth the wait.",

While I am a fan of this series this movie is probably the worst of the lot that I have seen up to this point.This is even worse than The Indian Scarf(see my review of that one).This should have been titled &quot;Curse Of The Boring Movie&quot;.\n\nThe plot deals with a fanatical cult of Chinese bent on world domination.They believe that a yellow snake charm has the &quot;power&quot; to give the possessor the ability to win any fight they start according to Chinese legend.Of course the intrepid white folks are shaking in their boots at the thought of world peace being threatened. But the cult looks like it only had about 100 members so there are some heavy logistics to work out on the ability to wreck world peace.\n\nThe usual stable of German actors are in this film. As usual the comic relief is played by Eddie Arent and you wish he would have gotten a dagger in the back.The comic touches in this series are heavy handed and irritating.The hero isn&apos;t really a guy you would like.In fact I didn&apos;t care about any of the characters.\n\nThere is a nice use of fog and dank atmosphere.But it doesn&apos;t help much. The source material may have been weak for this one. Either way, skip this cursed movie.",

      "reviewBody": "How I love to watch history-telling like this! What talent in both writing and film making it is! This is both epic and important.\n\nThis is the story about the amazing world famous Kon-Tiki trip crossing the pacific on a balsa-raft just to prove this happened in ancient times, made by the makers of great Max Manus.\n\nThe trip, taken on the basis of an idea of the explorer Thor Heyerdahl, was completely ludicrous and no one believed it could be done. and how could a trip like this be told better than by Heyerdahl himself in the documentary made during the trip.\n\nBack in 1947 this was just the story the world wanted to be told after the 2nd world war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The documentary film from the trip later won Oscar (1951), and the book was translated into 70 languages, and sold more than 50 million copies world wide.\n\nFinally we get to see the trip dramatized as it should be. And the result is really an amazing and epic film which holds two hours of explorer-ism, excitement and awe. I think we really get to imagine how it was to be 6 persons floating on an uncontrollable raft in the middle of nowhere for more than hundred days. The bore, the awe of discoveries, the fear of weather, sharks and whales. The psychological toll, the friendship...\n\nIt&apos;s a great story and a great film which will make new generations pick up the book with the same name, before they watch the original documentary. Beautifully filmed, well played, even down to Heyerdahl incredibly bad English pronunciation. Not all is accurate. There&apos;s been a debate around the premiere about making Herman Watzinger such a wimpy character, when we actually was a Norwegain 100 m record holder and a strong guy with good looks, but the writers found the story needed heart, and not only bald and crazy feeling-less young men. I agree. Over 100 days on a raft is at least 90 days of boredom.\n\nThor Heyerdahl himself made this trip to prove his idea, which no one would believe, and later got famous. He made the trip though he was not only not able to swim, but actually afraid of water, can you imagine! And it also tells the story of those left behind, wife and kids.\n\nThis is the most expensive Norwegian film production ever, and the story is a Norwegian sacred explorers story, as good as they come, changing world history. Thankfully the film floats as good as the raft, and is well wort ha watch. Great manuscript, beautifully filmed, good handcraft.\n\nThe film comes in both a Norwegian and an international (English) spoken version, which gives the movie a possibility to be shown all over the world. And it will. Treat yourself to an insane, but epic trip, and get to be an explorer yourself. This is great storytelling! It loses one of 10 stars due to the irritating (though factual) English pronunciation of Heryerdahl. Not necessary to re-experience that to make a good story.",

However, I found myself enjoying this movie.  The characters are likable and have good reason to cross the line to cheat on the SAT.  I especially enjoy Erika Christenson (who I didn&apos;t recognize from her work in Traffic and Swimfam) as the girl who needs a high SAT score to get into Brown University.  This movie shows the pressure that high school students have on standardized testing in general.  Their grades may be good, but without a good score on this one test makes the difference in what college they can get into.  I was not a fan of standardized tests in high school and I do not like them now.  I think that dislike of these tests adds to the appeal the movie.  I give this movie a 6/10.  It is worth 90 minutes of your time.",

      "reviewBody": "There are so many reasons Black Orpheus is important to cinema. First, how many people know that prior to Marcel Camus making this film the late Orson Welles attempted to capture Rio Carnival but with no story, plot, or script? In 1942, Welles discovered voodoo was at the root of the carnival samba, and started filming in the favelas, the slum shanty towns on the hills of Rio...it was considered by Hollywood to be anti-establishment and dangerous by Brazilian authorities. Thus, Welles was not able to complete his film.\n\nSamba is a Portuguese form of music, the word was derived from the West African bantu word &quot;semba&quot;, meaning &quot;invoke the spirit of the ancestors&quot;. Long outlawed as a dangerous expression of black slave culture, samba music eventually gained legitimacy and became a big part of carnival.\n\nNearly 20 years later Black Orpheus achieves what Welles was trying for and goes beyond it. To start Marcel Camus had a script to work from whereas Welles was trying to wing it on the spot. Camus successfully recreated the Orpheus-Eurydice myth using the Rio Carnival as the back drop. The main characters retain the mythological names, including the symbolic Death. This works because it is Afro-Latin culture where pagan-Christian names were more evident and because the Carnival itself was such an important part of the story. History manifests as a deja vu, a cyclical progression of event and re-incarnation, understood only by the occultic transformation of samba, trance and possession, for which the Carnival is the engine.\n\nTo those who misunderstand or are ignorant of samba, voodoo, or the Rio Carnival Black Orpheus may seem overwhelming, especially because of all the singing and dancing but samba (and Carnival) is ritual, in its most elementary form it is a raw cacophony of primitive drumming, clapping, chanting... and the droning cries of the dancers who stagger on the edge of the &quot;stage&quot;, seeking possession and reincarnation.\n\nBlack Orpheus won the Palm d&apos;Or in 1959 at Cannes. It was seen as progressive because it featured black actors and the pluralist culture of modern Brazil. It also gives outsiders a view inside of a ritualistic, non-Western culture and that is why it was and is so important to cinema.",

I wasn&apos;t sure of what the movie was about so I was definitely caught off guard with the whole plot. It sort of starts out like a love story, then next thing you know the guns come flying. Its different from any other movie I&apos;ve seen with realistic outcomes and life situations. At times I wasn&apos;t sure if I was on the good guy&apos;s or bad guy&apos;s side because in a way, the main character deserved some of what he got. And I also understood why the bad guys chose their targets without remorse. If I wasn&apos;t given a background of the main character, I don&apos;t think i would&apos;ve felt bad for him. Anyway, its a good movie and I&apos;d definitely recommend checking it out.",

However, the film becomes more and more exciting as the story goes on. At least it became for me. I was satisfied with the acting too. The three main characters had memorable scenes. Of course the battle scenes could have been mare spectacular, they cannot challenge those of the huge budget Hollywood pictures. (Also the amount of money spent on the making of the movie cannot be compared to the Hollywood movies&apos; with or without government support.) I am happy that this film was made.

Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t connect to the IMDb to check on this before we went to the video store, these sharks (and their lousy producers and cast) chew away $4.00 from me. As it happens very often in a bad movie case, I found myself making fun of the movie and wondering how in the world there are not authorities to prevent these disasters from even getting to innocent hands like ours. My poor daughter was hoping for a &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, and she got the &quot;Deep Goo Sh**&quot;.\n\nThe people commenting here about this movie are so right about the spoofs they found out, that I wont repeat them. But it chocked me mysteriously that when the female star decided to go &quot;to help&quot; the poor people that were actually being eaten by the sharks outside, the producer magically omitted the at least half and hour or more that takes to change into a diving suit. Who she thought she was? Superman, that changes inside a phone booth in an instant??? Oh wait...there are no phone booths undersea!...Oh well.\n\nIf you are in a bank account suicidal drill or just love Animal Planet (and I&apos;m not referring only to the sharks), don&apos;t let us commenters stop you...go ahead and rent it... Don&apos;t say we didn&apos;t warn you.",

      "reviewBody": "One of Broadway&apos;s most brilliant songwriters, Cole Porter (1891-1964) worked hard to present an unflappable image to the world--but in truth he was a tremendously complex man, a homosexual who lived with wife Linda Lee Thomas in a marriage of convenience, subject fits of depression, and suffering horrific pain in the wake of a horseback riding accident which left him crippled at the peak of his career. Add to this the fact that his lyrics were often censored for film, radio, and records and it seems very odd that 1940s Hollywood would attempt a biography. What they did, of course, was fictionalize it to the max, reducing the story of his life to a mix of backstage musical and domestic drama--and transforming the tiny and waspish Porter and his icy bride Linda into handsome Cary Grant and lovely Alexis Smith. The result is pure nonsense, of course, but when you tack in a host of Porter classics--fantasy it might be, but it is entertaining enough to watch.\n\nGrant is no singer, but he has considerable charm, and Smith is as always extremely attractive. The supporting cast is remarkably strong, featuring the likes of Jane Wyman, Eve Arden, Dorothy Malone, and Alan Hale--and rare screen appearances by Monty Woolley and Mary Martin, who deliver knockout performances of &quot;Miss Otis Regrets&quot; and &quot;My Heart Belongs To Daddy&quot; respectively. The DVD transfer is reasonable, and although the bonuses are pure fluff they are amusing. While it may be short on fact with a story little more than pure melodrama, the music and performers make NIGHT AND DAY a reasonably pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon.\n\nGary F.

      "reviewBody": "Only a few of the other comments mention the dialogue of this movie, which I think is superb! The verbal sparring between Marietta and Captain Warrington is a delightful contrast to their soul-mated singing and elevates this film above other musicals of the era. One always suspends disbelief when viewing any film, of any era (come on, you don&apos;t think modern films are really &quot;real&quot;, do you?), and it may be difficult for some to enter into the mindset of a &apos;30s moviegoer, but with not too much effort even those who say they don&apos;t like this type of film, or these actors, or whatever, can find something to enjoy in this film. (Just call it a fantasy, without special effects.) Some of the opening scenes are almost embarrassingly silly, but quite soon the movie hits its stride and the music, humor, and sweep of the story carry you along. As an untrained actor in his first real role (singing cameos don&apos;t count), Nelson Eddy does quite well, thank you; I am inclined to think that the oft-repeated comment about his &quot;wooden&quot; acting style may owe more to L. B. Mayer&apos;s jealousy (remember what he did to John Gilbert?) than to a true assessment of his skill (which, admittedly, did improve over time). Mayer wanted MacDonald for himself and the obvious attraction between Eddy and MacDonald, coupled with her stinging rebuffs of Mayer&apos;s advances, made him no good friend of &quot;the baritone&quot;. (Bear in mind, too, that Eddy was not interested in being an actor; he used film to advance his concert career.) I think this is a grand film, almost my favorite of the duos&apos; work. &quot;Maytime&quot; has an edge because I had the good fortune to see it on the big screen when it was re-released in 1962, and I&apos;ve only seen the others on television. The music in &quot;New Moon&quot; is glorious, and Nelson and Jeanette seem to be having such fun together in &quot;Sweethearts&quot;.... All I can say is, if you have the opportunity to see MacDonald/Eddy films on the big screen at a film festival or revival theatre, don&apos;t pass it by!"

      "reviewBody": "When this movie was first released, I was living in Memphis, Tennessee, not exactly the most cine-literate city in the world, and it was only showing at one theatre in town- luckily, it was right next door to where I worked. I decided to see the late show one night after work, and was so totally blown away that I saw it every night for the next four days, in one case even getting off work early to catch it. As the first directorial outing for Kenneth Branagh, it must surely rank among the most impressive directorial debuts in history. I don&apos;t feel that I&apos;d be overstating my point to say that not since Orson Welles&apos; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was a directorial debut so impressive. From Derek Jacobi&apos;s brilliant opening soliloquy as The Chorus to the climactic battle sequence and the following sequence of King Henry&apos;s surveying of the carnage on the battlefield, this is a film that never lags, owing to Branagh&apos;s willingness to excise certain sequences that don&apos;t translate well to film- a move that Olivier was unwilling to make for his production of Henry V back in the 40&apos;s. This film totally altered the way I thought of Shakespeare- I went from looking at a Shakespearean work as being full of literary merit, but of dubious entertainment value. However, after this film, and followed soon after by &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Mel Gibson and &quot;Prospero&apos;s Books&quot; with Sir John Gielgud, I came to realize the full entertainment value of Shakespearean story, long before the recent Shakespeare explosion brought on by the Romeo and Juliet music video with Leonardo DeCaprio.",

Denzel Washington does a great job of portraying a jazzman&apos;s quest for perfection, while living in a &quot;real world&quot; full of problems.  Being a musician myself, I appreciated the struggle Washington&apos;s character was going through.  All of Spike Lee&apos;s trademark camera angles (which I&apos;ve disliked in some of his movies) worked to perfection in this movie.  Great music, good acting, and a solid plot. Recommend!",

Concurrent with its U. S. theatrical release, pic is available on video cassette under the slightly different title &quot;Formula for a Murder&quot; from Lightning Video.\n\nSet in Boston, where most of the film was shot, pic falls loosely into the &quot;Gaslight&quot; genre, as Craig (British thesp David Warbek, dubbed with an American accent) trains paraplegic Joanna (Christina Nagy) for special athletics events to be held in New York City. They fall in love and plan to marry, which makes Joanna&apos;s lovely live-in companion Ruth (Carroll Blumenberg) very jealous.\n\nCarried by fine acting by Christina Nagy, pic drags a bit halfway through as Warbeck procrastinates while Blumenberg urges him to kill Nagy, but it picks up again with okay twists. Tech credits are okay and, except for the post-synchronized dialog, pic adequately passes for a U. S.-style production."

It&apos;s François Villon&apos;s poem &quot;ballade des dames du temps jadis&quot; who spawned the legend of&quot; this man thrown into the Seine in a bag.&quot;All these characters are featured in the film.\n\nThere were already nudities in Gance&apos;s work,which was risqué at the time ;in 1968 it was more common ,but the plot involved an incestuous relationship (consummated in the movie) .\n\nThe first part was certainly influenced by Gance ,but the second one turns melodramatic ,confused,the queen changing her mind every five minutes ; the king seems to be out of a card game ,and the giant chess game out of &quot;Alive in wonderland&quot; ;the cinematography is nice and shots of the tower are particularly successful ; the director already showed a fondness for soft eroticism which he would carry on in the seventies.",

      "reviewBody": "The difference between adolescence and adulthood can be defined in terms of years or age, but when it comes right down to it, the only real difference is in the experiences the added years provide.  As we mature, we are at some point confronted with the realization-- some sooner, some later-- that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives, the two things we are all, though perhaps subconsciously, striving to attain.  But it&apos;s an elusive butterfly we&apos;re chasing; and at a certain age, the lack of fulfillment in one&apos;s life may be dismissed out-of-hand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes.  Attaching such a label to it, however, is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood, and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality.  This, of course, is not a unique situation, but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in, which is something we all have to deal with in our own way, in our own time.  And it&apos;s an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee&apos;s pensive, insightful drama, `The Ice Storm,&apos; in which we discover that-- more often than not-- the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent; we may shed the skin of youth, but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains, albeit manifested in different ways, to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience, creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness, leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul.\n\n\tWorking from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus (who also wrote Lee&apos;s `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&apos; and `Eat Drink Man Woman,&apos; among others), Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic-- though somewhat dark-- film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early 70s:  Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and their children, Paul (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy (Christina Ricci); and Jim and Janey Carver (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver) and their children, Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd).  And it&apos;s a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal, individual level, as it reflects an issue common to us all-- that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in.  Ben and Elena have grown apart; she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben, and unfulfilled, she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth, while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman.  Jim, who spends much of his time on the road, has become completely disconnected from his entire family; his children are apathetic to his very presence, and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness, yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.  \n\n\tThe Hood and Carver children, meanwhile, are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live, exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all.  And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that&apos;s giving them Nixon and Watergate, new age spiritualism and self-absorbed parents who teach one thing and do another? \n\n \tThe story unfolds through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Paul, whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film.  And it&apos;s through Paul&apos;s observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor, in which he captures the beauty, as well as the ugliness, that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood&apos;s and Carver&apos;s world, which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it&apos;s inevitable climax.  It&apos;s sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience, and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly, with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama.\n\n\tLee also knows how to get the best out of his actors, and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film, beginning with that of Kevin Kline.  Kline does comedy well, but he does drama even better, as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben.  The final scene of the film, in fact, belongs to Kline, as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts.  It&apos;s a superb piece of acting, and one of the real strengths of the film.\n\n\tJoan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena&apos;s life, and especially her relationship with Ben.  And it&apos;s in Allen&apos;s character, more than any of the others, that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent.  It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter; but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother, which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film.  It&apos;s a performance that should&apos;ve earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.\n\n\tAlso turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire, Ricci, Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan, whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best-- it&apos;s believable, and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive, `The Ice Storm&apos; is remarkably poignant and absorbing; without question, it&apos;s one of Lee&apos;s finest films.  10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Zishe is a Jew living in Poland and working with his family as a blacksmith. When a fight breaks out in a local restaurant, Zishe uses his impressive strength to fend off his attackers but finds himself facing a bill for the damage. To make the money to cover the cost, Zishe enters a local circus to challenge the resident strongman. Easily winning, he draws the attention of a talent scout who offers him the chance for more work in Germany. Despite the reservations of his parents, Zishe travels to Berlin where he joins the high-class show of mystic Hanussen. Playing to mostly film stars and members of the ascending Nazi party, Zishe plays the role of an Aryan strongman. Initially happy to do so, the deception and denial of self gradually eats at him as he performs on stage.\n\nI may not be the most cine-literate person in the world but I know enough to give any film from Werner Herzog a try to see what happens. With this film I was interested from the very start as it throws up an interesting &quot;true&quot; story that I had never heard before. It opens well but it only manages to hang together until the middle of the film, at which point the direction of the story starts to badly waver and, with a mostly amateur cast and some clunky dialogue, it cannot do anything to really turn it around. After a while it does become dull and rather aimless which was a shame given the potential that it showed early on. The problems of narrative will probably worry Herzog&apos;s fans less than the casual viewer though but what will surprise them is how visually ordinary it all is. It all looks good and has some nice use of locations but generally it lacks imagination or the flair for the unusual, with only the out-of-place use of the crabs sticking in the mind as an image.\n\nThe cast are mixed, with some good performances and some terrible ones. Ahola falls somewhere in the middle; he is not the most expressive man in the world but he has a good presence and his gentle strongman performance works for the majority  it is only in the latter stages where more is asked of him where he comes up wanting. Roth is impressive of course and he does add a much needed professionalism into the film when given the chance. The rest of the cast are mostly average at best  not a major problem but few people will defend the bland and flat deliveries of people like Gourari and Wein  both of whom come over as if they would struggle to read a traffic sign in a convincing manner.\n\nOverall this is an OK film at best  starting with potential but fading away long before the end. The performances are mostly average but what is more surprising is that Herzog doesn&apos;t really make the film his own  some of it looks interesting but it lacks the visual style that I had hoped for and it doesn&apos;t offer a great deal in its place."

Plus whenever the characters move, it looks like the speed has been turned down half a notch.\n\nThat said, the film itself is a low budget affair (which is a typical feature of Jean Rollin&apos;s films) about two female vampires who are blind during the day, but can see at night.  They have lived throughout eternity, being killed off occasionally through the ages, only to be resurrected later.  By what, this is never explained.\n\nNo where near as good as Rollin&apos;s THE GRAPES OF DEATH or his later film FASCINATION, but there are worse such as the schlock Jess Franco puts out. The film goes on about 20 minutes too long with a lot of pointless talk about how mankind just doesn&apos;t understand them and that they have to kill in order to keep existing in the neverworld that they are condemned to live in.\n\nAll this talk just bores the hell out of me.  3 out of 10",

This character is so obnoxious that it is difficult to keep watching the movie, though introverted viewers may empathize with his obsessive hypersensitivity and social maladjustment. But as the plot progresses we see that he isn&apos;t that much crazier than the rest of society, just more sincere about it. This movie succeeds in immersing you in the time and place, and the acting is on point, particularly the ladies who are captivating despite not really being knockouts.",

To enjoy this film more than some have been doing you&apos;ll have to know what situation the people are in. The movie is based on the Icelandic lives at that time. I think it&apos;s a great movie but not the best Icelandic movie i&apos;ve seen.\n\nIf I would see some film that is identical to this one from another country with another culture I would not enjoy it as much. For example if there were a movie about someone in Britain and I would not know the situation the people would be in I wouldn&apos;t understand the story in the film.\n\nI recommend to everybody who can read the book to read it before or after you see this film. In the book you can see the storyline much better and you&apos;ll know why this is a really good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Imagine a film with three major stars put together with a good script and some fine action and what do you get: The Wild Geese. With the unlikely combination of Richard Burton, Richard Harris &amp; Roger Moore plus a well-written script coupled with spectacular action sequences this is a rip-roaring action / adventure and a top-notch film.\n\nThe three main leads are the main attraction of this film. It&apos;s hard to believe that actors of the caliber of Burton, Harris and Moore would either have chemistry or even be in the same film together. But put the three of them together as mercenaries and you get a truly explosive combination of three terrific actors. None of them fail in their roles and they actually share quite a bit of chemistry between them especially in the final scene between Burton and Harris.\n\nThe rest of the cast is not a let down either. Harvey Kruger does well in his role as the mercenary Pieter Coetze as do Kenneth Griffith, John Kani and Jack Watson among the other members of the Wild Geese. Frank Finlay, Winston Ntshona and Stewart Granger all make welcomed appearances in the film in their supporting roles.\n\nThe film&apos;s script is a well-written action film with political overtones. While the politics of the film are dated now, the message for the times is still evident in the film. Outside of the political overtones the dialouge of the film is well-written and in some scenes is even touching especially in the final scene.\n\nThe action in the film is another highlight. The air drop into Africa, various raids by the Wild Geese and the final battle at the airstrip complement the story and never overwhelm the story and plot. Thanks to some good editing by editor John Glen (who had edited three Bond films and would go on to direct five more Bond films)the action is never dull and keeps the pace constant.\n\nWith a top-notch leading cast, a good supporting cast, a good script and spectacular action sequences, The Wild Geese is one of the better action films you can see. Despite being somewhat dated the film still packs quite a punch and could easily go up against any recent action film. A must see for action film fans.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember something that Roger Ebert said in an interview with Martin Scorcese. Ebert said that &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was a great movie. People would protest that they didn&apos;t want to see it because they didn&apos;t want to see a film about boxers. No, Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather, it&apos;s how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So, no, I&apos;m not a man; I&apos;m not divorced. But &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. \n\n&quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; of course, is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend, sports writer Oscar Madison, who is himself a divorcée. Oscar lives in an eight-room Manhattan apartment, which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat; Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.\n\nBut the movie is a revelation. The script reveals surprising depth about love, hate, and human relationships. The Walter-Matthau-Jack-Lemmon team is like a well-oiled machine – they seem to have perfected their shtick together through several lifetimes. \n\nJack Lemmon plays the entire movie completely straight. He gives the exact same kind of performance as he did when he was acting in &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; a hyper serious film about alcoholism. When Lemmon, as Felix, is upset about his meatloaf burning, he shows as much agony as he showed in the previous film about a drunk ruining his own life. It&apos;s hysterically funny to watch this poor schmuck wrestle with his petty obsessions and compulsions, oblivious to how he affects others. Even as you laugh at him, you realize he can&apos;t help himself. Felix Unger has Asperger&apos;s. \n\nWhat has changed in America, and American film, that this film from 1968 feels like a time capsule from a lost moment in America? Oscar lives in a spacious, eight-room Manhattan apartment. Manhattan real estate has become more expensive, of course. But it&apos;s more than that. \n\nThe words that kept going through my head as I was watching the movie were &quot;grown-up&quot; and &quot;intelligent.&quot; \n\nOscar, Felix, and their poker buddies are six white guys. They meet and play poker. There are no scenes where these adult, white men are revealed to be inept in comparison to women, blacks, or homosexuals. There are no scenes where the sassy gay man instructs the straight men on how to dress or create romance. There are no scenes where the &quot;magical negro&quot; shows the men that they can&apos;t dance. There are no scenes where a woman puts the men down for not knowing how to take care of children or shows the men up as being blinded by lust. There are no scenes where these straight, white men are made to apologize for being straight, white men. \n\nThe men are grownups. They have jobs. They wear adult clothing. They wear white shirts and ties, slacks, belts, and shiny shoes. Oscar does wear a backwards baseball cap, but he is the clown of the group. And he does not wear it throughout the film. When he goes out, he dresses properly. \n\nThey speak of their marriages as if marriage were something important. They speak of their children as if they love them. \n\nThey go on dates. They ask women out, dress up for the occasion, and make witty banter with subtle double entendres. \n\nWhile watching &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; I thought of recent Judd Apatow comedies starring men like Jason Segel, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. These current male stars all play children; they all play losers. They play failed men. The humor in these films is built around what pathetic creatures they are. In &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&quot; Jason Segel, who is fat and prematurely saggy, is shown fully naked. The nakedness highlights his humiliation when his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, dumps him. These films all use the F word over and over in a manner that feels desperate and limited. \n\nThere is one very sly, very funny reference to the f word in &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; Oscar complains to Felix Unger that he is tired of getting little notes from Felix like &quot;We are all out of cornflakes. Signed, FU.&quot; Oscar says it took him hours to figure out what &quot;FU&quot; meant. A funny joke. Delivered deliciously. The only time &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; has to refer to the F word to get a laugh. \n\nI&apos;ve never felt, while watching a Judd Apatow comedy, that I was gaining any insight into the human condition. There are so many payoff moments of absurd comedy in &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; as when Oscar steps on a vacuum cleaner cord and then takes his foot off the cord at just the right moment to send Felix reeling. But there were so many moments that made me say, &quot;Gosh, yes, that&apos;s what human relationships are like. That&apos;s what it&apos;s like to love/hate another human being.&quot;\n\nI can&apos;t imagine a film like &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; being made today. A genuinely funny, intelligent, rich, grownup comedy about men that shines light on the human condition and that need never speak the F word to get a laugh. And I can&apos;t imagine anyone other than a Trump being able to afford that eight-room apartment in Manhattan.",

I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes and I was very much amused by the book, O Xangô de Baker Street, written by Jô Soares, whom I am always pleased to hear and see on TV. I laughed a lot when I read the book. It&apos;s quite good. I also liked the film, but I must admit I prefer the book, though I always think it is silly to compare literature with cinema, because they are two different art forms. The one thing I can say is that I laughed more reading the book than I did watching the movie. I think the timing in the picture is not very good. The director/ editor almost always interrupted the joke with a cut. But still the film has lots of jokes and it is very funny. The image is beautiful as well as the sets, costumes and so on.\n\nThe actors are superb - all of them. Joaquim de Almeida and Maria de Medeiros are especially good in it. Another one I liked a lot was the one who played the murderer. When I read the book that was almost exactly as I pictured the murderer to be. Anyway I recommend the film to every one and give it 7 out of 10.",

Not that the plot has holes, it just starts to get rather far-fetched. Too many twists, some just for twists&apos; sake.\n\nEnding feels contrived and a tad too neat.\n\nHowever, still an interesting movie.\n\nGood performance from Jude Law and Rooney Mara in the main roles. Catherine Zeta-Jones just doesn&apos;t feel right in her role, however. She&apos;s maybe too intense, or too one-dimensional. \n\nChanning Tatum is okay in his role.",

Uses a trivial storyline (a young boy&apos;s relationship to his much older brother who has left their southern Italian village to find fame and fortune in the north of Italy) as a pretext to surreally stitch together 75 minutes of random, totally unrelated newsreels all shot in Italy in 1960. Difficult to believe how many historic events happened in one year - the making of Fellini&apos;s La Dolce Vita, the shooting down of the U2 plane as it spied on the Soviet Union, the Rome Olympics, the election of JFK, etc.\n\nWatch it if only for the unrepeatable stylishness of a sunglasses-wearing Livio Berruti in B/W winning the 200m sprint final at the Rome Olympics, one of the defining mythical images of early post-war Italy (film buffs, read &quot;A Roman Holiday&quot;, &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, &quot;8 1/2&quot;, &quot;Umberto D&quot;, etc).\n\nAnd don&apos;t be put off by not knowing Italian, if it doesn&apos;t have subtitles.

I hope the U.S. rating of &quot;R&quot; can be changed or it will prevent young people from seeing it or could stop some theaters from screening it. It definitely should be seen by everyone, but especially teenagers. \n\nThe fact that it centers around the victims and the survivors of the tragedy and not the mind or motives of the perpetrator, makes it even more engrossing.

As he gets involved in pulling off some robberies for his &quot;research&quot;, he finds himself feeling a &quot;heady intoxication like champagne&quot;. He tries to get out of the criminal life but his antagonist, Bogie of course, won&apos;t let him. As in many films, it&apos;s now Bogart vs Robinson. Who wins? Nice try, just watch and enjoy the movie and you&apos;ll see. This was before Bogie was a headliner and it&apos;s fun to see how he was developing his on screen persona. If you&apos;re a Bogie and Eddie G. fan, you&apos;ll like this one. It&apos;s definitely worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "I knew the music to this film for many years before I finally saw the film itself. I had discovered the hypnotic soundtrack by Rheingold on a second-hand LP and have had it on heavy rotation for many years. It&apos;s one of the best albums I know.\n\nThe music is certainly one of boons which helped to put this movie into another class and make it a classic. Hypnotically slowly, it follows the development of a teenybopping waif&apos;s obsession with a pop star spiraling out of control. It&apos;s one of those movies which you kind of have to see in a cinema because on TV you&apos;d zap away after 10 minutes. But it richly rewards your for its slower moments.\n\nApparently there was a lot of controversy around lead actress Désirée Nosbusch&apos;s nudity scenes, which are admittedly surprisingly crass. But they are not exploitative and absolutely gel in with the movie. Kind of ironic that immediately after this scene there is one of extreme violence which went practically unnoticed by the public. A nice society we&apos;re living in.\n\nIt&apos;s very respectable that the director fought to keep these scenes in, as they are essential to the escalation of the story. They are actually a good example of how those scenes should be done realistically but without becoming pornographic or voyeuristic. It&apos;s a big fat shame that this controversy tainted the reception and popularity of this great movie.\n\nAnd by the way, other than is often stated, the affair between star and fan doesn&apos;t end with the star &quot;dropping&quot; her after a night of carnality. It&apos;s not a case of &quot;find&apos;um, furp&apos;um and flee&quot;. R. merely returns to his reality whereas Simone stays locked in her fantasy world.\n\nSome tidbits about this movie: R. is actually played by the singer of the band Rheingold, Bodo Staiger, which furnished the soundtrack. The actress playing the fan, Désirée Nosbusch, was at the time already a popular &quot;VJane&quot; (i. e. hostess of a music show like the one that is shown in the movie). And the host of the TV show which Simone watches with her parents at the beginning of the movie is played by Joachim &quot;Blacky&quot; Fuchsberger, who in real life was the most popular TV host in Germany at the time.",

      "reviewBody": "Tim Burton is a brilliant visual director but with Edward Scissorhands he managed to combine these talents with pure, classic storytelling  Scissorhands is his best overall film, abandoning the slight characterizations and special effects-driven spectacle of the (albeit hugely enjoyable) Batman and serving up a convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance.\n\nThe story is fairly basic, being the standard Frankenstein-esque tale of alienation and the empowerment of love. Edward (Johnny Depp) is a lonely man with scissors for hands, crafted by an eccentric inventor (magnificently played by Vincent Price in flashbacks) prior to his death. After Edward witnesses the death of his creator he stays locked away inside his mansion all day, which is located atop the otherwise cheerfully picture-perfect local neighborhood community.\n\nThen one day a nosy neighbor decides to investigate, and ends up bringing Edward to reality. He falls in love with a local girl (Winona Ryder), and is witness first-hand to the joys of life, until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town. Soon everyone is out to get him for no good reason  the climax is beautifully done and, because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much, it&apos;s also very touching.\n\nThe movie is decidedly odd but in a good way  the only problem is that it is occasionally quite thin when it comes to actual depth. Burton&apos;s never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical, exciting fables (see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example). Even Burton&apos;s Big Fish  arguably his most story-oriented film of his career  was somewhat shady. The mix of screwball dark comedy, horror, drama, romance and elements and familiar happenings of other genres results in a very different combination. You can literally &quot;feel&quot; the vibe of this picture, its heart pulsing black blood.\n\nThe movie was a childhood project of Burton, who drew sketches of Edward as a boy and used to alienate himself from his hostile surroundings by taking refuge in fictional stories involving the scissor-handed hero. As a result Burton&apos;s true affinity for the subject is evident  it&apos;s clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.\n\nThe acting is marvelous  Depp&apos;s performance is one of his finest and, arguably, one of the most convincing and fun of all-time. Depp has formed a Scorsese/De Niro-like companionship with Burton over the years, teaming up for various pictures (including Sleepy Hollow and the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). He&apos;s always had fun relishing his over-the-top and absurdly dark roles, such as Ichabod Crane in particular. In Scissorhands he gives the equivalent of a Travis Bickle  a man who feels shunned by society, only to open his heart and have it feel crushed again. This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day. The tale does not grow old because the values are timeless.\n\nEdward Scissorhands, despite its occasional flaws, finally gave Burton the chance to unleash his talents as a visual filmmaker along with a pretty solid story mold  the result being a sublimely dark rom-com-drama that never conforms to the typical genre clichés and becomes quite a unique film in its own little world.\n\n4.5/5",

      "reviewBody": "Buddhadeb Dasgupta&apos;s CHARACHAR is based on a story by Prafulla Roy. The film deals with the life of a bird-catcher Lokha played by Rajat Kapur. The film is an exploration of existence caught between &apos;reality and a dream.&apos; The bird catcher&apos;s wife Sari (Laboni Sarkar) leaves him for another man Natobor (Sankar Chakraborty) when his love for birds became overpowering. The growing affinity for the feathered kind was fuelled by the sensitivity with which his dead son cared for them when he was alive. He gradually detaches himself from the &apos;reality&apos; of modern existence and eventually merges himself at one with his &apos;dream&apos; – becomes exactly like a bird without any worries of the world.\n\nBhusan Kaka ( Sadhu Meher ), a fellow bird catcher and his daughter Gauri ( Indrani Halder ) attempts to provide some comfort in his tumultous existence. Disenchanted with the way people became rich in his trade Lokha resolved that henceforth he would put a full stop to all of his bird catching activities. He says optimistically that the jungle would be able to provide sufficient food for his needs. The director makes recurring use of dream sequences and this film, more than any of his other works, have a poetical quality in the treatment. Apart from the thematic novelty, a genre hitherto unexplored by serious Indian filmmakers even though we have had such wonderful films like &apos;Born Free&apos; and &apos;Hatari&apos; made in the West aeon&apos;s ago, the film effectively captures the agony of a man caught in the wrong profession. The film soars above the standards set by most Indian filmmakers and highlights the distinctiveness of Dasgupta as a filmmaker. Succinctly, the film is an essay of possibly a dream that the director cherishes and not a hard- hitting statement about the ground reality facing a bird catcher&apos;s life. The ending sequence has a dream like quality about it. Embellished by strong performances from the entire cast the film is shot beautifully adding to its strength. Memorable stuff.",

      "reviewBody": "How does one choose a film to view? Often it is the subject matter - here the fraught relationship between landscape architect Will and both his partner of 10 years Liv (who has an autistic daughter) and his new lover Amira (who has a thieving son). Sometimes it is star - in the case, Jude Law who has to choose between his American partner who has an obsessive approach to parenthood (Robin Wright Penn) and his Bosnian refugee girlfriend who works as a seamstress (Juliette Binoche). Other times it is the director - on this occasion, Anthony Minghella who writes as well as directs as he returns to the north London milieu in which he located &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot;.\n\nAll of these are reasonable reasons for wanting to see &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot;, but I confess that it was the supporting French actress Juliette Binoche that drew me to the work. I&apos;ve been in love with her ever since her first English-language appearance in &quot;The Unbearable Lightness Of Being&quot; in 1988. She is simply beautiful in a bewitching manner, while always convincing as an actress, especially in vulnerable roles.\n\nThis is a multi-layered work in which the title can be taken in three ways: the obvious sense with the robberies perpetrated by Amira&apos;s son Miro; the deeper sense with Will&apos;s emotional assault on Amira; and still another sense as the middle-class Will and his like invade the traditionally working-class area of Kings Cross.\n\nThose who need car chases or special effects in their movie experiences should avoid Mighella&apos;s parable, but those who value thoughtful and nuanced works will find much to admire here."

Max is a chased city slicker that finds out he&apos;s got a terminal form of cancer and that wants to make the best out of the little time that remains him. Together they make the two lead characters in a film that is more or less a modern fairy tale about two people that run into each other on accident and that change each others lives in all possible ways and more.\n\nAs the film starts and gets through the necessary bits that introduce the characters it doesn&apos;t take long before it turns into a mild comedy. After this initial part it doesn&apos;t allow itself to sit back and relax and simply continues at a fairly high pace and as it rolls on it is impossible to NOT love the characters.\n\nOn me that was visible as a smile that was etched on my face from the word go. It started as a small one and became wider and wider as the film went on, even though there also was a tear and a gleam of sadness added to it. So, all in all, it&apos;s the perfect feel-good film.\n\n9 out of 10 loving pig farmers",

      "reviewBody": "I saw Diary of a Wimpy Kid (DOAWK) at a Cineplex large screen (full-price), with 2 grand-daughters, one of whom has read the books (I haven&apos;t). I concur with others that the film starts out promising, but tends to bog down in the middle. The main character becomes a little mean-spirited, and the fun begins to fade somewhat. I gather that the books contain a certain cynical tone for the main character, and that the humour plays off that. When you transfer to a screenplay, you have to get the &apos;voice&apos; right, or else the gags don&apos;t work.\n\nI might compare it to describing a Seinfeld plot to a bewildered foreigner: &quot;you see, George takes a disabled parking spot at the mall, causing a girl in a wheelchair to have an accident, so George and Kramer buy her a replacement wheelchair that has defective brakes, and she goes screaming down a hill..&quot; sounds mean, huh? it&apos;s not -- it&apos;s hilarious WHEN you see it in context. Maybe that&apos;s what happens in DOAWK -- incorporating several ideas from the books resulted in some &apos;losing the context&apos;, so to speak.\n\nHowever, family films are few and far between these days, and this is passable family fun. My advice? if you have a matinée-priced theater, go see it. At full price? stay home and watch your &apos;Better off Dead&apos; DVD on your big screen TV.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of A Christmas Story and was unaware that Bob Clarke had filmed more of Jean Shepherds work until I listened to the commentary track on the Christmas Story DVD. I had read peoples comments here and been a little concerned by its 5/10 score. I still wanted to see it for myself so I picked up a copy on VHS for £1.00. With all our VCRs now replaced with DVD players we only have one VCR in the house so I didnt get to watch this til after midnight one Sunday night. Whilst not brilliant and no where near as good as Christmas Story (but I guess thats because this isnt about Christmas!) I found this film to be a very delightful piece of light-hearted entertainment. Yes the choice of actors dont seem to be as memorable  but thats probably because Ive watched Christmas Story hundreds of times.  Dont expect any huge moments, but this is a perfect lazy day nostalgic movie. The adults will probably enjoy it more than the kids though.",

She is both fond of money, clean underwear, and using the expression &quot;crackers&quot;.\n\nCameron Mitchell is the second member of the group, who is nearly dealt out of the game by the third (Ivor Salter).  Mistrustful, but still bound by the money, the group takes to the sea to make their getaway, trailed by an opportunistic hotel manger (Aldo Carmada).  Stopping at an island, they encounter a strange group in residency there.  Greed and madness lead to murder.  And the money becomes a ridiculous fashion accessory.\n\nNot a great deal of depth, to this B movie, but OK for some late evening intrigue and suspense."

      "reviewBody": "A look at a fascinating family, headed by a hardcore noncomformist - Dorian Paskowitz, a washed-up doctor, surfer, adventurer, and oddball who, along with his wife, created one of the weirdest families ever. The Paskowitz clan (2 parents and 9 kids!) travelled around the USA in the 1960s and 70s, surfing, just barely scraping by, not going to school, and having legendary adventures. Eventually they kind of settled down and opened a surfing school. This vivaciously edited documentary shows both the good and the bad, the joys but also the pains of growing up in a brilliant, loony environment. As cool as the surfing and endless summers must have been, many of the boys (and they were mostly boys - only 1 daughter in this litter) ended up at loose ends, butting heads with each other and with the world.",

      "reviewBody": "In a post-apocalyptic future humanity war against an army of cyber virus infected hybrid man-machines created by X-Corp.\n\nDirector Kevin King offers a low-budget exploitation flick which appeals especially those who enjoy women wielding weapons and ripped men without tops.\n\nTo King&apos;s credit many of the gore and special effects are pretty good. Rocky Myers and Eve Mauro are notable. Danny Trejo is his usually staple self in the short amount of screen time.\n\nCyborg X combines existing themes and tropes from sci-fi film history and pop culture. If it was 1992 this would have been a sure fire straight to video hit, the problem is that the Cyborg, Terminator and Mad Max cash-in has been worn tire thin.\n\nKing &apos;s creative eye is evident and he manages to pull together a consistent film for the budget with the help of Myers performance.\n\nOverall, don&apos;t expect Terminator or even Cyborg, think slicker Nemesis or APEX or more recently Battle of the Damned and you won&apos;t be disappointed."
